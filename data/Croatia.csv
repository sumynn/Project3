Croatia,LindyWestmorland,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"After visiting Dubrovnik for many years and not walking the walls because of the heat and huge numbers of tourists in Summer, we went early in the morning in October. No crowds, no excessive heat, just relaxing walking and beautiful views of the Old Town, surrounding area and the sea. Awesome looking down on the roofs, alleys, and architecture. A drink stop overlooking Lokrum halfway round. Every view a photographer’s dream. It is expensive and I believe next year will be more so but as a once in a lifetime visit it is hard to beat.

Croatia,Louise M,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We walked the walls of Dubrovnik on our own and it was awesome! The weather was a pleasant low seventies and it wasn't too crowded--mid October was perfect. We took around two hours to walk the perimeter and visit some museums that were included on our Dubrovnik card. The views of the Adriatic were glorious and the peek into the backyards with the laundry hanging on the line enhanced the experience. Most of the homes within the walls have been converted to vacation rentals, but it was clear that some are still residential. The uneven stone walkways will give your ankles a workout!

Croatia,SROVirginia,Walls of Dubrovnik,2.0,"The views can be pretty, but the walls are reminiscent of a Disney creation, as is most of Dubrovnik. After spending a week there, I felt that the entire city could be skipped. It's a tourist-trap on a major scale, with egregiously inflated prices -- especially for food and drinks. The walls apparently survived the 1667 earthquake (which destroyed nearly every building inside the walls) and numerous military attacks, and are an impressive 6 meters thick in some places, but they have been restored to an extent that makes them look new (nicely squared stones), hence artificial. There are walls (and castles) in other countries that have been standing since the 13th century, with less restoration, so more historical appeal. If you do walk the walls, go early, before you find yourself in an ant-like line of tourists -- and take water with you.

Croatia,Russ Lacuata,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Do not Miss the monumental walls that encircle Dubrovnik. Undoubtedly the city's most unique and famous feature. There's no place like it on earth. Towers overlooking the sea, glittering Adriatic Sea on one side and red clay roofs of the Old Town on the other. You can easily explore the walls on your own. I recommend first thing in the morning or late afternoon.

Pro Tip:

Buy Dubrovnik Card and will save you money.

Bring water , wear comfortable shoes, a hat and a sunscreen.

Croatia,88UK,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"This was our first visit to Dubrovnik so of course the walls were top of our list. I felt tickets were a little expensive but I imagine the upkeep is tremendous and it has to be funded somehow. The experience was worth it, some fantastic views and if you are a GoT fan like us then it’s a must.

Although there are quite a lot of steps, I think people of most abilities would be able to manage it if they took their time. If you are scared of heights or less able then it would be a good idea to avoid busy periods as some sections are a bit narrow and the sides seem quite low so could be scary navigating if there were a lot of people around.

There are several refreshment points where you can get a coffee, juice, beer, ice cream etc and they have toilets. It looked like there was a toilet for anyone to use at the bar on the sea section of the wall.

An absolute must do, we were lucky that it was quiet in October so we were able to take it all in and get a load of pictures without having to wait for others to get their shots first!

Wear good shoes and a hat, bring water. It wasn't too physically challenging overall, but there are some steps involved in portions that some guests may choose to skip. It took us about 2 hours, and by 10am the sun was noticeably stronger than when we started. I've also heard the sunset views are exceptional if you choose to go towards the end of the day.

Can get very hot during the summer we visited in August and very little shaded spots so would recommend early morning or evening time.
If you are staying for a few days I would recommend a Dubrovnik card as this includes free entry to the walls so almost covers the cards fee.
Just a tip avoid stalls selling jewelry on the walls I fell into a tourist trap of buying a bracelet for €25 I later saw the exact same bracelet in several shops for €13.

Croatia,Emma W,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Do not miss this. We went early in the morning to try to avoid the worst of the heat- not entirely successful there, but that's August in Dubrovnik. The walls are utterly spectacular, with the best views of the old town and the sea. It is no surprise they have never been breached. With entry you can visit a number of fortresses along the walls, and another fortress just outside on a clifftop (Lovrijenac). Entry is also included with the Dubrovnik Card, which in itself is a worthwhile investment. We went at the end of our trip so greatly enjoyed looking over the places we had visited all week. Walk carefully as many of the stones are rounded and slippery, and be ready for a fairly long and uneven walk- wear sturdy shoes and take snacks and water. There is a stop halfway round for food and drink if needed. Though I have no doubt that a sunset walk would be spectacular, the early morning before the crowds pile in is magical.

Croatia,ian s,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Incredible views and a fantastic experience of years gone by.
Arrived at 9.50 hrs so pretty quiet therefore a very leisurely walk with many photos. Advice if travelling in by car, park at the multi-car park as you enter from the main road and ignore the old town parking as already full and a LONG one way system out of the city which takes you away from it before you can double back.",Sep 2021
Croatia,Stuff Edinburgh,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"The reason I’m giving 4 stars and not 5 is just because it was a bit pricey for what it was - 200 Kuna each when I visited. But of course I was silly and didn’t realise there is a Dubrovnik Card you can purchase that would have made this almost a steal combined with a couple other major sites to visit.

The views from the walls are amazing however and if someone said ‘what’s the one thing I MUST do on a visit to Dubrovnik’, walking the city walls would be it. Well, that and an ice cream from Peppinos. I know that’s two things, but shhhh.

If you like photography, you’ll love the opportunity to take a gazillion different photos of the expanse of red roofs and alleyways below. Toward the end I was beginning to feel a sort of IKEA dread, where you’re stuck in a seemingly endless one way system, but unlike IKEA you can exit the walls at quite a few points if you reach ‘peak wall’. There are also a few refreshment points where you can grab a seat and a drink, which are both very welcome in the heat.

Croatia,HBWillsy,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We didn't mind the expense, the climbing, the walking, the crowds, the uneven pathway, etc...but the heat, my goodness, it almost killed us! Yes, going in late June with temps in the 100s wasn't the best idea, but - when in Croatia, right?

The walk itself is quite the workout - the path is made uneven and slippery in places by the smooth, rounded inlaid stones and the stairs are very steep with a shallow riser height and tread. Almost all of us had flip flops on which made traversing the unique foundation a little complicated - particularly with the heat! My flip flops were much thinner and had far less structural integrity than when I started out. Ultimately, we didn't mind the workout after eating and drinking our way through Croatia, but it was more than we expected or planned for.

If you go in the summer, be prepared. We each had a water, but that was mostly gone halfway around the fortress and we soon realized we'd need to ration our supplies if we were going to make it out alive! I had a small tube of sunscreen in my purse which came in handy, but it wasn't nearly enough and we all ended up getting fried anyway because there is NO shade for most of the walk.

My suggestions are these: Take your time - rest often and pace yourself; Carry a backpack with extra water (even if it's cooler out and you think you won't need it) and sunscreen to reapply; wear a hat; definitely wear shoes with a tread and support; and take CASH as there is a stop at the midway point for a cocktail, frozen treat, or bottle of water. The prices are steep though, so take that into consideration. It's a pricy trip around the castle for an entire family.

***If you have kids - BE CAREFUL! The walls are VERY low and it would be easy for a child to fall right over the side. My son is 17 now, but I know that if I took him on that trail when he was younger, he'd be all about climbing all over the place - it's a fortress for goodness sake, a kid's dream! (I can't imagine any such amusement being open to children in the U.S., but traveling opens your eyes to a lot of things - most of the world gets along just fine without the safety regulations we have in place). I'm not trying to be preachy, just giving advice you can take or leave :- ) To keep the day pleasant and avoid a tragedy, a conversation with little ones about safety should be had in advance. It's important as well to adjust your mindset to be prepared to be on guard the whole time. There are plenty of other fun spots for the kids to pretend play on the ground level).***

Aside from the unexpected distractions and difficulties, the overall excursion was pretty cool. The views are breathtaking and once you get to the side facing the water, the unobstructed panorama of the shimmering Adriatic and distant islands coupled with the cool breeze gives you just enough energy to keep going!

Ultimately, it's a pricey and challenging excursion but we felt it was well worth it - after all, how many times can you say you've successfully circumnavigated fortress walls of the unconquerable Croatia? The Venetians can't!

Croatia,pampogi,Walls of Dubrovnik,2.0,"In my opinion, it is overpriced, and you have to pay extra for the museum. Also, if you are not going with a tourist guide, you won’t know anything about the wall because there’s not a single place where informations are written about it. It was a 1 hr walk. If you go to upper streets outside the old town you will get the same views as you would on the walls.",Jul 2021

Croatia,Frank P,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,I highly recommend walking around the walls of Dubrovnik. I would consider the walls a must do activity in this city. My wife and I walked the walls over a 3 hour period. We took our time and enjoyed the wonderful views. I would recommend going early in the morning or later in the afternoon. It can be very crowed and very hot. The walls are totally worth it. I would walk them again the next time I visit the city.,Jul 2021
Croatia,chamdexor,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Absolute must. Probably takes about 2 hours if you're in a leisurely pace and stop to take pictures. We got tickets online in advance just to make it easy. But KEEP your tickets because you may be asked for them once you get about half way through as you pass the other entrance. I also suggest going early. It gets more and more crowded later on plus it's hotter. We went around 9:00 am.,Jul 2021

Croatia,Beatriz M,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A must see when in Dubrovnik. There are two different entrances in the Old Town. The entrance costs 200 kuna in summer and apparently 50 kuna in winter, I advice to check online for the prices. It is possible to go around the walls in around 1 hour with some quick photo stops. It is really long and goes around all Old Town. Many stairs and climbs at certain points. Amazing views of the Old Town. Recommend to go at around 6 to 6.30 PM in summer since it can be very hot!! At this time the temperature was perfect and the sun was going down. They close at 7.30 PM during summer. There were some small bars around the fortress selling refreshments.

Croatia,Joost G,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The best way to get a full overview of the old city. A full round takes about 1 hour and is well to do for most. Has some slightly steeper sections, yet hardly as steep as regular stairs. Comes at price though - 200 kuna or just over 26 euros per person.",Jun 2021
Croatia,Brittany_11_10,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Walking the city walls is a ""should do"" for any first-time visit to Dubrovnik (or for subsequent visits if you're with new people who haven't done it before). Ticket prices are 200kn for adults (about $30 USD), at least as of May 2021, and I think the walk is worth the price.

Great views of both Old Town and the Adriatic abound as you walk along the walls, ducking in and out of fortresses, climbing numerous steps...

Best to go in the off season, or early in the day before the wall gets crowded.

Croatia,tumbleweedchris,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"If you want all the pictures you see from Dubrovnik, you pretty much have to pay for a walk on the walls. The price is kind of too high for something as simple as this, but you kind of have to do it if you are here. It is quite hot in the walls so it is advisable if you go at the start or end of the day. There are public fountains at the entrance of the north side of the city. You can fill your bottle up here before you go up. There are also various food/drink vendors on top if you need to stop and rest. The admission here will include admission to the fort across the bay. Make sure you see that as well to get the most out of your money.

Probably takes about three hours but far to hot yesterday to do the ‘full round’. Can imagine it being slippery in the rain.

Croatia,Jill S,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"I do this walk every time I visit Dubrovnik because the views and the colours are ever-changing. The different perspective over the sea and down into the folded canyons of this millennia-old city are something that should not be missed. The light and temperatures are friendliest early in the morning or evening- the hours listed pertain to when you can enter the wall, but once you’re up there, they’ll let you stay on the wall until sunset (in July, sunset was an hour after the wall “closed” at 7:30p).

It’s expensive, sure, but this is one of those cases where money does buy 2 hours of happiness in the form of an unforgettable experience. Think of it as a worthy investment into your vacation. Unless you’re there on a super busy day, just buy the tickets at the gate as it’s much cheaper.

Bring water and snacks!! There are some cafes and restaurants where you can buy supplies on the wall but they’re very expensive. There are 3 exit/entry points so you can go down and come back up (to the same gate) if you need a break.

I had a drone with me and took some amazing videos so greatly satisfied :)
Some tips:
- It takes around 2-3 hours to walk all of the city walls so it would be better if you choose a time when it is not that hot as you are definitely sweat out.
- Stay hydrated! you can take water with you, or sit in one of those stops on the walls where you can buy some refreshments.
- Make sure that you are in shape as you are going to climb a lot of stairs.. like really A LOT!

Croatia,espa000,Walls of Dubrovnik,2.0,"STAY AWAY!

After Covid19, everyone in Dubrovnik wants to recover their losses from returning tourists.

Access to the walls used to cost 30 kn, now it is 300 kn. In this weather, not wortn it.

Besides, access to the very few public toilets costs 7 kn in coins only. Trying to find change from kiosks or restaurants becomes a nightmare because they do not seem to have the right change or they want you to become a customer and dish out for their overpriced menus. What shark tactics!

To finish, English-speaking visitors somehow get higher prices or no discounts at all.

Truth be told, the FREE water fountains are a blessing in this weather and icecream is always a treat in the whole region.

You can take quicker and come off at one of the exits along the route. I would highly recommend doing the full circuit. The views are gorgeous.

Croatia,Michael H,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A walk along the old town city wall is of course a must, as it is a great experience with pristine views both towards the old town and external parts as well as the Adriatic sea surrounding this very special UNESCO World Heritage.

The admission fee is very pricey, and for such cost one would at least expect hygiene measures and disinfect spray to be placed at all places where there are narrow steps, so at least visitors dare to hold on to the staircase handrails.

Adult entrance Kuna 200 (Euro 26).

Not ideal for someone with height problems, as some parts along the seaside are a bit narrow with rather low level protection. In such case, best to make half the round, from the ""Ploce"" entrance to the """"Pile"" exit, which of course in such case could be offered to a reduced price (currently not the case).

Still worth doing it.

Croatia,doctorbobster,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"The negative: admission to the wall is about $35. And, it is for a single entry, one time… No leaving and coming back. That said, this gives you access to one of the more remarkably intact medieval city walls in Europe. The wall surrounds the entirety of Dubrovnik and gives you some excellent vantage points of the city and the Adriatic Sea.

The walk can easily take 30–60 minutes so consider your physical condition, your shoes, whether you are appropriately dressed as you will be exposed to whatever the weather is doing and your need for fluids.

Croatia,Michael B,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"The first is from just inside the Pile Gate on the left-hand side next to the Church of Saint Savior, and opposite the large Onophrian’s fountain, it is a steep climb so if you are faint of heart forget it. The ticket office is to the right of the gate.
To get to the second entrance you must pass through the Polce Gate, walk alongside the massive walls of Fort Revelin, immediately after you pass the little Gothic style church of St Luke, turn left through the stone archway and the ticket booth is right there. The walls offer amazing views of the harbour and Saint John’s fort, again not for the faint of heart. There are places to get light refreshment along the walls, but remember your hat sunscreen and water.
The third view of the city walls is more of an adventure and not quite as glamours, but its tourist free for parts and costs nothing. Climb the Jesuit steps to the top, turn left cross the square to right hand side, walk up the narrow ally and follow it as it twists and turns through homes and court yards clinging to the inside of the wall. Eventually you will end up near the top of Fort Bokar, turn right down some very steep steps and arrive at Pile Gate.

TIP: In the Summer months 1000's of cruise ship passengers descend on the old city so go early to avoid them and the heat.

Croatia,LouiseBourne,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"A beautiful way to see Dubrovnik old town in all its beauty, some beautiful sites and excellent photo opportunities.
It takes a couple of hours and is very hot during the day, however there are of places to stop and take a break and also some shady places out of the sun. I would recommend going early morning or evening.
There are water and snack stops throughout the walls however they are expensive.

The only downsides to the experience is the lack of information- no signs explaining any history etc, we had our own pocket guide book which gave us the information on the walls.
The walls are overpriced for what they are especially with no guide books or information. £30 per person- it is cheaper with the Dubrovnik pass as you get entry into museums and other attractions plus discounts in food and shops.

Overall it was a great experience and probably the best part of the old town.

Croatia,Caterpilllar,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"200Kn for adults. 50Kn for under 18's. If you have visited Fort Lovrijenac within the previous 3 days, then show your ticket for that when you purchase your City Walls ticket, and they'll discount the cost of the Fort visit off your ticket.

If it's summer take a bottle of water, you're very exposed to the sun on much of the walls. There are little cafes en route though.

Worth starting at Ploce Gate side as it should be a little quieter - walk through the Ploce gate and 20m down on your left is the city walls entrance.

Look out for the mortar crater in the floor and shrapnel holes on the wall just through the entrance gate... remnant from the 1991-2 siege of Dubrovnik.

The walk from Pile Gate to Ploce Gate less so - it’s a one way system so for your own enjoyment make sure to get in at Ploce before the crowds show up! I visited right after UK announced Croatia quarantine so it was relatively quiet and seeing the city from the walls without a trotting crowd with you makes a big difference.
While the entry fee is expensive, it’ll satisfy most architecture, history and GoT fans. It also includes the nearby fort Lovrijenac (worth a visit for the views). Bring a camera and make it into a photoshoot walk, it honestly is a very photogenic activity to do in Dubrovnik.

It offers some great views, you can probably make some nice instagramable selfies, but other than that I really did not find much value. I was expecting to learn some history, see some weaponry, but it is just the stairs and a couple of caffees. Make sure to carry a lot of water with you, as you will mostly be directly under the sun.
On a positive side, I appreciated the great view on the old town, which you cannot experience when you are observing it from the ground, where you mostly see restaurants and souvenir shops.
Another plus: due to Covid situation there were not cruise ships around, so not too many people on the walls either.

Croatia,Nika Ugarkovic Stimac,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"For somebody who is afraid of heights this wasn’t exactly dream come true, but still an amazing experience.

I’ve been on the City Walls a couple of times (3 to be exact) but the first two times I went there, I was just a little child and was still too short to see behind stone walls that were surrounding the path. Even with that in mind, I enjoyed all three visits to the City Walls that do have a much bigger meaning and history than being just a place where GoT was filmed at.

You have a couple of bars on the Walls that offer cool and refreshing drinks as well as smoothies.

Probably the only bad thing about going to the Walls is the huge line for buying tickets. Most of the people go to the Walls when it’s cloudy and fresh outside so if you want to go the Walls on one of those days, I recommend buying a ticket a day or two before because you don’t need to use it the same day you bought it and because the line in front of Ticket Sale will probably be short. Trust me! You can also buy tickets online.

Here’s my recommendation: buy the 1 day Dubrovnik pass, go to the Lovrijenac Fort first (this involves lots of stairs to get in and out of), you’ll pass the pier used in GOT and other backdrops from the show. When you get to the top show them the Pass then explore. Then walk back down the stairs to continue to the Walls. Everyone will start at Pile Gate, to avoid crowds and get the steepest walk over with, go through the Stradun and enter at the Ploce Gate. Complete the whole thing in about 1.5 hours depending on stops. To save money from the bars along the wall, pre-pack water and other “beverages” in a backpack or purse. Once you’re done, go back to either of the Buža bars and continue to the water, change into your swimsuit and jump into the waters and cool off!

Croatia,Chris W,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"Get there early. The shop that sells the tickets gets phenomenally busy in the afternoon. We waited about 2 mins at 10am, but 2 hours later the queue looked to be about a 45 minute wait.

Plus getting there early ensures it's not too busy on the walls and this makes social distancing more possible. Your photos will be better too.

There are quite a few steps up and down so a cooler time of day helps.

The views are spectacular and worth the entrance fee, but if you get the Dubrovnik Card the walls are included. The card was 350 Kuna fo4 the 7 day card and the walls are 200 Kuna, so if you don't plan to do anything else with your Dubrovnik Card it's best just to pay for the walls.

On an aside, the Dubrovnik Card also gets you 4 trips on the number 10 bus, which goes to Cavtat, as well as getting you more local bus trips and entry to many other attractions.

Back to the walls, there are a few places featured in Game of Thrones if that's your thing. You can get on and off at three different points but most people, us included, use the entry point at the Pila gate. The one-way system means that you do the highest point of the walls near the end and then descend back towards the Pila gate.

I suspect that the walls are a little treacherous in the wet so good footwear would be essential.

It's not really buggy friendly and not at all wheelchair friendly.

So when the staff comes to the last tower is already 19:30-20:00 so you have enough time to enjoy your sunset and view.

The Old Town is known for increased tourist prices but the 2 or 3 little shops on the walls selling drinks and ice-creams charge even more and it can't be justified really.

The entrance fee to the Walls are 200HRK and students and children are 50HRK and the ticket includes the free entrance to Fort Lovrijenac. In my opinion it is worth every Kuna. The scenery is absolutely amazing and we enjoyed every step along the walls. It is definitely a must see whilst in Dubrovnik and the history attached to this area is fascinating.

They are much bigger than we expected and also kind of frightening. In a good way though, for an adrenaline rush. If you are into history, there is a lot to be seen.

The views of the city are spectacular, why I say it’s a must do if you plan to visit the city. Many beautiful moments for photo opts.

It takes 1-2 hours to walk around. We went in February and it was very quiet. so we often had sections of the wall to ourselves and could take lots of great photos. About half way there is a small shop selling drinks and snacks. You can enter from either of two points. We started with a steep climb up, but after that it was fairly easy going, and although i'm not a huge fan of heights it was fine for me

The cost is a bit over £20 per ticket, but the proceeds go to supporting the upkeep of the walls so it seems well worth it for such a fantastic historical place

Croatia,Danielle,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Walking the walls in Dubrovnik is a must do. Tickets can be purchased right at the entrance to Old Town, just inside. There area decent amount of steps during the walk, as well as some inclines. Overall, just take you're time and it's an easy enough walk around the walls. We took a couple of hours to do the entire loop, stopping to take photos and admire the scenery. There is a another point that you can descend back into Old Town. Depending on the direction you head about the walls it's a little over halfway. Be sure to take plenty of water and snacks if you want/need it. There is only one or two places to stop along the way and were typically cash only. There is one small restaurant which was crowded and the prices were pretty high considering it was the only place on the walls. I'd recommend waiting till you're back in Old Town.

Croatia,Nick,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"A great way to spend a few hours. As you progress around the walls the views over the old city and the Adriatic are forever changing. There's a fair few steps to get you up to and onto the wall, and a few along the way, but nothing to onerous. On a sunny, hot day a bottle of water will not last long, so its great that there are plenty of places along the way where you can take a breather and refreshments while sitting and enjoying the views.
If you find yourself caught up in a large tour group let them go ahead, and give yourself space and time to enjoy the experience.
I did not make it all the way round. There are several places where you can come off the wall and re-enter the city.
All in all a memorable walk, and an opportunity to loose weight to perspiration on a hot day...... until the next beer.

There are lots of stair. Some places quite narrow paths and stairways.
In rain the surface is extremely slippery and you can easily fall. There is a toilet and cafe half way around which in summer is very popular but in winter we were the only customers. Take a guide as they have all the knowledge and ours made it a great day.

Croatia,stewthompson,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"A pleasant experience around the walls of the city - you can go with a guide or do your own thing and take as long as you like, I'd recommend doing your own thing and you can stop in a few places for refreshments etc but you will pay the price for buying on the walls.

My top tip is get there early, just before 8:00 am because by midday you will want nothing more than to plung in a cold pool - it gets hot and busy.

The very frequent bus service from the harbour at Gruz is the easiest and best way of getting there - don't drive otherwise you'll sit in traffic for a long time - bus tickets are available from a small kiosk across the road from the ferry stop to the right of the Dubrovnik Travel Centre

Purchase your entrance ticket from just outside Pile gate at the tourist office (opens at 8) ere you can get a ticket to cover you for the walls and other attractions for the same price as just the walls plus there are discounts for certain food establishments and shops etc.

Once you have your ticket you will join a queue, please note the hords of pepole from cruise ships with thier advance tickets will join a different queue - like a fast pass. this is why it is essential to get there early if you wish to avoid the crowds.

We were there in August, peak season for tourism and sunshine. The walk is not too demanding, there are some steps and slopes but it does get hot quite quickly therefore I would suggest you take plenty of water with you and sun protection including a hat, I saw some ill-prepared people struggling with the heat.

There's a number of places for selfie fans to get a pic and some lovely views too though I feel you get the best of the city actually walking through it.

The Walls is one of those trips you do because you're there and you wouldn't to return - only because once you've done it and seen it why would you want to do it again?

Croatia,Ashley P,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"This was our favorite thing we did in dubrovnik. Yes, its a lot of walking and stairs. We went in december when it wasn't busy which was great for pictures and we barely saw any other people! The entire time me and my family kept saying wow look at that, what a pretty picture. The whole thing was so incredibly scenic and it was overall just amazing views and very cool with the game of thrones connection. We followed a walking tour online that was really great where she shows pictures of the game of thrones scene and then the actual picture of the site that you will see when you are there so you know where to find it. Included in your admission you also get to go to the fort which is also very cool and has great views as well! Definately worth the $$. I think you can easily do your own tour and follow directions from people online. It took us about 2+ hours without a tour guide. There is also a washroom about 1/3 of the way in that was free when we were there. We heard other tour guides saying there was no washrooms but there was one along the way as well as a refreshment stand.

Depending on your pace, it can take from as little as 45 minutes to a few hours. Because we stopped several times for pictures, we spent a bit longer than 2 hours out there.
We started our tour at around 9am and it was quite quiet as most of the people started their tour after 10am but then it suddenly got busy as some sections of the walls are quite narrow and you get stuck in the queue every time someone stops for photos.

Croatia,lindasllim,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"In Dubrovnik, also called “Pearl of the Adriatic”, we toured the Old Town and climbed the ancient City Walls. The Old Town is also designated as a UNESCO world heritage site. It was made famous due to the Game of Thrones filming locations, or known as King's Landing. We were told there are organised walking tours for avid GoT fans. Some of the main locations are Pile Gate, Lovrijenac Fort, Fort Bokar, the Gothic Rector's Palace and Ploce Gate.
There's an interesting history behind the walled city. We climbed the surrounding Old Town walls and at the top, we can see the red rooftops of Dubrovnik Old Town, the fort and at some parts of the wall, the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea can be seen. A spectacular and breathtaking sight!
There are cafes at the City Walls and one can take a break, sipping cold drinks and enjoying the views of the sea. There were not many tourists in the late afternoon, so taking photos at various spots uninterrupted were a breeze.
At the Old Town, there are numerous shops and restaurants but prices here are on the high side as it is a tourist destination and a stop for cruise ships.
Do wear proper shoes for walking as there are lots of walking and climbing of steep stairs.

But having come this far you need to do it.It got busy in parts but you can do at your own pace and there are several bars etc;on the way around if you need a rest. I for one will never return to such a place that is totally ruined by overcrowding and rip off merchants.",Oct 2019

It's too bad it's so expensive. Approx. $25 and no going back. Once you're on the wall you have to stay and complete the trip - you can't go back with your ticket, even later that day. The back 1/2 is supposed to be harder, but none of it is difficult if you are in reasonable shape.",Oct 2019
Croatia,Eric C,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"This is a great walk that will give you views of the city that you cannot get from inside or outside the walls at ground level.

I was only told about the closing time right before i enter instead of being informed over the ticket counter. Perhaps, i would hope that the ticket officer could have more ethics in informing me this since from their experience, they know it would require a minimum of 1.5hour to finish the entire loop.

Croatia,GEKristina,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"As we had been told that it could get rather crowded during the day, we went up as soon as they opened and it was a good thing as we managed to find ourselves quite alone in some areas. You should not rush this walk; take your time to stop and enjoy the fantastic views; the old city beneath you where people are very much still living their every day lives, the sea, the sky! If you are a photographer, it is worth brining your best cameras. We had brought lots of water and some breakfast which was really nice, but there are also some really nicely situated bars and cafes along the walk, espceially on the side facing the sea.You can also buy some souvenirs and hand craft, quite nice things (but expensive). You need good shoes and anyone with problems to walk or very young children might not be able to make the full tour as it can be rather tiring, especially in the summer when it is warm. I would love to come back at another time during the year, and stay even longer. Highly recommended!

Croatia,Zimminaroundtheworld,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"I believe the walls around Dubrovnik are the number one attraction. Perhaps because of this, they set the price so high to keep people from walking it? It was like $30 a person, yikes! It took me a day to decide to just get a Dubrovnik card since the walls were included. I am glad I did it though in the end. Like everything else, go early, like right when they open. Toward the end there was a line of people walking the walls. Once I got to the top, you get amazing views of the Sea and Old Town from almost any location along the walls.

Croatia,Anuj_Mithani,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The walls were built between the 12th and 17th centuries for Dubrovnik’s defence, with a total length of ~2km and some sections as high as 82 feet. Numerous forts fortify the Dubrovnik Walls, the most photographed being the Minceta Tower.

Tickets : We bought tickets at the Tourist Office near the Pile Gate, and started at the stairway nearby. The entrance to Lovrijenac fort is included in the price. If you do intend to also visit some museums/other paid attractions, the Dubrovnik Card which includes access to the walls represents good value e.g. the 1 day card bought online (10% off) is only marginally more expensive than the standalone ticket for the walls.

Route : We walked counter-clockwise, eventually returning to the Pile Gate start point. The total walk took around 3 hours, at a very leisurely pace, factoring in lots of photo-opps, rest stops at a bench or toilet breaks. We began around 9am - starting early gets you a head start over the tour groups that start arriving later in the day.

Experience : This is an absolute must-do whilst in Dubrovnik- the views are breathtaking.. from the shimmering blues of the Adriatic, steep cliffs, the terracota red rooftops and aerial vistas of Dubrovnik’s old town, this will be a lifelong memory

This defensive fortification, most of which built during 12th to 17th centuries, protected the City as well as values it represented. Uninterrupted walls of about 2 km, with surviving towers, four ornamented gates, display of old cannons, scintillating views of Old Town, calm and expansive Adriatic coastline, serene islands, all this confirm this site as finest in the World. There is an entrance ticket of 200 Kuna and it's advisable to start the walk during late afternoon so that one can enjoy enchanting views of Sunset as bonus (that I have done).

Croatia,Jeremy P,Walls of Dubrovnik,3.0,"It took me a long time to decide how to write this. Dubrovnik is a beautifully restored city, and you can't help but respect the civic pride and courage that has helped bring it to its current state. The walk round the city walls shows the magnificence of the old town itself, its beautiful position on the Adriatic and the resilience of the fortifications themselves.
But....even in late October by 10am the walk round round the walls was already getting busy. By half past, the organised groups with their schedules were becoming more common , pushing past so that it became increasingly difficult to stop and enjoy the view. You joined the procession or kept being pushed aside. Heavens knows what it's like in August, when the cruise ships are disgorging passengers every hour or so, and the sun is beating down.
I wish I'd come here either in the 1980s or just after the war of Independence. Now there are just too many people,too many for anyone to be able to appreciate what a magnificent city this is. Try to do that and you'll end up with someone's selfie stick in your eye.

Croatia,Sylvia S,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"I bought a 1 day Dubrovnik card online the day before we visited the walls and felt it was well worth it. I paid 225 kuna for each ( special online price) whilst I believe a ticket to the walls only would have cost 200k. I was sent a booking code by email and they then asked for this to be printed out, which fortunately I was able to do at our hotel. It did not suggest showing the email on your phone as an alternative so I’m not sure if this would be acceptable. You then had to collect your card from the tourist office outside one of the gates to the old town.

For the extra few pounds, we were able to visit places like the monastery and rector’s palace - worth it, particularly you are looking for game of thrones film locations - I don’t think I would have been happy paying for the various extra attractions separately.
I would suggest doing a bit of online research before you go as there are no information boards to tell you what you are looking at.
Overall, views were spectacular and the walk round the walls was worth every penny. Beautiful views, no litter, hard on the legs and knees, but not to be missed.

The websites I had visited to find out information on the wall said cash only; however, they did take major credit cards. We enjoyed our walk around the old city of Dubrovnik. The views of the city and the islands and sea beyond were great. We did not find the walk to strenuous or crowded. We visited in late September and did not go early in the morning, as advised by many in their reviews, yet it was not crowded. Would I do it again? Probably not.

Croatia,Wez74,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Visited here whilst on holiday in Croatia. It costs 200 Kuna to visit this attraction which is quite expensive, but a more cost effective way is to get a Dubrovnik Card for 250HRK where you get the public transport and other points of interest included too.

You have to be reasonably fit and able-bodied to scale all the steps and make it all the way around, you need to remember that these medieval ramparts were designed for soldiers and not tourists. There are however a number of cafes and other places where you can stop and recharge yourself before moving on, I'm sure it can be quite exhausting if you attempt do this in the middle of summer. At least everyone moves in an anti-clockwise direction which is just as well as some of the walkways are fairly narrow.

This is must do in Dubrovnik, it's where you appreciate the citadel the most and marvel at the impressive fortifications. Try and get there early to avoid the stampede of tourists, you won't regret visiting here.

It is best to do it on a day with fewest cruise ships in port ( check that on line ) and also to start at the Eastern/Southern gate ( not Pile ). ( You are required to walk in an anti-clockwise direction). This gets the uphill section out of the way first but gives great early views. It also means that by the time you are about an hour into the walk you also get to the best bars for a much needed beer. Takes about 2 hours at a leisurely pace with plenty of stops.

Croatia,_drayles,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,A walk around the walls can be spot by slow-moving crowds. It is definitely worth doing and you get splendid views onto all aspects of the city. There is the occasional museum such as the Maritain one and also very good stop off point for refreshing drinks which you may need on a hot day. These little drink spots are usually situated in areas of particular fine views.,Sep 2019

Croatia,Absalon_mad,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"If you like medieval cities, walled cities or just architecture, you will love visiting Dubrovnik's old city walls.

Croatia,Andythebaggie,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A walk along the famous walk is an essential activity to do. There are a couple of entrances onto the walls, they’re not immediately obvious so keep yours eyes open when you enter the old city. Is it a bit pricey and crowded? Certainly, but it’s still well worth doing, the views are amazing as you walk around the old cities perimeter. It’s a steep climb at times and the stone can be slippy, so wear sensible walking shoes. There are a few cafes you can use as you walk around as places for rest and refreshments.",Sep 2019
Croatia,rockyjoe,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The Walls of Dubrovnik are a defensive wall around the Old Town of Dubrovnik, Croatia. These fortifications were started in the Middle Ages and have never been breached in battle. Most of the existing walls were built in the 14th and 15th centuries. There are four gates that lead into the city and they are part of the city wall. The walls are open from 8 AM to about 5 PM (depending on the season) and a ticket costs 200 kn. You can buy tickets on-line but that does not seem necessary (as the walls are huge and can hold a lot of tourists).

I visited this amazing attraction with my wife and really enjoyed walking around these ancient fortifications. There was at least one cruise ship in port and there still was no line to buy a ticket. Thankfully I did not lose my tickets as I was asked to show it a couple of times while taking the walking tour. The views of the Old Town were amazing, and you can see it from almost every step along the walk. There are a few stairs to climb but they were not bad and almost anyone could climb them.

This is a must-see attraction when visiting Dubrovnik and no visit to this city is complete without a walk around the wall. I really enjoyed visiting this amazing UNESCO World Heritage site and highly recommend it.

Croatia,LCB53,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"Based on the advice of reviews on TA we arrived at the walls early - we were hoping for a 08.00 start (walls open) but arrived at around 08.30 to beat the hordes/bus tours/cruise liner passengers. It paid off as we walked the walls in relative peace and quiet before the mass of lemmings arrived. We bought a one day pass which gave us access to the walls and a number of other attractions in Dubrovnik. It cost 250.00 kuna which was good value as the walls on their own cost 200.00 kuna. You can buy a ticket near Pile Gate and they do take credit cards contrary to other reviews which indicate that CCs are not accepted. The walls are fantastic and it took us about 2 hours to walk all the way around the old city. There are a few cafes along the way with magnificent sea views. Highly recommended.

Croatia,Tammy T,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"There's good reason why this is the #1 activity in Dubrovnik, omg the views are incredible especially on a clear day. I see recommendations that it's good to go in the morning before the crowds from cruise ships and tour buses (I saw the tour buses arrive a little after 10 am - by 11 am the crowds going up the steps to the wall entrance was pretty crazy). Our tour guide told us it's best to go around 4:30 PM to catch the sunset and we are glad we listened to him. I think the wall closes at 6:30 but they don't run around kicking people out right away, you can linger a bit (they do close the ticket booth). We were able to walk around with literally no other people in certain sections, catch the amazing sunset, and by the time we walked down it was relatively more empty. So I would recommend either going at 8 AM if you can or after 4 or 4:30 PM. Also, keep your tickets with you after purchasing. There are certain sections of the wall where they will scan your tickets again, especially if you walk the entire loop. It was pretty easy walking the whole wall, it's not always a steep uphill climb and in total it took about 2 hours including pausing and stopping for pictures, resting, etc. There are a couple of cool bars with ocean views, really incredible. I would highly recommend doing this - you won't regret it!

Croatia,pickytweeter,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We walked the walls -so to speak on our first day in Croatia-Dalmatia-Dubrovnik- as part of the Dubrovnik 3 day card , which means you end up paying hardly much more + get to see all of the other major attractions plus 3 rtn bus journeys- if your staying on one of the peninsula's this is useful for getting in each day to the old town!!. Muralles should be compulsory -if you don't DO anything else in D tourist wise, as the views are spectacular- as per the title of the review. We went at a busy time but on a dull day- so it was not quite as hot altho we had water and there were plenty of cafes.

Croatia,FrankNamibia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We were approaching the city walls from the north, instead of entering the old town we opted to climb all the stairs on the outside of the wall, leading up to the big tower facing inland. From there we wanted to access the wall and wander around to the southern gates. Don't do that. We struggled up the close on felt 20000 steps until we reached the top tower - voila, no entrance and no accessing the wall. So down we go to the nearest gate, another few thousand steps down, find the access to the wall after climbing another few thousand steps upward again. Ok that is grossly exaggerated, but your legs will thank you if you just inform yourself ahead of time on how to best get on top of the wall. Once up, what a wonderful experience.

Croatia,Dmitri K,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Most of the people know that this place is popular and will be crowded. Most of us know that this place is very touristy, not least because of Game of Thrones. And yet, every other reviewer writes something along the lines of ""busy but has to be done"".
Mental preparedness would be useful here: yes, it will be crowded but it is a beautiful place and you can enjoy it regardless of the crowds. It is not Mona Lisa or Sistine Chapel, which are almost impossible to enjoy because of the crowds. A Walk on Dubrovnik city walls allows you to ""soak in"" the beauty and to enjoy yourself, especially if you prepared to be patient. Allow yourself some time to finish the circle, maybe take a rest and have a sip of water or an overpriced ice cream.
It is best to buy Dubrovnik card online in advance if you plan to visit other places/museums. The card may also significantly cut your time in line, if there is one. The walk is rewarding not only mentally (I done it!) but also aesthetically.

In every other city that I’ve visited which have Roman walls it’s been free to walk around them. I could understand if it was a small fee but 200 kuna is excessive in my opinion.

It's a little bit overpriced, in my opinion, but, like I say, it's a must visit. The structure itself is intriguing, and the views are amazing. It's a one-way walk, which is very helpful as it's quite narrow at certain parts. Once you're inside the walls you can take it at your own pace, admire the views, take photos, point out things you recognise from Game of Thrones. Your ticket also includes a visit to Lovrijenac Fort, which means it's slightly better value for money - and the fort is also well worth a visit.",May 2019

The shelling damage visible from the walk around the walls really brought you up short. So we did the walk again this year, and it was very impressive to witness the recovery the country has made.

We thoroughly recommend putting in the effort needed to climb to the highest levels. It’s all a bit crowded, but that’s because it’s a “must do”. Allow yourself at least 1.5 hours to get the best of your visit.

Croatia,evbeans17,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"We really wanted to walk the walls while visiting Dubrovnik, but were nervous having a toddler in tow after reading mixed reviews. Reason for a 4 and not 5 star review we 100% felt it was worth it but feel need to warn this activity would be hard with young children if you were not fit/in good health, if so then 100% go for it. It is impractical to take any form of pram/stroller/buggy up the walls but the staff will happily store for you at the entrance. Ideally take a carrier, however as ours wouldn't fit in suitcase we knew we would be carrying our 22 month old up the steps. This was hard work at times but completely manageable if you are in good health. There were a lot of older tourists walking the walls and we didn't hold anyone up walking with a toddler. She loved running along the straight bits, there are plenty of places to stop for refreshments if required and toilets mid way. No baby change facilities but plenty of corners if an urgent nappy change is required. Defiently take water for you all and earlier the better for heat but would 100% recommend this for an active family.

Croatia,Edward,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The walls around the old town are accessible, for a fee, and allow one to walk around the entire old town. Th walls are substantial and are high up above most of the town, especially since partly built on cliffs, with significant portions very high. Parts go right by or through buildings and part is along the shore. This gives excellent views of, and feel for, the old town, the locations of buildings and streets, and the setting. While there seems to be a constant stream of visitors to the walls, when we were there in mid-June 2019 the walls were not particularly crowded, in contrast to the old town streets, the Stradun, and especially the area outside the gate, where buses disgorge tour groups, an area which was swamped with tourists. The walls were fairly calm and peaceful. There are several cafes along the walls, offering refreshments and it was one of our favourite experiences in Dubrovnik.

Croatia,James,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Walking the colossal walls that surround the city takes the number one spot of things to do no matter what. Every visitor to this historic city should strive to tick it off their list if they can!

Since its construction between the 12th and 17th centuries to defend against the threat of Turkish invaders, the famed limestone walls have been considered amongst the greatest fortification systems of the Middle Ages, protected by forts and towers still standing, never breached by a hostile army during that period. When the Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, a substantial portion of the walls were included.

As they circle the entirety of the Old Town, the walls are 2km long and it takes roughly two hours to walk them. Rest at the cafes for drinks with stretching views of the Adriatic, and be sure to look inwards too; the walls, and especially atop Minčeta Tower, offers unbeatable views of the city’s sea of auburn rooftops. Go early or late to avoid the hottest times of day. Bring a hat, sun cream, don’t forget your camera, and bring plenty of water with you (or wine if you wish to embody Cersei Lannister’s spirit). Which reminds me, the Walls of Dubrovnik crosses several Game of Thrones locations off the list.

Croatia,Sherril E,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"We came in on a cruise ship which docked at 9 am, but it was 10.30 before we disembarked and caught two taxis to the Old Town Gate - we had teenagers with us, it takes awhile for them to get out of bed. There were eight of us - grandparents (us), our son, his wife, our two granddaughters (12 & 16), our daughter-in-laws sister and her 9 yr old son.
We thought the tickets to do the wall walk are a bit over priced but we bought them and set off. The first flight of stairs are very step and narrow but once at the top the walking becomes easier; for the initial walk you do tend to get propelled along by the crowd as it is single file, with some places where two could walk side by side and here and there it opens up into a much wider area where people who want to walk quicker can pass. At these places there are various refreshment options. We bought ice creams at one and sat in the shade of umbrellas. It was 27 degrees with a cloudless blue sky so I tried using my umbrella for shade as much as I could - this made taking photos difficult so was not ideal.
We proceeded along slowly, taking heaps of photos and a lot of rests on the way in any and every bit of shade we could find. It took us 2 1/2 hours to do the walk - 1940 meters & 1080 steps. We are are 72 & 79, and I talked with a lady who was 82, having said that you need to have comfortable footwear, a reasonable level of fitness, and/or take it slow and easy.

Croatia,Peter vV,Walls of Dubrovnik,1.0,"Seen that the walls were built ages ago, and the big stones do not need much maintenance, one wonders why the fee has to be nearly €30 (without a guide). When i asked at the entrance what happens to the astronomical sum collected every day (seen the thousands of visitors), the ticket vendor got upset and started to be unfriendly and not to the point; ""i do not think that you are so poor to need to ask"", and ""even poor Croatians pay the entrance without complaint"". The right answer would be something like ""here is the website and link to the communal financial report"", but seen the shady reputation of many croatian politicians, such a report, if at all public, probably will not show much detail...
Anyway, for those that do not want to pay this fee, similar views can be seen by walking around the town and uphill.

Enter the walls at the Pile Gate entrance. Keep your ticket as it is checked again on the walk. It will take you a leisurely 2 hours to walk. Take plenty of water with you although there are beer, ice cream and water stops along the way. Approximately 45 HRK for .33l of beer so pricey but expect it.
Also keep your ticket as it will get you into Fort Lovrijenac for free saving you 50 HRK
Wear decent walking shoes or boots as there are loads of steps and hard ground, it needs a good degree of fitness as there aren't any lifts for elderly but take your time it is possible
Also they adopt a 1 way system around the wall which helps with the crowds. We didn't find it overly busy, there was a little bit of waiting and patience going up the towers but nothing much else.

We followed Lonely Planet's advice and entered from Ploce, this way the hardest part is done at the beginning. Because of the hundreds of tourists, you are advised to do it as early as possible or before closing time as we did. The city looked amazing in the late afternoon sunlight and the heat was bearable. Keep in mind that there is practically no shade up there with the exception of the two or three cafes.
I would say two hours but you might need more if you want to take this rare picture with just your chosen subject in the frame! The ticket is rather expensive so I suggest buying the Dubrovnik card- with just 50 kuna more you can visit other sights as well.

Croatia,warfield,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"We walked the walls on a Tuesday lunchtime, to avoid the crowds as far as possible. This seemed to work as it was quite easy to walk them without feeling overwhelmed by lots of other people.
The cost is very high, but the views are amazing and it is a welcome break from the pushing and shoving below.
If I had one criticism, it would be the staff inflexibility with students. Our son had his Cardiff University card on him, but they still refused to accept this as proof that he was a student - they insist on certain International Student Cards. They are making enough money from tourists, so a bit of flexibility would not go amiss.

Croatia,Roisin M,Walls of Dubrovnik,1.0,"The staff are incredibly rude at the ticket controls on top of the wall.

I had stopped to breastfeed my 4 month old baby and when moving on I had emptied my pockets and discarded my ticket.

NO ONE told us we had to keep our tickets for the duration of the wall as there were other ticket checks along the wall. We had already had our ticket checked upon entering the wall so presumed we wouldn’t need them again as it’s a ridiculous system that checks your tickets multiple times in the wall.

Views lovely but need better staff. The staff ruined our time on the walls.

Croatia,Abhishek Shah,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The walls are a must if you visit Dubrovnik. At 200 HRK it’s not cheap to walk the walls but it’s worth it.
Don’t do this if you don’t have walking shoes as the stairs are steep and slippery in some places. It takes about 2 hours to walk around the entire city (with a couple of breaks to to rest and enjoy the view). My phone counted 18 flights of stairs and about 2.5km. There are plenty of places to get refreshments (water, beer, juice) along the wall. But they are overpriced, so it’s best to carry your own water before you start climbing.
Would not recommend for older people or anyone with leg/foot injuries.
It was September and we started at 4:00pm so it was still quite hot. Starting at 5:00 would have been perfect as you can catch the sunset towards the end.

If you go any later in the morning, you'll be jostling selfie sticks and IG posers vying for the best photo opportunities.

We enjoyed our time on the walls. There are some beautiful views. It is a long walk - nearly 2 km - with lots of steep stone steps (we actually counted 359 steps) and virtually no shade.

We weren’t sure if the wall is included in our game of thrones tour but the lady which sold the tickets was really friendly and tried to help us. In the end we just decided to take the risk to go twice 😅 which i personally wouldn’t recommend because you have to walk at least 1000 stairs and about 2 km directly in the heat. It.

From entrance to first exit may take up to two hours if you stop frequently. Half way along there is a beautiful cafe&bar with stunning views over the sea. It's on the costly side but a welcome break.

Croatia,PostieTrevor,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"So, a short but factual guide. I'll let everyone else tell you how wonderful it is.
The cost is 200 k which is £25. This allows you one visit, once round. If you come down for any reason, you have to pay again. There is a one-way rule in place (anticlockwise). Best place to join is the no. 3 entrance which is by the harbour/east gate. This allows you to miss the crowds of coach parties who all go up at the Pile gate, which is on the other side.
There are 5 places that do drinks/ice creams/toilets at various points around the walls. The best of these are the 3 on the seaward side.
I am 64 and it took us about 2 hr 30 min. We weren't hurrying and stopped several times for photos. There are quite a lot of steps, so not disabled friendly.
When to go up depends on how hot it is and how long you are there for. When we went the walls were open from 8am to 6.30 pm. This does vary. Most of the walls can be seen from ground level so just look up and see how crowded it looks.
Your ticket does also allow entrance to Fort Lovrijenac,( a separate building outside of the city walls), which you can do the following day and would otherwise cost 50 k if you did it separately. The costs detailed here can be offset by buying the Dubrovnik Card.

As an adult it would be worth considering the Dubrovnik card as it was about 300kuna for 3 days I think and offered entrance to other places so better value.

Don't buy any of that crap in the basement. People come on. If people stopped buying it, those shops wouldn't be there and it wouldn't be so tacky to walk through.
Check out the bell tower next to the mausoleum. Def pay to walk up the tower. No need to go see saint lucia crypt, but the baptistery is kinda cool

Some scenes from Game of Thrones were filmed there.",Dec 2019
Croatia,Wendy M,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"There are so many reviews of this that I will only add two things.

Firstly, Diocletians Palace actually encompasses a large chunk of the town of Split so it is more like a walled town than simply an ancient palace and is full of shops and restaurants and eve apartments and hotels. So you don't have to ""visit"" it as an attraction. You can go in and out while shopping and getting lunch etc. Sections can be ""toured"" and have to be paid for like the cellars and Jupiter's Temple- see all the other reviews.

Secondly it can be very hot within those walls so be prepared.

We were here at the end of September and their were crowds, but not as bad as during the summer, as I'm told.

Croatia,JP1946,Palazzo di Diocleziano,4.0,"The main draw of Split (apart from its pretty marina) is clearly Diocletian's Palace - an amazing surviving example (in terms of architectural facades, layout and extent) of a Roman Emperor's home. Constructed in the late 3rd / early 4th century AD, it was supposed to serve as Diocletian's ""retirement home"" after he abdicated power in 306 AD - having served 20 years as one of 4 Co-Emperors of the Roman Empire He planned to ""tend to his cabbages"" in retirement, but the strange smell pervading Split is not from cabbages, but the therapeutic sulpher springs on which the Palace and Split is built. The facade of the Palace extends along most of the modern-day seafront, and owes its wonderful state of preservation to the fact that it is preserved as an integral part of the homes and shops that currently occupy it. If you enter via the Bronze Gate, you are taken immediately into the vast cellars of the palace (now small gift/craft shops) and up to what were the living quarters (now more small shops and restaurants). The palace is now a maze of small streets and open plazas both inviting longer personal exploration, and is wonderfully photogenic - no wonder they filmed so many scenes of GoT here!... Among sights not to be missed are the remains of the Temple to Jupiter, the Cathedral of St Domnius (ironically formerly the site of Diocletian's mausoleum) and the Peristyle hall (now serving as a large cafe). Do climb the stairs at the rear to enter the Emperor's receiving chamber with its open oculus - the acoustics in here are marvellous, and if you are lucky, you will hear a male Croatian acapella choir sing song for charity (CDs /USB sticks are on sale). Finally, most tours will exit the Palace via the Golden gate and Srosmajerov Park.

One of the largest rooms was found only after tons of debris and trash was cleared out, the room was apparently used as a trash collecting room. As we walked through one of the rooms with an open sky light there was a quartet singing a beautiful Croatian song. The acoustics of the room was amazing. There were columns, great entry ways and yes capers growing on some of the walls. Another wonder experience in Croatia.

Since we stayed in the Riva Palace hotel, that is inside of the palace , we were able to enjoyed walking very much the palace.
The palace is inside of the old town of Split... it couldn’t be better!
And the Split port is just in front... we loved it!
At night there is always someone performing at the center of the palace, Peristyle, and from there there is a relative small tunnel that goes to the outside promenade, were we loved looking at the ocean and the boats coming and going.

Croatia,rockyjoe,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"The Palazzo di Diocleziano (or Diocletian's Palace) is a Roman Palace built in the fourth century AD for the Roman emperor Diocletian as a summer home. A large part of this ancient palace remains as locals used the old walls and rooms as apartments and shops (which helped preserve it). It is a large rectangular building about 215 by 80 yards. This amazing Palace is located on the waterfront near the center of Split, Croatia.

I visited this amazing historically site with my wife on a Saturday morning in late October and really enjoyed the visit. While it was packed with tourists (which made it difficult to walk around), I went on a guided tour of the upper level and then did a self-guided tour of the basement. The basement area is the most well-preserved part of the structure as it was used as a garbage dump in ancient times (so it was not destroyed). Archeologists just needed to remove all the ancient refuse. There is a charge to tour the basement area and I highly recommend that you go down there (this was the best part of the tour). The only downside to visiting this ancient palace is that the crowds are huge if there are a lot of cruise ships in port (so try and visit before they arrive of after they leave). If you are hungry there are tons of restaurants along the outer walls or inside of the structure.

Overall, I enjoyed touring this amazing site and highly recommend it. This is a must-see attraction when visiting the Dalmatian Coast. I plan on returning to this amazing site on a future adventure.

Without having been there I just couldn't get my head around how immense the palace was described as being. Even after being there for several days, I'm still not sure I can fully appreciate its size. We got a combo ticket that allowed us to visit several of the palace's attractions above ground and also toured both sides of the basement that is open to tourists. I suggest that, even if you're on a tour, you return to the palace and walk around slowly imagining what it must have been like when it was first built.

Today there are many little alleyways and old structures surrounded by shops within buildings built within the walls.
A tour or a good guide book or map of the palace is good as we have walked around twice already and still find out bits we have missed.
Some things have sort of been absorbed by modern day shops so you need to look for them.
We are heading back to try find the temples of Venus and Cybele near the Temple of Jupiter and also the mosaic floors in a few areas.
I read somewhere you can get a free Split card from the Tourist Board near the Peristil or Riva if you are visiting for 5 nights or more which gives free admission to some museums and 10-50% discount on loads of other things so might be worth looking into?

Croatia,IN_Travelers47906,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"When we travel, I like to find things that you just can’t see anywhere else, and Diocletian’s Palace is certainly one of those. It now is the central landmark of the beautiful city of Split and remains free and open 24x7 for locals and tourists alike.

You want to set aside at least a half day to explore Diocletian’s Palace and its immediate surroundings. If you can, return multiple times, including evenings to see the place under soft light when it is not so crowded.

Diocletian was born in a village very close to what is now Split in 244, he served as the Emperor of the Roman Empire for 20 years, and he ordered this “palace” built for his retirement. It took 10 years to complete the construction, and in 305 AD, when he became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his position, he lived out his retirement in this palace on the Dalmatian coast . He died in 316.

The term “palace” is a bit misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress. About half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison. Within its white stone walls and under its courtyards are a cathedral and numerous shops, bars, cafes, hotels and houses. Once home to thousands, its sprawling remains include more than 200 buildings. Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split, which, in 1979 were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

A Visitors’ Center is located in the center of the palace and a tour is almost a must if you want to truly take in the history and beauty of the palace. There is a fee to tour the basement, which is the space into which many of the ruins fell over the centuries only to be reclaimed through archaeological expeditions over the past century. It is also worth mentioning for some that, as were so many landmarks throughout Croatia, Diocletian’s Palace played a significant role in the filming of “Game of Thrones.”

ABSOLUTE MUST DO: Klapa Singers are a’ capella groups of male Croatian folk singers and they perform for free in regular 15-minute intervals within the Vestibule that is just off the palace’s peristyle (central square). The circular 3-story Vestibule has a mosaic tile floor and was capped by a dome ceiling. It once served as the entrance to Diocletian’s apartment via the Peristyle. The domed ceiling eventually collapsed leaving a circular opening at the top through which sun illuminates the space in which Klapa singers now perform.

The acoustics in this rock/mosaic Vestibule are nearly perfect and the sound of the male Klapa singers is magical. You MUST go to the Vestibule and hear at least one performance. You will never forget it. ADDITIONALLY, there is a small unassuming doorway that most people miss just off the Vestibule (opposite side as the Peristyle). When you enter the doorway, there will be someone there to collect a minimal fee which will allow you to climb up the stairs to the top of the Vestibule. The views from there are excellent, but the best part is that you are now at the top of the Vestibule and in perfect position to listen to the sounds of the Klapa singers as they rise from the floor up and out of the vestibule. Don’t miss this!

Croatia,IlyaNJ,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"The name Diocletian's Palace is a bit confusing given that there is no actual palace to visit here. It refers to the fact that the walls encompassed a Roman Emperor’s palace in the 4th century AD; nowadays, it’s a grid-like maze of narrow streets that strongly evokes Venice, minus the canals. The palace’s main court, Peristyle, retains a lot of Roman architectural features, as well as transplants from other schools and cultures. Off Peristyle, the spaces such as round vestibule, where a capella singing can be heard through the day, or basements of the palace, which house artisan shops, are well worth looking at. The northern Golden Gate and the eastern Silver Gate are the most important points of entry to the palace, in different states of preservation.

At noon in season, there is a semi-curious “ceremony” at Peristyle, with actors dressed like Diocletian and his guards coming out on a balcony for the “emperor” to entertain the crowds for a minute or two with some semblance of address. No reason to make it a must in your itinerary.

Croatia,Davidjellis,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"I spent a pleasant hour or so wandering the Diocletian's Palace in the old part of Split. The Diocletian's Palace isn't really a palace in the way you might expect, but more of a city within a city, where the extensive site of the old palace form an internal city with traders, a cathedral, temples, vaults, a bell tower, and much more.

Some of the sights are subject to additional fees so depending on how much time you have these are probably worth paying for. I had limited time so just wandered and admired this unique historical living museum. The bell tower had been subject to restoration and wasn't open on my visit.

For fans of Game of Thrones, some of the scenes from the series were filmed in and around the palace including the under vaults...I haven't seen the programme, but my wife is a big fan so I bought her a magnet from the small fan shop inside the palace grounds. There is also a Game of Thrones museum with a dragon in the window, if you are interested in that kind of thing.

It's an impressive sight to experience and despite only having limited time I was pleased I took an hour or so out of my day to wander the palace and get a feel for what it might have been like in Roman times.

Croatia,Stewart C,Palazzo di Diocleziano,4.0,"We visited the Palace of Diocletian in Split on a weekday in June as part of an organised coach tour from our cruise ship. The palace has been used as a setting for some episodes from the TV series ‘Game of Thrones’ and indeed the theme of the tour was based around this although having never watched it we were at a bit of a disadvantage in terms of locations and characters.
The palace was built by the Roman Emperor Diocletian who chose to abdicate and retire to the city. The palace fronts onto the harbour itself and if you look up at the first story of the buildings here you can see the Roman influence. If you intend to visit here, take a look at the three dimensional model on the harbour front first as this gives a reconstruction as to how the palace would have looked in its heyday, laid out as a square with high walls pierced by gates on each side.
We entered from the harbour area and once inside there are a good number of souvenir stalls selling all kinds of mementoes before the visitor reaches the pay desk. Note that many of the souvenir stalls price their wares in Croatian ‘Kuna’ however, if you ask the vendor some will take ‘Euro’s at an impromptu exchange rate. Once inside the Palace ‘proper’ there are a series of cavernous tunnels and large rooms to explore all seemingly linked together, maps are supplied on the walls to help the visitor navigate the labyrinth. Because of our tour’s theme, our guide illustrated her talk with pictures from the TV series and it was interesting to see how the palace interior layout had been adapted for the filming sequences here, being enhanced as required.
On leaving the underground section there is still much to see including other remains of the palace but also churches, narrow streets (the city seems to have ‘leaked’ into the walls over time), and impressive gateways including one with a dome open to the skies similar to the Pantheon in Rome (but smaller and not nearly as ornate), and a wonderful colonnaded courtyard complete with Egyptian sphinxes showing the Romans admiration for this earlier civilisation.
If you are in the city, then a visit here is a ‘must see’ for a number of reasons. It will obviously appeal to those with an interest in history or alternatively to the fans of ‘Game of Thrones’ however even those just curious will no doubt enjoy exploring this area. There are unlimited photographic opportunities within palace confines including the locals dressed as Roman centurions who will pose with you for a small fee.

It is a pity that so much private and commercial interests have take over most of the site, making it look like a tourist trap.

The palace and its surrounding walls tell a long history dating back many centuries ago and their building structures were impressive and we really wondered how could that be done during the ancient days in building such structures by hand!

As we walked around, our local guide gave us a good introduction of the place and it's history behind. We were very amazed with everything that came in front of us and well, history has come to ""live""!

It was very crowded (and so do beware of your personal belongings) and we also saw acapella performers here who really sang well and hopefully visitors would grab some of the CDs or USBs.

If you are into history, ancient archaeology, this place is simply ideal for you!

Its possible to climb the bell tower for fabulous views. Surrounded by a maze of cobblestone streets and shops and check out the old town clock. Its the real historical center of the city, not far from the bustling waterfront of The Riva, great for people watching, local markets, palm lined and featuring colorful buildings and about a 3klm walk to the beautiful beach.

Croatia,Tracy W,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"I don't think any visit to Split would be complete without a visit to the Roman palace. I would recommend either booking yourself onto a guided walking tour or getting a decent guide book because there's so much to learn about this place, what its function was and why there are 4 gateways. The cellars are the best preserved part, and is home to several market stalls selling crafts and souvenirs. I was amazed to discover that people actually live in the building too!

There are some quite steep stone steps and it can be a little uneven in places, so those with mobility issues do need to be a little cautious.

Croatia,rybblevalley,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"What I love about the palace is the way it's fully integrated into today's city. There are hotels in it (I was lucky to stay in one a few years ago), there's the cathedral which used to be Diocletian's mausoleum before the Christians got the last laugh on him. You've got the peristyle with its chunky steps, people sipping their drinks whilst watching crooning guitarists and assorted posers with varying quality of entertainment.
Restaurants crowd the front of it facing the Riva. Numberless independent business pack into its tiny streets. It opens up to several squares with umbrellaed cafes and overpriced shoe/bag shops.
Local crafts are on sale along the passage underneath (slightly reminiscent of Krakow's Sukiennice). Each of its gates has its own story. Various adjuncts along its Riva aspect range from tasteful blends to outright carbuncles.

The point is, it's nearly 2000 years old, and yet it's well and truly used and lived in to this day.

The 1700 year old Palace has been partially torn down, reconfigured and in some cases with regards to the Communist area totally mutilated and thus it can seem difficult to discern where the Palace begins and ends. One great help was our private tour guide Ante Batarelo, privateguidescroatia@gmail.com, who was able to show us both the above ground and under structure in the context of history and relevance. Much of what is seen was added to and around the Palace by the Venetians after the fall of the Roman Empire. Diocletian was able to accomplish the building of this amazing structure in 10yrs and even though there is little left in comparison to what’s seen now the Palace structure and its amazing history are the most important find in Split.

As others have said the streets are narrow, and it was very busy even in May. Just outside there are models of the palace as it was in its heyday, and in the middle ages, it helps you to orientate yourself as to how it was and how it is now. As our guide pointed out to us, though none of us were Game of Throne followers, some of the series was filmed here, apparently the basement of Diocletian's Palace turned into the throne room of the dragon queen or something (I really know nothing about GoT).

Croatia,emast87,Palazzo di Diocleziano,4.0,"My husband and I visited Split on a short 3 day break whilst on our way to Dubrovnik. We were privileged to stay just outside of the palace walls which was so close to this historical marvel.

The old palace walls are partly ruins, which contain lots of narrow streets which create a labyrinth to explore. I understand there are walking tours you can buy tickets for, which tell more about the history but unfortunately we ran out of time. There is a central square where the cathedral is, which is extremely beautiful. It does get very busy with tourists and groups (lots of cruise ship trips!) but my husband and I enjoyed sitting on the steps with a drink and watching the world go by!

The streets are full of restaurants, bars and shops. There is a market towards the north side of the palace walls selling lots of different items from food to souvenirs. The people are friendly and not “pushy”.

Game of Thrones used some areas here for filming, especially the basement of the palace. You can walk through part of it (which I was surprised to see was full of more market stalls - not really necessary!) but to get into the main area you have to pay. I think there are Game of Thrones walking tours you can get tickets to also.

It is a shame that a lot of the buildings in Split, including some of the palace walls have been vandalised with graffiti - but look past it and see the beauty and history of the ancient architecture.

At the entrance from the market side there is a wheelchair lift but it wasn’t working on the day we visited, however if you meander further up the road there is a turning into the palace and the old town that doesn’t have step access so I felt that I could see as much as everyone else. There are a couple of areas that are step only but this is an incredibly old town so it’s to be expected. My main beef was the toilets as per the photo I’ve added but I think there was other access though I didn’t find it!

Diocletian and his people lived on the ground floor which its structure ruined and replaced with housing from medieval and later period after his death.
The basement was full of trash til the archaeologists diged them out and fount many historic stuff. So, they can tell which room was Diocletion’s bedroom, dinning room, reception room etc. a part of this was also where they shot the famous ‘ game of throne’

Plan on a minimum of 4 hours for the palace and an additional 2 1/2 hours for a thrones tour - well worth it if the guide or his/her family were extras (ours was).

The following day was beautiful and sunny, which meant it was crowded. We were told that because its shoulder season it wasn't too bad compared to summer months. I would say going in the shoulder season to anywhere in Croatia is the way to do it.

Helpful Tip: Make sure you get Kuna before you go to eat. Lots of places dont take cards. Remember to avoid the BLUE AND YELLOW arm's. They charge an exorbitant exchange rate. There is an ATM right at the end of the Plaza that is Green and White, it is attached to an actual bank. Always get your Kuna from these places (this applies to all of Europe).....DO NOT exchange monies at the airport either.

He also explained the layout of the Diocletian palace, the former rooms of the now excavated ruins.
Visiting the Diocletian palace and touring it yourself without such historical and expert explanation of the different parts of the ruins will not be as satisfying than hearing what a particular section of the ruins used to be.

Croatia,Cwattsks,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"So read the reviews, look at the photos, yes - it’s ALL fascinating. But here’s what’s DIFFERENT about this area compared to most other European “old towns”.
NO CARS ALLOWED except the mini mail truck and a funky, pint-sized garbage truck. You won’t get run over.
Yet the place is CLEAN, free of litter, and we saw practically no graffiti.
We witnessed NO POLICE presence, but we were assured they were around, plainclothed.
Happily, every RESTROOM we used was clean and stocked with supplies.

WE RECOMMEND taking at least a 2-hour guided tour. The layers of history are all the more impressive if you know what you’re looking at!

We booked through Sirena Travel Agency. Our guide Petar was excellent! Over the two and a half hours he led us through a detailed explanation of the site through the ages and punctuated his talks with diagrams, maps, and photographs which made the verbal discussion even clearer.
He was head and shoulders above our guide at Pompeii last year.

Croatia,70 years young,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"Today we met a lovely young woman, Anna, Our daughter found the free tour online. Our family has toured numerous places by searching out the free tours online and today’s was super. Anna is a history professor. You can also join a tour inside as there are many operators inside. Anna showed us the Gold Gate entrance that only Diocletian and family could enter. This is the gate with the giant (8 Metres tall) bronze statue of a bishop who has a well rubbed foot from centuries of stroking by the public in the belief it would bring good luck. We visited the Silver and Iron gates and stood outside the original seaside wall of Diocletian’s mansion ( built in the Fourth century) which he had facing the lovely Adriatic. Inside are “guards” dressed in the original dress strolling inside the main courtyard outside the Christian Cathedral built in the Sixth Century when the Christians came in and ravaged the Palace. Diocletian had been brutal to the Christians. So, altho Diocletian was long dead, he suffered when his Jupiter Mausoleum burial place was turned into Baptismal site and his body disappeared. Anna was able to share these facts and many more fascinating tidbits. Try to go EARLYto avoid tours. We ate a lovely lunch inside a one of the smaller plazas. Name: Marul . Try the Adriatic Squid and the risottos are numerous. The Goulash Ragu with gnocchi is awesome.

stalls occupy the lower vaulted space in the basement. Approximately 3000 people live within the grounds of the old walled palace, the main entrance is through the Bronze Gate.
Built into the outer walls are various cafes and shops, with some of the original walling intact.

Now it is alive with cafes, apartments, shops, tourists and locals. It is a bustling place and is the heartbeat of the city. Some of the current shops have walls and floors made of glass to showcase original 4th century structure.

Croatia,Muriel M,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"If you see just one thing in Split, it needs to be Diocletian's Palace, even if, like me, you are not a Game of Thrones fan. If you are, you will be in hog heaven.

A good guide is essential. Ours was sardonic and knowledgeable. Dobir made the experience far more pleasant and educational. First we went into the under-vaulting that holds up the entire city. It is impressive and utilitarian, because it only held up the palace, but from it, you get a sense of the size of the palace--huge. Many episodes of GOT have been filmed in this undervaulting.

Once you get up to street level, you're in what remains of the Palace itself, as most of the site is a Medieval city. We were lucky in that there were Dalmatian singers under the dome which gave perfect acoustics. We saw the place Diocletian executed his own wife and daughter for becoming Christians. We saw the tomb of Diocletian, now transformed into the oldest consecrated Christian Church in the world. Inside, if you looked carefully, you could see that this was a Dark Ages church and feel that it had been a holy place for a long, long time. Outside, we went to the walls and city gates, the statue of St. Gregory, and many, many narrow medieval streets.

The morning was a feast of history. Don't miss it!

Croatia,Carol A S,Palazzo di Diocleziano,4.0,"The Underground of Diocletian's Palace can be accessed either from Riva harbor through the Bronze Gate (Porta Aenea) or down the stairs from the Peristyle. The rooms beneath the palace were used for storage, and are in an amazing state of preservation. The underground has two areas: a central hall with souvenir stalls (free) and a museum (ticketed) allowing access to dozens of side chambers and halls. The Bronze Gate once opened straight from the harbor into the palace basements, allowing goods to be unloaded and stored. The underground rooms structurally mirror the the chambers above, and helped archaeologists to reconstruct the imperial chambers. During the early Middle Ages some chambers were for residences. Over the centuries, many chambers were filled with rubble; excavations began in the mid-19th century, and the cleared rooms were opened to the public in 1995. They are occasionally used for art exhibitions, theater, fairs and other events. The labyrinth of rooms in the basement museum feature groin arches and barrel vaults, amazing in their state of preservation. Painted reconstructions of the Palace give an idea of its size and grandeur. One of the halls contains ancient floor beams from Roman times, another an ancient oil and wine press (turnjačica). I appreciated a model showing how water was piped many miles from a mountainous spring in Roman times; nearby were stone collars from that water distribution system. There are restrooms in the museum (somewhat dark and damp). The museum is open Apr-Sep: 8.30am-9pm, Sun to 5pm Sun; in Oct: 9am-5pm Mon-Sat, Sun to 2pm; and Nov-Apr: 9am-5pm. There is an entry fee of 42 kuna (children half price).

Croatia,Carol A S,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"The palace was built by Roman Emperor Diocletian for his retirement on May 1, 305AD (he was one of the few Roman emperors who was able to retire). The massive palace served both as Diocletian's home and a fortress for a military garrison, combining aspects of a luxurious villa with those of a military camp, with its huge gates and watchtowers. After the Romans left, the palace was empty until the 7th century, when nearby residents fled to the walled palace to escape invading Croats. The town of Split grew as residents converted parts of the palace into homes, shops, businesses and churches. One of the best-preserved features is the Peristyle, a monumental court and entrance to the imperial apartments. Diocletian's mausoleum (on the east side of the Peristyle) became the Cathedral of St. Domnius. Palace basements used for storage in Roman times, and now accessible to visitors, feature groin arches and barrel vaults. I was impressed by the palace size (~160m x 190m), and its amazing state of preservation. In 1979 UNESCO listed historic Split and the palace as a World Heritage Monument. A reconstruction of the palace appears on the reverse of the Croatian 500 kuna banknote. I found a 2-minute video of a virtual walking tour of the reconstructed palace by typing ""Diocletian's Palace reconstruction"" into my web browser. Buildings, walls and gates are lit at night, which adds to its romantic atmosphere. The Peristyle is now old-town Split's main square, with crowds of people, vendors, street theater and music. The palace is open at all times with no entry fee, although there are fees for various museums and buildings within.

Croatia,Phil_Dolliff,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,Visiting this site was one of the highlights of our trip to Croatia as it provided a unique and amazing insight. The ruins are fascinating as the parts that are intact like the long facade at the front or the Peristyle are such beautiful examples of ancient architecture. We took a private tour with an english guide and I felt it was well worth the extra money to get additional stories that illuminated the history of the palace. I would highly recommend this as one of the most beautiful and interesting sites in Croatia.,Sep 2018
Croatia,Role,Palazzo di Diocleziano,4.0,"The palace is pretty much in the middle of town in the cool area of the city. The happening area of Split. Lots of crafts and tourist things around.

Croatia,TheIllusiveMan20,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"History buffs or casual tourists alike should take time out of their day to see this place. It is fascinating how well preserved the Roman architecture is and how renovations throughout history have added to it. There’s plenty of shopping to be done and museums to tour. A must is the bell tower. For a cheap $3 (20 HRK), you have a short hike up the stairs to get a wonderful view of the surrounding area (second picture).

Being here in January, the crowds were very light. Getting anywhere was very easy. I found some pretty quiet areas where I could sit and enjoy the architecture. There’s something for everyone here.

Croatia,Bandit-One,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"There's a good number of jewelery stalls, arts & craft stalls and souvenir stalls here. Enter from the front or go down the stairs from the peristyle.

The section with the shops is free to walk around and - if you get some clean shot without visitors - quite impressive.

We found some nice jewelery made out of nice and polished silver. Good prices, nice staff.
If you'd like to see more of the nice undergrounds, you'll need to pay admission though. But we just didn't have the time for that, even I was interested in seeing more of this Game Of Thrones location.

But just the shops section is also a good start. We liked it.

Croatia,Bandit-One,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"Came here by cruise....having almost a whole day in Split. Came right here to this place (by foot, it's a nice walk from the port).

Split is a nice city, the old town right out of the Roman times. The whole old town is well kept and preserved, they take care really well of all the ancient buildings.

The Diocletians Palace of course is the heart and center of all of it. Impressive throughout and architecual details on every corner. It's now over 1700 years old. And humanity couldn't built something that impressive or original anymore if they tried. Since 1979 it's listed in the UNESCO World heritages....deservedly.

The Peristyle is one of the most impressive parts of the palace. Also the undergrounds (featured in GoT) are worth a look - there's two of them: one open section with stalls (souvenirs, arts & crafts) and another part where you pay admission to enter.

Don't miss out on the Vestibulum/Vestibule just behind the Peristyle. It's - weirdly enough - not that much visited. It was used to enter the residential part of the palace and has an open round ceiling.

It's one of these places that you could describe on countless more lines than this. But that won't do it justice. If you ever have the chance to visit this place, make it so. One of the most impressive Roman sites we've encountered so far.

Croatia,Deborah T,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"The Diocletian's Palace in Split is a massive ancient palace built for the Roman Emperor Diocletian at the turn of the fourth century in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305. It's a mini city within ancient walls. It's amazing to see how people still live in this walled city.

It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is also undergoing a preservation project by the World Monuments Fund. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian Adriatic coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European and world heritage.

I'm a fan of Egyptian history and was surprised to see that some of the materials used to build the palace were imported from Egypt such as Egyptian granite columns and 3500-year-old granite sphinxes, originating from the site of Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III. Only three have survived the centuries. One is still on the Peristyle, the second sits headless in front of Jupiter's temple, and a third is in the city museum.

Another cool thing that you can see underneath the palace structure is preserved trash that has built up over the centuries. What a story that must tell!

Croatia,davidandjanet65,Palazzo di Diocleziano,5.0,"We spent two nights in Split, staying pretty close to the Palace walls. That was only just enough time to explore the city.
What a lovely city, built in and around the Roman Emperor Diocletian’s palace and residences where he and his army of soldiers and slaves would have lived. There is so much to see, the old walls and gates are surprisingly intact, considering the age of them. Visit the ancient square with its Sphinx and church and walls. The museum inside the walls is fairly basic, but worth a look around as it doesn’t cost much to go in.
The cellars of the old city now houses stalls selling touristy things, but you can see the vaulted ceilings and sense the antiquity of the place. For a very small fee you can enter the cellars where the emperor’s boat would come right in from the sea, so that he didn’t have to get off the boat until he was inside the palace walls. Fascinating history. Split is built in and around this old palace, life is still buzzing everywhere. People still live nowadays in some parts of the old walls. There are shops and cafes all around.
Apart from the museums, it’s free just to explore and wander round.

On the weekends it's common to catch all sorts of street performances here, and is also part of the route followed by the town guard during their changing of the guard ceremony. Find yourself a comfortable spot on one of the many patios that line the street by midday, and you're sure to hear the drums and pipes of the guard shortly afterwards. If you're looking for more of a party, wait until after dark when the pubs, bars, and clubs come to life! A trip to Zagreb isn't complete until you've enjoyed a beer/cocktail/coffee on the Tkalciceva.

Tkalčićeva Street feeds slightly uphill from Ban Jelačić Square and the center of Zagreb. Walk the entire (short) route. If you walk it slowly the street's soft curve can easily help you envision the fact that this was once a creek bed. There are plenty of places to take a load off, people watch, drink a beer or one of the interesting Croatian wines that are available. Be sure to look up at the well preserved housing from an earlier era. Also, be absolutely certain to find one of the occasional side streets that head off into the Upper Town of Zagreb. There are alleys, twisting and turning dead ends, less touristy shops, WW II bomb shelters, deck chains from Nelson's ship ""Victory"" (Battle of Trafalgar), and more. There are several decent restaurants along Tkalčićeva, but the real star is the street itself.

Only disappointment was a small antique shop called Saranden. The owner (Rodomir Saranden) is very talkative, full of stories (bunch of lies too). Sells some, so called 'vintage' watches which are not at all worth what he sells at and he fools you into believing they are really genuine, worth a lot more.

It is expensive and fency but food is delicious. At the evening we went to the beerhouse Mali Medo where we tasted the best beer in Zagreb and enjoyed in live music while eating great grill.
Second day we decided to visit Trakošćan. As we didn't have transport to there, we needed to rent-a car. Some of my friends told me that if we bought CroatiaPass ticket that we can enjoy discount for rent-a car. So, we bought it and saved money for Trakošćan ticket, for rent a car and get opportunity to visit more attractions around Zagreb, what we have done for the rest of our vacation.

Beautiful buildings are telling the story itself. Also i was in the restaurant and food was out of the charts, just stunning. And price was fine also. In the restaurant, i heard something interesing about CroatiaPASS ticket by some random people. I heard some interesting things and checked it myself. It is great and feel little down in the dumps i haven't heard about it before. You can visit places everywhere, in Zagreb also, for great and convinient prices and save a lot of money on other things. I will deffinetly use it next time i visit places around Croatia. Recommend!

Croatia,flashncrash,Tkalčićeva,4.0,"Tkalciceva is a popular street for some shops but mostly has cafes and restaurants. People will settle in for an hour or two with a coffee during the day while the food really comes out in the evening and night. Some places have flat-screens showing football. There is a variety of cuisine to choose from. Tkalciceva used to be a river that divided Old Town sections of Kapitol and Gradec. Back then these were not necessarily friendly times. Kapitol was for the more well-heeled while Gradec was where the working class lived. There was a bridge that crossed the river where many fights took place and gained the name The Bloody Bridge. The location of the bridge is now the short street Kravi Most. The river flooded often enough and due to some industry would become polluted. Eventually the river was re-directed and the area filled in. So a place that used to divide the town is now an attractive place to visit. As much as it fits the daily life of Zagreb I appreciate the historical aspect more.

It was fun, relaxing and a high quality. If you get hungry while doing nothing, try to sit in, and the restaurant takes reservations so you can always plan ahead.

Croatia,stacman7,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),4.0,We visited Zadar on our Croatian Holiday and thoroughly enjoyed the Sea Organ. It is very surreal and nice place to watch the sun set on the horizon. Only problem is that there are not enough trash cans or toilets. The WC nearby closed at 2100 and they have no signs that state so. Poor layout of the downtown overall in terms of providing facilities. It's almost like they are driving you into the bars and restaurants if you need to use the bathroom.,Aug 2020
Croatia,Aarron,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),5.0,"When entering of an evening it can be very busy as everyone wants to be there for the sunset. But the sea organ is playing throughout the whole day 24/7.
- you can literally sit on the floor as its so clean and listen to the sea organ play, now they don't play a specific tune but its the wind that makes it so cool and a great invention.
- its definitely something you don't want to miss as its a landmark for Zadar, you see everyone turn up for the sunset and sea organs from an evening. We got here for around 7.00pm to get a great spot as our first night we got there for 8.00 no where to go along the whole stretch.
- if you do stay for sunset be careful if you go for food as its very busy everywhere and tables fill up quickly in the old town once sunset is over.

Overall amazing experience.

Croatia,Juggleguts,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),5.0,"Friends had told me about the Sea Organ and until I heard it, then I could never have imagined how wonderful the Organ is. It plays away all by itself with the water being both conductor and orchestra. As the tide comes or when waves are generated then the Organ plays deep notes and vice versa.

The Organ is also a great place to swim or paddle. So make sure you bring your bathers.

Take the time to sit down and absorb the music. It will be time well spent.

The water front is beautiful and once you get to approximatly 100 meters of the organ you start hearing it. The sound is kind of eerie yet musical and peaceful. You don't actually see it until you are right on it. It's basically very large, neat stairs going down to the water. We sat there about half an hour just enjoying the sight and sound. Cooled off my feet sitting on the lower stair....but don't try walking on the stairs that are slightly submerged....they are slippery!! Easy to get really cooled off! Definitly worth while checking out if you are anywhere near Zadar! Extremely unique.

Croatia,IN_Travelers47906,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),5.0,"Right next to the Monument (Greeting) to the Sun is a Sea Organ. Installed in 2005, it is another engineering feat that is very difficult to describe. White marble steps lead down to the Adriatic ocean front. Under these steps, is a system of polyethylene tubes that resonate the air forced through them by the movements of the sea.

The result is cacophony of random tones that escape via vents in the steps, so that their vibrations surround the seated visitors. These are not musical tones but they are mesmerizing in the same way that whales songs are. There are no moving parts or parts requiring outside sources of energy, so the organ plays on endlessly 24x7.

Couple the sounds of the Sea organ with the sunset colors of Greeting to the Sun and you have a richness of the senses that is hard to duplicate elsewhere.

Croatia,Marie P,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),4.0,"First let me say if the water is flat and you happen to be walking around this area you might miss it. And, on first pass I did. However, when the sun goes down it is a popular place for people to gather and sit on the steps/ As the waves hit the pipes below the steps submerge underwater the water hits the whistles and pipes come a live. Actually it sounded a bit like whales calling to each other. Walk down along the water until you get to the end, then look for the steps and holes in the cement ...that is how you know you are in the right space. Better yet wait for waves of wakes from the boats to get going and I bet the music that comes is magical. In any event its a beautiful spot to watch the sun to go down over Zadar..

You are able to sit on the steps leading down to the organs and take time to appreciate the views around you.

If you visit during the day the steps are used as a beach since you can swim in the sea below. We took the opportunity on our last evening to swim and stargaze as we listened to the organs.

It’s a simple beauty which you cannot miss.

Croatia,Lori G,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),5.0,"I could have sat there all day listening to it, and taking in the view of the islands. Got there early in the day, the winds were light so the music was fairly subdued. Went back after lunch when the wind had picked up and the organ was much more active but unfortunately so were the hordes of tourists. Why does a large group make people oblivious to anyone outside the group? And why do they feel the need to shout at each other continually ruining anyone's chance of a video?
Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area but choose your time wisely to avoid the crowds.

It is an exceptional, peaceful and joyful moment to hear the adriatic sea playing a unique music minute by minute. I will remember this experience for a long long time and wish to come back.

Croatia,Zfy Ed,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),4.0,"Located near the ""monument to the sun"", this clever way of using nature power and turning it to a point of interest is the Sea Organ.

Flight of steps, each capped with holes (of different sizes and shapes inside that are no visible to the eyes) are made and when the sea waves (up tide) gushes to it with the help of the wind, it will generate the ""natural sound of music"". The sound is nice, clear and amazing, each with different tune! Very impressive!

Right here, the water is crystal clear and people were saw swimming in it too! So we don't need manmake attractions and sometimes using the force of nature, it too can become a point of interest as well and as effectively too!

It’s a modern organ randomly played by the sea, difficult to explain and quite different to experience. I wouldn’t say it was particularly tuneful but consider its generated by the movement of the sea it’s quite fascinating to experience.

The best way we found to enjoy them was to sit downwind (you hear more) and face the sea on a nice sunny day. Unfortunately we weren’t around for sunset but I suspect that that would be exceptional.

We went to Zadar, a University city with added bonus of Roman ruins and forum.. We walked first to listen to the Sea organ -- Harmonic music played by the Zadar Sea Organ... where the waves interact with the organ in order to create somewhat random but harmonic sounds. They nicely built up steps to conceal, under these steps, which both protect and invite, is a system of polyethylene tubes and a resonating cavity that turns the site into a large musical instrument, played by the chance-based results of the wind and the sea waves. Incredibly ingenious and wonderful.. We love to have witness and heard it personally...

We visited at night, walking up along the waterfront from the Forum which is about 100 meters away. First you see the people sitting on the steps, and then you begin to hear the organ. As you're taking that in you see the ""Greeting of the Sun"" which is a large circle with lights dancing up from the ground. It is really an interesting experience with people enjoy it and being washed over by the ocean breeze.
Visit at night to see the ""greeting of the sun"".

Croatia,The Swiss Nomad,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"Everytime we visit Pula we walk by the amphitheater, which is located in the proximity of the harbor and of the pedestrian zone.

Croatia,HBWillsy,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"A new acquaintance looked over my list of ""must see/do"" items for Croatia and told me to skip Pula altogether. Although she gave some great advice overall, I'm glad fate had other ideas. A needed stop for gas and water put us right at Pula's door, so we made a turn here and there and accidentally happened upon this ancient Roman amphitheater (one of the six largest in the world), both an incongruous and inevitable part of its surroundings .

There is something both unbelievably startling and absolutely spiritually grounding to happen upon such a site. It stops you in your tracks. Those feelings are only magnified as you walk through the colosseum and take in the sheer scope of it. It's easy to imagine how magnificent it must have been, once - and still - the pinnacle of achievement, overlooking the Adriatic. The subterranean gallery conjures a whole other set of emotions as you remember exactly what took place there.

The juxtaposition of ancient and modern is somewhat surreal, but it in no way takes away from the surprise or admiration. I'm glad I saw it.

I liked the way you can freely walk anywhere and imagine being 2000 years ago. Some more information would have been nice, without audioguide you are on your own (we knew this and read about the buildings architecture and history before). Totally worth the visit!",Aug 2021
Croatia,Timy L,Amphitheatre de Pula,3.0,Personally I enjoyed seeing such an ancient structure in such good shape but my children were very quickly bored and the information I got inside after purchasing a 40kn audio guide on top of the price of admission was not outside of anything I could have read on Wikipedia.,Aug 2021
Croatia,Dragan I,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"We were amazed how well preserved the inside of the arena is. It is really beautiful and clean and the best thing is that it is open until 23h.

We were fascinated that we were able to walk the paths Roman gladiators walked.

I recommend everyone to take the audio guide, since it is stacked with interesting facts and is a great chance to learn a lot about the arena and the Roman times as well.

However, the audio guide device is a little bit too old and some of the spots in the tour seem to be out-of-sync with the audio guide. This is the only downside of the visit, apart from that, everything else was fabulous.

P.S. I recommend the visit at the sunset - the colors and the setting is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life.

Croatia,Nick19791234,Amphitheatre de Pula,2.0,"The place is beautiful but it could be much more improving the inside visit.
- audioguides are too old and NOT Working well. I asked to replace it and i was told by the woman taking care to push stonger on the butons (like hell) to make it working… I wasn’t able to hear some points.
- For people paying entrance and not taking audio there is almost no indications. Better for them to watch from outside.
- No storytelling in the audio explanations. Why not inventing the story of a citizen of Pula, the life of a galdiator, … Audio would be more engaging
- Missing a VR experience and movie recreating the atmosphere during the games and how the theater was looking like. A bit like in the antic theater of Orange to give an example.

I put 2 stars hoping inside visits will improve as there is potential. Nevertheless, i defintively recommend to visit this charming and so well conserved amphitheater.

Croatia,chamdexor,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"We loved seeing the Pula arena. We paid to go inside which I recommend. It would probably be smart to get an audio tour, but we didn't. We just googled and read about it while we walked. Two things to note: parking is a bit of a nightmare. And if it's raining in Istria, do NOT go to Pula. Apparently (unbeknownst to us), we had the misfortune of scheduling our Pula visit on a day it rained. It was coincidence. But the problem as we found out later, was that when it rains in Istria, all the beach and island bound tourists scrap their plans and go see the Pula arena instead. So our 40 minute drive from Rovinj took an hour and a half because of traffic and police were closing routes and diverting traffic. We had just made a turn into Pula when an officer walked two cars behind us and closed the route.

Tickets are 70kn/adult, granting you access not only to inside the arena but also to underneath it. Be sure to check out that area as well. There's a (paid) parking lot just below the arena on the south side (the coastal side).

this place is not flat but you can manage to walk if you have difficulties walking the stairs are not for you, I recommend to stay down, the better views are from the top of the arena. Prices are around £8",Oct 2020

Croatia,The Swiss Nomad,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"On a rainy and cloudy day we headed to Pula, taking a break from the beach.
We had previously been in the city and had visited the amphitheater, but it's one of the main attractions in Pula so we came again.
We have never gone in, since it's not the colosseum of Rome and you can perfectly see what's inside even from outside, and we noticed people queuing without keeping distances, and these times that's not a great idea.
In any case, the building is well preserved, has a lovely stair surrounded by flowers on one side and a few cafes nearby from which you can admire it.
If you visit Pula the amphitheater is a must.

Croatia,Lizzy V,Amphitheatre de Pula,2.0,"You pay 10eur entrance fee (which is a lot for this small amphitheatre) and then if you want audioguide you would have to pay 5eur more. Felt like a rip-off.
If you can go watch a movie there or attend a festival it will be cool but honestly not worth the money for a visit otherwise. You can see most from outside the theatre anyway.",Aug 2020
Croatia,Leeann M,Amphitheatre de Pula,3.0,The Amphitheatre has a lot of history behind the building that we didn't realise until we had a guide take us around the local area. I think a guide to take you around the inside would be far more beneficial in terms of pointing out the historic details and the interesting historical facts in a lot more depth. We found the history of area very interesting and for us it would be much better. There is also a museum there showing how they used to make oil and some old fashioned pots. It is a great place to get some nice photos too.,Aug 2020
Croatia,Enzo,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"I'm in love in archaic architecture and this was thrilling experience. This is the best preserved roman coloseum in the world. What is interesting is that it is not on Unescos' list and it has interesting reason which i will not spoil :)( for those who don't know.) It is big, monumental and underneath it there are rooms with amphoras and similar. If you want special experience i'll recommend to go with tour guide.

Gladiator fights reined and entertained 20,000 spectators until banned in the 5the century. Arenas were also a place to torture people and to display blood thirsty hunting.

70 kunas to enter, worth every penny.

Be sure to visit the underground Gladiator chamber.

Further underground is all different pottery that has been collected over time and how that used to be transported.

The Arena offers great views of Pula and is a selfie paradise. I was a bit surprised to see so many people climbing up on broken columns and the large stones for photos. Having visited similar sights in Greece and Rome, this would never have been permitted.

After a nice stroll of the spectator area and arena, you can head down into the subterranean gallery for a small exhibition (mostly the pottery for wine and olive oil)

All in all, it is a great visit for history.

Croatia,MoonaMuslim,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"One of the main sights and landmarks of the city is the amphitheater, which was built under Emperor Augustus and expanded under Emperor Vespasian.
Well preserved, centrally located, it can also be easily reached on foot from the pedestrian zone. Great to visit from the inside.

A beautiful monument to the old days. Impressive and fascinating, if not as big and pompous as the Colloseum in Rome, but it still has a flair.
As the sixth largest amphitheater in antiquity, and one of the best preserved, at that time it offered space for over 20,000 visitors who attended the gladiatorial battles.

Clearly a must when you are in Pula!
The approximately 10 € are definitely worth it.

Croatia,wendhmagz,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"I am very interested in ancient history and I was gobsmacked when I visited the Pula Arena in Pula, Croatia. It is the only remaining Roman amphitheatre to have the four side towers and other Roman architectural areas entirely preserved. The original stone amphitheatre was constructed by Emperor Claudius around 27BC, and later enlarged by Emperor Vespasian in 79AD for gladiator fights. Today the amphitheatre seats 5,000 spectators and is used for musical events ranging from opera to rock. Pula has a number of magnificent monuments from the Roman era of which the Arena is one of the best. I definitely recommend you visit this town you are in Istria, and if you’re short on time, don’t miss the amphitheatre.

If you are struggling in the heat there is always the underground crypt to visit, if that interests you. However, I will say that we didn't find this part of the attraction very stimulating.

So that meant I only saw the colosseum from the outside. 20 years later I was determined to not be a cheap-skate and pay the $45 Australian dollars to go inside... it wasn't worth it. Especially when you can walk around the outside like my smart wife did and look in and have the same view and experience as we did.

Entrance is 50 kuna, and yes - you can enjoy the view from the streets high above the arena - but that doesn’t contribute to the maintenance - so please pay the entrance fee and enjoy the magnificent, full circle arena and the view to the sea.

Croatia,jef-ind,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"This is a stunning piece of scenery, so well preserved. It's fascinating to see it standing right there in the middle of the city. Somehow, it feels quite different than the Colosseum in Rome, at least to me. It is smaller, of course, and there is less to see inside.

Overall, I found the inside (50kn.) a bit disappointing. it seems like there could be a bit more about the history of the arena. The exhibit in the basement was more about local wine and olive oil than the arena itself.

But still, this is a must see in the area. It's also beautiful viewed from across the bay from some of the beaches.

Croatia,Rafal W,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"One of the ways to show city's wealth and status in times of Roman Empire was erecting prestigious edifices like amphitheatre. Pula's first structure was built in times of Emperor Augustus. It was humble, wooden building. This was replaced by stone one in times of Claudius. Enlarged by Vespasian in 79 in order to accommodate gladiator fights was, finally, finished under Emperor Titus in 81. With prohibiting fights of the gladiators in 5th century slow process of cannibalising arena for stone started, which was put to an end in 13th century by patriarch of Aquileia. In medieval times interior of arena was used for grazing, occasional tournaments by Knights of Malta or fairs. In the present day amphitheatre is used as a venue for musical concerts and its underground passages host regular exhibitions of viticulture and olives growing. Among many remaining amphitheatres Pula's is the only amphitheatre that preserved all three Roman architectural orders and four side towers. The arena is open for visitors all year long, however, with different opening hours, depends on season of the year. Admission is 50 kuna for adults and 25 for students and children. While visiting Croatia it is good to have some kuna on you, as not everywhere accepting Euro or debit/credit cards.

Croatia,For Wellness Sake,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"Croatia shares many traits with Italy, given their shared Roman heritage, so it's hardly surprising you'll find one or two wonderful examples of Roman construction to visit. The Amphitheatre at Pula is in pretty good condition and with the aid of an audio tour, there's plenty to learn about its history as a Roman arena for entertaining the masses. In the museum beneath the arena, you can also learn about the history of trade in oil and wine around the region. We were disappointed to miss the shows that would have helped further bring it's history to life so if you are visiting the region, it's worth checking out whether they are running the Gladiator shows that seem to run throughout the summer months - I imagine it's quite a thing to behold when so much of the arena is intact.

Croatia,d0gwalker,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"We visited with our two young boys who are very interested in Romans, gladiators, etc. We didn't get audio guides (as the kids don't have the necessary attention span) and without that it's worth bearing in mind that there isn't a massive amount to see once you've paid to go in.

The interior is pretty bare and in any case you can look into it through the open arches from the outside. The best view of all is the one taken from a short distance away where you can see the whole thing - again without needing to buy a ticket.

What you can't do without paying for a ticket is go down into the subterranean cellar space. What you see when you get there is a museum about... olive oil. Why on earth don't they have a museum about gladiators or Roman soldiers or frankly anything about ancient Rome? That's why you've paid to be there. It is not the time to get into detail about ancient olive presses!

Overall it's obviously the single most impressive ancient monument in Pula. But you might want to save your money if you don't have much time or are with young kids who don't have the staying power for audio guides.

Croatia,IN_Travelers47906,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"The amphitheater is Located 4-5 blocks outside the old city walls because of its size and configuration, and there is no need to begin looking for parking until you have actually seen it. It is huge, and, as they say, you can’t miss it. Street parking is an issue. Rates are by zone and we made the mistake of selecting a zone on the street for 15 Khuna ($2 USD) per hour with a ticket dispenser that only takes coins, which no merchants will give you unless you buy at least a stick of gum. A much better option is a parking lot directly across from the coliseum, and between the coliseum and the waterfront. The charge is 8 Khuna per hour and you can stay as long as you want and pay by credit card when you leave. Once done at the amphitheater, you can leave your car in the lot and return to it once you’ve finished exploring the rest of the town.

Entry to the amphitheater is 100 or so Khuna for adults. Once you pay your entrance fee, you may walk the grounds for as long as you like. The amphitheater was constructed with local limestone, and much of it is still standing. . You are free to touch, climb, sit anywhere you want in the interior. When you do exit, it will be through the gift/souvenir shop.

The amphitheater was built at the same time (27-68 BC) as the Coliseum in Rome and was home to gladiator fights. Today, it hosts concerts. You will want a allow for a full hour here. We are seasoned travelers and difficult to impress, but, to be honest, this amphitheater exceeded our expectations.

Croatia,MikeB,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"Arrived here today at the first stop of our Pula day trip. Looked every bit as fascinating as it did when researching the city! We arrived early (8.30am) as we were advised by other holiday makers in our hotel that they found it too warm to walk around after lunchtime.

Anyway, standing directly outside with the sea to your back when the sun hasn't quite peaked is a fantastic sight! The Amphitheatre is very well preserved considering the age of it!

There were only 2 negatives from visiting here (1 became a positive however). Firstly, there is a lot of scaffolding on the inside at present, along with spectator chairs and a stage. I know there has been some performances recently so I would hope this is just temporary. If the scaffolding, chairs and stage are permanently there, it does take the edge off a little bit. As the amphitheatre is so open and exposed, being able to see all that equipment inside ruins the view and takes away from the wow factor to be honest.

The second negative, which is also a positive, is the entry price. 50kn allows you access to the interior of the amphitheatre and not much else from what I saw. Whilst this isnt a lot of money to an English traveller (£6.20) and indeed works out a hell of a lot cheaper than an English tourist attraction, you can see every part of the amphitheatre from the outside, including vantage points above ground level, and even a nice cafe/bar to sit and catch your breath whilst looking at the monument and the sea.

An amazing piece of history that deserves a visit, but I would advise on seeing it from the outside and saving yourself 50kn, or spending that admission cost on a coffee or a beer at the top of the steps.

Croatia,N T,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"The city of Pula is symbolized by its well-preserved Roman amphitheater, the 2,000-year old arena, with its near intact walled ring that was built to hold 23,000 spectators. The Arena, constructed between 27 BC and 68 AD, and completed under the reign of Emperor Flavius, is the only Roman amphitheater in the world with a complete 3-story circle wall and one of Croatia’s architectural gems. It is the world’s sixth largest Roman amphitheater.

The arena, in the heart of the city, dominating the streetscape, doubles as a venue for outdoor cinema, open-air summer concerts and festivals, and events as diverse as ice hockey and foodie markets.

We bought a family ticket to take a look inside and I have to say, it was stunning. You had to pay extra for the audio headphones (we didn't ) but just being there was something. Only a month before the Foo Fighters had played there and the stage was still set up for other acts. It has even staged a football & hockey match.
Well worth a visit!",Jul 2019

Croatia,KirillOussov,Amphitheatre de Pula,3.0,"It is amazing and definitely worth a visit.
However, our visit was spoiled by the film festival, as ancient ruins and a modern stage with a large movie screen and cinema sittings don't really go together, not for me at least. Yet we still got charged 50 kunas to get in and see the stage as a centre piece of the Colosseum... to top it up, there is construction everywhere, so I have pipes, scaffolding in practically in every photo I made.

But you can easily tell the difference between the old and new bits and marvel at the genius of the builders of old.

A visit underground gives you a glimpse of where the wild animals and gladiators were kept. There are lots of amphorae and an olive oil press.

If you will be visiting several Pula historical sights, buy a Pula tourist card for 90 Kuna.

You can listen to an audio guided tour for 40 kina but the content could have been presented in a more interesting way.

Croatia,Zfy Ed,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"From a glance, you may have thought that this place is in Rome but it isn't. It is in Croatia and yet you can still find a similar and a ""me too"" Amphitheatre like that in Rome!

Well, it is not surprising as this place was formerly conquered many centuries ago by the Romans who actually built this building, one of the few outside Rome, that is so well maintained up to this present moment. Using the venue then for gladiator shows, it was then a form of entertainment.

The overall structure of the building is considered well maintained (though with several touchups and renovations over the years) but you can still feel the sense of ""originality"".

The place is now used for public events and concert performance venue with a makeshift stage being erected during our visit for a weekend show and it's a good place to visit, if you want to have a feel of ""Rome"" but not in Rome!

Interesting, and well-located but hard to get parked for long enough if you don't have plenty of coins...we eventually managed to get enough coins for an hour from a very grumpy lady staff member n the adjacent car park...the change machine was broken, so what else were we supposed to do?

Croatia,The Walsh Family🇬🇧,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"It’s no secret that from certain parts outside the Amphitheater you get clear unobtrusive views of the inside so if you are on a budget you can save yourself some money.

Of course however you don’t get the same appreciation of the atmosphere and history from outside. It’s hard to believe that the amphitheater is over 2000 years old & took 100 years to build. Save from the bits of restoration here and there the building is pretty intact.

Had it not been from the modern additions such as staging & lighting works the site would be declared a world heritage site but it’s not. Instead the city makes more use of it by holding events and concerts. If you time your visit right you may also catch some live action gladiator fighting.

We thought the the entry fee was reasonable to go towards keeping the history alive and for all to see. Which was about £10 per adult.

The Amphitheater de Pula is very neglected, I don't understand that the city of PULA let such a treasure go down the tube. Remember this is history going back to 1st century, we saw broken wine bottle, beer bottles, graffiti, trash.

Amphitheatre was enlarged In 79 AD, to accommodate gladiator fights by Roman emperor Vespasian, and to be completed in 81 AD under emperor Titus.
Today Arena is used as a venue for many music concerts and theater performances, and every year in the summer it's a big cinema under the stars during the Pula Film Festival.

I have paid to go in and walk around, but if you are in a rush it is a simple job to walk around the outside and view through the openings. It is built into a hillside and the road around the back allows you to see pretty much everything inside except the underground bits. You can even sit in a cafe watching what goes on inside.

There is an audio tour available once you are inside for an additional cost. We did find some of the numbers of the audio tour hard to find.

It offers a quick peek into the history, but it would be better if it had a bit more descriptions and more info about the Arena itself.

Croatia,VirginiaCW,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"This amphitheater in the ancient part of Pula is the 6th largest in the world and very intact - especially compared to Rome or Arles - even after 1000-1500 years of decay.
At its best, it could hold ~20,000 spectators, plus slaves, gladiators and animals.
It was built in ~70AD, with 4 stone towers (one at each ordinal point), ached arcades for 2 levels and the very intact third-level has square or rectangular openings.
Below there are fighting chambers and chambers for animals... so much detail in the archaeology and so much is visible that you don't get to see anywhere else.
Gladiator games took place here until the 5th c. and then when they were forbidden it started to be neglected and decay. However, it's hard to realize that when you see it today as a place where there are concerts, a film festival, and it gets used by many in the city.
There is a price to go into this.
It is down on the waterfront and parking around it is expensive crowded and often not very available. But it is within walking distance of many other ancient Roman buildings and highlights of ancient Pula, which was a large Roman outpost and the very early first century.
Definitely a place you could should go see.
There is a hop-on-hop-off bus for Pula which has a stop here, but I didn't see that any of the other stops are places where you would want to go and it doesn't have the ability to stop anywhere else where the ancient ruins and buildings are so I would discourage your spending the money and just walk

Croatia,David B,Amphitheatre de Pula,5.0,"You really can't go to Pula without visiting the amphitheatre.

Of course there is an entry fee, which goes towards the upkeep and restoration works. Entry is up a stone staircase into the vast interior of the arena.

It is an historic monument, and also it is used for open air events and concerts - a great venue and keeping up its purpose as an events centre, although with slightly different types of events now (I really can't see some of the modern events arenas still being in use in 50 years time let alone 2000+). So for those reviewers moaning that there was staging etc during your visit, be pleased that it is still a fully working events venue and accept these ""modern additions"".

Much of thee original interior has changed from the days when it was built as this would have been in wood. However, pockets in the stonework indicate where this structure was fixed and it gives a great impression of the vast interior built to hold thousands of people.

Some stonework repairs and replacement have been undertaken but this has been done empathetically. The majority of the walls remaining are original and this is a testament to the original design and construction, having survived the political changes and unrest which have affected this area of Europe

I found this amphitheatre to be more interesting than either the Rome Colosseum or the Verona amphitheatre (both of which are definitely worth a visit). It just seemed more complete than either of those, although I'm sure some may argue with that statement!

There is access to a tunnel which goes down and under the centre of the arena. This contained a display about olive oil production in Roman times, and although not directly related to the amphitheatre was quite interesting.

On the way out there is the inevitable shop, although you don't have to stop or buy.

I enjoyed my visit and thought that it was well worthwhile.

The Amphitheatre is not well preserved, as theft on many occasions over centuries occurred. The audio guides has a lot of information but leaves a lot to the imagination. The map provided with the audio guide is inaccurate. There should be a model or at least drawings somewhere to show how the arena looked when it was operational. It appears that information about the detail of the arena got lost over the years.

They could have been more creative in the presentation of information to achieve a higher rating and to attract visitors and thus leave a lasting memory.

From the outside, the Amphitheatre is impressive and a walk around the complex could be enough for most visitors.

You can walk around the amphitheatre and see allmost everything.

The only thing that you can see ""extra"" is the large underground room with a couple of ancient ampfora's and its history

We payed 50 kuna entrance fee and saw almost exactly the same. You get a map of the amphitheatre with all the chambers you can find. Only there is no explanation. If you like to have more info you need to hire an audio guide or a guide.

Only takes around 30 minutes to view it all with the small pamphlet provided. Yes you can see most of it from outside without going in and paying - but then you’ll miss the underground area which goes deep into the centre underneath the arena which was very interesting (see detail in photo) and have you a real sense of what it must have been like.

Croatia,Loophole Lifestyle,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"Gornji Grad (or upper town) is one of the most frequented areas by tourists in Zagreb, and with reason.

The area is cram packed with things to see and experience. From old-timey market stalls to local businesses, restaurants, and novelty shops there is no shortage of stuff to get into in Upper Town Zagreb.

The best part about Upper Town is how much old architecture and energy is still intact there. Even many of the streets are still cobbled from centuries ago.

The worst part about Gornji Grad is that it's pretty much an uphill battle. The best way to combat gravity in this situation? Step into a store, restaurant, or coffee shop every so often to take a rest!

Do NOT visit Zagreb and skip out on seeing Upper Town!

Croatia,Asiyah Noemi K,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"We love the Upper Town with its beautiful little streets and lovely buildings. It's always interesting and atractive, especially when you know the rich history.The old part of Zagreb consists of two parts. The first is Kaptol, the main ecclesiastical seat and a kind of 'bishopric town' dominated by the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or simply the Cathedral. The second part of the old town is Gradec, today's Upper Town. As Gradec for centuries was a free royal town and he had his walls, but the only city gate that is still preserved is the Stone Gate.
The Upper Town is the center of political life in Croats, Trg sv. Marka, where are the Croatian Parliament, the Constitutional Court and the Banski dvori, ie the seat of the Government of the Republic of Croatia. The square is also significant for the church of St. Marko. It was built in the 13th century. The beautiful Baroque and Renaissance buildings make a particularly beautiful atmosphere. Beautiful is the feeling when you walk through the little streets with shops and cafes and souvenir shops.

Croatia,Frances D,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"We'd done a fair bit of our own mooching around Gornji Grad (not far from the main square in Zagreb) before we discovered this walking tour. It's not exactly free: conducted by an historian (in our case), one tipped if one felt one got value, and one did! It was very enlightening indeed. They start from the equestrian statue in Ban Jelačić Square (you can't miss it) at 11am and 5pm in high season. There's much to see - churches, parliamentary buildings and civil service offices, and we enjoyed being primed for the canon (why on earth does a population recently traumatised by war allow that to happen every midday?), the weirdest museum devoted to thwarted love, and we learnt a lot of the town's history. We'd already been to the Museum of Zagreb, also excellent, so we felt very well primed for this tour. It really helps to have an informed commentary as it provided a larger historical context for what we'd seen. Although there are some cars in the area, it's very pedestrian-friendly. Some nice bars too when your feet give out. We also learnt about a tour (this was a bit pricey) of how the Homelands War affected Zagreb which took us to the tunnels under the Upper Square. Fascinating. Enjoy the Upper City.

We had been travelling around Croatia for a full 3 weeks and made Zagreb our last stop thinking 1.5 days might not be enough to see the sites and experience the city. We were wrong. As there is no landmark sightseeing in Zagreb we thought we would walk around and soak up the atmosphere and old town. Boring totally, if you have only a few hours max even that might be too much. The city is dingy and old but not in a good way, dirty, covered in graffiti, and full of lost tourists looking for something exciting to hold onto like us. It is a city for the locals and not for visitors and the very best of the country is way outside this so called capital. Very few redeeming features. Look closely at what you think you want to see and challenge this, The capital of Slovenia was almost as bad but at least that one had a castle to see and some old bridges over the river that made it picturesque in a sense. Zagreb has the usual beggars and losers wondering around, restaurants that open whenever they like and shop keepers who don’t care. If you run out of time don’t worry give it a miss or even better fly directly to Split/ Pula. The so called foodie street Tkalciceva was not impressive and was actually really short and did not offer an international mix of food, it was mostly for drinking booze and coffee. Not so easy to find good food as they promise.

From Ilica Road I took the funicular to go up the hill. To be honest I would have reached the top much quicker by walking. But anyway, I ended up close to Lotrščak Tower, which I went up to enjoy the view over the city.

From there I saw the beautiful St. Mark's Church, our next destination. After a short photo session on the square in front of the church, I visited the Museum of Broken Relationships. Then I had a coffee in the restaurant of the museum and started to stroll back to Ilica Road. On the way I took some detours deliberately.

There are many interesting things within walking distance of a kilometer or less.

The whole Upper Town experience took three hours and could have been longer. There is so much to see, so many photos to take. Even with twice the amount of time at my disposal, it would not get boring.

Croatia,flashncrash,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"Upper Town (or Old Town) is a staple of Zagreb that must be visited. Sure some portions are more recent but the essence of Zagreb is here in Kapitol and Gradec, the two sections that form Upper Town and have a history against one another as well. For Gradec there are 2 popular ways to access it on foot (am not counting the funicular as being on foot) and both are off of Radiceva. The first is a small alley next to Harmica Caffe that takes you up steps and if you take the first zig (or is it zag?) to the right on the steps it will deposit you onto Strossmayer Promenade where there is the padlock-filled fence with a wonderful view of The Cathedral. Behind you and along the Strossmayer Promenade is the silver sculpture/bench of Anton Gustav Matos and a short stroll further on is Lotrscak Tower and the funicular (upper) station. Turn north from the tower and you will come to St, Marks Church and Square. The second way to access Gradec is to take Radices further up and look for the first U-turn to your right and this takes you to Stone Gate (karmenita vrata) which holds a chapel and possesses a painting of the Virgin Mary saved from a 1731 fire. This pathway leads you past one of the oldest pharmacies in Europe and you are now located just one block north of St, Marks Church and Square. St. Marks Church, on its roof, displays the coat-of-arms for Croatia on the left and for Zagreb on the right. In the Square on opposite sides of the church are the Parliament building and the Governor's Palace. Take note of the many gas-operated lamps on the buildings that are numbered. In total there are 221 of them and 2 men each day trek 4 kilometers twice a day extinguishing them and lighting them. There is also the original Museum of Broken Relationships between St. Marks and Lotrscak Tower (there is a branch of this museum in Los Angeles). Lotrscak Tower's bells were used to let the villagers know the gates to Gradec were closing and when they were opening. The tower now shoots off a cannon each day at noon. Well worth being there and taking a video of it. While there enjoy the view of the city of Zagreb laid out before and below you. To get to Kapitol I would recommend you make your back to Radiceva and look for a small street named Kravi Most, this was the site of the Bloody Bridge where many altercations took place between the people of Gradec and Kapitol. From here you can choose which way to go to visit Dolac Market or The Cathedral (Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). Tkalciceva is a street filled with pubs/cafes/eateries that used to be a small river that departed Gradec and Kapitol. Skalinska is another walking street filled with restaurants with tiered seating in the middle of the stepped street. Make note that at the top of Skalinska is a fountain that is useful for washing fruit you buy at Dolac Market. Dolac Market also has a fish market plus underground is the meat market, bakeries and cheese. The Cathedral is a must-see and I would recommend coming at night to see the exterior bathed in light. With both Kapitol and Gradec so close to Ban Josip Jelacic Square it is incumbent upon you to visit Upper Town (Old Town) as this is where Zagreb began.

Croatia,vivibelle,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"While strolling through the Upper Town on a Sunday, our path was crossed by mounted guards in traditional costume. We followed the riders through the town to the Square of St Mark, joined along the way by a parade of gunsmiths, flag-bearers, trumpeters and drummers. And on the square at midday, next to the statue of Our Lady at Kaptol, we were treated with a spectacular display: the 'Preparation of the Guard and Arms Inspection'.

The full ceremony begins with the honour company riding from its headquarters at Dolac 2 (in front of the Church of St. Mary), arriving in Tkalciceva Street at around 11.40 am. Then they continue across the Bloody Bridge, along Radiceva Street, through the Stone Gate and onto the Square of St. Mark for the ceremonial line-up.

The Changing of the Guard, organized by the Zagreb Tourist Board and the Academia Cravatica, takes place every Sunday, and also the Day of the City of Zagreb (May 31) and the Day of the Necktie (October 18).

Unfortunately we sadly found that the plaster is falling off most buildings, there is graffiti on most buildings, and the white marble buildings are very blackened. I wonder why the city and country does not invest in this nice city? Perhaps they could take some of the revenues from the coastal towns and bring it inland. This city could look like Prague some day, but it is a long way off.

We enjoyed the city though but don't plan to return until the city invests some time and money here.

On Kaptol hill there is Dolac, famous fruit and vegetable market, also known as the soul of Zagreb. There is also Zagreb's Cathedral of the Assumption, amazing and breathtaking building, visible from the each part of the city. We took the funicular up to the upper town. It take 35 seconds for a ride, and it's amazing and unusual experience for only 4 KNs. It's the shortest cable car in the whole world and connects the Lower and Upper town for over 120 years. The major attraction in Upper town is Stone Gate (Kamenita vrata), it's a small passage with a chapel of Our Lady. For art lovers there are City museum, Museum of broken relationships, Galery of Naive art and Mestrovic studio. A famous landmark and Zagreb's most photographed site is St.Mark's church on St.Mark's square. It roof is made from multi-coloured tiles and it looks very interesting. You can spend a couple of hours in Upper town, enjoy the view, which is amazing, chill out in nice cafes, take some photos and buy a souvenir.

Croatia,TutaRuta,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"Gornji Grad is one of the oldest parts of Zagreb. The city was originally built on two neighbouring hills, one was Kaptol, where the cathedral is, and the church owned buildings (at that time), and the other was the free Zagreb, inhabited by craftsmen and other ""regular"" people. The old city was surrounded by the wall, and you should visit the most prominent remains of that wall: Lotrscak Tower (don't get startled when you hear a cannon fire a ball exactly at midday, every day from the top of that tower), Kamenita vrata - one of the remaining entrances into the old city (""stone entrance""), where you will see an actual place of worship - a church in the open - where people from Zagreb come to say a prayer for their loved ones or themselves, in times of need. You can also light a candle there.
And then, there are also the Parliament, the seat of the government, and St Marko Church (the famous roof tiles), and also St Katarina church (if you are into pinky roccocco or baroque style), as well as some of the museums and galleries.
If you get tired, stop for a cake and a coffee at the terrace of Museum of Broken Relationships. They serve famous ""Torte i to"" cakes, and it will refresh you for further exploration of the city.
Go for a city skyline view from the place in front of the Lotrscak Tower, or just behind St Katarina church. It is car free zone, apart from some cars with special authorisation, so it is pretty quiet there.
And you can hire a specially designed electric (but old-timer) car for a sightseeing tour of Zagreb.
There are many things to see and explore. Take your tome and enjoy it.

Croatia,SteveAnthony_Toronto,Upper Town (Gornji Grad),5.0,"When in Zagreb, you must visit the ancient OLD upper Town as it's referred to.

Undoutedly, the prettiest part of Zagreb, you'II get to see St. MARK'S CHURCH with its cool tiled coat of arms rooftop, the nation's capitol's Parliament Buiding and their Supreme Court building and get lost in the wide open space.

Take the tram up, the world's shortest, quickest one at that and don' t miss the little parkette overlooking the city's lower town just up top nor forget to pass down through the city gate not far off, home to it's patron Saint (referred to as the Woman and Child) statue that was the only item to survive the old town's devastating fire a way, way long time ago (sorry I forgot the date).

Plenty to see and do up on the hill here, with sights and sounds, cafes, restaurant's and souvenir shops too.

Oh, and after you pass through the oldest part of the town's old medieval wall just past the statue of the patron saint, head for the area's 800 metre long main street ... here it's a treasure trove of bars, cafes, and restaurants that eventually leads down to Zagreb's main square (Ban Josef Jelacic square). Ask for directions to the main drag as you leave the old city gate as getting over there is tricky (lots of short connecting streets you'd likely miss unless you know where they are). Years ago, it used to be the city's ""Red Light"" district but today it's trendy, chic and all done over.

Read up first if you can on the history or just wing it. It's all great stuff!

Many things to see but wondering around is your best pass time. St Marc's church is an amazing monument and the central structure of the upper town. Many places of worship are scattered throughout the area. Famous Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović had his atelier here and now it is a wonderful museum worth visiting. You will see a building where one of the greatest genius Nikola Tesla used to study and work.

Second thing is the smoking!!! Zagreb has a bad bad smoking problem. It's hard to find a decent place to eat when people, even couples with babies are smoking like chimneys in public!

There are some stairs in place but my wife with her heart condition was able to do it without issues. We spend all morning here and the used the included in the ticket price tram to go to the upper lakes, walked down to where the boat is, which is also included in the price, and took the boat across the lake to where we walked maybe ten minutes to where we were staying. The waters are crystal clear, there is no trash, nothing to mar the natural beauty of the lakes and waterfalls. We have been to all the major National Parks in the US, to Iceland, Switzerland, and most or Europe and this is by far the most spectacular park we have finished in terms of the amount of waterfalls and the stunning natural beauty.

The paths are well curated and in some places there are wooden walking paths on the water that do not have hand rails. It wasn't difficult but some people might need support.

I was able to buy the ticket online and scheduled it for between 12:00 and 1:00 PM. It being past the tourist season and also because of COVID, the park was not crowded, and I was able to do the long trail in less than 4 hours. (On the average, there were about 10 meters between visitor. So, one could walk pretty much as fast as one desired.)

The park lives up to its billing, and is quite a unique experience. The water cascades down the lakes via innumerable waterfalls and streams, and the gentle gurgling sounds of the water together with its beautiful turquoise color gives the park a unique ambience. It is maintained well, and there are plenty of pictographic signs so it is easy to find one’s way around the park and also locate facilities such as toilets. The boat ride (halfway through the hike) and the motor train (at the end) gave welcome respite to my tired legs.

All in all, it was an excellent way to spend the better part of a day (if you include travel time).

Croatia,Neil,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I spent far too long planning the perfect trip to Plitvice, getting to go after years of looking pictures of the otherworldly lakes. And it didn’t disappoint, it’s stunning. But it was confusing trying to work out the the best route, which entrance etc etc. so here’s what I did which may help a few people.

We stayed overnight in a B and B in the Plitvice Selo area, the night before entering the park. The advantage of this is you’re right next to the park, so you can walk along the cliff top to get birds-eye view without needing a ticket and before you enter. You also don’t need to pay for parking). From here you can enter via entrance 3 (which according to Plitvice doesn’t exist, but it definitely does. There’s a wooden cabin with someone in it to scan your ticket. It doesn’t matter if you’ve booked for entrance 1 or 2).

We got there first thing, at 7am. The advantage of this is how quiet it is. We didn’t see anyone for the first 20mins. Although I assume that wouldn’t be the case at entrance 1 or 2. The downside is entrance 3 takes you to P3. Where the long boats ride takes off from. But the boat doesn’t start running until about 8:30am. So you have to take route H from here. Another downside of starting so early is the sun hasn’t risen. And the colour of the lakes isn’t as turquoise when the sun isn’t shining on it. But there’s a way around seeing the beautiful colour lakes without having to go back on yourself, which I’ll explain later, and it was so nice being so quiet. Anyway, because the boat wasn’t running yet, we had no choice but to take route H.

So at 7am, it’s quiet, so doesn’t matter re. the crowds if you do the lower or upper lakes first. But when it starts dramatically picking up about 10/11, route H was much quieter than route C. When the paths cross, it gets busy, but when C and H split off from each other, C was always much, much busier. The downside of H is you’re often walking away from the waterfalls. So you find yourself having to turn around to take photos of some of the waterfalls. Wasn’t a massive issue though.

To do all of route H, plus lunch, took us about 6 hours. We then got the boat back to P3, and walked back to Plitvice Selo to our car. But this is where you can take advantage of being higher up, with the sun being high, and taking photos of the lake in their full glory! When you get back to the ticket hut, keep walking along the pathway through the woods. Along here are loads of view point of the lakes. You’re also on the right side to get that famous photo everyone talks about. You could walk to it, or drive a bit closer and park up along the road. If you’ve got Google maps working, the coordinates to it are (44.9023904, 15.6073713). It’s just over the bridge, and there’s a little pathway to your right. Follow that for a few mins and the lookout point is there. Definitely the best view in the park imo.

Other points, the food was average (burgers, chips, cheese and ham baguettes etc.), but did the job when I was starving and hadn’t eaten in hours.
The park transport seemed efficient. But did get busy around the time we were starting to head back.
Obviously the park is very busy, so if you’re taking a photo on the boardwalk, just be aware of people around you and move to the side, it’s not hard!

So in a nutshell, I’d recommend getting there first thing. The quiet and tranquility, although short lived, is worth it. To do that, it’s worth staying overnight there the night before, assuming you have a car anyway. If you’re fully intent on doing route C, either enter via entrance 1, or start about 8:30 if using entrance 3. And walk along the cliff tops when the sun is above you. At 2pm, it was dead quiet, you’re shaded from the sun by the trees and views are next level.

Croatia,TravelDan,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"An incredible experience. Believe the hype. The lakes are magically blue. There are several routes to choose from, depending on how much time you have and how physically demanding you'd like the route to be.

September is a great time to visit. There was a crowd but it was manageable. We went in at 09:00 and we found it a good time. If you get there earlier you'll surely have less of a crowd. Main entry time seems to be 10/11 AM, so our suggestion is to get there before then. We came from Zadar by car and it was an early wake up call, but 100% worth it. Even though the weather was partly sunny partly cloud (with some rain mixed in toward the afternoon) it was extremely beautiful and not too hot.

Suggestion: buy tickets online one day before to avoid the long queue on the day. You just get there, show the ticket and you're in.

We too route C which took us 5 hours in total. You'll get to see everything with this route. If you want something more demanding, routes K and H are for you (H is around 18km). In any case, bring enough food and water + hiking boots (no flip flops).

Croatia,shtooka,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"It was a little disappointing at the beginning of Sept. It's the dry season and the volume of water over the falls was very low, so it didn't look like the advertised pictures at all. But it was worth the day spent there.

We were just there last week. We stayed at a small inn outside the park, Villa Verde, and the owner suggested a route for us as we are not all that young that is mostly downhill. I don't think it's one of the lettered routes but it doesn't matter, once inside you are free to roam. No one ever asked us to select a route. You can buy a ticket the night before online, but this time of year I doubt there is an issue. But you can select and reserve an entry time online one day ahead. We did that. You can park at entrance 2 and walk to St2 which is the bus stop. It's a tractor pulling a linked up train of panorama coaches, so some say bus and some say train. Take the bus going to St3. From St3 you have a downhill walk to the boat dock P2, just follow the P2 signs. Take the boat to P3. From P3 you have a mostly downhill walk to the main attraction, Veliki Slap the Big Waterfall, just follow the signs to Veliki Slap. From there you walk uphill and follow the signs to St1. It's not so far and ok if you take it slow. From St1 you ride back to St2 which is entrance 2 where you came in. If you go the opposite way, you are facing continuous uphill especially from P2 up to St3. Going at a slower pace and stopping 1/2 hr for lunch this took us between 5 and 6 hours. It's about 5 miles of actual walking, not counting the bus and boat rides.

At P3 there is food available, some of it hot sandwiches for reasonable price about 40 to 50 HRK I think but can't remember for sure, and a large grassy area with outdoor tables. We brought our own sandwiches though.

The waterfalls are everywhere, small large, wide, skinny, tall, etc. The only downside is that it can get crowded, as there are small walking planks and bridges everywhere.

Croatia,Rachel-St2015,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful scenery and definitely worth a visit! We went in September which is not the typical holiday season but it was still very crowded. Dont want to even know the amount of people visiting during school holidays!

We took Path C though and also had some moments where we were alone on the path. Just avoid the the big guided groups, those are really annoying. And if there is a beautiful picture spot ahead there is more likely to be a crowd since everyone wants the perfect shot.

Anyway, we enjoyed our stay in the park and I would definitely recommend you go if you are in the area and have a day time.

Parking is 10kn per hour and you can buy snacks/food/drinks at various spots in the park. Bring good footwear though, its not necessarily Flip Flop proof. Also make sure to prepare for different weather. The park is in the mountains and it can get chilly when there is no sun.

Croatia,MarkfromtheIsland,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"I was really looking forward to this so I was really bummed when it was so disappointing.

This is a MAJOR MAJOR tourist attraction. The crowds are ridiculous. They use two separate entrances to separate the large throngs of people. Your ticket is good during one time frame at one entrance. They send people down differing paths to break it up but you can't separate that many people all the time and it turns into a gong show quickly.

There are numerous paths through the park. We had 4hrs there so we took the very 'typical' path B. That takes you down to the big waterfall, along a series of lakes and falls and ends at a boat.

The falls and lakes are stunning. There's no denying that. This is a drop dead gorgeous area. But being pushed along down a wooden gangway the whole time is not the way to enjoy it. I literally just stopped a half dozen times to let the pushy mobs of people go by.

The B route takes you along all the 'must sees' and you end at a boat/souvenir/snack area (of course). There you get in line for a shuttle boat that takes you on a 10 or 12 minute ride to the next station. There you get out of the boat, walk up the hill, walk down the hill to another boat and then get on a different boat to take you to an area where you can catch a motorized shuttle most of the way back to the entrance.

Part of the path is cobblestone - easy to turn your ankle - part of it is dirt/roots/rocks - also easy to turn your ankle. Wear supportive shoes/boots.

Are the lakes/falls beautiful? absolutely. Is it worth the crowd experience? Not on a bet.

(2) Take a waterproof cover for a phone. Even if it is not raining, the paths are very narrow - you can accidently by pushed and drop your equipment to the water.

We walked pretty much every part of each trail by doing a combination of various trails and boat rides. You need to check the timings of the boats as they don’t start early - so we walked up to the upper lakes boat station P1-P2 . This boat service runs very frequently and is just a short hop - there can be queues for the other longer boat route.
We also climbed up to the lookout above Veliki Slap - as you enter the waterfall viewing area go up the steep stairs on the left side ( there is a no entry sign but the path is ok , if a little overgrown ) this take you to the viewpoints above the waterfall which are magnificent .

Croatia,Nelli8,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We visited Croatia and wanted to visit this park. We stayed just outside if split so the journey to the park was 2.5 hours…..so quite a drive…..but so worth it!!

The park itself is simply beautiful….nature at its absolute best. Worth the drive and the ticket getting in. Book your ticket on line to avoid queuing when you get there.

The big waterfall is at entrance 1. We entered via entrance 2 and walked around that part of the park around the lakes and smaller waterfalls and then saw the large waterfall at the end. Beautiful.

We were typical tourists, and came wearing short sleeves and shorts as where we travelled from was 34 degrees.

When we got to the mountain it was quite chilly (very obvious, but at the time we just didn’t think!!) and it rained for the whole day. It didn’t ruin the experience as the views and scenery were spectacular, however had we layered up with long sleeved clothing and bought a waterproof Mac, it would have been so much better!! We were cold and wet all day so one piece of advice before you go…..wear appropriate clothing and footwear….comfy walking shoes or trainers to make the day more enjoyable if it does rain.

So glad we visited despite the long drive and being under prepared with the colder temperature and wet weather…..apparently the water in the lakes is the cleanest in the world….you can see why……as mentioned before nature at its best! You are not able to swim in the lakes snd you can see why when you get there, the preservation of the park is what keeps it looking so beautiful.

Croatia,Clay C,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"First off the place is beautiful and stunning and definitely worth a visit. There are different routes through the park and we did route/program B from entrance 1. The park did a great job of putting boardwalks in so you can see the park but they are narrow in many spots and with no handrails so I definitely do not recommend for anyone with small children. We loved the first half of route B as we were hiking and got to see a lot. The trail was clearly marked with lots of signs. The second half of route B involved 3 shuttles (2 boats and 1 bus). The shuttle part was a little confusing but there was always park staff at these points that gladly pointed us in the right direction. I think we had to wait 20 minutes for the 1st boat shuttle which was the longest wait. Personally I’d much rather hike between the spots, but that is my fault for not doing research before going.

We did not like the bridges that you have to walk on to get from one point to another. They aren’t safe, you can fall into the water every step of the way. Plus, there aren’t enough side-places for people to take photos, making it impossible to enjoy your walk while having to stop every 2 minutes and wait for 14689 people to take their pictures. The food is horrible and it costs way too much, considering the quality. There aren’t enough toilet establishments and trash cans.",Aug 2021

YES, the crowds are similar to Disney land, according to one reviewer, (which I appreciated as it mentally prepared me for the worst) BUT, this place is magical. We only took the ferry early to dodge the crowds then walked the rest of our 6 hour tour. If you were mindful and up for a heavy day of walking, you can steer clear of the masses for a good part of the day. We came on a Tuesday and the weather was overcast with a soft rain which may have helped the crowds. When most people took the ferry, we walked the pathways from 1 point to the other. Grab a sandwich in the park or bring one with you and enjoy the scenery as there is nothing like this place in the world! Just stunning! YES, it's crowded but you can't go to Croatia without a stop at Plitvice Lakes. In my opinion, 1 full day is enough to see the entire park.

It’s cheaper to buy directly from the ticket office when you are there or if you want to buy in advance, buy it online via the official Plitvice Lakes website. We had gotten vouchers and it wasn’t worth the trouble nor the price!
Secondly, once you have tickets you don’t have to enter/exit via the main entrances. There are mini entrances around the park. We stayed near P3 entrance and avoided the crowds at the main entrances.
Finally, don’t forget to bring your mask. It is required for the boat and bus ride inside the park but if you forget you can buy them for 6HRK at the coffee shop.

You can mix and match walks as much as you like. All staff in park are very helpful. Food places at various stops but long queues so recommend you take picnic. Water fountain to fill up at boat stop 1 which you should use as bottles to but are pricey. Glorious scenery at Plitvice Lakes, it’s a distance from the main cities but well worth the effort.

It was very busy which slightly lessens the experience and if I could offer any criticism it would be that in places the queues mix from different directions and this really creates a backlog. We had to queue for 45 mins to get the very short boat ride back on the way down. I imagine going out of school holidays is much less hectic.
We did route C which covers the whole park . This involves walking over 20,000 steps , two boat rides and a bus/train .

Croatia,chamdexor,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"You can read all about the park in other posts, so I'm going to highlight some tips:

1. Buy tickets online in advance. It'll save you a lot of time because the ticket line at the park is long.

2. If you just have 3 hours you will not be able to circle both the upper and lower lakes, but if you want to see the lower lake and a little bit of the upper and are decently fast walkers, try this: Park in parking 1 and follow the A/B route until you cross the lake on the first boat (P3 to P2). However, here, don't get on the 2nd boat yet. Follow the route like you are going to the upper lakes, but just go around the first ""upper lake"" - Lake Gradinsko and then just circle back to the dock and take the P2 to P1 boat. At least you get to see a bit of the upper lakes this way.
Then you can just grab the shuttle bus back to the 1st parking area. Note - when the shuttle brings you back, it is still a 20+ minute walk back to the actual parking area.

3. Pay for parking before you leave otherwise you'll do what we did which is find yourself at the exit gate with an ""arm"" but you can't pay at the exit gate. You have to walk into the ticket office which is right beside the gate.

4. The P3 to P2 boat may have a long line, but it moves quickly and the boats come very frequently.

5. If you see a tour group, either walk around them, reverse course, or trail behind the slow moving group. Those are your options.

Overall, a really beautiful park completely worth visiting.

It is an easy and magnificent walk through one of nature’s wonder.

Recommendation: book the tickets in advance.
Note: through the Viator website you usually get a reservation with a barcode. Go to the information point at the entrance and exchange it for the tickets to “cut the line”.

Croatia,Chris R,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"The good:
The park itself was a very nice place with great views and routes to hike through

The bad:
Entrance to the park was a shambles. We entered via entrance 2. The parking was a maze with poor guidance as to where to go, resulting in cars driving the wrong way through one way loops only wide enough for one car. This caused jams with nowhere for anyone to go. There were no stewards around making up for the lack of clear signs directing traffic.

Buying a ticket was a shambles, we didn't book online as the website said tickets could just be booked at the park entrance. When we arrived there was a 2 and a half our wait for tickets. The queue was hundreds of meters long and several groups of people were trying to cut in and skip the queue. There were no stewards controlling the situation and a lot of angry confrontations around us resulted. The entire ticketing system needs a complete overhaul, the majority of people were just turning around and going home at this point.

The park was extremely busy to the point of ruining the experience. Granted our presence there was contributing to the business but had we known how busy it would be we wouldn't have went. The paths around the park are extremely narrow and there are crowds of people constantly flowing in both directions. You can't stop for a photo or to enjoy the view due to the crowds of people behind you being held up. The queues for the boats and buses to get around the park were miserable, we spent half the time in the park waiting in queues, so if planning a long hike be aware several hours of the day will be spent queung stuck at bus/boat connections. Either the number of tickets allocated each day needs to be controlled properly and capped at a suitable level or the infastructure in the park needs overhauled, with the paths significantly widened and the number of buses and boats running doubled.

In summary, we had an awful experience due to terrible management of the park, which is a shame because the location itself has nice views and walks that are fairly unique to the area. Unfortunately couldn't recommend Plitvice to anyone until large improvements are made.

There is a boat and train that take you to locations along your trail. The temperature was very comfortable even though we were in the end of July.

We finally got on the dock after a very long wait, but then the boat left without taking anyone on. A staff member was there but did not stop people from getting on the dock. It got so crowded on there that I was sure the dock was going to crumble. We finally bagged the whole trip and hopped on another boat that took us back to the parking lot.

Croatia,tumbleweedchris,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We visited Plitvice in the early morning (8am) on a Saturday. It was early enough to stay ahead of the crowds and not feel too congested on the paths. This park is absolutely gorgeous. The only downfall is you will probably not be impressed by other waterfalls once you have seen the array of bright blue falls here at Plitvice. The paths are all well marked and will lead you through the program that you select. We followed the C route and felt like we got the most out of the park. It took us about 4-5 hours to complete this circle if I recall properly. This is a must visit and is not really on the same level as anything else. I read some reviews that suggest Krka may be a better visit. I went to both and that is simply not true. Plitvice far surpasses any similar experience in the country.

The complaints that I'm seeing about being overcrowded and not accepting cash (which they now do) seem like silly things to take away from the whole experience. Is it crowded? Absolutely, but it's the NUMBER 1 UNESCO World Heritage Site in Croatia, so obviously it's busy... Any amount of research will tell you this, especially the fact that you must buy your tickets in advance. But that did not ruin my trip whatsoever as you are able to move through the very well-marked park at your own pace. Food and drink just ok? Well it's a national park, not a food court, so I'm not sure why food options would lower a rating of the amazing views.

With its exceptional natural beauty, this area has always attracted nature lovers, so on April 8, 1949, it was proclaimed the first national park in Croatia. The process of saddlery, which forms travertine barriers and creates lakes, represents a unique universal value due to which Plitvice Lakes are widely known and attract many visitors from all over the world.",May 2021

Croatia,Jeff S,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Recently embarked on a trip from Split to Plitvice Lakes National Park by Apodos travel. I am semi reluctant to go on guided tours but was quite pleased by the treatment of the Apodos staff and especially our guide Renato. First, I would like mention that this is a long ride to get to this wonderful National Park. It takes some 3.5 hours or so and it good to be prepared for that. Also, it can be chilly so bring a sweater or light jacket just in case. The remainder of what I have to say is about our guide Renato.
From the time we departed until we arrived at the park, Renato provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the Croatian people in terms of the history, present realities of government and people as well as the future challenges and goals of Croatia. It was obvious that he had an impressive background and understanding of the many subjects that he addressed during our trip. Renato provided a wealth of information but was always sensitive as to not go too far and talk too much. However, after each of his short presentations as we traveled through various areas, he would receive many questions to expand on what he had to offer and he welcomed them with enthusiasm. Everyone on the excursion felt quite at home and interacted easily throughout the day.
While at the park, Renato was careful to ensure that everyone knew exactly where to go and what to do if they should have a question or get separated from the group. Again, he provided a wealth of information as we made the transition from our van to the park trails, to the boat crossing and back in a seamless manner. He watched over everyone without them really realizing it or having the feeling that they were being “guided.” It was a really spectacular and cool experience.
Overall ratings;
1. Depth of knowledge – top 1%
2. Ability to communicate (in multiple languages) – top 1%
3. Enthusiasm – top 1%
4. Ability to expand the experience that his clients receive – top 0.1 %
If I ever did this trip again, I would only go with this same group.

I am so happy we choose this part of the year when everything is soooo green and water is still quite strong. We choose H path and I am happy about it. It has length of cca 10 km which is not too long and you can see all lakes (it would be a pity to skip some parts). Also, upper lakes are less crowded so you can truly enjoy there. It took us cca 4 hours. Don't drink too much because there are toilets only on few locations.",May 2021
Croatia,PR,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Absolutely incredible. It would be such a shame to go to Croatia and not see Plitvice.

We spent 4 hours there. I'd say 2 hours absolute minimum. Up to 5.

Great way to see this is on the way from Zagreb to the coastal cities. A transnfer can take you there and you stop at the park which is kind of in the middle of Zagreb and the coast.

You can buy tickets from the Plitvice website I think for 80 kuna each. Don't buy from the vendors on tripadvisor who mark it up a lot. They sell tickets directly on the Plitvice Lakes park website.

Note that there are a lot of stairs to manage. So being in shape is important. Also, the path is narrow.

Enjoy!

Croatia,GE,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,"The nature is absolutely amazing. BUT

1) You pay 200kn for tickets then you arrive and have to pay for parking 8kn per hour!!!!! Average time od walking around is approx 3 hours.

2) the lady at the info point and everybody that works there are rude and are sharing wrong information about boat tours and overall what to do in the park

3) once you have finished 3/4hours of walking you arrive at the bus station to take you to your car, but then the bus arrives full you have around 50people standing and wAiting to get on. Then the bus leaves and you are left waiting for another 30min as the park worker will say but when in reality it is 45min to an hour to wait for a new bus.

All in all 2/5 because of the nature everything else sucks specially the service

Visited in Sep 2019 (picked APR 2020 since period out of range) One must DEFINITELY do this if visiting Croatia. Honestly, the images on Instagram of the Plitvice Lakes was the reason which made me want to visit Croatia. I booked the excursion through Tripadvisor itself. We were picked up from the Zagreb city and dropped off at the same place. We walked by the narrow, cute paths by the incredibly clear and blue water It was like walking through a fairy tale. The colours were so vibrant. Honestly it is difficult to say how beautiful this place was! The foliage, the water and the view , everything was SO picturesque! We also went on a cruise and the stop was where we could have lunch. There were food outlets where you could buy food. I'd really, really love to visit here again!

Croatia,M. Ban,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Plitvice Lakes, as the first national park in Croatia, was proclaimed in 1949. It's the oldest, largest and the most beautiful national park, situated in the mountainous region in Croatia, mainly in Lika - Senj County. This area has always attracted many visitors, including nature lovers and tourists, with its beauty. In 1997 National Park Plitvice was put on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The park covers the area of about 300 km square kilometres. There are 16 lakes divided in the Upper and Lower lakes cascading from one into another. The largest lake is Kozjak and you can take the sightseeing tour by boat. The greatest attraction is the exceptional waterfalls at the end of the lakes cascades. Also, you can enjoy the local home made food and drinks, and accommodation at the hotels near the lakes and in the surrounding area. There are two entrances to the national park ; 1 day entry ticket per person is 11 - 40 Euros ( depending on the season), children of age 7 - 17 ( 8 - 16) Euros, under the age of 7 is free. If you ever want to experience this magical beauty of nature, don't hasitate yourself to take one hour tour from Zagreb to National Park Plitvice Lakes. I'm sure you won't regret. Recommend it! 😊🏞️👍👍👍👍

The park is so well done, with the wooden walk ways taking you through and over the waterfalls, so you can get up close and hear the roar of the water. The water is incredibly clear, and visiting in winter it was a beautiful jade colour. By wrapping up and visiting in December not only was entry a fraction of the price but it was so very quiet. Didn't see a single Instagram photo shoot, which feels increasingly rare nowadays.",Dec 2020
Croatia,Barbs25,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Visited in august 19 and easily of the one the most beautiful places in the world. Incredible green/ blue views everywhere absolutely not to be missed.
We followed the reviews and arrived early (7.30am) and had already booked our tickets (these sell fast so a must do) and queued for all of 3 mins to get in so best to get there early.
I can’t remember the route we took but it started from the lower lakes and the blue water was just out of this world beautiful. So many people yes but don’t let that put you off, many take the most tourist easy routes so it’s not hard to find some quieter spots.
A note for those less able - my mum can’t walk too far and to be honest there is no great paths to help with that but you can still see some of it. Plenty of benches along the way to take breaks as my mum did and she managed to walk the route from 1 gate to the other then get the bus back to meet us while we walked the rest of the way so options are there.

Plenty of route options when you get there so you can decide as you go from a couple hours to 7/8 hours walking depending on what you want to do and see.
Some snack/ drink places but not many other than at the gates so make sure to take plenty of water and snacks and definitely good walking shoes/ trainers as it’s not even throughout

Croatia,Brittany_11_10,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"If you're coming to Croatia and planning to spend any time away from the coast, definitely check out Plitvice NP. It's worth it to spend several hours here, as there is a lot to see and plenty of walking paths (and two ferry rides) that can fill some time.

Best advice I can give is: go early. Even at the end of October (granted, it was the weekend, but still), it got busy around midday.

Whether you start at Entrance 1 or 2, it doesn't really matter, as you can take the ferry between the Upper Lake and Lower Lake, or you can walk alongside the river. Both are nice to do.

I also recommend bringing a picnic lunch, as there are plenty of benches and nice spots to stop, rest, and enjoy the view while having a bite.

Croatia,Sal Schmidt,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Magical lakes and waterfalls in Croatia, it was utterly mesmerising, the vivid colours and raw nature walk through the park. We were overwhelmed by the crystal clear waters and exceptionally well maintained park.

They have well planned walks for everyone, from a nice relaxed trek from 2 hours to a more expert level of all day. We opted for the 2-3 hour walk and it was perfect to enjoy the wonderful park, a short boat ride and leisurely stroll with magnificent views of the magical lakes and waterfalls. Once you are finished there is a shuttle bus waiting to return you back to the entrance, where you have a short walk back to the carpark.

We chose 'Program E' for Easy:-) It starts at the southern entrance to the Park (“Entrance 2”). The tour is circular and includes the area of ""Upper Lakes"". The program includes a short boat ride across Lake ""Kozjak"" followed by a walk upstream all the way to Prošćansko Lake. Return to the starting point is by panoramic train. Experience the idyllic beauty of the peaceful and spacious ""Upper Lakes"" with wooded shores and their most attractive waterfalls ""Veliki"" and ""Mali prštavcima"" as well as many smaller waterfalls.

Whilst the waterfalls aren’t necessarily the tallest, they are pretty and there is something beautiful around every corner. Not all of the food options were open given that we are out of season but there was a good takeaway style place near the boat drop off (half way) where we got a nice burger and chips.

Croatia,njackson84,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"My experience at Plitvice was largely, positive, but I do want to do start with why I've only given it four out of five.

So I've only given it four for the simple reason that I walked along route K, and there are large chunks of that where it is either poorly directed (there are a few occasions where the path branches into several different directions and you don't know which to take. Also, as the day goes on, it gets busier and busier (even during the Covid era) and the thin path is taken up by couples taking pictures of each other, and there is literally no way around them.

That being said, the scenary of the lakes justify their reputation due to the stunning wonders of nature that surrounds you. It has the clearest water I have ever seen in my life and parts of route K are so quiet that you can take your time looking at the surroundings.

There are a few things you should know in advance though;

Take plenty of water, it gets very warm and there was two placees to buy any once you're in the park, and they are several hours walk inbetween.
Route K is really only for experienced hikers (I mean you can still go, but I'd recommend being physically fit as my pedometer says I climbed the equivalent of 63 staircases), but does over stunning paroramas of the rest of the park.
Entrance 1 is where the better (in my opinion) sights are located. You will spend more of your time walking uphill
Entrance 2 is where the more convenient hotels are, but on the flip side it takes longer to get the majority of the ""better"" parts of what the park has to offer.
You can walk from one to the other, but it's a 45 minute walk on the roads, none of which have paths.

Its so clear and refreshing, the park is kept pristine with no garbage or pollution and its a perfect place to spend the day. or 2. I hiked A-B, its definitely a lot of walking but there are benches occasionally and its shady and so incredibly beautiful, it doesn't feel like a long walk. There aren't clear maps or signs so you need to kinda figure it out. There are areas where food and refreshments are sold. There are ferrys (save your entrance ticket to be scanned) that take you across one of the lakes and you can rent a rowboat there (100 kn/hour) and then continue the hike or take a bus back to the entrance- be prepared to walk a bit after getting off the bus, it doesnt go straight to the parking lot.

Croatia,Miki,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"We have visited Plitvice Jezera during our summer holiday on Aug. 2020 and as much as we were stunned by the beauty of the lakes, waterfalls and the karst landscape, we were dissapointed by the way the directors of this park are managing the facilities of the park. First of all the website does not offer enough information about the hikes and the payment method inside the park. When we arrived at Entrance 1 we saw that no map was included in the ticket price which was not cheap (200 HRK). Be aware that a map is needed since there are not enough sign posts in the park and you can easily lose yourself. The map costs 20 HRK and can be paid only cash in local currency. On the contrary inside the park at the snacks shops you can pay only by card. The maps inside the park are somehow useless because they are not showing your position on the maps. We decided to follow hike C to see the whole park including also the rides by electrical boat and train shuttle and which takes you to both lower and upper lakes.
The park is prone to rains so even if weather forecast is showing a low rain probability a raincoat is always needed. We had our mac in a sac with us so the torrential rain from the lunchtime did not affect us too much.
Be sure that you take with you enough water and if you don’t like fast food bring with you your own food. Be sure you use the toilets wherever you find them because only 3 places where we stopped had toilets.
In the end I would like to highlight that management is more oriented to make a lot of money here rather than offering the best orientation and the best value tickets to the tourists. Parking is not free of charge, we paid 70 HRK for the 7hrs we stayed in the park.

Croatia,Adventurecurls,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"People who heart of Croatia not only have the Adriatic Sea in mind but also the Plitvice lakes.

We got a ticket online for two days starting at entrance two following route E end then coming back on K. Pretty awesome way.

The second day we started at entrance one. We hurried a bit as the weather started to get pretty worse once we got back to our car. We took the boat across the biggest lakes and walked back parallel to the bus road.

The website of the National Park is sort of okay but also pretty frustrating, in other words not good organised. We were fed up when we came to the booking tab. My partner got quite unsure whether the website is trustworthy when it came to the payment, the last step.

Then: it is said that we can only pay by card in the NP. We’ve seen several places where we can pay ONLY in cash, we have had nearly nothing of it.

The other thing we weren’t sure about is whether we are allowed to take pictures or whether we need to fill in a form if we want to take pictures. I had to believe the form is necessary while taking pictures for commercial reasons.

We didn’t even get the information that we are free to pick the time and entrance at the second day. We got that information from our host...

I personally think this website and information needs updating.

We also recommend to give people, tourists some information about the track conditions. The maps aren’t good enough and don’t give any information whether there is a steep climb to expect or not. At times we had the question which way to continue as the Sign posts were missing or not enough to point us in the right direction. We had to use an App to get the right way.

All in all we had a fantastic experience and hope you’ll enjoy your stay too.

Croatia,Jacob Ispas,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"Our hotel was located near the secret Entrance 3 which our hotel said that we may use to enter the park. And since our tickets were for 9-10 am entrance time, we hurried to get there on time. When we got to the entrance there was nobody there so we just continued to walk until we were in the park. Afraid that we would miss our entry time (even though we were inside the park already) we hurried to entrance 1 which was 1 1/2 hour walk away. When we got there, they said that it didn’t matter and we hurried through the most beautiful part of the park because we thought we were late. The only use for your ticket is on the boat ferry which is when they scan it. Otherwise just enjoy the walk. My biggest problem with the park is on a 3-6 hour section of the park (trail H) which is one of the most popular, there is only a bathroom at the beginning and the end. And even at the end which is where the ferry is, you need to take the 30 minute ferry to reach the end-end where the bathrooms are. And it’s also very busy (we went during COVID restrictions and it was still busy so don’t think you can use the bush toilet without being seen...because you will be seen, trust me. The park is very large so don’t underestimate the time it takes per trail. If they said it only takes 2 hours to get to the end, they mean 2 hours of quick, nonstop walking, not the stop and take some pictures walking everyone does there. They have some food/drink shacks but bring water in a thermos, you’ll thank me later. No drones are allowed in the park, but I took off outside the park and accidentally flew a little inside and got some footage. Wink wink. The bathrooms that are at the bus stops are nice and well supplied with the necessary stuff. You can bring food and eat on the trails but depending which trail you are on (LIKE H) don’t do it because there. Are. No. Bathrooms.

Croatia,SmilenOne1,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"This park is absolutely beautiful! We went a few days ago with our family of 4 (kids ages 7 and 10). We parked at Entrance 2 - FYI you don't have to buy tickets here - there's also a ticket booth at the park entrance at the end of the path. We bought our tickets when we arrived. From entrance 2, we decided to hike trail H, so first we boarded a bus to get to S3 to begin our hike. The bus was overcrowded, which was disappointing during COVID times. We all wore our masks, as did most other people, but I still felt uncomfortable with how full the bus was. Once we got to S3, we hiked for about an hour and a half until we arrived at P2. The trail is mostly wooden planks which makes it all the more beautiful. The color of the water is unlike anything I've seen before! From P2, we hopped on a boat to get over to P3. The boat had a max capacity of 100 which they adhered to and didn't feel overcrowded. Once we arrived at P3, we hiked to the big waterfall and then to S1. From the time we bought our tickets to the time we got back to the parking lot, just over 4 hours had elapsed. We didn't stop for lunch and we didn't stop for long at any point on the trails (mostly because they were quite crowded), but I felt like we got to see most of the park and it was at a comfortable pace. Overall, it was GORGEOUS - there were so many waterfalls and the paths through the park were well kept and well marked. The only downside was the lack of extra controls and safeties with regard to COVID.

Croatia,Tetyana L,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"I give only 1 star to the park because my experience was an absolute nightmare. There is only 1 bus a day that goes to the park arriving at 10:20 and only 1 bus that goes back to Zagreb at 17:15. So, you must stay in the park for 7 hrs or take a taxi which costs more than 200 eur to Zagreb. And this is in a peak season, in August. When I arrived in the park, it was freezing cold, around +15 ( in Zagreb was +26 and sunny) in August with rain and thick fog. It was literally nothing to see in the park because of fog. You cannot get a free map of the lakes upon entrance, so you must buy one. There are maps inside the park but it is not marked your current location, so you don't know where exactly you are and which direction to go. The trails are poorly marked, so I got lost several times and because of that did extra 10 km under rain. When I came to the ferry station in order to cross the lake and continue to Upper lakes, it appeared that there is no ferry because of fog. I was not informed about it at the entrance, so I had to do extra 4 km walking along the lakes to continue my trail. All restaurants in the park were closed, I wanted to buy coffee from the coffee booth to warm up and I was refused because they don't accept cash, only credit cards and I had only cash with me. When I finally reached the farthest end of the park ( station 3) I was totally exhausted and hungry. I was waiting for the bus along with dozens of other tourists to take me to the entrance 1 and when no bus appeard in 30 min, I asked a lady from the park about the bus schedule and she said that there is no busses because they had some issues. Why there was no sign about it at the ferry station ? I was shocked to find out about it at the farthest end of the park and only after 30 min of waiting under rain, when there is no way out but to walk back 8 km. I started walking back and because of poor marking of the trails, 45 min later I found myself making a big circle and coming back to the same station 3 where the lady told me that there is no bus. I was almost crying from exhaustion and despair. But what could I do, I walked back again and 1 hr later took a ferry that was already operating, came by another bus to the entrance 1 just to find out that this is not where people enter the park through the entrance 1 and I have to walk another 15 min to the ""proper"" entrance 1. After that more than 2 hrs of waiting for the only bus to go back to Zagreb. I can say that the lakes absolutely do not worth the efforts spent and you never know upon arrival if you will be lucky with the weather or walk under constant rain and thick fog, no places to warm up and rest just, might be no ferry and no buses to return to the starting point.

It was not as difficult as expected. There is a lot of paths exclusively for the 18-kilometer walk, which is nice to avoid tourists.
The blue and transparent waters allow you to see fish and the deep waters, as well as a lot of outstanding algae. Absolutely amazing !
Mind you cannot swim in the waters (for some good reasons: preservation!)
We advise you to go early in the morning and take a lot of water. Also, please take your garbage with you ! We saw too many cigarette butts...

Should schedule more boats for route K+H as the boats only come every 30min and 100people are waiting for only one boat!

Through this and your ticket you also get the free boat ride across the beautiful lake before you get further into the park.
We went on a good day sun was absolutely amazing throughout, weather was hot, yes it was busy but we let groups go past us allowing us to have great photos and not miss a thing.
We took a sandwich each and 2 big bottles of water as we reached the top there was sitting areas in shade for us to eat.
From then we got the bus which was free all the way back to entrance 1 so its perfect.
Prices we paid
1 adult - 200kn (I left my student card at home)
1 student - 125kn
Return bus ticket from Zadar to Plitvice - 165kn each.
Overall prices are perfect. We brought our tickets online the night before as it stopped us being in a queue we literally walked straight through with phones on our ticket.
Would absolutely recommend anyone to do this excursion either with a company or make your own way there.

Croatia,Richard W,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Wow, what a place. Everywhere you look, there is a photo opportunity. The water is so clear and turquiose that you just want to jump in - unfortunately, you're not allowed.

There is plenty of wildlife to see along the way and there are many waterfalls to be mesmerised by.

You certainly need to be creative when parking beyond the main car park area - mind the rocks and branches. You need to pay for the parking in addition to the entrance ticket price unfortunately.

Overall, the value for money was ok and included a boat and road train ride - we did ""Tour B"" which took us about 4 hours including stopping for photos and food and waiting in line for the boat and road train rides.

The food prices were also reasonable for a place like this.

We loved the scenery so much that we're now planning to go to the Krka National Park too.

Croatia,CharlotteKirsch,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We went for a day trip from Trogir and we’re so glad we did. Slightly shocked at the need to pay for parking (10kuna per hour) given that the entrance fees are fairly steep for a national park (UK parks are free!) - 200kuna for an adult, 125 for student, 75 for child.
The scenery, maintenance and cleanliness of the park were phenomenal though. Views were absolutely beautiful and trails very well maintained and walkways very good.
Of all places we have been around the world, this was a highlight and impressive by both views, lakes and cleanliness and care over nature and the park itself.
We walked route H (about 4hrs) which allowed us to see all of the lakes taking the bus from entrance 2 to the top of the park, then walked down, got the boat to the bottom end and then walked round the rest of the park before getting the bus back to entrance 2. All bus and boat included in the entrance fare.
If you’re torn between here or Krka then I’d suggest go for this park for the sheer beauty! But definitely try to do both if you have the time!

Croatia,Ericthomas928,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,Came here with 3 friends. We all agree prices are sky high for admission. Park is ultra beautiful but administration/management is terrible.,Jul 2020
Croatia,Ieva,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,"For those visiting the park - Please be aware (1) people don’t keep distance, and (2) the park administration don’t seem to control the flow/behavior of people. Consider going in the evening (in our case - we went on Saturday evening was a very pleasant visit with few people, while on Sunday morning 8.30am it was unsafely crowed).

“Longer” observations:

It’s nice to see the excitement of people travelling, enjoying the views and taking photos. However, why does one have to do it potentialy in an expense of others/own health? Why does one put masks in the supermarkets but then feel perfectly fine pushing others to get to the waterfall to take yet another photo?

To People:

(1) Please be more considerate and even if you don’t care yourself, stay away if you see others that try to keep safe distance and protect the risk groups that are also there. The waterfalls will still be there even if you need to wait 30min longer to see them.

To Park Administration:

(1) The paths are very narrow but people still are walking both directions (e.g. from Entrance 1 to the big waterfall). This definitely does not allow to keep 1,5 metre distance, they were A LOT of people walking at the same time. The signs everywhere indicate that visitors should keep 1,5 metre distance, it’s also your (Park Administration) responsibility to ensure that that’s possoble.

Proposal - implement one direction paths and don’t allow people to crowd up, control the flows of people coming in and out better.

(2) Visiting the big waterfall - we had to walk away (around 8.30am) when we saw how many people there are - there where really many. None of the staff tried to control/limit the crowd.

Proposal - limit the number of people allowed by the waterfall and ensure that people don’t walk in crowds both directions on the paths.

(3) There are rules for masks to be worn on the boat but they are not enforced. What we noticed, some people wore it, but others were allowed to enter the boat without a mask. It was a half empty boat but, I believe, there shouldn’t be ant exceptions.

Proposal - make sure all rules are followed at all times.

I definitely think these measures could be implemented right away. Even if that means less visitors, I believe, we should all prioritise the health of our society first.

Let’s not forget in what times we live in.

Otherwise, the nature is really beautiful and definitely worth a (safe) visit. We had a great visit to the park yesterday evening (17h - 20h). We entered through Entrance 2 and walked the path through small waterfalls to the Station 3. There were not a lot of people and we felt comfortable.

Hopefully these concerns will be taken into consideration. Thank you.

Croatia,RavWoj,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"This is ‘one cannot miss this spot’ type of place. Due to Covid-19 situation we were very lucky as the Park was not crowded at all. I would say it was rather empty so we could fully enjoy wandering around it. As recommended (with what I fully agree) the best option is to take ‘H’ version of the sightseeing route starting from entrance number 2. One can leave the car at the parking lot located close to the Park’s entrance. There are also few bars (junk food only) and souvenir shops It takes 4-6 hours to complete the loop around all the lakes including 2 park’s bus transfers and boat/ferry trip across the Kozjak lake. The colours of water, flowers, all sort of greens were just amazing. Numerous waterfalls with different shapes, types are incredible. There are few places in the park where toilets, and bars are available. Unfortunately the food (snacks, fast food, drinks) were very average. Nonetheless, all the Park’s personnel and in all bars/toilets COVID-19 recommended precautions were present and followed (masks, disinfectants, disposable cups, plates…) and what is important only credit/debit card payments were allowed (no cash payments).

Croatia,Corinne W,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"An absolutely stunning place to visit.

We decided to split the lake hikes over 2 days but it can definitely be done in 1 if you start early and pack your lunch.  Definitely start from Entrance 1, not 2, as the largest waterfall and most scenic overview of the lakes is done in this part of the park, the lower lakes. All walking is on paved paths or wooden boardwalks but can imagine it is a bit slippery when wet.  Gym shoes are good enough for most people. 

We reserved an 8.00 ticket for Entrance 1 on Day 1 (earliest entry is 7.00). If you have a 2-day ticket you can use either Entrance or any time you want on Day 2. Parking is easy in the designated lots (park under a tree of possible so the car isn't too hot). The Entrance is just across the road so take the overhead pass or skip that and walk across the road.  And at the entrance don't forget to look up at the roof by the Info window..there are bats in the roof...a mother and her 6 babies.

There are 4 routes you can choose from at this Entrance...A, B, C and K. A, B, and C are basically extensions of each other and a circuit...so if you want you could end after A or B. K is the longest route and covers both the lower and upper lakes and says 6-8 hours. We did A, B and C  which includes a 20 min boat ride (P1)and a 5 min boat ride (P2) right after that (neither had a line or wait) and then walked back to entrance 1 following path K (other option was to take the shuttle bus). This took us just under 3.5 hours at a very relaxed pace, taking time for many photos.  The park at this hour (and due to being during the corona period) had few tourists so boardwalks were empty and never had to wait at a photo point...and many times our family was walking all alone...amazing experience! Regardless of which route you take,  be sure to walk a bit of K as it is the route where you get the overview of the lakes from the top. 

If you aren't sure which route you can take ask one of the ticket agents at the entrance who can show you each route. All routes are signposted and easy to follow.  I would not bring a stroller, as the boardwalks are made of natural wood so many times not flat. Masks are mandatory on the bus but not on the boat. Boat and bus are included in your ticket.  There are huge set of picnic tables and some facilities (WC, snack kiosk  etc.. not everything is open though)  by the first boat (P1) and also some by P2 boat. Boats are electric so nice and quiet. The long boat ride seemed to leave on the half hour and the 5 min ride was every few minutes.  

The second day we again arrived at 8 but started at entrance 2, trail E, taking us just over 2.5 hours from Entrance to Entrance, including boat and shuttle. You can choose from route E (only upper lakes), route F is closed, route H (upper lakes and some of lower lakes) or K (round trip/ longest circuit of upper and lower lakes).

We chose route E as we did the lower lakes the day before. It takes a good 15 min waking to get to the entrance from the parking lot, and then 10 min or so to get to the 5min boat at P2(same as Day 1). After that,  the trail really starts. We followed trail E which was for the upper lakes only,  they ended at the shuttle bus which was a 10min ride back to Entrance 2. The alternative was to walk bsck along the bus road (not recommended as it is narrow and you would share with the bus every few minutes) or to walk back on trail K/some of E, taking about 1.5-2 hours. 

The upper lakes are beautiful and the water varying colors of blue.  The boardwalks allow you to walk across parts of the lakes so the views are beautiful.  There are many small waterfalls and the path weaves between forest and boardwalks. 

Overall a great way to spend a day or two mornings.  We read the area is a microclimate so the weather is changeable and can be foggy. 

If you have extra time in the afternoon,  we can recommend horseback riding at one of the local ranches (call to reserve) or a visit the local caves (Barac caves- no reservation needed, highly recommended).

It is good to reply to these negative reviews and show the world what measures are currently being taken to address these issues.

Croatia,Mania,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"I have visited Plitvice several times, and as much as the nature is beautiful, the color of the lake amazing turquoise blue, and the view of the waterfalls breathtaking, the fundamental problem is poor management of the park, which has not changed since the last century. In the whole area of the park, and for a walk you need between 4 and 8 hours, depending on which trails you choose, there are only 3 places where you can buy something to eat and go to the toilet, and one of those places is before entering the park. So when you walk into a park (and imagine you’re in with little kid..), there are two (!) locations where you can buy water or use the toilet! The walking paths are narrow and the crowds (before the Corona situation) terrible, so you literally make a pilgrimage as in a procession and risk being pushed into the water while you or the other visitors try to take a photo. As you have to use trails like everyone else, you have no choice but to walk in a column. When you finally get to one of the rest areas, the food offer is poor and is based on fast food (although the Lika region is known for its excellent local food). There is no information about natural phenomena or flora and fauna within the park, and parking is charged per hour.
During my last visit, in May 2020, due to the Corona pandemic, the price was reduced from the planned 300 kn (almost 50 €!) to 75 kn (10 €), but because of that Croatian visitors did not have the usual longer boat rides available (there were only boats on the shortest route across the lake, it takes around 2 min to get across) nor did the electric train run. Basically, typical Croatian greed and filling the budget with a minimum of investment in the visitor experience.

Croatia,Dora B,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,"Due to extremely high prices, I only got a chance to visit the park when they charged the lowest fee ever after covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, I was very disappointed with the park. Nature is beautiful for sure, but not worth such a hype and price for park ticket (which is normally around €40). The track was wooden, on some places barely supporting itself, and it was pretty narrow which isn't convenient when there are a lot of visitors or if you want to take pictures. Also, there are not enough places to sit (and the hike is very long - usually around 5 hours). Another thing worth mentioning: there aren't garbage bins in the park, and only a few toilets so people were leaving their dump (and I mean ""dump"") where they thought appropriate. Finally, there isn't any information out on display if you want to find out more about the formation of the lakes or flora and fauna which is, I believe, the biggest oversight.

Which has been taken over by local, greedy cronies who are unable to offer tourists visiting this beautiful part of the world with higher quality content and more value for money upon their visit. Instead, their innovation is to jack up the price of entry to the Plitvice National Park to this ridiculously exorbitant entry fee. This amount is beyond belief for someone coming from a western higher standard of living like the US, UK, Canada or Australia. But imagine how it is for a local Croatian visitor if they want to take their family to visit the park and pay the equivalent of 2 days work for EACH entry ticket. So for a family of 5, they would have to work 10 days to pay for a day of visiting their own countries most beautiful natural park. UNACCEPTABLE!

Croatia,sbk225,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"I booked the day tour through Viator, made the payment and was so looking forward to it. I went to Zagreb to do this tour.
the day before the tour the local tour operator Super Tours d.o.o cancelled the tour and send me a whatsapp message that they didn't have enough people. and offered to book a private tour for 500 Euro.
I was so surprised to hear about this scam. I call it scam because I checked with the hotel where I was staying and they were willing to book a private tour for 250 Euro. Being a frequent traveller and a trip advisor user, I was very dissppointed with the way it was hanlded.
Trip Advisor should take caution who they are using locally if they don't want their reputation to be tarnished.
Do NOT use Super Tour D.O.O

Croatia,Must Do Travels,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,The Plitvice Lake waterfalls are located in the Plitvice National Park. It was titled as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. The two highest among the falls are the Large Waterfall (78 meters) and the Galovački buk (24 meters).,Mar 2019
Croatia,Hugary1,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"One of the truely wonderful sights of nature.
We did a day tour with Karl to this site which is some distance from Zagreb. He drove the van with 3 of us and was a great companion and guide for the day.
We have been to various natural sites e.g Grand Canyon, around the world and this in winter is stunning and well worth it.
It is a lot of walking and there are heaps of stairs. You have to be cautious on the wooden walkways in winter for ice and snow and in summer for the very large crowds. Don't fall Inas the water is very fast flowing.
Winter is the time to go but make it early as later on it become impassable.
We chose winter as the crowds make this area a difficult place to see and you may not get around in the time allocated due to the crowds.
Ferry ride was nice but their is only one place near it to eat if they have food left. So carry some snacks and water.
Don't miss it if you go to Croatia.

Croatia,oarsnape,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"A wonderful full day out seeing nature at its best. We used Public transport from Zagreb (bus) 6.30am bus to Plitvice Lakes. Entrance B stop was recommended on Trip Advisor so you walk down the waterfalls rather than up the hill . This entrance was also much quieter as all the tourists get off the bus as soon as they can but for an extra couple of minutes on the bus worth it but go very early as it's about a 2 hour trip from Zagreb. It's expensive but worth every penny and I think everyone would agree they have tried to keep the park pristine - it's up to us to keep it that way. I would recommend the day but if you have difficulty walking it may be tricky as the boardwalks are narrow and you have to share them with people coming from the opposite direction but check on-line as they may have some access for people with disabilities.

Our guide from our walking tour in Zagreb was telling us not to go as there would be nothing we could see and that we should return in Summer. However, we decided to stick to plan. On the day of our visit on 4 Dec, the lower lakes were also closed. The paths were frozen, slippery and difficult to walk on. However, our local guide was able to show us the waterfalls from good viewpoints and our family was in awe of how beautiful this place looks in winter. Simply Magnificent! A must see!",Dec 2019
Croatia,herenthere1,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"The park was flooded at the time we bought our tickets but this information was not provided by the website until AFTER we had paid. We bought tickets which allowed admission for 2 days . Luckily for us the lower lakes reopened in the nick of time so we were able to visit them in the rain. The upper lakes were closed. There was zero point going round the lower lakes twice. We asked if we could use the ticket on 2 non-consecutive days instead. No. Absolutely not. We asked to speak to a manager. No. Absolutely not. Basically if the weather keeps you out that's just tough. No flexibility or refunds available.

The lakes are not very accessible. The parking is quite a long walk from the place where the boats and buses go. Even though the bus could get much closer to the car parks it doesn't. The trails on the boardwalks are long and busy. You are only permitted to catch the boat once a per day, it's buses only after that.

It's a shame the administration is so bad because the lakes are very lovely and even with the way things are run it's well worth a visit.

Croatia,Piggogo,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We went on Route C starting at Entrance 1 and spent a good few hours at the beautiful national park. It has a timed entry so we arrived just before our ticket hour and joined the queue. The first part was nice as we could simply follow the directions and walked along the trail and boardwalk. We also branched out to the Veliki Slap (Big Waterfall) but it was not especially impressive to us. Our ticket also included a boat ride and eventually we took the tram back to entrance 1.

One issue we faced was the path is not very wide. There was a section where we were all stuck in a super long queue not knowing what caused it. When we eventually moved forward, it was just because some people stopped in the middle of the path to take jumping shots. It wasted everyone's time cos the background was not even the nicest! Should have walked further down for the real waterfall view.

I think spending 3hrs would be more than sufficient excessive walking meant we find the later part of the scenery repetitive and the lake views look similar to the earlier ones.

Croatia,Adrienne A,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Plitvice is one of the most gorgeous National Parks I've ever been to. There are multiple routes ranging in length, and I did the longer route around all of the lakes and started with the upper lakes. I think its definitely worth a visit, however it was extremely crowded in mid-June. I was hoping for somewhat of a workout but the boardwalks were just packed with people so the pace was definitely more relaxing than a normal hike.The waterfalls are unbelievable and the ferry ride that connects the upper and lower lakes is like being in Jurassic Park. Bring a waterproof coat as it spontaneously broke into hard rain a few times throughout my visit and that seems to be quite normal. I took a 6:00 am bus from Zagreb that went right to both entrance 1 and 2. There is storage for bags at Entrance 2 and then buses that transport visitors to each entrance. I also brought lots of water and a lunch because the line ups for food and drinks were quite long at the picnic area. I booked a room in a guest house about 2 km south of Entrance 2 and just walked there after to rest. There's a small town with a Pizza restaurant and little market that is perfect for overnight supplies.
You must book tickets in advance as they are trying to control crowds. If you just show up it is highly unlikely you will get in.
I would definitely recommend visiting the National Park but would suggest going in the shoulder of the season to get away from the crowds.

It was a beautiful day for a hike! had it been raining or had the trail been wet, the hike would not have been as much fun. The area was well kept and many boarded sidewalks over the water. Very pretty in the fall. If you are in Croatia, it would be a nice stop. We really liked Croatia!",Oct 2019
Croatia,sarainglenwood,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"First, the logistics of getting there. We were on a cruise and were determined to see the park, although we had only 9 hours in port. We combined forces with another couple and were able to secure a van and driver for the day who met us right off the ship, drove us to the park (about 2 hours each way), waited for us, drove us to the Sea Organ in Zadar and then back to the ship in plenty of time. Cost was €45 per person.
The park itself was lovely. Wish we'd been there a week earlier as half the park had just closed for the winter, but the lack of other tourists when we visited more than made up for it. In early November, we experienced the leaves changing color and a high temperature of about 50 degrees F (very pleasant for hiking).
The trails are narrow, and there are many places where one misstep could land you in the water, which would have been a distinct possibility if the trails were as crowded as they looked in some of the pictures. Trails were varied with some dirt, some sandy, some tree stumps placed ends up, some wooden slat and some paved. We did have to step around some selfie-obsessed visitors, but for the most part, we had room to maneuver.
The trails are very well marked, so it was easy to navigate. The boat ride (included with entry fee) was gentle and the line for the boat was so short that we got on the next one without problems. Same for the bus that took us back to the beginning of the trail. The entire walk/boat ride took about three hours, with a stop for lunch at the snack area adjacent to the boat landing. There was food available for purchase, but we had packed our own and there were lots of picnic tables nearby to get off our feet and eat. There were also restrooms close by.
We were able to get through the day without needing any local currency and without standing in the long line of cruise passengers waiting for the lone ATM in the cruise terminal to withdraw Croatian kunas.
The waterfalls are numerous and gorgeous of course, and well worth the trip.

Entrance Two
We arrived at the park at 2:30pm to Entrance Two. It is about a fifteen minute walk from the parking lot to the entrance of the park. Take a ticket when entering the parking lot and pay at the booth on the way out, which is near the park exit. Walk down to P1 (boat dock) and take a quick ride to P2 (boat dock). From there follow the sign to Trail E. This will end at S3 (bus stop) and the tourist information booth. From here you can take the bus back. If you wish to continue walking, take Trail H all the way back to P2 (boat dock) and reverse steps to P1 (boat dock).
By tickets online ahead of time. If you buy a two day pass, only the first day is timed, and the second day you may enter whenever you like. The entire hike will take three to four hours. Great lighting in the late afternoon. The beginning of the hike was very crowded, but most people take a small loop and the crowds thinned out, especially as the afternoon wore on.

Entrance One
We arrived before the park opened, highly recommend.
The walk from the parking lot to the entrance is about five minutes. Start at Trail B, with the Grand Falls, then take P3 (boat dock) to P2 (boat dock) a long relaxing boat ride (option to walk the entire way along lake trail). From P2 (boat dock) take boat across to P1 (boat dock) and walk to S (bus stop) once off bus, short walk back to entrance.

Also - please take a chance to buy tickets in website.

With several trails to take, spend a whole day and do the 4-6 hour trail. You see the lake in its entirety. Theres a cave called Supljara close to entrance A its worth a look and worth the leg burn, you can get some amazing pictures inside and some breathtaking views from the top. Theres a boat half way round to take you across the lake and they have restaurants and souvenir shop and the docks. There are also shuttle buses between starting points. I went in October and the first day was beautiful, sun shining and warm, the second day was raining and over cast but both days provided spectacular pictures, the water is more blue with the sun shining on it but either way your photos will be the envy of many.

Croatia,wendhmagz,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Plitvice Lakes and National Park was the one attraction that I really had been waiting for when I visited Croatia recently and I wasn’t disappointed. The park consists of a series of waterfalls, lakes and streams interspersed with walkways, boardwalks and foot bridges weaving their way around the water. This World Heritage listed park covers 300 square kilometres and has sixteen lakes connected by spectacular waterfalls. The walkways were well signposted and very safe to walk on, and not too many steps. There were shuttle buses available to take us to the starting points of the trails and our hotel in the park, and we toured the largest lake by electric boat. I thoroughly enjoyed my tour of this beautiful park – my only negative comment is that I would have thought there would be more water in the waterfalls than there was at the time of my visit, but maybe it was because my visit was at the end of the summer and there hadn’t been rain for ages. It was still spectacular though, and I highly recommend you visit if you are travelling in Croatia.

Croatia,Graham S,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"You know pretty much what to expect , so some pointers ...
>Tickets can only be bought 2 days ahead of your visit on-line. Otherwise you are doomed to queue.
>Earliest visit works really well ( 7- 9am ) as you often beat the crowds & coach tours of which you will experience somewhere on your trek.
>You can get a bus/train up or back from P2 top station. Many choose to walk downhill but I've got to say its not that onerous walking up to P2 ( as we did )
>If you encounter a conga train of slower visitors ( who inevitably don't adhere to single file is THE WAY ) just determinedly shout "" scusi, scusi"" & push through. This strategy worked well for some athletic lads & we followed this successful method.
> The return to Bottom Lake still leaves you well short of Veliki Slap the Big Waterfall. So now is the time to evaluate how much more time you are going to invest doing the bottom loop. View point #2 is particularly impressive. We bailed on Big Waterfall & walked back to gate2 as the wait for the bus/train was going to take too long.
> We stayed at ""Imperial House"" B&B ( fantastic! )which is only 2 km away. They ""do"" a great breakfast which sets you up for your walk. All cafes in the park are ordinary & busy so prepare in advance.
> RAIN ... we visited in light drizzle rain & apart from donning our anoraks the walk was absolutely great. Might have kept a few of the visitors away.
> If there is an alternative you spot TO AVOID THE CROWDS, go for it.
We visited in mid September & were told the crowds had subsided. Still an issue for us though as it seemed crowded in many spots.

The car park is some distance to walk to the actual park Entry 2 but once there we caught the bus to Entry 1 and immediately walked the Lower sections first, before any tour buses arrived (which is where most people go). We used a map and walked our way around the water features to the main ferry spot and caught the ferry across the Lake back to Entry 2. We then caught the bus to the top of the Upper section and walked our way back down the paths to the Ferry spot and crossed the lake again to Entry 2, where we walked back to the carpark. We only had one day so got here early, planned everything first, did a lot of walking and you can use the ferry and buses as many times as you need, in one direction, included in your ticket. The paths are great, some boardwalks, some solid ground, all safe and easy but lots of walking.

Croatia,Arthur C,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"The lakes of the Plitkivice National Park are truly amazing. The water is unbelievably clear. There are well marked and well made tracks throughout the park -virtually impossible to get lost. But be prepared to walk - good walking shoes and water, and perhaps some rain gear. When I went it was late October and off season. Yet there were still lots of people - especially on the trails of the lower lakes. I can only imagine the crowds there in the Summer.

The park is well run and managed. But, I can't believe they let people bring dogs into a National Park and World Heritage area. It spoilt my enjoyment somewhat, dodging dog poop, and trying to be quiet and listen for birds with yapping dogs - some even off leash.

A great place, but my advice would be to schedule your visit in the off season.

Croatia,Sarah D,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,We were not disappointed by this trip. The lakes were stunning and the views were incredible. It was a lot of walking in one day but so worth it. The park has different routes which are easy to follow. We did the one with a shuttle bus and a boat across the lake. It meant less walking and we saw different views. Was definitely worth visiting and would recommend to anyone.,Nov 2019
Croatia,Meng Kang from Singapore,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"Visited this Plitvice Lakes National Park during my Balkan trip in Oct 2019 . This park is definitely much, much bigger than the Krka National Park. It took about 1-2 hours to walk from the entrance of the park to P3, our designated rest place. Thus, need to wear a pair of comfortable walking shoes. Nice scenery. The lakes look gorgeous and water is clear and pristine. The accompanying trees are also showing different colors. The waterfalls are not as great as compared to pictures seen. But I suspect that this could be due to the fact there had not been any rain for the past few months. A nice twist was after all the walking from the entrance to P3, we took a 15 - 20 mins boat ride on the lakes from P3 to the exit, enjoying the beauty of the park from a different perspective. A wonderful end to my visit to this Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Croatia,bartie2017,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our day trip to Plitvice Lakes on Viator’s Private 8 Hour Tour from Zagreb, Croatia and it was one of the highlights of our European holiday in October. The lakes are spectacular, their colours surreal and we had a unique experience of walking among them on the boardwalks. The walk itself is very manageable because it was later in season and the restrictions recently placed on the numbers entering the national park.
We did the first tier with a pleasant boat ride linking our walk into the second. The initial walk into the lowest level with waterfall is crowded but soon thinned as we moved away.
Our tour guide Hrvoje ( or Kerry as he told us to call him) was friendly and very knowledgeable, gave us space and time for photos and made constructive suggestions throughout the day. The drive itself is long but comfortable in the van and we had a relaxing stop on the way up at the picturesque village of Rastoke. We enjoyed chatting with Hrvoje about life in Croatia and its history including the wars of the 1990s. All this put the wonderland of Plitvice in context. He was an engaging young man who enjoyed promoting his native Croatia.
The one suggestion I would give is pack your own lunch. The takeaway food in the park is awful. But did nothing to tarnish a great day.

Croatia,Richard T,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"The previous reviews adequately sdescribe the Park area. The lake area is smaller than pictures might suggest, however the colours are excellent. Waterfalls are not huge, but numerous so you are rarely outside hearing range of running water. The number of tour groups makes it necessary to be careful when passing visitors as the timber pathways, all in very good condition, have no handrails and it is easy to see how visitors could fall into the water.....which would be good on a hot day. Unfortunately, swimming is prohibited all year.
Definately worth a visit.
There may be issues with people who have mobility concerns, so check before you arrive as to where you can easily access.

We followed the advice of previous reviewers and stayed overnight in the area to reach the park early. Even so, for one reason or the other, it wasn't that early (past 9 am) when we started and it did get crowded as the morning wore on, so we were glad to have made a relatively early start.

Croatia,sunnyclimesCalgary,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I am normally quite fit and strong, but I injured my hamstring while on holiday just 5 days before our scheduled visit to the park. As a result, I was walking very slowly and with a limp (but without crutches, canes or a wheelchair). We had pre-purchased tickets and had a rental car booked, so we were definitely going to go to the park! Extremely glad that we did. The waterfalls are gorgeous, the colour and clarity of the lakes are amazingly beautiful. Fall foliage colours were a bonus. Going in the off season is great from the crowd perspective; most visitors were in groups of 2 or so, plus a few group tours that we let go by us. Tips: car parking is quite a distance from the entrance if you're slow like I was, so best to get dropped off near the road while your companions park the car. There is a pedestrian walkway over the road, with stairs up and down; this can be difficult, but so can trying to cross the road against traffic! I can't speak to the waterfalls in the rest of the park, but we did circuit A and saw the big waterfall and many others, and felt quite well rewarded for our efforts. This requires walking a lot of steps, stairs, and boardwalks. There are often no railings to hold for balance, so I was glad my daughter could help me occasionally. Water and snacks are good to have. PS the coffee in the snack bar is meh!

From pratical perspective - wear comfortable shoes, prepare water, if claiming the stairs, could get quite hot. At places near water - slippery. And in the morning - be ready for lot of asian groups visiting the park, so can get a bit crowded on the narrow paths.
The park and lakes are very beautiful. Blue and clear water, nice nature, waterfalls, gorges, walking trails - all you want for an active relaxing. You can walk, relax and eat something, take a boat.

Croatia,Rosie-holidaylover,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"This park is truly magical and if you have an opportunity, would strongly recommend visiting. We chose to visit in autumn when the trees would be changing colour and to avoid the peak periods in summer.

I would suggest purchasing a two day ticket - note that you will need to stipulate a one hour period in which you will enter the park and specify the entrance. They are pretty strict about this - do not be late and if you think you will be, contact them as early as you can to see if you can negotiate a later time. You will probably not be able to vary the day of your ticket.

On the first day visit later in the afternoon after about 3.30pm and enter through Entrance 1 as you can spend a couple of hours at the lower lakes and the Big Waterfall. Hopefully there will not be too many people there.

On the following morning endeavour to get there at the opening time of 8am as the hordes from the tour buses arrive about 9am. Enter through Entrance 2 and traverse Route H (they estimate between 4-6 hours for this). I also don't think this a route that the tourist groups take. The upper lakes were actually our favourite parts as they are so different to anything we have seen before and, at that time of the morning were virtually empty - you could even hear the birds!

After that take the boat across the lakes from P2 to P3 and spend some more time looking at the Big Waterfall and lower lakes again in the morning light.

You can then either take the bus back from Stop 1 to Stop 2 or walk back.

We took water and snacks with us but did buy a coffee mid morning - the prices for the coffee and food was very reasonable.

The Lakes are stunning but try and at least spend some of your time when there are not too many other people around. We found battling with tour groups who insisted on walking two abreast, almost forcing us off the path annoying. Also seeing people threatening the ecology by stepping off the paths to get photographs and in one case, so their child could urinate most upsetting (ignoring all of the signs and information saying not to do this!). I did mention to one guy on our first visit and another lady they next day that they should not be moving off the path but she ignored me and there was quite a few people doing it, so gave up in the end. I do think the guides should be more in control of their groups and insist that they walk single file and also not to stray from the path but they just didn't seem to care. In the end we put in our ear buds and tried valiantly to ignore them.

Wear sturdy shoes and layers of clothing because it can be chilly later in the evening and early in the morning.

This is a must do experience if you are in Croatia.

Croatia,A Y M,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"A difficult review to make, since the park is a natural wonder and truly world class. By all means, tourists to Croatia really should visit Plitvice. However, two things made our visit somewhat disappointing. 1. The crowds even in early October were annoying and at times made walking on boardwalks risky. Clearly, one should never go in the even more crowded peak months of July and August. 2. Photos on the internet will unrealistically raise your expectations of the park. While it is certainly a stunning park, many of the promotional photos were clearly taken using drones, and during early evening hours when regular visitors would not be allowed. So the photos you as a tourist can take from the viewpoints open to the public and in the lighting available will not be anywhere near as impressive.

At the moment the big waterfall walk is still overrun from about 10-3. It’s short so easily done at 4pm or even later if you are prepared to walk back along the shore (boats stop at 5:30 at Pier 3). Really I though the distant view from the high walk from gate 1 then down through the cave was better than the scrum at the bottom of the falls. Walks E and H outdid this in beauty for me.
This does really rate as a life experience but probably give the big falls extension a miss as it brings out the worst in everyone.

We were here mid-September and although cloudy, and a bit showery, it cleared and was stunningly spectacular! Cloudy days allow better photos anyway. Turquoise waters, steep gorges, clear water in the calmer lakes and dense forests. The constant noise of fast flowing water can be quite loud, but the lakes offer a calmer and more serene environment, that is equally as beautiful.

We took route H, which was supposed to be 4-6 hours. It will never take you so long, unless you take picture in every step you take. For us it was 3 hour hike and instead of train in the last section, we decided to walk. It added 45 minutes or so. Definitely take the walk, it was the most uncrowded part of our hike.

I would recommend coming during a slower season. I came in mid October, which is already not peak season, but found it a little like being herded around because everyone was taking so many photos.

The lower lakes had the best view, the upper lakes were alright but if you were short on time I would skip it. The sections were confusing so since we entered through Entrance 2, we just followed everyone else and took the boat to Port 1 and from Port 1 directly to the waterfalls. When you got off the boat, just follow the path and after you reach the tall waterfall and took pictures, go up to the gate of entrance 1. From entrance 1 you can catch the shuttle bus to upper lakes, you would have to walk around 1.5 hours to finish upper lakes, from the point where you get off from the bus, follow the path and the sign until you reach Port 1 where the boats are, that's the end point for upper lakes.

But do be very careful with the timing, we entered the park at around 11am, and got to upper lakes at around 3, we were cutting it close. The shuttle bus closed at 5 and the last boat ride closed at 6 so watch out for the timing otherwise you wouldn't be able to take the boat back to the entrance.

Croatia,Ljubica B,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Is my 3rd time in Plitvice and I’m always fascinated and happy..... this place recharge my energy and my inner peace

The cost of the ticket online was 100 kunas. You print your ticket and go.

They might give you specific times to pick your entrance .... but all was easy and straight forward.

Better buy online tickets or you might not find tickets later on at the door due the amount of people that comes everyday.

Inside you have some restaurant to relax have coffee or tea.
Wear comfortable shoes and bring water and a camera 😍

The toilets are free and clean

Croatia,JanKnee,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"The park is stunning and the thought and planning that went into the place and keeping it pristine is very evident. Try your very best to go when there are fewer people.

Because you're required, and rightly so, to stick to the narrow pathways, you have to deal with the crowds. If you're a patient, tolerant person, you'll be frustrated. If you're clueless and do whatever you want with little thought to others, you'll be fine. So, take up space, use your elbows to ensure that those who choose to walk abreast of each other are forced to walk single file. Keep repeating ""coming through"" when someone stops to take a picture without warning. If it's raining, wear a helmet to protect your eyes from the endless series of umbrellas that thoughtless people will shove in your face.

Croatia,David O,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Visited Plitvice during the last week of September. Bought tickets directly from the NP website which is the cheapest and easiest method. Did not have to exchange tickets on day of arrival, simply showed them the ticket on my phone and was admitted into the park. We selected the 9:00 am tour but even for the last week of September it was more crowded than I had anticipated. The 8:00 am entrance would have been a better selection with less crowds. We walked the entrance 1 C trail as suggested on this site. The trail is designed through the woods and over the lakes. In many cases there are wooden walkways about 3 feet wide that you walk over during the hike. Numerous waterfalls and the beautiful lakes are enjoyable and the walk was not that strenuous. Enjoying the Park can be easily accomplished in roughly 4 hours depending on how many pictures you take or how many times you just stop to admire the scenery. It was a warm day and we did not need jackets, fleece etc and glad we did not have to include them in our packs. Definitely worth visiting. The parking was easy and they charged a couple of dollars to park. When we were through, the parking lot was filled with buses so glad we were able to get in before the masses.

We had to be up at 6.45am as coach picked us up at 7.45am and returned back at our hotel just before 11pm. Over 12 hours on a coach and only 3 hours at the lakes. As it was an organised excursion by Tui i don't think we saw all of the areas and it was very crowded ( we went on Friday last Tui tour ) I enjoyed it once there but the big waterfall was a bit of a let down. Better to plan trip to lakes yourself rather than an excursion as i think you will see more and it will be at your time not Tui. Beautiful area,beautiful lakes with clear water .",Oct 2019
Croatia,JB238,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I strongly recommend you obtain your tickets before you arrive as you may not be able to get in when you want, if you just show up and buy a ticket on the day. At the time we visited they only let people in at the time shown on their tickets i.e you couldn’t get in before 10am if thou had a 10am ticket - it helps with crowd management in the park.
A map of the place is available to purchase from the gift shop - if you want to know where you are going / where you are, I would recommend this small investment. Although the routes are all well marked in the park, you may not know exactly where you are without a map.
We opted for the longest route as we had all day at the national park - sections that are not part of the more travelled shorter routes are much quieter. The paths / walkways are all well maintained. Unfortunately because of the popularity it can get a bit congested at certain sections and progress is slow because the pathways are not that wide - you just need to take in the scenery and enjoy.

Ariel photos of the waterfalls in my opinion are exagerated and while it was intereresting with beautiful clear water in the lakes teaming with fish and various small waterfalls I have experienced better.

Croatia,Anuj_Mithani,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"The park is an outstanding experience in the lap of nature. We had pre-booked our tickets online were the first to arrive at Entrance 1 as park gates opened at 7am - we avoided the tourist groups for much of the day. We followed Route C which involves a walk through the Lower Lakes, a boat trip across Lake Kojak, a walk through Upper Lakes and a bus back to the start. This involved about 5 hours of slow paced walking to admire the beauty and serenity around you and take countless pictures. Route C via Entrance 1 is a good idea as the waterfalls always face you in the front. We also detoured through the cave (a strenuous climb) to get to the panoramic viewpoints over Slap Virje - a highly recommended effort. A must do experience !

Just some observations : the online ticketing feature has a few quirks - the tab for the entrances isn't obvious, and several travellers seem to have erroneously bought entrance 1 tickets by default without realising you need to click right for entrance 2. Also once you've bought tickets, we saw three links in Croatian (even though the flow selected was English) - one of which allowed us to download the actual tickets themselves (we carried the A4 printouts and showed them at the gate). The automated email with tickets seems erratic. And finally, the ""peak"" admission fees of 250kn for a morning visit earlier applicable to the busy period July-August, now seems to have been (sigh!) extended to June and September as well - certainly steep in my opinion, but happy to contribute disproportionately to the parks upkeep.

I think we went around the right time of year, because although it was busy it was manageable and there were even times when we found ourselves alone for a few minutes. Also the leaves were changing colour and this was beautiful!

Croatia,ANDREW W,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Stayed at Lower Lakes which is really close to a quiet entrance which is useful. If using this entrance walk the high path further around to the top of the Biggest Falls before you return to descend the steep steps leading to the entrance, because you won't want to climb back! An absolute pleasure with dramatic scenery, massive falls of all heights, some more gentle than others. Huge amount of flora and fauna, fish and bird life. x16 sections of Falls covering several kms, beautifully managed walkways make the visit quite easy and choose between short, medium or long walks. We did long and most people could manage this. There's also a 'train' to bring you back. Might be hard going on a hot day but don't overdress if it's cool.

One doesn’t really get the views that appear on promotional brochures - because such pictures are taken from strategic points - either from hard to access points with no crowd or from a helicopter - but still what we do get to see is pretty. The walking path is somewhat narrow with lots of people - this is somewhat off putting.

Croatia,Tammy T,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"This place is a must-do for first time visitors in Croatia. We arrived on a Monday a little before noon (12:00 PM ticket time) with dark clouds looming above and the threat of heavy rain and thunderstorm. Good thing the weather held up and didn't rain until we left. Maybe it was because of the threat of rain but the park itself wasn't as crowded as I thought. The water color is beautiful and stunning, the waterfalls itself weren't that big (I'm told the waterfalls are bigger in May) but it was definitely a very enjoyable walk. We took the B loop which is just the lower falls and includes a boat ride and a bus ride. The bus ride was pretty bad though, there was no line in particular and when the bus came, everyone just squeezed onto the bus standing room only. We were lucky enough to grab a seat but I can imagine how uncomfortable it is to stand on a very packed bus (think rush hour traffic commute style). Maybe they should run more buses so people aren't packed like sardines inside, especially since there are many bigger tour groups. Overall, I'm so glad we visited, this place is definitely a must do especially for first-timers. Not sure if I would come back again since it can potentially get very crowded.

Croatia,Ken S,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Plitvice Lakes National Park has hikes options for all. This is a not to miss stop on any trip to Croatia.
My advice, is to get ticket in advance online. When you choose an entrance time online ticket is good 15 minutes early, and up to 1 15 min later. Start as early as you can in morning to avoid crowds, and tour buses. We started from Entrance 1 and that worked great. After walking the wooden walkways through the 7 lakes and so many beautiful waterfalls, enjoying the serene walk along the lake with other park guests. There are places to get water, and food in the park. In addition, we decided to take the less well known hiking trails. The hiking trails were well marked and added an additional dimension of hiking in the woods and meadows and seeing beautiful nature without any crowds. For those with energy or for those looking for more than 4 hours of hiking, this was a great finish to our visit to the national park.

Croatia,Amber H,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,"Sadly more negatives than positives for this place .granted it was a Saturday but was out of season so didn't think it would be anywhere near as busy as it was.

Pros
- the boardwalks are beautiful and look really cool when you can see them
-the waterfalls are nice but not spectacular
-you might get a tiny chance to take a beautiful photo but it is very rare that you wont get someone else in it

Negatives

- the board walks basically consist of traffic going one way, traffic going another way and then a queue of people that have stopped to admire/take photos. Everybody is just moving slowly along like in a cattle market
- in some places you can't even stop to admire the view (let alone take a photo) as theres that many people behind and in front that you would just get shoved off the boardwalk into the water
- you start off trying to be polite and waiting until people have taken their photos before you walk past but you soon realise that nobody does that for you
- sheer volume of people makes it dangerous /frustrating/ time consuming
- I feel like a numpty for saying this seen as though it contradicts the rest of the reviews but the trails are tricky to follow and some of the time it has you doubling back on yourself.
- you've either got to choose your timeslot 2 days in advance or wing it on the day. We were travelling from dubrovnik so had no idea what time we would be there, so decided to wing it on the day. Luckily we got some of the last few tickets for the time slot .

- crammed on to the boats like sardines , we couldn't see any of the view for the people stood in front and at the side of us

Mostly our bad experience was just down to how many people are allowed in. I probably wouldn't go again , but at least it's been ticked off the list.

Croatia,Denise,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"I wanted to add a little bit more to the review that was written from the driver from split. We drove from Dubrovnik. Almost a 5 Hour Drive. You do have to show your passport during the drive as you are crossing into another country. Also, when you get to a toll booth just push the button to get a ticket (we too thought we had to pay at the toll but no one is manning the booth). Try to remember where you are when you pick up the ticket because you may be asked (we could not remember and the person at the last tollbooth could not read our ticket). The ride is quite windy from Dubrovnik until you get to the Highway (about 2 hours into the drive). If you don’t like heights, curvy roads, bridges, and long tunnels, you may want to re-consider the drive.

Croatia,The Plumber,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I'm writing this review because I want to let you know how to drive to Plitvice from Split. My journey started on a Sunday morning at 6:30 am. I followed my Waze GPS map thinking it was going to be a piece of cake drive. I was excited to learn that there was a toll road which would cut off 40 minutes. Well, when I got to the toll booth 3 were working. But no one was inside. I freaked out because I was driving a large van with manuel for first time. I could not get the gate to open because I thought you paid the toll like in USA and drive on. It turns out , you push the white button and a ticket comes out and you drive to the end of your toll destination and pay at the end with a credit card. Because I made. U turn in the middle of the Toll road, I ended up taking the slow and backroad to Plitvice. It was very windy, hilly, but extraordinary beautiful. It is a dangerous farm road, but you get to see all of Croatia. I would only recommend this drive to experience drivers and during the day. DO NOT drive this at night. It took me 4 hours to get to Plitvice. I did get to see the town of Knin, which is where the center of the Bosnia War started. I hope this helps everyone.

Croatia,chucklingstarfish,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Visiting these lakes was an absolute delight. I drove down from Zagreb on 31 August and whilst I arrived as the park opened (per my ticket booking), I wish I’d had more time as I would have loved to do more trails than I did despite covering a lot of ground. The lakes are as blue if not clearer than the photos you see and are simply spectacular!

The hints you see about booking early and ensuring you are not late for your window are true. Plus as the day goes on it gets hot - very hot, even at the beginning of September – so ensure you have enough water if you are planning on even doing a shorter walk.

I think the advice to wear closed in shoes is possibly a bit over cautious. The boardwalks are well maintained and I wore Teva sandals and was fine (waterproof and good grip underneath). However, ladies no matter how many Instagram photos you plan on taking, I wouldn’t recommend anything with a heel.

Speaking of Instagram, we all want beautiful photos but please keep in mind that just because you bought a ticket, it doesn’t mean you own the park. The boardwalks aren’t wide and if you’re holding up the flow of traffic and hogging a great photo spot, you’re simply being selfish, so please keep others in mind and share the beautiful spaces 😊

The only issue with our visit (which is completely unavoidable but just something to prepare for) is the amount of people on the trails. We visited Plitvice Lakes in mid September, and it was hard to navigate the board walks with the amount of people also enjoying the views. So, I can’t imagine how busy this park gets during peek season. Just something to keep in mind. Although this park is absolutely gorgeous, if you are looking for a peaceful nature hike away from crowds and tourists; this is not the place.

Croatia,Tbasche,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Such a beautiful and unique natural park unlike anywhere we have seen.
So many waterfalls and you walk on a wooden walkway right over rushing streams and waterfalls. You have to go here when in Croatia.

Tips :
1. Buy tickets in advance, and not the day before. You must have tickets to go in and it gets sold out if u wait and try and buy tickets day of.
2. Be there ready to walk at 9Am or earlier. This beats the crowds. By 10am at the start its packed. We began at 9am and it was lovely.
3. You can do a 1 hour loop a 3 hour loop and a 9 hour loop. We did the 1 hour loop and lived it saw tons of waterfalls rode the boat across the lake etc.
4. While the wooden walkways are reasonably flat the walk Down to the pier is steep amd a zillion steps. It's a 20 minute walk to the pier to take the boat to the walkway.
5. To us entrance 2 is way less crowded and same sights.

I recommend you do some research before going, buy your admission ticket on-line (roughly $35), and wear hiking boots or a trail shoe. I wore soft soled Sketchers and on the rocky/rooted paths I felt it underfoot. Most of the trail is on a slightly uneven boardwalk so you have to watch your step. Arrive when the park opens for the least crowds to take photos w/o people in them. I started from Entrance 1 and the light was just right the entire day. By 15:00 there was too much sun and shadow for good photos, especially at the lower lakes.

The car parking was easy, and we walked straight in the entrance (with our pre-booked tickets) without having to queue. The park was so quiet and peaceful - we enjoyed the magnificent views. We walked all of route C, and for a lot of the time it felt like we had the place to ourselves. We walked an extra section after finishing route C as found that if you're hiking at a decent pace you can get round in 2.5 hours instead of 4-6. The boat ride was lovely, and we took a picnic lunch to eat to avoid the pricey park food. By the time we left at 1pm it was much busier, lots of tour groups arriving, so if you have the chance to stay nearby and go early, it will be the best experience you have in Croatia! Entrance is a little high but we thought the park was beautifully maintained, safe and well sign-posted.

Croatia,TravellerJJS,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"Hiking the lakes is an amazing experience with a couple codicils. If I had it to do again, I would try and plan my visit and buy a 2 day ticket online (much simpler) then I would plan on doing the lower lakes early morning one day and upper lakes early morning next day taking afternoons to explore other activities. The reason is that the paths and boardwalks are crazy crowded from early afternoon on making it a much less pleasurable experience. If we had to do both upper and lower lakes in one day (which is doable utilizing boat and/or bus), I suggest doing lower lakes early morning then upper as they seem to be less crowded. A boat ride from bottom of the lower lake to bottom of the upper lake is available one way included with your ticket. Alternatively, a bus runs both ways with 3 stops, one stop at top of upper lakes, one at bottom of lower lakes and one in the middle. Quite amazing and worth the visit if you’re a nature lover.

We were there in August which is a very busy time. Consequently there were too many people walking the boardwalks, which made it hard to stop and admire the scenery.
Once we had completed the walk, we managed to find out way back to the bus stop where there was a queue 90 metres long. We waited for over 1 hour to get a bus out of the park, all the time choking on cigarette smoke from inconsiderate people also waiting in line.

Croatia,Peta M,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I would highly recommend taking this tour through Gray Line Tour company.
What a fabulous tour leader Peter is . He made the whole day extremely interesting. Peter was helpful, gave us lots of information and the tour was amazing. Great value for money. A must if you go to Croatia.
Make sure you wear your walking shoes and take a warm jumper just in case it turns cool. We had beautiful sunshine throughout the day. Lots of walking and steps with fabulous scenery and waterfalls",Sep 2019
Croatia,Rachael T,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"After some research we decided staying near to the Flora entrance over night would be the best way to visit the park. No tickets are sold at the Flora entrance so we bought our 2 day tickets online before we went and printed them out. We arrived at our hotel in the middle of the afternoon and were advised to walk down to the park and to enter down the steps at the big waterfall where we could visit the lower lakes. We went in towards the end of our time slot of 3pm-4pm as most people were leaving so we had a nice relaxing and quiet visit. The next morning after breakfast we drove to Flora entrance where we parked for free. After showing our ticket to the guy in the booth we jumped on the first boat to the upper lakes. It was early and the upper lakes were practically empty for the first 3 hours. I got lots of pictures of empty boardwalks and stairways with waterfalls and the light fell perfectly on the falls. After our picnic lunch we decided to go around the lower lakes again before we left and it was horrendous I’ve never seen anywhere so overcrowded before. It was just a procession of people shuffling along unable to move or look properly for fear of falling into the water. Not a pleasant experience. I’m so glad we had already been the evening before when it was quiet. My five stars is for the beauty of the place and for our morning and evening experiences, if we’d only been in the middle of the day I would have given only 1 star.

Conclusion:
We made the right move buying and printing the tickets in advance as we didn’t have to queue up anywhere - you can choose tickets for either entrance 1 or entrance 2 when you buy online they are both OK to use at Flora which is very quiet and has free parking - I would highly recommend using this entrance.
At Flora if you walk left along the road, instead of right past the booth towards the boat, at the T junction there is a path into the woods on the right overlooking the lakes. There are some spectacular views from this path and at the end there are steps that take you straight down to the big falls.
Avoid the middle of the day when coach trips are there, it’s awful! Early morning and late afternoon visits are much pleasanter experiences.
The toilets in the park are only at the entrances, boat stops and land train stops so there is a fair distance to walk with no toilets especially at the upper lakes so go when you see one!
Comfortable shoes are a must as there’s lots of walking.

Croatia,SteveByfleet,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Spectacular views and superb walks make visiting a pleasure. The walkways are often wooden boardwalks and can be slippery so be prepared but still worth the visit.

The walking routes are well marked providing you keep to the lettered walks. the numbered walks and not marked on the routes at all so difficult to tell if you are actually doing them. However this does not detract from the beauty of the place itself",Sep 2019
Croatia,Bingzz,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"When in Croatia you must visit Plitvice Lakes. I visited during Mid September and the weather was still fairly nice.

My husband and I had a rental car, so we drove and parked at Entrance 1. You take a ticket at the barrier and then pay for the parking at the pay station just before you go leave.

We had booked our park tickets online the week before travelling - we booked for 8am entry, but didn’t get to the park until around 8.30am. I think the tickets allow entry within the hour from the specified time, so you don’t have to worry if you’re a little late for your entry time.

We decided to do trail C - this was a mix of walking, boat ride and bus ride. It took around 4 hours in total - this included waiting for the boat/bus and a stop off at the cave.

The views are amazing and the waters are so clear. It was a bit weird to see the fish hovering around where people are standing, but kinda cool at the same time! We also saw a snake in the water.. eek!

It wasn’t too busy during the time we visited, however it got very busy as we were leaving the park around 1pm. I would suggest visiting early - no later than 8am. Even earlier if you visit during peak times (summer holidays). It can get a bit scary walking on the boardwalks when it gets busy - as there’s only really enough space for two people standing side by side. There aren’t any railings either to stop you from falling into the water! One lady sat down to take a photo, and when she got up she fell backwards - luckily she fell back onto me and my husband was holding me... otherwise she/we would have fallen into water!

Allow a full day visit to this park and don’t rush it. Arrive early and enjoy the views! Wear layers in case it rains or gets cold - it can be a bit chilly if you visit early in the morning. Don’t forget hiking shoes or boots either - the gaps in the boardwalks can be quite big at times. Do not wear flip flops or heels!

Croatia,Jessi L,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"There’s nothing quite like this place and it is a must see! The water is a as beautiful as all the pictures, crystal clear, full of cute fish, and waterfalls around every corner with one more stunning than the next. The miles of boardwalks allow you to take in the entire park and add to the magical feel of this place. There are boats and buses to help the less adventurous get to the far edges of the park. We didn’t use these options but for the right guest they’d be very helpful. The other amazing thing I feel obligated to mention is that I didn’t see one piece of trash throughout the entire park! Thank you fellow guests and Croatian caretakers for keeping this space so lovely! The only drawback here is the sheer number of people. After about 9:00 a.m it’s like a cruise ship unloaded along the main boardwalks. It’s shoulder to shoulder with everyone trying to get the best selfie and there’s nothing to do but wait. Just be mentally prepared for the crowd. You can get a reprieve from the craziness by hiking towards the upper lakes. Those trails are much less traveled and still just as beautiful. We hiked 15 miles and there was still more to explore!

Croatia,Dawn1897,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"It is such a scenic place! Really cool walking on the boards over the lakes and waterfalls. Easily spend all day here or even more (I spent 2 days). Whichever walking route you chose you will enjoy the scenery. It is a busy place, the crowds did spoil it a bit for me and you cant walk at your own pace as difficult to get passed people on the narrow boards. Whenever you stop to take a picture you are in everyone's way! Despite this still 100% worth visiting. Maybe the crowds not such an issue in winter? Be prepared for all weather even in summer I got 2 very different days (1 raining and cold and 1 sunny). Much colder than Split. Easy to get buses or drive there, I chose bus option couldnt have been easier.",Sep 2019
Croatia,fancoischarest,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"My biggest tip for anyone who wants to go to Plitvice is to arrive as early as possible. If you, like my GF and I, choose the option of the 4-6 hours visit you might start not liking the end as much as the beginning. We choosed the Entrance 2 instead of 1 because it was on our way and also because we haven't bought our tickets in advance. The entrance 2 tends to have less people. We enjoyed the park a lot, it's so amazijg and the water so beautiful and clear. We started at 8am our tour and it was a rainy day, still beautiful, and for the first 2.5 hours it was very pleasant as there was not a lot of people. The last 1.5 hours was getting crowded.
What you need to know : you can make the tour from either entrance 1 or 2.. but in the end it's the same walk, just in opposite direction... so the more the day advance the more people you cross on the same path.. and some people are walking side by side while there's only place for 2 people in width on the path. It can gets very annoying. The price and the visit is totally worth it but save yourself some frustration and arrive as early as you can!

We arrived in the parking area (practically alleys in the forest) late (it was dark) and luckily we had the GPS coordinates of the car to find it. We were late because we waited almost 2 hours for the bus to take us from station 3 to station 1.
Book in advance and get there early because there are endless queues at ferries and buses",Aug 2019
Croatia,weejake2,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I know a lot of people say that this attraction is crowded but if you do it right you can avoid the crowds, just go the opposite way from everyone else!
This is how the park works:-
Entrance 1
Entrance 2
P1 - boat stop
P2 - boat stop
P3 - boat stop
ST1 - bus stop 1
ST2 - bus stop 2
ST3 - bus stop 3
There are 2 entrances to the park, entrance one and entrance 2, however there is also another unofficial way into the park which is near to P3 boat stop. We were advised to buy a ticket for entrance 1 but to enter the park at the unofficial entrance. Our b&b host told us to go to the gate for P3 and get our tickets validated and then enter the park at the nearby viewpoint for the waterfalls.
We stayed at Plitvice Falls Cottage, a 15 minute walk from this unofficial entrance. We walked to the desk at P3, showed the guy our tickets and then walked away from the desk back towards the main road, turning right. Just about 5 minutes along the road on the right are some viewpoints which give you amazing views of the best waterfalls in the park and you can watch all the hundreds of tourists walking about below.
Once you've had a chance to view the waterfalls, head down the steps into the park keeping the waterfall on your left and follow the boardwalk across to the other side of the lake towards ST1 (it's all signposted) which is the first bus stop. It is a bit crowded to start with but you soon leave this section and you start walking against the crowds. It thins out into a much quieter walk.
Once you get to ST1 you can catch the bus to ST2 or you can just keep walking. We decided to walk to ST2 and again this part of the walk was quiet and it was a really beautiful walk with lots of waterfalls and beautiful pools.
Once at ST2 we caught the bus to ST3 as its quite a walk but again you can walk it if you want. This walk basically takes you along one side of the entire length of the lakes.
Once we got to ST3 we did a beautiful walk around the other side of the lake, following signs for P2. This took a few hours to do but again it was quiet and stunning. Once at P2 we hopped on the boat and took it to P1, on the opposite side of the river. It’s a short 2 minute boat ride but we had to go it as there were no toilets or other amenities at P2. Once we’d had our toilet stop we hopped back on the boat back to P2. We had to do this to get back to P3 because you can’t go from P1 to P3, you can only go from P2 to P3.
Once we got to P3, rather than head back home, we decided to walk around this side of the lake for about an hour. It is very quiet, with few people on the trails as there aren’t any waterfalls or pools. It’s much more like walking around the lochs of Scotland but with beautiful blue clear water.
The whole day took us just about 9 hours, including a lunch and cuppa stop but there are maps showing you different routes with different timings and they are all easy to follow as they are well signposted.
If you choose to come in at entrance 1 or 2 then be ready for the queues and the big bus tours of people on the boardwalks.
Big tip, buy your tickets online in advance and choose the time you want to enter, although if you go in at the unofficial entrance then the time doesn’t matter. You don’t need to print your tickets, just show them on your phone. Don’t go in at the unofficial entrance without a ticket though as you will get asked to show it when you want to go on the bus or boat or as you pass by one of the official entrances.

I hope this helps.

Croatia,JChua,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"Our tour had started at about 8.30am. Our driver & guide, Franco (sp?) from Getyourguide.com then went to 2 more hotels to pick up another 2 couples, so we are a group of 6 in a minivan - nice & comfy.

The drive to Rastoke village was about 2 hours but we spent only 15 mins there. Then, its a short drive to the National Park, where our tour starts at 12noon. Entrance is 250 kunas, cheaper if you enter after 3pm. Lunch was , however, at 2.20pm and there was no break in between the walk of about 13.5km (someone in our group had worn a monitoring watch.) The walk was fast paced but mostly on flat grounds (thank goodness), even though the poor lady who was wearing the monitor watch had trouble keeping up from time to time

Although the scenery is very nice & tranquil, water very clear and turquoise in colour so much so we could see carps, trouts and pikes swimming in the lakes. We visited on a Monday and it was quiet, but someone in our group had visited on a Sunday but was turned away. So try weekdays instead if you must go.

In my humble opinion, even if you are as fit as us, the scenary is not worth all the hard work, expanse & time. To us, the Vintgar Gorge near Lake Bled in Slovenia was much much smaller but no less beautiful!!! The tour ended about 7pm and it was thus a very long day of about 11 hours. Are the blisters on my feet and aching on my legs worth it - in my opinion, certainly NO!

There was a very small line and we only had to share the park with a few people. By 10am though the lines were huge and there were people everywhere. The boardwalks were completely full.

Croatia,Rhonda A,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I bought tickets for 8:00 am and the day was overcast with rain in the forecast for the morning. We left at 12 noon and it was brightening with the possibility of sun and I can honestly say I was glad we went in the am with clouds over a nicer afternoon with the horde of tourists that we saw on the walkways as we left. Entering at 8 we had periods of time where we saw just a few people and took plenty of photos with no people to jockey around. We spent the night before at the Miric Inn nearby and so glad we did so we had easy access to the park. Even without the sun, the park was beautiful and well worth seeing. It felt like being in a fairyland. The cloud cover did not produce the amazing blue quality in the lakes as it needs the reflection but we still saw some amazing color nevertheless. We only planned on a five days in Croatia so I wasn’t sure we should add this park to the itinerary but very happy we did! Very different from the Dalmatia part of Croatia and I highly suggest this be a part of your trip.

Croatia,FrankNamibia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Incredibly clear water lakes, waterfalls, rapids, lush vegetation - a must for every outdoor fan. If you planned your vacation in Croatia to exclude the north you are missing out a big one - this park alone is worth a trip from Split. BUT BE WARNED - we arrived at 9h30, and there were tourist bus crowds already jamming the walkways. Arrive at opening time 9h00 sharp or earlier, this gives you better views and you miss the queues and traffic jams all over.
ALSO bring solid hiking shoes, the walkways are not paved, full of rocky edges and you will walk quite some time on wooden log walkways over water, can be slippery at times. So sneakers or running shoes not your best bet.
We did Tour C in about 3 hours, but felt that the tour is longer but not much extra to see. Unless you are a fitness fanatic, tour B suffices completely.
But what a fantastic experience, pity that it was overcast, almost misty. Try to pick a sunny day for your visit.

Croatia,Davide M,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"As many other reviews mention, this park is very nice.
Having said that, this was the most expensive walk I have ever taken in my life. For the two of us, between entrance tickets and parking (n ot to mention the petrol and time to get there from Opatija) it cost about €80.00.
The place is crawded and the pats are narrow and not well mantained. Security features are not existent and the different pats to choose from for the hikes are poorely signed and timed.
We have decided to go for path B which, according to the signs at the entrance of the park was going to take between 3 to 4 hours. Well, it was a 45 minutes affair which was a nighhtmare to follow as it was poorely sign posted.
We have then went for path C, pretty much same story. Longer walk but, again, a nightmare to follow the signs for it.

Conclusions, I have never paid before to visit a national park or to see a couple of lakes and I will most definetely won't do it again.
I wish I had spent these money for a nice meal instead.

Croatia,Abhishek Shah,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I would give 6 stars if it was allowed.

Make sure you book in advance. I think you need to do it at least 2 days in advance. They allow a limited number of people every hour so it’s worth it. And you can skip the long line at the entrance.

We entered at entrance 1. Then walked up to the point where you board the electric boats. I think this trail is the “lower lakes” and they are the most beautiful part of the the park. You can then take the electric boat (included in the ticket) across to the upper lakes. The bus “scenic train” back to entrance 1 is also free. The upper lakes are not as nice but still lovely. It all depends on how much time you want to spend and how much you want to walk. We spent about 5 hours in the park and walked about 13km including about 30 flights of stairs.
If you do only the lower lakes it would be about half that.
You cannot come to Croatia and miss this.

Be prepared to have alot of patience though because it's very crowded on narrow paths and feels like no one has any manners. The biggest downfall and my biggest problem is the smoking. It's a lovy place so you want to sit outside. Every table smokes and the benches are very large which can fit 6 people on, however if your a couple and there is just the 2 of you people will naturally sit on the bench as well but why cant they smoke els where... if there are non smokers why should they be subjected to other people's second hand smoke.

Like do you really need to take a selfie in front of every single body of water?! surely life is more important than getting that perfect Instagram...

My daughter bought the tickets online a couple if days prior to our visit. We had a schedule set in place. Plitvice was for the 25 of June.
Finally, on the 25th, we arrived at Plivitce and we were surprised to find out that my daughter had bought the tickets for 27th of June. They would not let us enter. I went to customer service and asked her to change the dates but she told me there was nothing she could do and to send an email to support.
So here I was stuck knowing I had spent approximately $100 on day passes but couldn’t use them and our trip wouldn’t allow us to return in two days, we were driving south. So what else could I do????
I purchased the tickets again and spent another $100 or so to get in the park.

I wrote an email to the support division about the situation but never heard back.
The park was beautiful, something to see for sure but the customer service....terrible!
I can’t believe they wouldn’t refund me and actually suggested I try and sell my tickets online.

I would never say to anyone not to visit Plitvice Lakes but you should be aware that there will be a lot of people with you. Heavens only knows what it is like in the high season. We actually discovered a little place about 15 mile up the road in the wonderfully named town of Slunj, It was called Rastoke watermills and cost 40 kuna to enter compared with 250 kuna for Plitvice Lakes. Much smaller but a delightful series of small waterfalls and clear water, which was part of the Slunjika River which falls over a waterfall into the bigger Koruna River, There are also old water mills that used to be used to make flour and a small museum. Best of all there were no people!! There was also an old wooden tavern near by where you could have trout freshly caught from the river, absolutely delicious.

Croatia,conrad9999,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"Stunning, beautiful etc etc.
We were only discovered that you needed to book online when we arrived at 7am (having followed the advice on here to get there early)- theer was already a long queue which stopped moving at 8am- we eventually discovered that the tickets had all been sold online two days previously for entry until 1pm- we had the choice to abandon the trip or sit in the queue until 1pm- not great with kids.
In August absolutely packed around the main falls- we did the 18km route which eventually became quieter and made the long drive and longer queue worthwhile!

Croatia,Superwoman888,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"Plitvice Lakes and the National Park is simply a paradise, and with proper management, it can retain its pristine beauty for many years. It is protected by guidelines under the UNESCO World Heritage.

Sadly when we visited, it was groaning under the weight of human traffic. The paths are mostly designed for single lane travel in either direction. It got very crowded so progress was slow, especially where boardwalks over waterways were narrow.

The Park is vast and and there are many walking trails and16 interconnected lakes of changing colours spread all around. It would be wonderful to quietly sit back and enjoy the picturesque scenery, without the crowds.

As we were part of a private group, our schedule made it difficult to visit any earlier than mid morning, but an early bird start is definitely recommended, before the large groups get there.

I was surprised to see very little discarded rubbish, and thought how nice it was that all visitors were so conscientious, and proud of their environment, to not litter, until I saw a few cleaners further down the track picking up all the litter. Oh what the?!! C’mon people! Please, take out what you take in.

Croatia,Dkheath777,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"This place is so beautiful but it is completely ruined by the amount of people they allow into this park. You’re so pissed off from walking on single track trails following tours led by the yellow umbrella tour guides walking at about .5 miles per hour and people that have zero business navigating any type of hiking terrain that you can’t even enjoy the experience. On the wooden plank trails there’s zero room to move aside and even take a picture. You either hold up the entire train by stopping or you take a rushed picture while you’re walking and can’t even enjoy the site. It’s worse than the busiest day in Disneyland and if it’s a hot day good luck! I would never recommend this experience to anyone and will definitely never come back. I could write 50 other examples of why this place is a mis managed gem but bottom line is it’s not worth the time or effort. Go to KRKA instead and go early but only if you plan to spend the day in the water as most of the tourists off the busses either can’t swim or didn’t plan to get their designer shoes/bags dirty trying to figure out the process. Plitvice is beautiful but the secret is out and now it’s not worth it until they institute a one in one out policy with a ticket cap per day that is about half what they sell now. Such a disappointment and a total waste. If it’s on Pinterest you should avoid it...if it looks to good to be true then it is:) Zero stars for the experience even though the nature deserves five. Sad.

Croatia,wazzap54,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"This treasure was a highlight of our trip to Slovenia. We were part of an escorted Peregrine tour. We started early before the crowds arrived and took the 2 hour walk through the Lakes and waterfalls. The water is crystal clear, and the views change at every turn. The walking surfaces are well defined although some of the wooden walking tracks can subtly change level without warning so being sure footed is an advantage. I must have taken over 50 photographs and will have to sort through the best. A fantastic natural attraction - but get there EARLY. By the time returned to the starting point, the place was heaving with tourists and the walk ways were down to single file walking.

I tried to find out the amount of rubbish that is created here EVERY single day. EVERYTHING comes in single use plastic. Nowhere could I find recycling containers. Not even for bottles or cans. No point in taking anything back to your hotel cause they don't seem to have heard about recycling either. In Germany people followed me to get the refund for a water bottle I had bought. I thought Australia was bad, but here I'm speechless. With all the money that gets made from entry fees, where does it go I wonder? Employ people to wash dishes. I heard that management is going to cut staff and use even more technology for scanning your entry yourself etc. How come UNESCO isn't putting restrictions in place? All very sad. 😢

Croatia,Matt V,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"What a stunning day. Beautiful scenery, serene trails and relaxing water falls.

I showed up around 1pm at Parking lot 2. The host of my B&B suggested I start there because there are typically more tickets available there (they limit entry throughout the day). After getting in I ate at the self service restaurant just before getting on the bus to do trail H. That trail came highly recommended from the ground staff. Keep in mind, its a 8km trek! Bring some comfy shoes.

Of note, things that I couldn't find before hand are:
* no, you do not need to pre purchase a ticket, although during peak travel time you really should! They limit entry to the park to control the amount of people on the trail, which is a good thing.
*Parking Lot 2 has more availability than Parking lot 1!
* You do need to pay for parking

Croatia,Judith L,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We had planned for years to visit this natural wonder. Having read other reviews about queues, overcrowding, unhelpful staff etc we were wondering if it would be a let down. We were unable to book online as we were on a touring holiday and didn't know when we were going to be wanting tickets so couldn't book the required two days before. We were staying just up the road and decided to go to Entrance 2 which is less busy. We arrived at 745am and there was no queue. The information office were really helpful with routes and we took route H. A bus took us down to the start of the route and we only had to wait about 5 minutes for the bus. There was only about 30 people on the bus and we soon spread out so that within minutes we were completely alone with the natural wonder of the northern waterfalls - it was sublime - so magical. At that time of day it was cool and shady and just wonderful. By 1030am we are down at the boat and popped across the end if the lake for a coffee and loo stop - again no queueing and then we took the boat up the lake to the southern end - it was only half full. At the other end at 12 it was packed and there were long queues to get on the boat but it wasn't too bad a queue to get a coffee and we were going in the opposite direction to the hoards! The bug waterfall had a 5 mun queue down to it but we felt the northern falls were much more impressive. We walked back to the bus and had a cheese roll from the cafe for just £4 for two and are back at the car for 130pm having had the most marvellous experience. Parking was only about £8 which was fine - they have to charge as some people park for other walking around the park area and the £35 entrance fee was worth every penny as it was so we'll maintained and the boat and train set up e was very efficient. Only small gripe was that there are very few loos in the trail and, if you are keeping yourself hydrated, you need more loos! After theong walk of 2.5 hours down to the boat stop there was no loo! However you can pop across to the other side to the cafe It is as great day out Just go!!

Croatia,MazzaMac,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We visited yesterday mid September and it was very busy around Veliki Slap the famous waterfall thanks to coach parties and instagrammers! But away from this bottleneck we had plenty of peaceful moments during our 4 hour visit. We bought our tickets online (this has to be at least 2 days in advance) and booked the 10am entrance time to allow 2 hours drive from Zadar. Only Entrance 2 was an option but this is an excellent quieter starting point. We left at 7.30 am and we were there before 9.30 but after parking and walking down to the shuttle bus it was almost 10 am. We had decided on Route H after research - and are so glad we did. The shuttle takes you to the Upper Lakes first and then it's a lovely downhill hike along very clearly signposted paths to the ferry. Despite lots of other people it was always possible to find a quiet spot and the upper waterfalls are beautiful. A short wait at the boat jetty and a tranquil ride across the lake and we were at the start of the lower section. Here it was so much busier. Awful in places with people blocking the boardwalk etc We thought Veliki Slap was a bit disappointing after all the hype. Not as lovely as some of the upper Lakes/falls and too many people. It must be hell in July/August! But climbing above continuing on Route H there were fewer people and great views. And peace again! We decided to walk along the lake to return rather than take the bus. This was a beautiful walk taking about 35 mins but you do have to climb steps at the end to get back to the very start. In total it was just over 4 hours to complete Route H with plenty of photo opportunities and a picnic.
We did Krka a few days before and Plitvice offers more. If you only have time for one park - unless you desperately want to swim at Krka (a bit over rated) then Plitvice offers more as it is bigger and off season you can get away from the crowds. But we're glad we did both and Krka was easily combined with beautiful Sibenik which makes a great day out.

Don't be afraid of mixing the trails, in order to make sure you would always be the closest possible to the gorgeous lakes: started from entrance 1, took K, then C, then H and K again and we loved it. We waked for more than six hours and it was definitely worth it. Make the time to go there!",Sep 2019
Croatia,Guy T,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"So once you get over the 250kuna (in season) per person it is to get in. Advice online I only read on route to park is to book in advance as they only let a certain number of people in at a time but you have to book 2 days in advance so be prepared.

It’s a fab day out. It’s really well signposted and at the beginning you basically pick a route. We opted for route H which did both the upper and lower lakes. We also started from entrance 2 which we found was a little bit quieter.
There are regularly toilets and refreshments around the park which are very reasonably priced. Your ticket also included a bus/train and a boat ride which were both well organised.
I would definitely recommend going and for anyone outside the area to make the trip.
Parking is plentiful and is 10 kuna per hour.

We then had to stand in a queue for nearly two hours to get tickets for entry at 1pm

Once you get past the entrance and the first 30-40mins of walking behind tourists who have to stop every two steps to take professional photos it's lovely.

Croatia,Akrido,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"On a sunny September day the long roundtrip took about five hours including refreshment stops. An articulated bus from entrance 2 to the highest point, a walk to roughly the middle, a boat ride almost to the end, a walk round the lower lakes and the bus back to the starting point. I believe there was around 8km of walking. Although neither of us is match-fit it was not hard work because the route, on average, goes downhill.

The park is impeccably maintained and the eateries offer decent food, mostly burgers, at sensible prices.

Points to watch
1. It probably wouldn't be much fun in the rain.
2. You have to take that risk: if you don't book and pay for your tickets online at least 2 days in advance you might not get in.

The first afternoon was sunny, lovely and there were LOTS of people at the beginning of June. The second morning we headed out almost by ourselves in a downpour. We were, however dressed for rain, loved the quiet and found, to no ones surprise, that the waterfalls are even more abundant in the rain. Be sure to learn about the formation of these pools/lakes and falls. You are watching the formation of tufa, a soft rock formed by dissolved minerals precipitating onto plants, which form dams, which create the pools and lakes.

I strongly recommend to purchase your tickets online and arrive well early to see the park.
The shortest track you can choose is about 2-3 hours long .
You can use boats to take you to lower lakes, but this does not shorten the track time, add to it waiting in the queue to get first boat to pier 2, and then another boat to pier 3.
Or you can just walk the track 8-9 hours .
Not recommended for a pushchair for kids , it’s ok if you can carry your child in a Carrier.

Since we selected to get in at 9 am they gave us a window from 8:30 to 10 am to enter. We think this is a very wise way to control the amount of people in the park.
The whole process was easy and fast.
The amount of water cascades and the beauty that is everywhere is indescribable.
The sound of the water rolling is incredibly relaxing to the point that the 8 kilometers we walked were not felt at all.
We entered in entrance #1 since the place were we stayed, House Biba and Leona was 15 minutes walk away.
We chose the route C, going up 145 meters to the upper lakes so we were always facing the water cascades.

We left at 7am, and got there at 9am. We qued for about 1 hour to get tickets, then headed straight to the top part of the lakes to walk route 'H'. The route was great for probably the first half an hour and then everything got insanely busy.
We stopped, rested, tried to take our time and wherein the park till around 5/6pm - the whole day was incredibly busy and full of people - we felt frustrated, stressed, and cross by the end as we didn't really get to enjoy many of the sites.

I'd imagine unless you go here in the quietest seasons then you may as well not go as its just too busy!!

To make it worse, the ticket price was already very expensive without the added extra £10 on parking! I wouldn't recommend going here, and this has now also put me off visiting the Krka National Park as i'd imagine it will be very similar.

Our hike took about 5 hrs in total (steady pace, one break), and we had the entire route to ourselves for the majority of the time. However, when the K path met the other paths at the falls, it was very crowded, even though it was pouring rain at this stage. The paths were overrun by water and people were trying to pass each other while carrying umbrellas...we still got a good glance at the falls but standing still to take a picture was hardly possible without annoying the herd behind you.
After this busy part, we walked the rest of the K path back to the car again almost without meeting a soul.
When we finished at 1pm and looked down at the falls, it was jam packed with people who could hardly move.

If rain is predicted, wear appropriate hiking boots, wetgear or a poncho. The remote K path gets quite muddy and the normal paths at the lakes and falls get soaked.

We were wrong!
Whilst it is truly beautiful, the HUGE crowds of people were utterly relentless. Naively we thought you would be able to escape the crowds once you’d passed the bottleneck and possibly even swim to cool down from the 32’+ heat. Neither was possible, I do appreciate the need to keep the lakes pristine and the huge crowds would be everywhere if allowed to deviate from the path. However, this is also part of the problem. There is a bottleneck to cross by electric boat (and some nationalities don’t seem to understand the concept of queues!). Then the boats are spilling their loads of people out to push past the queues waiting to return. The paths are approx 4’ wide and the snake of crowds winds their way round, each photo spot is a fight through the throngs and don’t get me started on dodging the pushchairs 🙈
We gave up, turned back and hired a towing boat so that we could escape.
We did not return for the second day and enquired about a partial refund by email. Deathly silence since!
Truly beautiful but crowds usually only seen in city centres!
None of the foot venues have any clue what gluten free means either.

Croatia,StandUpDeliver,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"My actual experience of Platvic lakes national park, far exceeded my expectations. Well organized for all the visitors, but do take note that there are many, especially from 10h as tour buses come in then. If possible, make sure to be there at 7h and start from the waterfalls. We spent 8 hours in the park, and walked 15km, as we wanted to miss nothing.
Next time I will pack a picnic basket and make sure I am there for sunrise to sunset. Photo opportunities are endless. Croatia is truly blessed to have such a natural wonder. Make sure to visit the town of Rastoke en-route and also if possible, to book accommodation in the area of the park, as that is an experience on it’s own with the beautiful nature.

Croatia,rita,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Plitvice National Park was a highlight of our trip to Croatia. We stayed near the park entrance so we could get an early start based on reviews we read beforehand. We were there in August which is a busy time of year. We started from Entrance 1 at 8am and chose to follow path C. You should be prepared for lots of walking and it is a good idea to carry water and food with you. I am not in shape and I did not have any trouble. It is an easy walk through the park as the paths are either man-made boardwalks or wide dirt paths. In sections we were walking in a stream of people, but when path C branched off we were with far fewer people. What you get to see is amazing! It is just like the pictures on-line or in travel magazines. There are areas along the walk with benches for resting or eating a snack. When we got to the end of path C at Entrance 2, instead of catching a bus back to the parking lot by Entrance 1, we chose to walk on another path recommended by the person at an information desk. Route C is one of the longer paths, which takes you from the lower lakes to the upper lakes. At one point we waited in a line for about 15 minutes to catch a boat to cross a lake to continue along our path. We truly enjoyed our day, (8am - 3pm) and were surprised we walked 11 miles. It was well worth it and as we were leaving we were so glad we started at 8am. At 3pm the lines were really long!
I recommend starting your day at Plitvice National Park early - ENJOY!

We had an amazing time in the pouring rain. central Croatia. It has 16 terraced lakes, linked with waterfalls, that extend into a limestone canyon. The hiking trails are parallel to the water, there are nd an electric boat links the 12 upper and 4 lower lakes. You can swim there which is great for all the family and enjoy the 78m-high waterfall.

Croatia,Jan H,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"This is certainly a very beautiful place. The colour and clarity of the water is amazing and the waterfalls just stunning. Be sure your camera is working properly. Mine wasn’t.
However, having said that it is well to be aware of some things, especially if you are of mature age. Lol.
The board walks are stunning but are made of rough timbers cut straight from the tree.i.e. They are trimmed branches. This means they are not level nor the same width. Some of the longer spans across water have no hand holds (balustrades) and they wobble alarmingly, especially if other people are on the same span, and on our trip, there were lots of other people. Also, watch out for people with backpacks, and your own if using one. If you turn to look at something, be careful not to knock someone off the walkway and into the water. Happened to me a couple of times and I was left teetering.
Wear good walking shoes. Many people also carried walking sticks, the expandable metal ones, and this might be helpful except for the gaps between those uneven sticks that are your walking platform.

Croatia,Anthony B,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"My wife and I arrived before 8am on a very hot day and tackled the K route from Entrance 1. For someone not so fit, entering his eighth decade and recently enlarged on a spectacular SailCroatia cruise, my feet made heavy weather of the last couple of kilometres, but that did not detract from one of my lifetime's great experiences. We love gardens and parks and this one ranks right up there on the international lists. The natural beauty is quite overwhelming and there are photographs everywhere one looks - of lakes, trees and waterfalls that never seem to lose any of their attractions, whatever the light and temperatures. We even saw some birds (in Croatia!), frogs, mice and so many trout! This park should be on every traveller's bucket list! A couple tackling the K route probably need four or five litres of water between them, on a hot August day.

Croatia,photo_AC,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Yes, it can get crowded, especially when the tour groups arrive. But they are usually rushed through their ""tour"", so the crowding will ease up. That's why we planned to spend the whole day exploring Plitvice.

Our recommendations:
- Book your ticket online for the date of your visit. We opted for 8am entry (the earliest).
- Arrive early to park and exchange the email for actual tickets at the reception building.
- Bring lunch & snacks & drinks into the park as there are very limited eating options inside.
- Be prepared to walk a lot if you wish to fully explore... we did around 30,000 steps that day.
- Start at Entrance 1, visit the big waterfall, then work your way to P3 for the boat ride to P2, then hike to St3 and take the bus back to St 1, and finally back to Entrance 1.

Yes, the entrance ticket is not cheap. But we thoroughly enjoyed our day in Plitvice. We hope to visit again in winter... some day!

There are fast food stalls and toilets at the entrance -- suggest you eat and use the toilets before you begin.

Croatia,Patrick G,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"Drove from Split to visit Plitvice Lakes and the scenery didn’t disappoint - the lakes and waterfalls are stunning and the different walking-routes are a great way to lose the crowds.

Biggest tip for your visit - definitely pre-book tickets or you risk waiting in line for the limited tickets available per hourly entrance slot.

Naturally the only negative about these beautiful sites are the people! The initial part of the route, closest to the main waterfall (the money shot photo) gets super busy and the risk of encountering the selfie-stick army is super high! If you can find the patience and get through it the rest of the parks are a worthy reward!

Back to the positives - the stunning scenery, great trails and a cool little boat ride to really show off the park really makes this a worthwhile trip!

Croatia,Hazetl1956,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We booked the Plitvice Lake excursion through TUI/Gullivers Travel and we only got to see half of them. We expected to visit what we now know to be the lower lakes ie: the iconic images of walkways passing directly in front of lots of small falls but unfortunately we never went anywhere near them. Our experience turned out to be a very short walk from the entrance to the bus where we were taken up to station 3. We then walked down from station 3 along the upper lakes and then immediately left the park from P2 (exit 2) We were given firm instructions not to deviate from the planned route and the rep follows behind the group to ensure you kept on the move. Whilst the upper falls are lovely we were never given the chance to view the lower lakes or to walk along their walkways. The advert states the 78m waterfall is one of the highlights of the trip and we had a quick glimpse of this waterfall and very distant glimpses of the lower lakes on arrival. The 'pleasant boat trip' turned out to be a very short trip (25-50m possibly) to take us from P2 to P1 and we were then taken straight to the exit. Apparently you need 5 hours for the complete experience - we had 3! If you book through an agent make sure they guarantee you will see all of the falls!

- Book your ticket online to avoid the queue
- Arrive at 7 at the entrance (be there before to park) and you'll have roughly 3 hours before the site gets packed. It is enough time to visit the lower and upper lakes.
- After, walk by the biggest lake instead of taking the boat or the bus and you won't see many people
- Then, climb to see the lakes from above, and again, you'll be almost on your own

When we went down to leave at 2pm, it was awfull, a proper nightmare, I can't understand the people still trying to see it in those conditions...

Croatia,SusanMH5656,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"Two starts for its beauty. I visited Plitvice Lakes with a friend over a week ago. Was going to be a highlight of our trip. I don’t write negative reviews, without first discussing the issue with the appropriate party. Having emailed the National Park the following day, I was hoping to hear from them within a week. No response, and I guess there is not going to be one. So I feel the need to write this review. Take seriously the comments people say about the crowds in August. I think the best way to describe our experience there is to copy the email I wrote to the NP.
Here it is ...
“Yesterday my friend and I visited Plitvice Lakes. We are from Australia, on a trip around Croatia, and visiting the lakes was going to be the highlight of our trip. Unfortunately, I must say that for us, it was a total nightmare, and probably the worst day I have ever experienced in travel. I am writing this in the hope that you will see it as positive criticism, and that it will do some good. I know there were many other angry people visiting the lakes on the same day.
We arrived at our accommodation the night before, hoping to get into the park early. I tried to book online but discovered you couldn’t book within the two days. Fair enough. Your website said, the night before, that there were 400 spaces available at 7am, so we arrived there at 6.40 am, queued up till after 8am, only to find the first available entrance was at 1pm. We bought the tickets ... we were keen to see this beautiful area, so were prepared to wait. At 12.30 we headed down to the entrance to find a queue so long that it was obvious we weren’t going to get in at 1pm. We just expected that if we had a ticket for 1pm , we would able able to enter at 1 pm. With hundreds of people in front of us, it was obvious we had a long wait ahead. Everyone waiting for hours for a shuttle. We went to the info office nearby and explained our frustration, especially as we had been there since early morning. They were very understanding and suggested we go down to the boat and start from there. We were happy with that, but I did realise that all the research I had done from home about which routes I would like to take, were not going to happen. I tried to enjoy what I did see, without feeling bitter about that.
Because of the direction we went , we needed to walk out and catch a shuttle down to where we started at Parking 2. And then we hit the queue ...again ! I couldn’t believe that a day I had so much looked forward to for so long, was so frustrating and unenjoyable. The line for the shuttle to get back to the car park took almost 2 hours. And there was no other way to get out. We couldn’t walk back out because my friend has knee replacements. I would have paid anything for a taxi at that time, but there were none available. I discussed this with one of the “officials” at the shuttle bus, who was very arrogant and wasn’t to keen to listen to me. At this stage a simple apology might have alleviated my frustration! But that wasn’t forthcoming. As we had a long drive ahead of us, I was feeling desperate that we were stuck in this queue, and had no other way of escape. Finally, back at the car park, we had to pay for all the hours we were in the park ... including all the hours of being in a queue.
At 250 kuna each, and car parking for all the hours of waiting, I honestly feel that we were totally ripped off. I feel like I wasted a nights accommodation in the area, the price of entry and car park, but also a total waste of a day and a half of our holiday.
But worst of all was the feeling that I missed seeing and enjoying a beautiful part of Croatia, that I had been looking forward to for so long.
Plitvice Lakes has so much going for it. I hope people in the future don’t have to experience it the way we did. I will leave Croatia very much feeling the loss of not experiencing Plitvice the way I had hoped.
Please see this as positive criticism. I know there were many others who felt the same frustration and anger that we felt.”
So, that’s our Plitvice Lakes experience. I hope you have a much better day if you decide to go there.

Beware of admin cost parking slot allocation and people dithering. The admission was expensive at £35 together with £10 parking. The park was full at 10am when I arrived and was only allowed in at 2pm. If I had known would have booked online. There are 4 routes - I choose route K which was a 18km hike around the lower and upper lakes accompanied by my dog. Most people chose the shorter routes so needless to say when the crowds died down it was much more enjoyable.

Do take a picture of your route so you know that you first walk for a while followed by TWO boat trips - the second one is really short. For the first boat we waited in line some 30 minutes. Recommended: We then hired a small rowing boat for 1 hour and explored the lake ourselves. Max 4 persons in the boat. It cost 100 kunas with 100 extra as a deposit. After that we had to get on board of some buses. Waited some 30 minutes and the bus was packed with people. To me this was disappointing as I expected a train after reading their website. For our kids aged 11 and 13 this trip was the right length. After the bus it was only a short walk to the parking. The park is really beatiful, see the pics :)

My partner and I bused it from Zadar and got off at Gate 2. This gate is not as popular as the Gate 1 and is an easy walk to the entrance from the bus stop. We were heading to Zagreb from the park so they have a great place that you can leave your backpack whilst enjoying the park.

Be mindful there are 3 options on exploring the park. One option is a shuttle bus from Gate 2 then a walk then a boat. Another option is a walk first then a shuttle bus and the final option is to walk the entire park.

The queue for the shuttle bus was huge when we were there and there is only one bus that runs. We were advised that the wait to get on the bus could be an hour so we decided to walk, so take this into account if you are visiting during a busy period. The same applies at the other end for the second option of walking then taking the shuttle bus. That line was even longer. So be prepared for long queues.

Croatia,mrsbsouthend,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I apologise in advance - this will be a long review but hopefully it will help you plan a great visit to Plitvice.

I had to visit in the summer due to working at a school - sometimes you have no choice! But I am here to tell you it can be a pleasant, uncrowded experience if you plan it right.

Firstly - go early. Many have said this but its true. We split our time over two days. Day one at the Lower lakes, day two at the upper. If you pick your trails before you go you can download the maps onto your phone just as a rough guide. However the signposting is excellent there so you are perfectly fine just to walk following the signs.

Lower lake walking trails are green. Upper are orange. Mixed is the combination of both. Decide your route before you go! It saves alot of time and dithering at the start. We had already printed our tickets to be used at 7am-8am so was able to drive in to the carpark, walk straight across to the entrance (over the bridge) and straight into the queue on the left hand side of those without tickets - scan and you are in. The next day you can go in at anytime at all, you don't have to repeat the same time.

We picked route B on the lower lakes. It was great for my teenage kids being around 3-4 hours (we finished it in 3), with all the great highlights, two boat trips (one after the other) and one bus ride. We got lots of amazing people free pictures as the crowds were thinner at that time of day. It was also surprisingly cool - check the temperature! We went in August and it was 12 degrees at 7am! Layer up!

When we got off the shorter of the boat routes the signs disappeared. Someone at entrance 2 (where we had ended up) pointed us in the direction of bus station 2. You basically head up through the entrance, up past a building directly in front then turn right to station 2. This takes you to station 1 where you get off and continue the walk. I loved walk B because you get a decent walk, see the highlights, there is a toilet/cafe stop at the P3 boat terminal, and the end of the walk is high up on the cliff. You get to take all those amazing panaromic photographs overlooking the lower lakes when the sun is higher.

We left the park at 10.30am to find chaos in the carpark! They were turning those away with no tickets and there was no parking spaces anywhere at that time. I paid at the machine next to the office (cash only, I think they might take card at the office). It was 4 hours parking in all for 40 kuna.

Day two we went to the Upper lakes to do route E. Again very accurate as it said 3 hours, which is exactly what we did. I would say that entrance 2 (where it started) it alot more challenging for young and old than entrance 1. At entrance one you start immediately with that stunning view. Entrance two is a long walk downhill (15 minutes) to even get to the entrance to the park.

I also noted the paths were rougher, more stairs and climbs than in the lower lakes. Also when we first took the shorter boat trip across the other boat arrived at the same time. 150 people all poured off the boats! My heart sank - it was the later time of 8.30am - but in the end people disperse and it can still be pleasurable. The same happened again where two trails converged. I definitely noted it was busier even setting off an hour later in the morning.

I loved the upper lakes, just as stunning and a photographers dream. We sat more to gaze at the views (plenty of benches along the way). I was happy to see it so pristine and unspoilt. You end up at bus stop 3, where you take a long bus route back to entrance 2 and that long walk uphill to the exit!

I was even more shocked by the parking chaos in entrance 2! Seriously, by 11.40am it was like a free fall all. I paid my 40 kuna and found myself stalked by cars on the 10 minute walk from the pay station back to my car.

In summary - book tickets, go early, plan your routes and stick to it. If you can split the park over two days, if not you can combine route B and E if you wanted. Instead of taking the second boat just get off the first one, go up the stairs and follow route E. Then when you get to the bus stay on until you get to stop one, where you pick up route B again. This would be around 6 hours of walking.

Please go. It was amazing and worth every penny.

Croatia,maddonna22965,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"we booked our tickets for the park whilst in the UK which meant we skipped queues that snaked around the entrance for about 2 hours! not great to stand in heat of the sun for that long so buy your tickets in advance. If you can take some drinks and a picnic with you as the food available is not very good. The park itself is stunning and so so beautiful that we took hundreds of video and photos that we have yet to get downloaded. so have a big camera card you will need it. The park is spotlessly clean with no litter and plenty of bins so the park does not get spoilt. most of the park is accessable for prams or wheelchairs with someone to help, as the walkways around the lake are fine for people to cross paths but i doubt 2 wheelchairs/prams will fit on them to pass in opposite directions because either edge of the paths are open over the lakes with no handrails.

Croatia,gogo12377,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We had a fabulous day in truly stunning scenery and I would really recommend a 7 am entry ticket. We saw the lower lakes before the crowds. We walked route C which was beautiful and covered all the main beauty spots. We chose to walk back along the lakeside rather than queue for a busy ‘scenic train’ ( bus) back so the whole walk was about 17k. The stretch back to entrance 1 along the lake was quiet and tranquil though and we saw water snakes voles and plenty of fish.
By the time we left the park at around 1pm it was too busy to fully appreciate .
Very impressed at lack of litter and attempts to manage visitor numbers with timed entry.",Aug 2019
Croatia,AkitDDS,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Do you like nature? do you like beauty? do you like peace and tranquility? do you like walking and waterfalls? - Then this is the place for you. Plitvice is just incredible, simply stunning and one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I feel blessed to have been there, it's so relaxing and exhilarating at the same, an absolute wonder of nature. We spent a heavenly day and a half there and we still didn't see it all. We went in May but I can imagine it's wonderful anytime, especially in winter. I will say that it's quite busy but if you time it right (go later in the day and actually stay on site like we did) we had some very peaceful times where we saw hardly anyone! I miss it.",May 2019
Croatia,TempleofPeace,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"The NP itself is outstanding. The paths only allow access to a tiny portion of the NP - so that the rest is unspoiled. However, they allow far too many people in so the paths are very crowded. You may think that 6 hours is rather slow walking for 8km, but you need to allow for the fact that each time someone stops to take a photo, the whole queue stops as well! The forest trails are harder and less busy - and faster.

Lots of wildlife can be seen if you look. Apart from the many fish in the lakes, we saw various snakes, mice, etc. There are bears, lynx, deer, but you’d need to be exceptionally lucky to see them.

Croatia,Antonija,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"The waterfalls and lakes are absolutely a beautiful and breathtaking must-see if you're in Croatia.

There are a few trail options in the Park, the shortest one is about 3 km while the longest one is around 6. There are a few places to grab a bite and a couple public bathrooms.

Experiencing this is definitely worth the extra time invested in preparation (buying the tickets online and coming early to avoid the queue).",Sep 2018
Croatia,TobiMicha2,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We went to the park because of its beautiful landscape and of course to see the astounding waterfalls.
We picked a 2-day-ticket (350 kn each) and so passed the lower lakes on day 1 and the upper lakes on the 2nd day. Actually you can walk through the whole NationalPark in 1 day (walking pretty fast in maybe 8 hours) but we were glad we had decided to do it on two days.

Some tipps 4 you

Tipp #1: Buy a ticket online in advance !!! ( we coukd skip the line of maybe 300 peopke waiting to get a ticket in the morning - and as just a limited number of tickets is sold not everyone gets inside - some people must wait A FEW HOURS until more tickets are sold later)
IMPORTANT: for online tickets you must pick entrance time and place in advance!!!

Tipp #2: be there at 7 am when the park opens. Until 9 or 9.30 you can experience the idyllic landscape. The later it gets the more people arrive.. and from 10 am onwards it is REALLY crowded!!

Tipp #3: if you want to be undisturbed for a little longer get in at entrance 2 (basically 80% of the people start at entrance 1 and go to the biggest waterfall first), pick the first boat from P1 to P2 and discover the upper lakes.

Tipp #4: when you pick a 2-day-ticket you can enter the park when and wherever you want on the 2nd day!

Although it was not cheap we had a great time in Plitvice :)

Extra-Tipp:
If you're also into waterfalls you should also visit the KRKA-national park (we liked that one even a bit more but it is more touristic)

Croatia,KevinBonello,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,The place is stunning and you have to be there early (7am-8am) and order tickets online so that you can enter without waiting in long queues and good parking spot. The only nightmares we encountered were the long queue at the end for the train to take us back to the begining and the parking fee 120kuna cash or 100kuna if paid by card,Aug 2019
Croatia,sanj15,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"We went in the peak season so first of all the entry fee is almost tripple. At 250kunas per person. Also the tickets are time stamped so the later you buy your ticket the later the entey time. We hired a car the night before for 500kunas, woke up at 5 the next morning and left from split at am. We got to plitvice at 9.15am and the only tickets left were for 2pm entry. We had to sit in the car for 5 hours. Then had to wait an hour to catch the park bus. Parking cost us 100kunas and petrol cost 400kunas for the 6 hours of driving. So 1500 kunas for 3hours of nature walks. The walks have been decked however quite poorly, we noticed up to 30 people have small trips. They are also way too narrow for the croweds ot attracts. If i could provode any advice it would be to go off peak or book online 3 days ahead or arrive by 8am. We did neither of those unfortunatly.

Croatia,Abby,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,The nature is truely stunning. But if you're a true nature lover and enjoy hiking and the outdoors and so on then I garantee you that you won't enjoy the lakes. There were so many people literally everywhere. There was no way of escaping the crowds and sometimes you even had to cue up to see a waterfall.,Aug 2019
Croatia,Tasha Georgina Y,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"The photos do not do this place justice ❤️

It’s a magical wonderland for national park enthusiasts and travellers.

Top tips:

Get in the 6.15am shuttle from your nearby hostel to get to the park before opening.
Walk to another entrance (Not the main entrance).
You’ll have the park to yourselves for the first 1.5 hours.

Croatia,Stacey B,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I almost didn't come because I was afraid it was going to be too crowded (as I visited in August), but I'm SO glad I visited. This place is so gorgeous! And I managed to have a crowd-free visit.

First of all...buy your tickets in advance! The lines are very long for people wanting to buy tickets, and many people are disappointed.

I bought a 2 day pass--WELL WORTH IT.

On the 1st day, I waited until 3pm to go in (as the tour groups were finishing up). I went in Entrance 2, and it was easy peasy. There were people, but it was not crowded at all. The Upper Lakes are just incredible (in fact, I like them better than the lower lakes). Then the 2nd day, I got to Entrance 1 at about 6:55 and there was just a short line waiting to get in when it opened at 7 (note that there are 2 lines - the longer one on the right for those who need to buy tickets, and the shorter one on the left for those who have tickets). At entrance 1 you are really close to the popular waterfall that gets really crowded, so I headed there first, and there were only 2 other people there when I was there. Then the loop around the lower lakes wasn't crowded at all. As I was leaving the park around 1:30ish, it was starting to get quite crowded at Entrance 2 (and I'm sure the lower lakes and Entrance 1 were packed by then)

I would highly recommend staying nearby. I stayed at a great hostel called Bearpackers - they give lifts to the park for 10 kuna each way).

Get a 2 day pass. It's SO worth it. First of all, you can enter and leave as many times as you want (with a 1 day, you can't). You can also enter at 2 different gates (you have to enter at the gate you buy it for, but the next day you can enter at the other gate if you want). And you can take your time when you're in the park rather than trying to do it all in one day. So much more enjoyable.

Really...go! It's so beautiful and well worth the price. Enjoy!

Croatia,mtducker,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We booked this with TUI as an excursion as we were staying at a hotel in Pula.

The journey took a good 4-5 hours each way so it is a VERY long day; one which I would say would be difficult with small children.

Our tour guide was calledMaria and she was amazing furnishing us with interesting facts and information on our long journey to the lakes.

Dinner was provided as part of the excursion on the return journey and this was tasty.

We returned to our hotel around 11pm.

The lakes themselves are simply spectacular!

The walkways are very busy as they receive thousands of visits every day but it’s worth it!

We felt that we were witness to a very special and natural wonder.

Tips:

1. Good walking shoes.
2. Enter at Gate 2 and start at the upper lakes. The lower lakes really are magical and I think it’s better to finish at the lower lakes!
3. Plenty of water.
4. Hat
5. Toilets are located at the different entrances and where you meet the buses. Use them before the walk!
6. You cannot go in the water. You will be fined if you do.
7. Time your visit well in terms of not walking at the hottest part of the day and visiting early in the morning if possible.
8. If you are on an organised excursion, be prepared for a long day!

Place is beautiful, but also crowded as expected. Make sure to make time for more than the main route to the big waterfall (small, upper ones are great too)

Croatia,frameme,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Plitvice Lakes National Park. Although it is far from the city, you can easily get there directly via bus from Zagreb. Make sure to get your bus ticket at least 24 hours in advance though as they fill up very quickly. I was lucky to get a seat on the way back. On the way back, anyone who didn't reserve a seat was required to leave the bus, so make sure to book one! The park itself is gorgeous and I recommend if you are going to take Entrance 1 to get in, you should arrive right when it opens because the queue is very long. I visited on a sunny day in shoulder season (very early May) and the line was already pretty long when I arrived (about 20 minutes before the park opening). By the end of the day it was super crowded! If you get there early and are willing to walk fast at first, you can get ahead of the hordes. The lakes themselves are the most gorgeous colors. I couldn't believe it looked exactly like all of the photos. As you walk (and I recommend the longest path), it just gets more and more beautiful. If you enjoy nature when you travel, this is a must see. However, I will warn anyone who wants to visit about the crowds. I got done with the longest path at around 1pm and had some time to kill before my 3pm bus. I decided to take a lap around the shortest path, but by then, the tourist crowds were so dense, it was almost impossible to walk. I do not recommend you come here late, during busy season, or with a tour group, or you won't have much of a nature hike. Early in the morning though, it is truly amazing.

- there is food inside the park, at least a few cafes to get lunch and snack shops and bathrooms too.
- bring good shoes. you will do lots of walking.
- you cannot swim here.
- it is crowded. go early if you can.

The control mechanism of letting a particular number of visitors in an hour is a very measure . One must visit if one is in this part of the world , keep 4 hrs for it , wear very comfortable shoes . Suggest enter from Enterance 2 , take the bus till ST3 then walk down till boat pier and then take a boat and get down after boat pier and walk towards entrance 1 , will be less tiring without missing anything , we did other way , entered from Enterance 1 , it was more walking.. pls take enough water with you to drink , no availability of water on the way .

Croatia,Steve B,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We went in August so it was busy. However it was worth it. Buy your tickets in advance and get there as early as you can. We arrived at 08:00 am and the queues had already started.

Because we had already got our ticket we moved quickly to the busses which took us to the head of the pass, from there it was a lovely stroll through woodlands and lakes and waterfalls.

At the bottom of the pass there is a boat trip which is worth taking as the views from the boat are lovely

The kids are 15 & 16 and they loved it.

By 3pm we were knackered so we headed out of the park, hot but happy.

Croatia,GrandTour685487,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We drove for 4 hours each way to come up this park for an afternoon. Was it worth it? Overall the 5 of us think so - we loved the stunning colour of the water, the breathtakingly beautiful vistas, but in August, the park is overrun by crowds. Parking was tricky (not impossible) at 1pm. We had bought our tickets online 2 days before and showed the e-tickets to park staff. Perfect. Bus from entrance 2 to p3, walk for 1.5 hours, boat from p2 to p1 and then walk back to big waterfall and entrance 1. Took about 4 hours.
Wear sensible shoes, take water bottles and enjoy the scenery, ignoring the slow lines of people in front and behind you on the boardwalks.

Croatia,sharibob,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We considered doing a group day trip—thank goodness we didn’t!! True, it’s a hassle to rent a car and drive to the area but it’s the only nice way to do it. We spent the night before our trip to the park in a hotel about 25 minutes away, left the hotel about 6:30 am arriving at entrance 1 about 7:10 am. The parking lot was filling up quickly and the line to get tickets probably had about 100 people. We purchased our 2-day tickets online beforehand and were able to go in immediately.

I’d read a lot of strategies about how to see the park best and without crowds but none of it made sense when we actually arrived.

Here’s my only advice—
1. Arrive as close to 7 am as possible with tickets you’ve already purchased online.
2. Go to the bathroom at the entrance. There aren’t many bathrooms and it’s a long distance between them.
3. Keep walking and walking so you can see most of the park before the tour buses arrive around 10 am.
4. Take snacks so you don’t have to waste time at a restaurant.
5. Take short breaks but mainly keep walking to see most of the park before the tour buses get there.

We were actually surprised that we were able to cover so much ground in just the morning. We took the boat across the lake and at the end (top of the upper lakes) we took the shuttle back to entrance 1, but the rest was walking. We covered about 6-7 miles before 1 pm and we saw essentially everything. The only bit we didn’t walk was the part where the boat goes.

We asked at the information office at the top lake and she told us we could walk the entire way back but it’s the same waterfalls just from a different side of the lake. By 1:00 we could barely walk on the boardwalks because of the crowds so we called it a day and decided not to return the next day.

You can’t believe how bad the crowds can be—it’s packed!! Additionally, it was drizzling and many people actually had umbrellas up which was ridiculous because the walkways are narrow and umbrellas are poking you in the head.

I know it sounds like we didn’t like it. We absolutely did but I know we wouldn’t have enjoyed it if we arrived late morning or afternoon.

Just before we left the park I took a photo of the line to see the tallest waterfall—yikes! (The photo is from a distance but you can see how long the line is.) When we left about 1 pm the line to buy tickets was several hundred people long and the parking lots was totally full.

We arrived around 7am on August 15 and had no problem with parking, didn't have to wait in the queue at the entrance and the park itself was relatively not crowded.

Croatia,Ondřej B,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"Visit of this place doesen't fit to travelers who decide on last minute where to go (if you don't want to wait very long queues for tickers and risk that the capacity of the park will be full). You can buy tickets at least 2 days before online. Although you can see on the web that there is still some capacity for today or tomorrow, you won't be able to buy it!
That means:
1) plan what day to visit it, chose at least the day after tomorrow
2) buy ticket online - you will have to choose the time of your visit
3) book some accommodation immedeately
Entry - there are 2 entrances so keep it on your mind when you will park your car.
Crowds - there are places where you will walk alone and there are overcrowded places, where are some queues of people taking photos and varieties of selfies. The best what you can do is to be patient.
Restaurants - there are some mainly by the entrances, but you can't return once you enter the park. Another are on boat stops P1 and P3. The upper lakes offer just poor choice - 3 types of a ""sendwich"" and ice cream.
Nature - many and many watterfalls and lakes across all park.

Croatia,afwz,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"A super memorable hike due to the incredibly unbelievably stupendously gorgeous stunning vista of the many waterfalls and turquoise lakes. Whatever hardship you face to come to this wondrous national park would be worthwhile. We all in the end left in awe of its breathtaking beauty.

I want to share some tips/infos that may be pretty useful for the readers, as I had been desperately looking for such info before my visit:

1. Despite the summer season (my visit in mid-August 2019), I managed to beat the crowd by entering the park early morning, at 7.30 am. The park opens at 7 am.

2. Buy the ticket online and you can print it onto an A4 paper, or have it as an e-ticket on your mobile phone. Upon arrival at the park, you do not need to exchange the e-ticket. This ticket is good for you to directly enter the park. I saw a long queue of people lining up just to buy a ticket from the counter. It is so much faster if for you just log in to the Plitvice website, make the purchase and go to the entrance.

3. If you are short of time, do the lower lakes (more beautiful with turquoise waters) , and make sure that you do not skip the route between entrance 1 and entrance 2. This is the part where you would go through multiple view points from above, including the view of layered waterfalls/lakes and people below you walking on the wooden paths.

4. All three hotels within the national park DO NOT have air-conditioning. If air-conditioning is a must for you, especially if visiting the park in the summer, it is better to stay at hotels in any of the neighbouring place such as Degenica area (about 6 kms away from entrance 1) , and this is just perfect if you come by car. You can then have a short drive and park at the Entrance 1 parking space at 7 am and enter the park directly from there. The parking charges is around 7 Euro for 5 hours (we did route C with two small children and it took us 5 hours from 7.30 am to 12.30 pm).

Overall, it is a bucket list item destination and good for a family outing.

Croatia,dskid,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"We slept in. Had we taken Rick Steves’ advise we’d have been at the park entrance between 7:30 and 8. We went on September 5, and it was crowded (can’t imagine how packed it must be in the summer). We arrived about 10:45 and had to stand in line for 15 minutes to get tickets. Since the vast majority of people entering the park turned right to go down the hill to see the big waterfall, we followed the instructions of a tour guide to his group and went left. That route (what Steves calls “backwards”) had us on the tram from the first stop to the third (don’t get off at the second or you’ll be in a huge line), walking down through the upper lakes to the P2 boat dock. The only negative I saw with this route was that the sun was behind the big falls when we got there, otherwise I think we minimized the time standing in line to board the tram and ferry. The entire circumnavigation of the park took us about 4 ½ hours and we only stopped for two toilet breaks. It’s a very pretty park with hundreds of waterfalls and crystal-clear waters. It’s kept virtually litter free and the boardwalks and trails are very well maintained. At US$23.50/adult they’re raking in the money and it’s good to see things well-maintained. If you’re still reading this, I’ll reward you with what may be the most important part of the review: Should you visit here? I don’t think you’ll regret not coming, especially if you’ve been to some of the large national parks in the U.S. We started our trip in Venice and this was a handy way to break up the drive from Pula to Split, so that’s why we stopped here. We were also spending three weeks on this trip, so had the luxury of a little more time. It’s a pretty time filler but the concentration of people made it feel much more like a mere tourist attraction than a commune with nature.

Croatia,Aini A,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Great place to visit, it is important to go with walking shoes and light comfort outfit in order to walk all day.
It is perfectly possible to visit the park in 1 day.
Parking: first we try to park on parking 2, it was around 10-11am it was crazy, impossible to find an spot. We moved to parking 1, it was a bit easier.
We had the tickets for 11 am and we entered 20min passed 11. advise: buy tickets before going; at least during summer because the line to buy them was really long.

After skipping the tickets line, we entered and walked to bus station 1 ( 10- 15min up after entrance) there we asked for a map and the reco to visit the park. We took the bus and went to the bus station 3.

When we stopped at the bus station 2 = parking 2, we saw a huge line for the bus, so my reco is to use parking 1 and start from there.

After arriving at the top, we walked 5km through path “H” arriving at “P2= electric boat” took the boat crossing the lake and getting at P3 (aprox 15min on the boat) after we supposedly walked 4km more, I think it was less, we saw cave (nothing special) and finished at the big waterfall, and then 10-15 min back to park exit (6pm)

Food: we bought an ice cream and coke, prices were ok. We had sandwiches so we ate them on some spots during our walking, twice, in order to have energy but not to be full.

Bus and boat: included within the park entrance

August: a lot of people!!! Sometimes it felt like we were on a huge tour, specially after 2pm, anyway i think is worth it to visit, reco: visit it early in the morning and have energy to walk, if you want a longer or shorter visit ask at the information points.

The cost of the ticket, paying for parking and if you wanted any kind of decent map you had to pay for it also. The maps that were dotted about were awful and made no sense.

The queue at 7 was already long and there was just 1 desk to buy them. At about 8 they opened another one. No one was explaining about the different ticket desks ecc, the guys at the desks were unfriendly and didn't even talk to us. The parking is also not very well organised, no signed places, you have to search in the woods and park as you can. At 12 o'clock there were, of course, almost no places.
When we went to the entrance there was a long queue there as well and no indications anywhere of where to go and what we were waiting for. Fortunately, in the end there were some girls who asked us what route we wanted to do and we went in immediately (as we later found out, the long queue was for the bus that takes you directly to the big waterfall but no indications here neither).
Inside it was really great and worth the waiting. There were people but in the end it was ok and not too crowded.
We did the ""less"" interesting lakes first and then we went to the big waterfall but everything was just beautiful!
There is a big grass meadow where you can eat and relax but at 4 o'clock the ice-cream was almost finished, as well as the beer. Attention, you only can pay in Kuna, no Euro, no cards, so you need to have cash with you (there are ATM just at the entrance). The guys working at the bars and cafes were absolutely unfriendly.
Maybe we were lucky and had good timing because there weren't so many people at the big waterfall (we were there at about 6 p.m.). We stayed the whole day in the park but next time we surely will: 1) buy a ticket on line, 2) stay there 2 days as there are really many routes and it's beautiful.
At the end we had dinner in a self-service restaurant near the parking with great view, good food, some live music and maybe the only service that was more friendly.
Another thing we didn't like was that the map they give you is not good, the routes are not there, if you want a better map, you have to buy it, but we found out this late as well, only when we were already walking around and trying to find out where to go.
So, a place to recommend but arm yourself with patience!

Croatia,djglobetrotting,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We traveled with a toddler who is 33 pounds. She walked 10% of the 5 miles (we did both loops, took the P2-P3) boat and the S1 bus back to our hotel by entrance 2). I carried her the rest of the way. If you have plenty of snacks, water and rest breaks (there are plenty of lovely spots overlooking waterfalls, lakes and greenery), you should be fine. Just go early (Buy tickets in advance, and get to P1 or S1 by 8 if not 7:30 in August) because it’s so much easier and more fun for the little one to walk when there aren’t adults shoving their way in either directions. Especially on the narrow boardwalks.",Aug 2019
Croatia,Clair O,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"It was easy enough to get here from Ljublana by flixbus rather than book a tour but have your plitvice tickets booked for the right time slot tgat you'll arrive as they are strict with that. If you are able to arrive between 20 past and 20 to the hour it is much quieter than the rush when the hour chimes for all those waiting to pile in. There is a beautiful viewpoint at the start
that is heaving but quietens down after 20 past the hour. We chose the A route that says between 2 and 4 hours. At a leisurely pace with lots of photos we took an hour to reach the end, you can choose to shuttle back or retrace your steps, we chose the latter. It was close to 2pm by this time and had got significantly busier with lots of bottleneck queues. It still didn't take away from the sheer beauty of this place, with waterfalls and neon blue lakes up take your breath away, around every corner. A must see in Croatia.

Croatia,AGC50,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Wear running shoes or appropriate footwear because there is a lot of walking and the ground is not always level. Also, bring drinks and water with you. Line ups are long. We recommend going as early as possible as it is quite busy and buying tickets online. The lakes and waterfalls are absolutely stunning. The waters are crystal clear. You cannot go in the water. Every view is beautiful. We even had the opportunity to enjoy some local singing and dancing. A definite must see while in Croatia.",Jul 2019
Croatia,Jolanda K,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Really beautiful.
Not many toilets. So visit one when you find one 😄

Be sue you book your tickets in line!
We did not. We where lucky we only had to wait one hour and got tickets for 8am that day. People behind us had to wait to enter the park till 3 Pm.

We where also lucky we missed the first entrance because these tickets where booked out till 11 am.

When you book tickets for 1pm, it van be that you can’t park your car at the entrance. I have no idea what happends then?.

Croatia,Lovetotravel,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We went to the Plitvice park with little or no expectations other than it was a national park with waterfalls. We found ourselves continuously saying Wow! As each view was breathtaking. The natural surroundings are just beautiful. We walked up and down stairs and crossed various bridges, stopping to take photos and admiring mother nature’s creations. The park is clean and the visitors are from all over the world, with many languages being spoken but there was a sense of respectfulness when people stopped to take photos or just to admire the views.
We bought our tickets on line to save time and it was worth doing. E tickets are easy to obtain and no need to print as suggested on the website. Head straight to your gate and find the ticket exchange centre. We bought tickets for Gate 2 and the exchange center was next to the cafe. Once we had our park tickets the gate attendant will ask you to select your route you will be taking (which is outlined by how much time you you want to spend in the park) This also gives you markers to follow whilst trekking through the park.
Food is okay to buy from local cafe and did see lots of people bring their own lunch and snacks, but just remember you are carrying this with you and your walking a fair distance.
I wouldn’t recommend this tour for elderly or people with mobility issues as there are lots of stairs. We climbed 31 flights of stairs and we only saw some of the park.
Also, don’t be put off if the weather is drizzling and overcast. We woke up to what we thought was going to be a terrible day to visit the park and instead it was comfortable to walk around as the trees provides a canopy most of the way. Mid morning the sun was out and we enjoyed the birds, water sounds and spectacular clear views.

Croatia,elenah2007,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"This is one of a life time experience you don't want to miss!! I ll do it over and over again in a heartbeat if am given the opportunity to. We bought the two days ticket as we arrived at 7.30 am at the entrance and the time we were allowed to enter was at 12!! The line was crazy! So we decided to buy the 2 days pass. Honestly it was a smart decision! After hiking all entrance 2 route from st3 to p2 we were exhausted and there was no way we would have enjoyed entrance one waterfalls. The 2 days pass is 350 Kuna. Although you can make purchases using a credit card at the entrance, yet once you make it to st 3 or p1 they only take cash. So if you need to buy anything from water, sandwiches or coffee then make sure you have cash on you. Only Kuna. We also rented the rowboat for 100 Kuna per hour. Beautiful way to relax in the lakes!
Highly recommend for everyone!

Croatia,bcsystems,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,We were unsure we would have time to visit the National Park given our tight itinerary while in Croatia. I'm glad we made a half day stop to visit Plitvice Lakes. The waterfalls are endless everywhere and some of the most amazing I've seen anywhere in the world. We actually booked a guided tour the day before for a 930am visit. We were fortunate. I would HIGHLY recommend you go with some tour. This place is very crowded and you don't want to have issues with entry and access to the park. You can also skip the line. It's worth the extra money for the tour anyways as we efficiently made it through all the major sights in about 5-6 hours.,Jul 2019
Croatia,John C,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,"I actually went here in August 2017 but trip advisor would not go back that far. I thought I had written this review some time ago but I can’t seem to find it. I naively thought this was going to be a get back to nature nature experience as the park is large. It turns out it’s like Disney. Parking - horrendous. The centre only takes cash (although there is a cash point I believe). We got on a ferry over to one of the areas with the waterfalls. You then get on a walkway which is two adults wide. Walkways protect the nature which I appreciate and means you can get closer to the waterfalls. But, as it is SO busy you can only go as fast as the slowest person so you end up trudging round at a snails pace. It’s like being in a queue, just with a really good view.

For the spectacle I would give 5 stars but that is tarnished by just how damn busy it is.

It is truly stunning if you can put up with the crowds.

Croatia,Foodie_CST🍽🇷🇴,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"We drove 3 hours to get here from Rijeka but to our surprise, the place was full with people, the parking was full with cars, there was no guidance, we drove arround for some time before we can find a parking spot which costs 10 kn per hour, even if you stay one minute the price is the same and what you only have 20 minute to go out after you pay so you have to hurry in case you parked far away from the exit.
Anyway, there were so really long queues and many people seems disoriented.
We found out also a second queue which was much much smaller and which seemd to be exactly the same but for some reason people prefered the longer queue, probably because they were not informed.
There is an information stand which confirmed the two queues are the same so I guess people didn't go to the information stand.
Anyway, the biggest surprise was the entry hours. We stayed at the small queue at 10 am and the entry hour listed was 1 pm so after you get the full day ticket you can only enter the park at 1 pm so you had to wait for 3 hours even if you bought the ticket which I found it very odd since you pay the full price just as the people who entered early in the morning.
Anyway, the biggest surprize came as we got very close to buying our ticket as the entry time sudenly changed to 2 pm so we are paying full price but have to wait for 4 hours until we are allowed to enter. My advice, buy online ticket, you will be allowed then to enter and don't have to wait for so many hours.

The fort itself is pretty spectacular! But, as in many forts and castles around Croatia, there is a total absence of any kind of educational panels or text!

When you arrive there, the fee is 50 kuna to enter the fortress and go more up and have better views of the city. There was also some kind of prison cell and canons.

When you enter to fort grounds walking from the old town, the walkway is not as steep and winds slowly to the fort.

There are great views from in front of the fort without paying the entrance fee, but the best views are from the walls. The $9USD entrance fee is not cheap, but there is a small museum, informative plaques, and of course your favorite Instagram moment of that’s what you’re looking for. We thought the prison was a cool place (no pun intended) as the prisoners had a good view of the sea. You’ll easily see all there is to see in 30 minutes or so. There is a restaurant within the fort walls, although we didn’t eat or drink there.

One strong feature of the fortress is the view of the town below. Suggestion: go at sunset as you will have a clear view of the town and the sun as it drops somewhere in the distance (see the picture.)

Croatia,Lee D,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"We missed the sign in town directing you to the fortress and so walked around the road and took the long way up, so for those who want to avoid this route, look for the small sign on Kroz Grodu Street off ST Stephens square. Once up the views are beautiful and stunning. The walk up takes you through some gardens but when you reach the entrance pick up a brochure so you can read about the stormy history. There are views from all around the fortress. Plan for -1.5 hours to look at the vendors selling good and taking in the history.",May 2019

Croatia,Ian L,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,Well worth the climb to the fort. 40Kuna entry. Old cannon still in place. Spectacular views. Interesting history. Climb is a hard workout but do it at your own pace. The stairs through town are hardest a gradual gradient with switchbacks for the rest is not bad.,Sep 2019
Croatia,Christina M,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"Although some in our group opted to spend 100 kuna to take a taxi up to the fort, our group of 5 adults decided to walk instead. We both got to the fortress at the same time, but we had the added benefit of exercise and fresh air! The steps up were not difficult and the switch back/ hair pin paved path was easy to walk. There were places along the way to stop and rest if you needed to do that.

The views are spectacular when you reach the top and you can enjoy the beauty as no one is there to rush you out. A few benches accommodate those who wish to linger and enjoy the wonderful view of the harbor. An additional fee gets you inside the fort but we decided not to go.

That comment is with the condition that the streets are dry. The steps and sidewalks getting to the top of the town (before the path to the top of the fortress) are the typical beautiful brac stone, but once wet it gets slippery. The fee to enter the fortress is a bit pricey but you made it this far, why not? There is a little bar where you can get a beer inside, and a little gift shop. Be sure to go down into the old prison, which is interesting and kinda creepy to think about being locked in down there. Of course the views of Hvar town are superb.",May 2019

There is a cafe should you want to stay for drinks or lunch. Go with low expectations and hopefully you will enjoy it.

Views of hvar town were awesome!,Jul 2019
Croatia,bprior1989,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"My friend and I walked up to the fortress from the main harbor.

STEPS:
It’s worth noting that the walk starts with a lot of steps, but it’s worth it as there are plenty of shops along the stairway, so you can easily stop and browse the cute shops and catch your breath.
Though there are many steps, it’s doable for any age group (there were plenty of children and elderly people).

TIME:
If walking fast, you can make it to the top in 20mins. However, one of the nice aspects of this outing is the walk, so you’re better off strolling and taking 30mins to get there.

VIEWS:
Views from the walk and from the fortress are really splendid. After the initial stairs, the walk goes through well maintained gardens that are really pretty.

FORTRESS:
We did not enter the fortress as we heard it was lame and poor value for money.

ADVICE:
Nice outing, take your time, you can buy water on the way, worth a trip but doesn’t take all day - 1h30 is sufficient to get there, appreciate the view and go back again.

Croatia,Paul,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"The Town Fortress was a surprise bonus on our recent stay in HVAR. It was only a short walk from our accommodation at Pharia Aparthotel and the walk provided some wonderful elevated views. The actual fortress is commonly known as Fortica and Spanjola and dates from the 16th century. The final walk up to the fort is fairly steep but the paths are easy to utilise and provide rest and viewing areas. It provided sanctuary for the locals when the town was attacked by the Turkish in 1571.
The fortress has a dungeon, chapel, walls and battlements. It also provides a nice meal and wine/ beer area where you can take photographs with strategically sited cannons. There are superb views of the town and port.
This was a definitely rewarding site, easy to access and well worth the visit.

Croatia,Ana,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"We visited Tvrdava Fortica in the middle of the day, but it was worth it.

After a walk around the city we decided to take the climb to Fortica. The climb was a bit difficult because of the heat but the surroundings were beautiful. We had enough water with us but there was a chanche to buy water or some suvenirs along the climb.
We payed entrance fee, 40kn but the view was really amazing. And we even got to cool down a bit in the old prison located on the grounds of Fortica. If you like walls, fortresses and cannons you will like it here. You can really take some gorgeous photos on the top where you can find perfect view of the town.
The only downside for us was the cafe on the top terrace of the Fortica. We sat there for about 15 minutes and nobody came to serve us. We would understand if there was big crowd, but it was not. All the waitresses saw us. They eaven went past us.

Croatia,Dave O’S,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"- Tough climb, especially in the heat!
- Lovely points long the way for photos
- Well worth paying into the castle at the Summit

We visited Hvar town for the day and after some initial refreshments started the climb along narrow steps of Kroz Gordu which is the lane way beside the Loco Bar in the main Hvar square.

There are a few nice jewellery shops and restaurants on the initial pathway up but then you get to the main walled area which is a tough 15min walk but when you get to the top you’ll be delighted with the view across the city, AND .. there’s a lovely breeze at the top to cool you down in the shade - beautiful!!

I do recommend talking the visit into the castle which is very reasonable few Euros entry fee, but the photos and view are well worth it, as well as the little tour you can do around the different elevations, it was the crowning glory of our journey up.

To learn more a guide would be useful for this. It is open until 8pm and lots of people return later for the sunset. Definitely worth a visit when in Hvar as it is close to the ferry port and possible to reach by car if you can't do the walk. Not all areas are pushchair or wheelchair accessible but you can still enjoy this historic site. Not that busy in late May, even at 11am. A clear day would enable the best views.

This fortress is visible on top of the hill as your ferry pulls into the harbor. You have to take a slight hike up to the fortress. Once you get there, you walk around the fortress checking out the towers and structures. The money maker is probably the views you get of the surrounding areas and the city/harbor below.

Bottom line, nothing extraordinary when taken in context of Dubrovnik city walls, but in visit Hvar, you should check it out.

Croatia,Carol A S,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Hvar fortress (a.k.a. Fortica, Tvrđava Španjola, Spanish Fort) is easy to find, just look up from just about any place in town. To access it, head north from the main square, climb the stairs through the old part of the city and continue up a meandering footpath (tree shaded) which starts on the north side of Higijenickog Drustva St. The vertical ascent is about 100m, and takes 20-30 minutes (wear sturdy shoes and take some water). If you don't wish to walk, you can hire a taxi from the main square for about 100 kuna. The fortress terraces offer superb views overlooking the town, harbor, Pakleni Islands and illustrate its strategic importance. A Byzantine citadel was built here in the 6th century, and the Venetians upgraded Hvar's fortifications in 1278 to protect their shipping and fleet. The town financed the construction by selling salt. During the 14th century, Spanish engineers helped with an upgrade, which is how the fortress acquired its nickname, Spanjola. In 1571 Hvar's population fled to the fortress when the Turks sacked the town. The current fortress was constructed in 1579, after a gunpowder explosion (caused by lightning) severely damaged the old fortress. It was renovated in the 19th century when the Austrians added barracks and raised battlements. After falling into disrepair at the end of the 19th century, the fortress was reconstructed in the 20th. The fortress consists of four circular bastions, tower, church, prison, and walls with battlements. Inside is a labyrinth of passages, staircases, gun ports, casements and storage rooms. There are several exhibits of ancient amphorae, canons, armaments and other medieval relics. The terrace cafe is a good place to pause for refreshment. The interior of the fortress is open (Apr-Oct) 8am-9pm, with an entrance fee of 40 kuna (children half price). The fortress a great place to enjoy sunset or watch boat traffic in the harbor. It is lit at night, which adds to a romantic atmosphere in the town, particularly if one is dining in one of the many outdoor cafes.

Must visit if in Hvar.",Oct 2018
Croatia,tchout02,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"Nice walk above the old town. Great views of the harbor. Fortress is well maintained and sign posts are informative. Small museum with recoveries from local shipwrecks. No exhibits regarding life in the fortresses heyday, 15-16th centuries other than the fort itself. Go for the walk and the views.",Oct 2018
Croatia,Annstreks,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"We were on a five island boat trip and had over an hour to spend on Hvar so we decided to go up to the fortress to get the best views. There's a nice square at the bottom where we managed to buy an ice cream before braving the climb to the top. It's steep enough with some steps but not overly challenging. We had to pay to get into the fortress, around 35 kuna each, depends if you are into history or not but I was more interested in the views from top. We ended the visit with a nice cold beer from the restaurant there, they were getting ready for a wedding, should have been lovely with the views and the flowers and lights all over the place. We didn't see a lot of the town as it was time to get back on the boat by the time we got down, saw enough to satisfy us though.

Croatia,Karval1,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"The walk up is a long one At first there are lots of stairs and you think it is too far to go. Then you get about half way and you are then in the castle park and the path from there on is a slow ramp incline switching back and forth so in the end it is a hike but not too strenuous.

Croatia,scott92,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,My wife and I hiked up to the fortress. It was a moderate stress hike but very nice. The fist part was hundreds of steps in town then trails to the fortress. The views of the area at the top were spectacular. Highly recommend and it is FREE!.,Sep 2018
Croatia,doctoryes,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"Magnificent setting with incredible views. Complex, sophisticated layout and amazing how it could be so perfectly constructed stone bit stone 6 hundred years ago.

No truly guided tours, but easy ambles up and down the stairs to the various parts of the fortress. Everything was great except, oddly, the service in the cafe patio — one of the only truly rude servers (the bartender) we had the whole time we were in Croatia. Kind of surprised since this is one of Croatia’s national treasures. Still, very glad we visited Spagnola.

Croatia,Sonny,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"It’s a great location to just take a moment and absorb the beauty of the town. You walk through a herb garden to reach the top and it’s definitely worth the 15 minute walk. I didn’t pay to go inside the actual castle area as it’s a small section of the fortress which isn’t worth paying for. The views alone are enough, especially if you get the for sunset or sunrise if you can brave getting up that early.

There are quite a few steps up from St Stephens Square however once you get past these its an easy walk - less than 20 mins in total.
You can also drive up if you wish!

On a clear day you can see for miles over Hvar and the islands.",Sep 2018
Croatia,linlou,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,Not as bad of a climb as some make it seem. Definitely nothing like the steep steps on the city walls in Dubrovnik. There are some steps you have to take to get to the path to the fortress but after that it’s a winding path. If someone has difficulty walking then there is a way to drive up instead. It was definitely worth going up. Really great views.,Sep 2018

Croatia,ArlenK,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"If you're visiting during the summer months, definitely bring water along with you as you make the 30 minute hike to the top (not for the elderly or infirm). Alternatively, taxis can take you to the top (but we chose to walk and enjoy the view).

The fortress itself is impressively large, and entrance costs 40 HRK. Inside the fortress itself you can visit the dungeons (scary!) and view some artefacts.

Worth visiting for both the view and historical importance of the site.

Croatia,Christina D,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"40 kuna to enter and well worth the money. The views of the city are breathtaking. The history of this fortress is simply amazing to learn about.

There are a few steps leading up then the rest is a winding path.
We had dinner reservations and due to how hot it was.. we paid 100kuna for the drive up and worth every penny on a scorching day.

We took the path down thinking it wouldn't be so hot but we were soaked by the time we got down. lol

The walk itself takes about 10 minutes to get down. Some say it takes 30 to go up, but that would depend on how slow you are walking as many climbed up much faster.

Croatia,Smith1984,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,We did not pay to enter the fortress but it’s well worth walking up to it for the views you get from outside. There are some wooden loungers at a few points on the way up so you can enjoy a few minutes with your feet up if need be!,Aug 2018
Croatia,Stefano964,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"If you stay in Hvar for some days, you have to visit the castle, either on foot (quite a heavy walk) or by car. View is fantastic and you can see the old city and Pakleni islands. A must to visit.",Aug 2018

While you can go all over the fort and take beautiful pictures, there is only one historical exhibit within the walls of the fort.

Croatia,Jaxamo,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"A must for all GOT fans. I took the number 22 bus from HNK, it costs 22kn for a return ticket. The bus takes you right there. It now costs a hefty 60kn entrance which includes entrance to another place, only really useful if you have a car. Anyway it’s well worth it just for the views. There has been quite a bit of renovation including a small museum on site. It took approximately half hour on bus and another hour and a half to walk around. Take your own water as there is nothing inside, including toilets.",Aug 2018
Croatia,A L,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"Way to much for entrance (40 kunas) and they do not offer anything for that price. Ok, there's great view on the city but still, 20 would be enough. More people would come to see.
With this price they push away famillies. Let's say that familly of 5 need to pay 200kn, almost 30 euros, and for what? Gift shops don't have nothing connected with fortres and that's a shame.",Aug 2018
Croatia,Amit W,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"We travelled with our 6 year old and eventually decided to stay in Hvar.... (as we thought all day tours would be accessible from Hvar port)... but for kids Hvar has really very less (to nothing) to offer... It is kind of party town with several pubs and bar... even the tiny beaches at Hvar town have not much activities... along with food with incredible exaggerated prices.....
I rather suggest make JELSA or better BOL as a base which are very family friendly with several activities on beach and also quite reasonable accommodation and food prices.... the day tours are also possible from this places...or even you can come to Hvar within 15-20 min

Croatia,streetdragon,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"My wife and I walked up from the centre ( I am in my sixties so not too challenging a walk) . The early part of the walk was a bit daunting , with some steep steps but then we got to what was like a slightly inclined walk as if you were heading to security at a busy airport , meandering from side to side as you gently ascended towards the fortress .
This was a hot day ( 30 degrees) but we took our time and steadily made our way up , stopping occasionally to admire the view.
The climb was worthwhile and we were happy to pay our entrance fee before taking a leisurely stroll around the fortress and having a coffee in the outside area of the cafe .
After a brief investigation of the gift shops , we made the return journey , retracing our steps back down to the centre in order to continue our wandering sin beautiful Hvar.

Croatia,insideIAMdancing,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,The fortress and especially the view is really incredible. We went in the heat of the day which was a huge mistake as the temperature was above 30. There is a road up to fortress if you are unable to make the climb,Jun 2018
Croatia,Lowe2785,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"A quite steep set of stairs followed by a walk up a steep hill awaited us to get there.

At the top, 40 Kuna each to enter (£5).

The fortress is impressive and has a lovely bar at the top of it.

The thing that makes this place special though is the views. You can see so many islands and towns it is spectacular and the breeze cooled us all down too.

Well worth the walk and a must if in Hvar.

Croatia,514shannon,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Ferry was late, for Hvar but finally arrived from Split. Our Apartment is close to a track leading down to the local beach,but about 20mins walking from main town. It’s not a beach as we know it at home, can’t really swim, we call it “bobbing about” Heaps of boats moored in the port. Lots of bars, known as a party island & surly waiters but no raving for us.

Now in our Apartment, nice and modern with all the extras, but no cooking will be happening here, best part of travelling.

Walked up the never ending steps of Hvar to the Fortress. Once you get halfway, it becomes a paved walk way. Fantastic views from the top, with the ubiquitous cafe at the top.

Hvar is small, but busy with tours to the outer islands and all sorts of water sports.

Croatia,Patricia M,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Hvar is a great island for a day trip or a vacation destination. We went on a day trip from the harbor area of Split. There a a couple of options, a 2 hour ferry arriving at Stari Grad or a a quicker catamaran into Hvar town harbor. We did the 2 hour ferry about 98 Kuna (£9-10 return). This is a car ferry so you can take your car if you have one. We did not have a car so we opted for the bus to Hvar town. This takes approx. 20 mins. Hvar town is a beautiful little harbor town with the fortress very obvious an easy to get to. If you have mobility issues maybe not so easy as it is a constant climb of stairs through cobbled streets initially, then a hillside slope to climb to the top. It costs about 40 Kuna (approx £4) entry fee. There is a nice cafe and shop at the top for a sit down and recharge. Well worth a visit.

Someone had the ridiculous idea of walking up to the fort. However, even feeling worse for wear, it was well worth the walk up there! The views were absolutely fantastic and provided some of the best pictures from the holiday. Well worth the 40 kuna (about £5) entry.

We walked up there around midday and it was empty. Some ferries must have some in as on our way down we walked past 3 or 4 very large groups (20-30 each) heading up there. So keep that in mind.",Jun 2018

If you want to save the 40Kn entrance fee the views from the top of the path are almost as good. But not quite, and the ""Fortica"" which dates from the C16th is interesting in itself and has a good and well told story. And there is a cafe and a small exhibition to see. But the views are just breathtaking. We just stood and looked and looked..... and of course took selfies!",Jun 2018
Croatia,398lea_,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"We took a walk up to the fortress one day and it was definitely worth visiting. The walk was only about half an hour (not going too fast, you could probably do it in 20 min but we weren't in a hurry).

The best time to go would be before sunset, it was amazing watching it from up there. You also get a spectacular view of the whole town and the Pakleni islands.

There is a little museum up there as well where you can learn a bit about the history of the island. It's also accessible by car but it was a really nice walk we didn't mind at all.

Even if you're only in Hvar for a day, this place is well worth it!

Croatia,kevod83,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,We waited until 8pm to visit the fortress as it was less busy and to catch the sunset. By waiting until this time we misses the busy day tours and had lots of freedom to roam around and view Hvar town and the islands from vaiour sides and turrets. We checked out the dungeons and watched the sunset with a handful of other couples making it very scenic and romantic instead of having to rostle for position with lots of others. To really appreciate the fortress it has to be viewed from both sea level and from within.,Jun 2018
Croatia,akaphd08,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Unexpectedly decided to climb from Hvar Port to Hvar Fortress with a group of friends.

The hike is from the main port area is about 0.5 miles, but it’s an up-hill climb. Still we were wearing flip-flops and it wasn’t that bad, despite the incredibly hot weather (bring water!). You can also drive or take a taxi to the top of you don’t feel like walking... but the walk is interesting and certainly worth the hike. The path is beautiful and there are a few vendors selling lavender, ice cream and water to break up the hike. There are also benches to sit and admire the view on your way up (or take a break!).

Once you get to the top, pay the entrance fee to go into the fortress (about $5 USD). The view is magnificent.

There’s also a tiny gift shop inside, and a nice cafe that sells coffee, wine/beer/spirits, and non-alcoholic beverages, with an outdoor patio.

Highly recommended for all ages.

Croatia,pdxballard,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"The fort sits about 100m+ above the town which it protected from the elevated position. Dating back to 1282 it was finalized in the 16th century. The fort saved the townspeople in a major sacking by the Turks who plundered and burned the lower town in 1571. There’s a small display of artifacts found inside sunken ships located nearby. A few cannons give you an idea of the armaments of the period. The view gives you a great perspective of the larger town which given the hills can be misleading.

It took us about 15/20 minutes to get up there, we forgot to take water which was a mistake as it was a very hot day!

Croatia,Charis,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Didn't make it into the fortress itself, just around it as we went to the wrong pathway that led up but not to the entrance of the fortress. Decided to stop where we were to have breakfast and enjoy the view. Definitely worth the short climb.",Oct 2017
Croatia,chrisandkatyaway,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"The fortress is at the top of a steepish hill- quite simple to access directly from town. Took us 20 minutes from the main square to walk to the fortress.

Very, very pretty panoramic views on the walk and in the fortress- definitely worth the walk!

However, little else to do in the fortress- a small maritime exhibition at the side of the main plaza, but nothing else to see/ do.

A very quick and very pretty attraction that gives great panoramic photos.

Croatia,Larina D,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"So we ended up visiting the fortress at sunset and reached the top just as the sun set, so the view was beautiful.

Croatia,bigaps,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"Visiting the fort is a must if you have time in Hvar. The walk up the hill from town is reasonable and on a nice gravel path. The views from outside the fort are a bit limited by trees, so paying 40KN is worthwhile to get great views and see the fort. The views of the town from several points are great. The fort is interesting but quite barren. The museum only has a few artifacts but the prison gives a real sense of what it must have been like.",Oct 2017
Croatia,David P,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"We visited Hvar fortress and were impressed.

Croatia,adalbert3,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"The fortress certainly dominates the Hvar Harbor, so I cannot imagine going to Hvar and not checking it out. There are the usual cannons and jail cells, but the best reason for the trip up are the gorgeous views. We were limited for time, so we did not walk up.

We walk is great, you really get your heart rate up but it's not too long. It took maybe 25 minutes to get up to the fortress. The views from the top are fantastic.

Takes about 30mins and you'll go up beautiful medieval steps through the city, and a long winding path towards the top. You'll earn your first 3 course meal with this bit of exercise...

The actual fortress has a fee of around £5 to get in, but it's totally worth it.

Croatia,champman99,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"Once you get up all the steps and meander your way round the walk path up to the fortress, you'll certainly appreciate the view down upon the town.

It's relatively cheap to get into the actual fortress itself. Once you're in, there's not too much to do apart from walk about and take in the views.

There's a few touch screen machines you could use but I could get either of them to work to change the language into English.

Anyway, if you have a free hour to kill, head up and appreciate the vista.

P.s. It was so windy at the top on the day we went it was a tad unnerving so just to be aware.

The views from up here of Hvar below are amazing. We went inside an old prison which I found scary as it was very steep & dark downwards. All very interesting & worthwhile.",Sep 2017

Croatia,The Swiss Nomad,Old Town,4.0,"We have been spending at least a few days for the last three years in Rovinj, as we enjoy Istria and it's easily reachable by car and offers lots of accommodation options.
From wherever you approach the city, you will marvel at the skyline of Rovinj, with its church at the highest point in the city, its building straight onto the sea, its cobblestone alleys and tiny shops selling local produces.
This year, because of covid, we tried not to wander too much in the old Town, as it gets super crowded and we thought it not very wise,but otherwise this old town is simply marvelous and worth exploring.
A must if you visit Rovinj, even if just for a day.

Croatia,Eyekaytoo,Old Town,5.0,"We came over here on two separate evenings, parking to the north of the town by the sea and then walked south into the old town. You can take the scenic path via some narrow streets which opens up onto a panoramic view over the sea and then drops down into the old town via some snazzy restaurants and bars perched on the rocks. Or you can walk through/past a small market, short cut the panoramic path and enter the main part of the old town.

This lovely little town has many of the hallmarks of its ancient Venetian past. It is full of boutique type shops, hidden little alleyways and a plethora of bars and restaurants. You soon come to the waters edge and harbour where many small boat are tethered. There is also a good selection of boats offers dolphin watching tours, sunset tours as well as visits to the many neighbouring islands.

All in all a lively, bustling little place which has happily retained a lovely Mediterranean/Venetian character.

Croatia,NomadicTraveller7,Old Town,4.0,"I agree with many of the comments that the old town of Rovinj is very atmospheric and very attractive. Rovinj was the last stop on a long 2 month trip through Montengro, Bosnia and Croatia. In Croatia, our favourite place was Cres, then Korcula. Split was incredible but too busy. The great thing about Rovinj was the absence of cruise boats and hordes of day trippers. We would certainly recommend week there, perhaps in June or September. A day trip on the bus to Pula is essential.",Jul 2019

Enter and wander through the narrow lanes...even the Main Street up to the cathedral is narrow. This is a very quaint little town...laundry outside the windows and friendly cats. Cafes at the entrance are a lovely place to have a sandwich and coffee...lots of locals there in February. Weather was great in February...warm today...sun and wind...beautiful!",Feb 2020
Croatia,Graham S,Old Town,5.0,"The steeple of the church of St Euphemia on the hill ( worth a steepish walk) dominates the town which can be seen from all over. The narrow streets are reminiscent of Porec actually, & climb up past the cathedral via Ul. Grisia & around the point to loop back to the main square via Ul SV. Krizia.
At Krizia area are a couple of rocky coves which I can recommend for a swim (booties required).
Shops & cafes are in abundance: we enjoyed Monte Carlo Bar on the return walk down Ul. Krizia. Sit back & it is so easy to imagine you are scanning the Cote D'azure towards Nice. ( C'mon you might need a Spritz or two ...! )
Rovinj could easily be a 'model' for film locations or Disney towns.
Just perfect.

Croatia,Piggogo,Old Town,4.0,"It was a lovely place! I knew it was going to be touristy from reading up before coming, but still, I loved the vibe when we stepped here! Wide main street with many shops lined on both sides, many restaurants and has a very superb bakery - Mlinar! There was also the Green (Farmer's) Market but I realised not all was authentic - some are not local fruits (seasonal) and looks like it was from the nearby supermarket.

In the uphill part of old town, the alleys are very instagrammable! But the stone floors can get slipper for some shoes so better to put on good footwear. Love to explore the old town as the people there are generally warm and friendly.

Few shops, few restaurants and coffee shops. Church at top of the hill where the best views are. Where was once a cemetery is now a coffee shop, nice place to chill.

Best part of Old Town is the wharf and promenade surrounding. Plenty of boats, tourist restaurants and ice cream shops. Nice stroll to the Grand Park hotel.

Not sign posted well, after reaching the waterfall and a dead end it was either back tracking or up an unmade route by us grabbing on to trees to reach the correct path again. Saying that after over 2 hours later we reached the old town of Labin. It was either due to being a Monday or the end of the season most shops were shut. Fantastic views from there but would recommend taking the bus both ways if thinking of going, unless you are very fit and love hiking on very uneven surfaces.",Sep 2019

Croatia,JooliC,Old Town,5.0,"Piran and Rovinj are similar towns, one in Slovenia and the other in Croatia.

I find Rovinj larger, more active, and more exciting than Piran, with cruises snd activities as well as more restaurants dnd bars.

Piran, on the other hand, is smaller, more elegant, and provides a nice hideaway on the Mediterranean coast.

We wanted to find out where the street went and to just see what was around each corner. It was wonderful taking in the sites as we wandered the area.

It really is a very picturesque town and enjoyable even if you only have a few hours although I imagine it would be fun to stay at least one night. We visited on a hot summer's day and some of the steep streets with their cobbles were quite slippery- I imagine if it rained and with anything other than good probably rubber soled shoes it would be treacherous- would be interested to know how the locals cope. The best way to enjoy the town seemed to be to just amble without a map as there seemed another picture opportunity at every turn.,Aug 2019
Croatia,Ljubica B,Old Town,5.0,"I always come to visit this city for me is one of the most romantics cities in Istria .

Highly recommend it to walk it. Don’t forget your trainers or flat shoes the floor can be slippery since the city is made of stone.
The views from the top of the church to the sea are breath taken don’t forget to reach to the top where the bell tower is .... is a bit stiff but worth it.

You can have fantastic meals in the local restaurants with some good local wine.... highly recommended it to go with the truffles specialities .

The souvenir shops are lovely... they have amazing local jewellery , paints, products made with lavender etc. You can reach this place by bus or car.

Croatia,Tom K,Old Town,5.0,"Considering the fact that we had never heard of Rovinj before going there, what we found on arrival was one of the most charming small cities on the Adriatic. Whilst you will only need a day or two to fully appreciate Rovinj, it is worth adding to the list (alongside Porec and Pula) if you are planning a trip to northern Croatia.",Sep 2018
Croatia,Vad A.,Old Town,4.0,"This is a great one-day excursion: if you stay somewhere in Istria, it will not take you more than 1,5 hours to drive to Rovinj. We went there because it was recommended in the travel books that I had read, and were not dissappointed.
It is not going to impress you with the world-class attractions, but the town itself is very pleasant, the ambience is a mix of Croatian-Italian, the restaurants are nice, and the architecture is all Venetian since Venetians were the people who built it.

If you try (like all other tourists :) to walk all the way to the St. Euphimia church on the top og the hill with its commanding bell tower, the nice way up is by Ul. Sv. Kriza all along the left sea shore (going clockwise on the map).
At the same time I regretted later on that on the way back we (like all other tourists :) took Ul. Grisia as the way back down: it is quite nice, but all you see is other tourists. Take it only if you are hunting for souvenirs - it is much nicer to take the quiet non-touristy streets since it's impossible to get lost: just follow your way downhill.
Anyway, on the way we passed lots of cute backyards, side-streets and other Old World charms (one house's front yard was like a stage ready for the Shakespeare play!).
Together with the nice marina it makes a very pleasant day of exploring (but don't forget to include climbing that bell tower for the view of all Old town!).

One more advice: if you plan to dine out after seeing the Old Town - may be it's better to take the road vice-versa (counter clockwise), because on the Ul. Sv. Kriza there are tons of restaurants with the nice sea views. We dined at the marina, adn the prices were reasonable (for the US) and drinks in a cafe - like wine and spritzer - were 3-4 euros.

Croatia,IN_Travelers47906,Old Town,5.0,"Just about every city of any size in Croatia has an Old Town (Stari Grad) and many of them were once walled medieval villages. Instead of being walled, Rovinj’s Old Town was an island hill until it was connected as a peninsula to the mainland in 1763 by filling in the channel between the island and mainland. As a result, Rovinj’s “old” Old Town is on the hill that was the original Rovinj, but most of today’s tourist traffic is found on the man-made isthmus that was created in 1763 where a beautiful collection of small streets, alleys, shops, cafes fill in the space between the two harbors/marinas that exist on both sides of the isthmus.

So, if you want to see St. Eufemia Church and other ancient landmarks of the original island, you need to work your way up to the top of the hillside, but if you want to shop, eat and/or enjoy the waterfront, you want to stay on the flat isthmus. Of course you want to do both, and this variety makes Rovinj’s Old Town very special, even among all of the other Old Towns to be found in Croatia and the other Balkan countries.

Of Special Note: When we were there in early June, the soft evening light was spectacular and offered some of the most beautiful sunsets we have ever seen. Evening in Rovinj can be a photographer’s dream come true.

You want to give yourself at least two nights and one full day to explore Rovinj’s Old Town.

Croatia,BanatiBarna,Old Town,5.0,"Having spent a couple of days in the old town of Rovinj, I have to say it's a really cute, tranquil town, with lots of great vibes. The cobbled street take you back to an era long gone by. There are plenty of shops selling real quality handcrafted goods (not chinese imported stuff) and you can find lots of great cafés, restaurants lerking in the shadows. The churs on top of the hill is magnificent, and there is a rocky but really picturesque beach on the western side below it. The market is full of quality foods. There are plenty of shorter or longer boat trips you can take to explore the islands in the area. The outer parts of the town are more spatious and therefore not so unique, it's really those tiny narrow streets with colorful windows that set the mood.
I recommend renting a small apartment for a few days and taking in the vibes of the place.
Parking is only available on the eastern end of the old town for 6 kunas per hour (0.5 Euros).

That said, we were surprised how busy it was and how many visitors it attracts each day in the summer. Based on all the cars, it was clearly a Mecca for people visiting the region from Western Europe (Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy), Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden) and Eastern Europe (Hungary, Slovenia, Poland). At times, all the car parks were showing as full and started working on a “one in, one out” basis which could be very slow. That said, a number of the car parks took credit cards (not all) so you didn’t need to go and change money to get lots of coins for the parking.

Would we recommend going - absolutely yes but be prepared for the huge numbers of tourists!

Croatia,goodhikers,Old Town,5.0,"Old town Rovinj is one of the most interesting and beautiful towns in Croatia. Located in Tuscany-like Istria, it has everything a tourist could want: small alleyways filled with artisans, outstanding restaurants with five-star food at three-star prices, a modest beach with crystal clear water, sea port with superb outings, and a great night life.

Note: there is old, old town...and new, old town. Old, old town is basically the hill topped by the church. It used to be an island, but the Venetians filled in the land and turned it into a peninsula. The large square at the bottle of hill by the harbor is this filled-in area, so is the main outdoor market. New old town is the area immediately on the other side winding around the port. Both are wonderful--artisan shopping in old, old town, normal tourist shopping in new, old town.

Suggest a two-day visit...one for the old town, another for the surrounding countryside which includes some spectacular vinyards and restaurants.

Croatia,Masanori D,Old Town,4.0,"Having visited Zagreb, Split, and Dubrovnik as well as Rovinj, I have to say Rovinj is one of the most beautiful places in Croatia, only second to Dubrovnik in my opinion. It's small enough to explore. There are many small cities and towns nearby (e.g., Motovun) to visit if you have a car.

What I did not expect was how overpriced everything was in Rovinj, particularly restaurants. I know Rovinj has been discovered, but it was so much more expensive than I had anticipated even after visiting larger tourist destinations like Dubrovnik.

Practical advice:
1. Avoid the market. Those farmers are very aggressive, and they try to hustle you.
2. If you'd like to have a meal looking at the ocean, do your homework. Many of the restaurants on the water serve mediocre yet overpriced food.
3. Many restaurants only take cash.

Croatia,Zfy Ed,Old Town,4.0,"Comparing to the old towns of other European cities, this one is considered ""less crowded"" and ""smaller in scale"". On the day of our visit, the area was quite ""empty"" and many shops were not in operations. (We visited the area as part of our day tour at around 4.30pm on a weekday). But it was good for us, for we could slowly walk around and enjoy the ""quiet and peacefulness"" unlike other old towns that are so crowded and noisy (and have to be aware of pickpockets).

There were nice buildings around the area, the churches and local government buildings and all dated back quite a long time ago. The small lanes, with shops and eateries on both sides, offered unique and historical background of the city. There were also a number of souvenir shops around.

However, there wasn't any visible public washrooms and so our tour group had to ask a restaurant if we could use their washrooms and offering a ""token of appreciation"" which they kindly allowed us to do so.

Nevertheless, its a good experience for us to be here and walk around to immerse in the Croatian lifestyle!

Croatia,Glyn E,Old Town,5.0,"Our first experience of Rovinj was back in 2016. You won't be surprised that we have returned.

The Old Town is the most interesting part, although the harbour area is also lovely.

It is relatively small although quite a climb to the old church which dominates the area. Bring your walking legs. The ancient flagstones are polished to a high sheen by millions of feet. The finish is attractive, albeit it must be extremely slippery after it has rained, go carefully.

It is a further climb, although you do get fabulous views of the town from the top of the church tower. Some 20 kunahs.

Every nook and cranny reveals tiny shops, cafes, restaurants and even a hotel.

As with all tourist hotpots you will find plenty of tourist tat. Shop selectively.

There are gems, seek out Raku (see separate review) which is run by a husband and wife team of potters.

Being small, it is almost impossible to get lost. The layout can be confusing, and you often come out somewhere you didn't expect.

Enjoy.

Croatia,HvPssptWilTrvl,Old Town,5.0,"Pleasant surprises around every corner, whether cafes, shops, restaurants or bars. The old town is the place to stay if you can; very reminiscent of Cinque Terra. The tourist office in the harbor area, next to Scuba, is very helpful!

The old town does not permit cars and the lots on the entry road just before the ferry dock is 24€ per day.

Helpful hint: we used airbnb and found a residents’ only guest lot close to the discount supermarket for 5€ per day!

Croatia,Ian S,Old Town,2.0,"We visited in a motorhome only to find the only official parking was €3.40 per hour in the furthest carpark from town.
The town itself was quaint enough but twice we walked to the sea via the old town alleys only to find that in 2019 they still flush their toilets into the ocean! The smell was horrendous and the sight was stomach turning.
We wouldn’t visit again.",May 2019
Croatia,Terry G,Old Town,5.0,"Certainly the best place I have visited in Istria. If you like Venice then it is the place for you.
Every step up to the St Euphemia church gives wonderful views of this authentic medieval hill town and harbour.
The church itself has some very Interesting features, particularly the sarcophagus of the saint.
Didn't do the bell tower as I thought it unwise for someone in mid 70s.
Also a warning for oldies - the cobbles back down the hill can be very slippery.

Small town with a hypnotic charm and timeless beauty.
Easy to navigate through, although some skill for cobble stone streets and a bit of elevation is required.
Best to walk through in the early mornings, late afternoons and evenings.
Plethora of food, wine, coffee & ice cream choices, ranging from small, authentic tavernas to fine restaurants.
Great parking facilities by the port - and town is easily accessible by road and by sea equally.
Direct access to Venice is a bonus.

Croatia,222888SL,Old Town,5.0,"It's a such exquisitold town on the seaside of Adriatic Sea. I went to this town by boat from Vrsar. When the boat approached the town, it was a such beautiful sight : old housed crowded together on a small hill from sea to the top, and the bell tower of the church stood proudly above them. Blue ocean glistened under the sun. The streets in the old town is narrow and sometime steep. Houses along the way are old but restored stone houses. Windows are brimmed with flowers render the sight romantic. There are parts very commercial with lots of artisan shops, artist studios. Art lovers have a field-day here. The port is full of yachts. There is a few nature pools formed by rocks in the bay. I'd come back again here and spend some quality time. Love this town!

Croatia,Deborah T,Old Town,5.0,"Rovinj is a wonderfully preserved historic Old Town. The narrow cobbled alleyways and the small squares which have witnessed the turbulent history of the town are full of medieval, gothic, renaissance, and baroque buildings and terraces.

On the northern side, you will find the remains of the walls which used to protect the town’s inhabitants from conquerors and looters. Walking down the old alleys is a very special experience – you will feel like time has stopped and you have returned to the ancient era.

Walking in the historical old town, you will find a new surprise at every step. Small churches, monuments, old doors and arches await behind every corner. Include a visit St Euphemia Parish Church, the symbol of the town of Rovinj at the top of the Old Town while you are there.

Approaching the church harbour side is less strenuous except for the last part where there are a number of steps.
Walking through the old town is fascinating and full of local caricature but a word of caution, large flagstones worn to a smooth service over the centuries forming the towns cobble streets are very slippery when wet.

Croatia,HeinC,Old Town,3.0,"Rovinj is a quaint little town with a long history, but we found it a bit overrated if compared to other similar towns in Croatia. We traveled across Croatia and based on reviews payed hightoll road fees to visit Rovinj and Pula. It was not worth the cost and time. If you pass the two cities nearby, yes certainly pay it a visit.

Rovinj does not have the deep-rooted authenticity as for example Dubrovnik and Split. It will come over time.

The rude waiter at one of the highly rated restaurants on TripAdvisor has nothing to do with the review, but is an example of what should not happen. The account was wrong and he argued with us which pizzas we ordered. He did not want the admin to fix it.

Croatia,Heli P,Old Town,4.0,"The main attraction of Rovinj gets crowded in the August heat, but there are connecting alleys to avoid the rush going up. The area by the port has several restaurants and cafeterias with good views of St.Katarina island, I take my second morning coffee with the newspaper often at Riviera. The many jewellery shops sell mainly imported stuff made in low cost countries such as Turkey, India, Indonesia, I wouldn't much count on the autenticity of so called coral or turquise if it isn't sold with real gold items. You can even go swimming from the steep cliffs of Old town as there are concrete stairs and railings to ease access to sea. This August the water temperature had reached over 25c bringing ugly, brown medusa like creatures the size of a child's head to the surface limiting at least my swimming to mainly floating near the shore.

Croatia,Veronica H,Old Town,5.0,"Rovinj is now a busy port town, evolved over the centuries from a fishing village. Whilst there are bustling bars/restaurants catered to tourists, the town itself is steeped in history. Walking up the stone paved foot path to the church or walking down via the narrow alley ways in between the houses, the sense of history is overwhelming. It almost feels going back in time to follow the foot steps of residents who have live there for thousands of years.

There are some unique crafts shops along the way, selling jewelry, olive oil/truffles, fine Italian linen clothes or other souvenirs. Have a drink or gelato by the harbour adds to a fine end to the day.

Highly recommended if you are in Istria.

The evening is it’s busiest time.

Lots of small boutique shops amoungst the tourist tat selling everything from t shirts to snorkles. The stores selling the local wine and lavender are a delight staffed by lovely but fiercely patriotic locals. Happy to haggle on what are reasonably priced goods. So many restaurants you hardly ever find problems being seated. The restaurants nearer and overlooking the port can be a little more pricey, but then so they should as the views of an evening are beutiful. Street entertainment is abundant with salsa dancing in the square. Take time to climb up to the church of St. Euphemia, often known as the Basilica of St. Euphemia. The bell tower charges a nominal fee to climb to the viewing platform which is well worth it. The church itself is a lovely cool heaven from the town when hot. In all a lovely place inhabited by a welcoming beutiful people.

We spent a wonderful afternoon wandering around looking at all the beautiful buildings & wandering up & down the little winding streets. It was market day & many wonderful local products were on display - nuts, truffle, olive oi. fruit to name a few. The stall holders were very keen for you to taste their products, too keen some of them. We didn't go up to the church, but were told that the views from there are breathtaking.
As my title suggests, beware of the greedy seagulls. They snatched my husbands pizza from out of his hand. I thought it was hilarious, he wasn't so sure, as he'd only had two mouthfuls.

We booked from the bus station with 0-24 Taxi Vrsar. The driver was amazing dropped us off in the old town of Rovinj and he was right in saying it’s the most beautiful town.

On the way back the taxi driver brought us to our hotel. 2 hours later I realised I lost my expensive camera. Call the taxi company and he brought it back to the hotel, so honest I couldn’t believe it. This company is definitely trust worthy 00385989622555

So many great little restaurants- quaint little cobbled streets and an area near the church on the hill with lots of little artistic studios. People are wonderful and town - like- Croatia itself was very clean. Apparently it gets VERY busy during height of the season so we were lucky to be there at the end of April beginning of May when it wasn't really crowded at all. Cobbled streets could cause problems if you have walking difficulties , they are mainly pedestrianised ( except for the push bikes!) and if you stick to the beautiful harbour part the walking is very easy. Do go you'll love it!!! we are going back next year. Only place we've stayed in twice!!!!!

Croatia,alibatty🦇,Old Town,5.0,"Loved, loved, loved the beautiful , cobbled , labyrinthine old town with the Venetian pastel - coloured buildings and wooden shuttered windows with wrought iron doors. Every which way you looked there were interesting alleys & nooks and crannies needing exploring. Even though some of the buildings plasterwork looked in need of some TLC, the distressed- look all added to the bewitching charm of the place. Here you will find many independent and inviting little shops selling all manner of things ; seed-pearl jewellery, ceramics, specialist Croatian drinks, honey, truffle oils - just to name a few, not forgetting a wide range of restaurants and cafe-bars in which to soak up the unique atmosphere.
The whole area is a photographer's dream and full of character. I was especially charmed by the random rows of colourful washing carefully pegged and strung across streets or under windows.
It also seems to be the place to be to take in the sunset - especially at the allocations overlooking the sea. You cannot help but fall under the magical spell of this delightful town.

It boasts mysterious stairways to secret places, cobblestone streets, restaurants and shops a plenty (bustling and buzzing until late), friendly people, a harbour full of boats, breathtaking sunsets, with the church as the pièce de résistance on the top of the hill in the middle of town...

Having a spritz on a terrace bar overlooking the ocean and harbour -with one of the most glorious sunsets I have ever seen - is a memory that will be etched in my mind forever. Could easily spend a month and never get bored - especially with all of Istria so close by - can't wait to return!

Tip: In the season, you can catch the ferry from Venice for around EUR80 return - trip takes around 3.5 hours each way.

Croatia,KemikOjstra,Old Town,5.0,"On the territory of the historic Republic of Venice, many great and spectacular towns can be found. Among the greatest and the most spectacular ones, it is also the old town of Rovinj which happens to be the culture capital of Istria. For a Slovenian, this town resembles much to the town of Piran but is larger. Because of many narrow streets, very nice colourful houses (with many different colours) and coastal position around the Adriatic Sea, this town is a perfect spot and heaven for romantics and lovers from all over the world but also for history buffs and historic architecture lovers who love Venetian history and Venetian architecture styles. The best views to the old town as a whole are from other sides of ports and the best view from above you can experience from the tower of St. Euphemian Basilica on the top of the old town which resembles very much to the St. Mark's Campanile in Venice.

Don't miss the Rovinj Market before the old town where you can buy all sorts of truffle products (forest region around nearby towns of Motovun, Livade and Grožnjan are well known truffle habitats), especially some olive oil with truffle flavour. There are many restaurants where mix of Croatian, Italian and seafood cuisine is served. From wherever you come, you will surely like this beautiful town, a true Venetian gem.

We also loved the Green Market in Rovinj is located in the center of town, a hundred meters north of Marshall Tito Square in the direction of the port.

We were staying at Studios Barbaro (amazing, found them through Booking.com but sadly not on Tripadvisor) at Pietro Ive 5 so the market was just across the street from us. It seemed to be always open (we first visited it at about 7pm on a Thursday night and the gift stalls were all open).

The market is also a great spot for photos along the waterfront. There is also late night stalls that pop up through old town that sell various local produce and snacks - our favourite was the cup of fresh Doughnut balls for 40kn / €6.

Croatia,leonvstaden,Old Town,5.0,"What a lovely little town. The old town is situated on a hill right on the sea. There is a cathedral at the top of the hill and the town developed around the cathedral. The climb to the top is steep, but manageable. Fortunately there are many little shops and old buildings to explore if you need a rest. Once at the top, you can enjoy the breathtaking view over the sea. Try to locate the different islands and follow the boats on the water. I sat for more than an hour in front of the cathedral, just enjoying the view.
Our recommendation is to visit the old town early in the morning, before the tour buses arrive and the air is cool. Afterwards you can relax on one of the nearby beaches, eat at one of the many restaurants. For the naturists, there is also Valalta FKK resort.

Croatia,aesta,Old Town,5.0,"If you are a ""visual only"" tourist, you will miss 90% of the lives presented by history. Great paintings, brilliant sculptures, fine architecture tells us a great deal about the 1% but the lives of the remainder are simply buried under the rubble of broken walls or rebuilt gates. Rovinj is a small town. It has mementoes of history but as you poke about in the Old Town, you get a sense of how average people lived in villages and towns.

In the summer, it's a whirlpool of tourists with an interest in sun and water but come October, the streets of the old town begin to reveal the meaning of its history.

Parking is easy right close to the Old Town and inexpensive. The Old Town market offers truffles in bags and bottles along with other local specialties. You can sit in one of the benches and watch the action in the sea or in one of the al fresco restaurants and watch the tourists go by.

Rovinj is a bit off the beaten track for most tourists but is really worth a visit. From here, you can go for a day trip to Venice.

On the roof, tiles are laid so that they represent the coat of arms of Zagreb (white castle on red background) and Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.

A church that has come to symbolise Zagreb with its decorative tiled roof. Sadly out of bounds to visitors following last year’s earthquake. Spectacular from the outside and well worth the visit. The pathway at the sides of the church are also closed off. Be sure to see the church from the south side.

Brilliant and spectacular. The must see in Zagreb.

Croatia,J H,St. Mark's Church (Crkva sv. Marka),3.0,"St. Mark's serves as one of the symbols of Zagreb. Sitting in the centre of Upper Town, it's impossible to miss this landmark. It's distinct, coloured roof tiles make it immediately identifiable. Another distinguishing feature are the Town Guards posted to it's front door. The inside of the church is very nice, but very small; don't expect the same grandeur or opulence you'd see in a cathedral. Entry is free, though I recall a donation box. The crowds ebb and flow, but as long as their isn't a tourist group going through at the same time as you, it shouldn't be bad. If you're going to be in Upper Town, you're bound to see this great church.
