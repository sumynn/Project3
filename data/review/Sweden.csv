Sweden,DorisHeimgartner,Vasa Museum,5.0,"In my opinion, the Vasa museum is how a museum should be:-). It has this awe inspiring ship on display and super interestig information boards as well as artefacts they retrieved from the water around and within the ship on 4 storeys.
Unlike many other museums, this one's definitely exciting for kids too.

Sweden,Fred K,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I see why this is one of Europes biggest attractions.
Before you start the tour around the ship. Watch the short movie about the ship and the disaster maiden voyage.
I would guess you need 2-3 hours in there.",Aug 2021

Sweden,Torutoper,Vasa Museum,5.0,Amazing museum in which the audioguide brings this ship to live. It's also on of the few museum which might dissappear in x years as it's not sure that they can preserve the ship forever. Very impressive!,Sep 2021
Sweden,Miamiescapee,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Amazing to see the scale of this hand made huge sailing man o’ war. Interesting history of the ship, it’s sinking minutes after launch and salvage operation as well as how the King and his ship designer screwed up by poorly designing this huge sailing ship. The exhibits were gone very well. Must see.",Sep 2021

Sweden,lajmen,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Very impressive, probably would be much better with the story and the guide, but this was not available during covid. Still worth a visit. Unique place, the ship is more than 90% original and the whole project is one of the kind in the world.",Aug 2021
Sweden,Stella,Vasa Museum,5.0,"This is quite a famous museum in Stockholm and I can understand why. It is a very cool place, the most interesting part being the story on how they were able to lift this vessel and bring it back up in the 1960s. It is fascinating to see this vessel up close. The best views were definitely from the top floors.",Sep 2021
Sweden,jputhenv,Vasa Museum,5.0,"The ship Vasa that sank in the 1700 was recovered and restored in the second half of the twentieth century. The Vasa museum holds this restored ship. It is definitely worth visiting the museum to see the size of the ship and learn about the recovery efforts. The twenty minute free movie sums up all you need to know. This won't take more than an hour. So, you can combine this with a ferry trip, Viking museum and a relaxed stroll.",Sep 2021
Sweden,Little_punk_doll,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I went in thinking the museum would only be the boat. Turns out it is filled with informations, rooms, dug up skeletons, and era-related objects. The boat itself is a beauty of craftsmenship.",Aug 2021
Sweden,Vera M,Vasa Museum,4.0,"Vasa was a really nice museum! You can listen to the audio guide on your own device. They really did their best to create an experience and I must say they have succeeded. When you enter the museum, you can see the Vasa right away, to me it was quite impressive. You’re able to look at the ship from different floors and distances. There also were exhibitions about the people on the ship, how the ship is being preserved, etc. I’m not too interested in those things, but it still was fun to learn from.
You can make the visit as long as you want; it took me less than an hour to look at the ship from all possible angles and also look at some of the exhibitions

Sweden,Ghibli608,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I wasn’t sure to visit this museum. I thought: just another ol’ ship.

Boy, was I wrong. This is such an interesting museum. The lay out in very well done with tons of history. I learned a lot about life then in Stockholm.

The ship is AMAZING to see. So impressive. The explanations are available in several languages.

I actually spend 2,5 hours in this museum. That’s how much I was absorbed in getting to know more.

Definitely a museum to visit if you have young adolescent children.

Sweden,globtrotteuse,Vasa Museum,5.0,The Vasa ship capsized and sank in Stockholm 1628. After 333 years on the seabed the mighty warship was salvaged and the voyage could continue. Today Vasa is the world's only preserved 17th century ship.,Jul 2021
Sweden,maglund,Vasa Museum,5.0,"We visited Vasa about 15 years ago and was impressed, it didnt disapponit on this ocassion. We think the exhibition has been added to as new knowledge is uncovered.
There is an educational film on the recovery at the start which sets the scene. That 98% of Vasa is the original adds to its impressiveness, The research into Vasa; the meaning behind carvings, the paint colours, other finds and how the sailors lived it also clearly displayed. We viewed Vasa at diffeent levels and admired it in awe again!
We spent 2 hrs here and if it wasnt closing time, we could have been here longer.
Although Alcogel is deployed throughout and there are signs for 2m distancing and we were there at a quieter time, the pandemic seems to have been forgotten. Not a fault of the Vada museum of course but this seems common throught Stockholm.

Sweden,Gabi,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Very very interesting museum, first you can watch a short 17 min movie about the story of the vasa, than you can walk around.
You need at least 2 hours to watch everything (it closes at 5 pm).

Sweden,jbg74,Vasa Museum,5.0,This is one of the coolest museums I have been in. The Vasa is huge and the museum has five different levels around the ship to give you different views. The accurately painted scale model of the ship is really cool and there are some other interesting items on display but the highlight is the Vasa herself and she is a glorious 17th century warship.,Jul 2021

Sweden,synnøve s,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Stunning museum. A big plus for the fact that they have included a section dedicated to women’s role in the era the museum covers. Loved the fact that due to the pandemic, less people than normal were in the museum. Gave one ample opportunity to really study the exhibits. Also I’m sure it’s better for the ancient ship",Jun 2021

Sweden,jensen,Vasa Museum,5.0,"One of the highlights of my trip to Stockholm. Amazing story of its construction, sinking and recovery. Hard to capture its size with photos. Worth spending a good 2 to 3 hours. Fantastic asset and moment in history. Well recommended.",Sep 2020
Sweden,LOUISE AND PAUL H,Vasa Museum,4.0,"Great museum, fascinating shipwreck. Huge impressive ship when you first walk through the door. Lots of different levels for viewing the ship at all angles. Shame visitors can't go inside it but I understand that it is fragile. Lots of information in the museum. Lots of artefacts that were rescued from the bottom of the sea. Cafe onsite. A short film was also playing with footage of the raising of the ship in a cinema like room. Glad I visited it was fascinating.",Aug 2020
Sweden,Maurice K,Vasa Museum,5.0,When walking in you are greeted by the huge ship that is very nicely restored. The shape of the building makes it so the ship can fit inside pretty comfortably and give the visitor the room to observe the ship from different levels.,Jan 2020
Sweden,Michael D,Vasa Museum,5.0,One of the best museums in the world! Fantastic! It is one of a kind experience with so much history at hand.,Dec 2020
Sweden,Mark_Dornoch,Vasa Museum,5.0,"A fantastic museum even if you are like my wife not interested in nautical stuff. The ship was the pride of the Swedish navy and took 2 years to build. Unfortunately the design was all wrong - too narrow and top heavy with insufficient ballast. On it's maiden voyage in 1628 it sank within a mile of leaving Stockholm harbour.

I saw the Vasa in 1977 and 42 years later was really impressed with the restoration work. They are now looking at bringing the original colours back to life which will make it totally stunning.

The masts of the ship stick out the top of the building which is presumably done deliberately.

We got there when the museum opened which I would recommend as you have the run of the place yourselves. Cost SKr 300 admission for 2 adults

Sweden,mcr14,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Entering the museum the scale of the Vasa is quite a shock. It's huge! There are many levels in the museum to view the ship from different vantage points, letting you get quite close to see some of the intricate details. Displays around the ship recreate the original colours of carvings and explain something about life on board ships of the time with many original artefacts recovered from the site where the ship sank. Highly recommend a visit!",Oct 2020
Sweden,Kaisa,Vasa Museum,5.0,Very well preserved ship and I liked how they've build the museum around it. There was a free audio guide in the website. Definitely recommend this museum.,Oct 2020
Sweden,Debra D,Vasa Museum,5.0,"My husband and I arrived right when the museum opened and stayed until just before closing. We tried to see everything there was, and we believe we did for the most part. We even took a walking tour in English, but at times it was a bit hard to hear. I would go back in a heart-beat to spend time drawing and to contemplate the greatness and the folly of this ship. It truly has a fascinating story that you shouldn't miss if you are in Stockholm. If you are at all interested in sailing ships, this museum is for you. If you are a history buff, you will love this. I expect most people spend a couple of hours and leave, but as I said, we stayed all day and looked at all of the displays. We almost missed one of the most fascinating rooms, a display with some videos and historical items on the role that women played in this time in history. I was very pleased to learn of the importance women played in a time when men were away at war, and how the women stepped up to run businesses and more. It was a small room that we saw as we were leaving, because as you enter, you are overwhelmed by the sight of this huge old sailing ship that sunk on its maiden voyage and after 300 years was successfully raised from the sea that had protected it.

Sweden,Jim Hearson,Vasa Museum,5.0,"... for the ship, at least. The level of detail that remains is truly remarkable - plus hardly any of it has been refabricated, and they've been very honest about the bits that have been.

Aside from the ship itself, they do a great job of telling its (short) story and intended role.",Oct 2020
Sweden,Iulia,Vasa Museum,5.0,"If you are in Stockholm you must visit this museum because it offers you a unique experience. The Vasa is very well preserved ant it takes you in the 17th century, showing you the great power of Sweden royalty was back then.",Oct 2020

Sweden,kissycarol,Vasa Museum,5.0,Seeing the ship fully restored from 1628 as you walked in amazing. Several floors to explore so you can see the ship from different viewpoints as well as interactive things to do x,Oct 2020
Sweden,Luxury traveller,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Very impressed by this place. Obviously the Vasa itself is jaw droppingly impressive, especially given its 98% original, it really is a sight to behold. But the rest of the museum built around it is very well thought out covering the boat itself, the crew, the history, the discovery, the salvage and the ongoing preservation. Great exhibits, the recreations of the crew members are very well done and gives you a good sense of the people who worked on the ship. Been said before but if you are in Stockholm this place is a must in my opinion. My tip would be to try pick a quiet time, very peaceful in the museum when quiet. Would say the same for all museums to be fair, hordes of people do generally kill the experience and I imagine this place gets very busy peak season and hours.

Sweden,Sue149,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Spread over 6 floors, this spacious museum not only documents the building, sinking and excavation / raising of the Vasa but also covers a wide range of sub exhibits. These are wide-ranging from life on board, the role of women at the time and a good display of finds from the wreckage. Static and active exhibits and a really interesting one on researching the original colours of sculptures on the ship. Also, a very good café / restaurant and gift shop.",Oct 2020

Sweden,dhs9909,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Even though the Vasa Museum has only one main exhibit, it is more than impressive. The ship was beautifully restaured and the purpose built museum fits perfectly",Aug 2020
Sweden,Georgios Kouris,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Unlike most, I think that the ticket of some 130 Krona (13 €) is not expensive. The museum is one of the most impressive, if not the most impressive, across Scandinavia. The research that has been done is incredible and the way the ship is presented, with the exact analysis of many different issues, such as how the ship was lifted or the ship's interior, is excellent. What is also amazing is the fact that scientists have been able to accurately depict the crew and the ship's occupants. As you leave the museum, just before you arrive at the souvenir shop of large variety, there is a viewing room where you can watch a documentary about the time and the way the ship was built, as well as the reasons why it sank. I suggest it to anyone who chooses Stockholm for their holidays.

Sweden,Cynicoren,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Stockholm is (well, was) a nice city to visit a tourist. Doesn't have many really big attractions, but the city has a few small one. That being said, the Vasa museum is considered the biggest attraction.
We came in when the museum opened, waited for the guided tour (a must) and then wondered around. When we left, there was a long queue of people outside.
The tour will let you know about everything that happened, but you can also examine some parts of the ship up close, watch a movie about pulling the ship from the sea.
It is well worth getting here, and you can enjoy this museum without having any special affection to ships.

This is one of the BEST museums in the world! Even my museum despising teens LOVED it and we talked all about it at lunch. Sadly, we were not eating lunch at the Vasa Museum since there was not one vegan option, not even plant milk for coffee! Super strange since Sweden is embracing the vegan movement so enthusiastically for the environment. I would have expected several sustainable plant options, not to mention just one, yet even the vegetarian sandwich was full of cheese.

We got to the museum just about 9 am before the usual hordes come and therefore had a very good walk around with unobstructed views of the different parts of the ship and the rest of the museum. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable telling us the story of how it sank on its maiden voyage. This is the only 17th century warship in such excellent condition and ironically the only reason why is because it sank and was buried for 300 years in mud that preserved the timbers! I would recommend taking a private tour with Alla rather than with the cruise line.,Aug 2019

First thing first, check out the activity schedule and plan your intended activities accordingly. The tour which is inclusive in the entrance ticket is informative and interesting, and so is the video. It is amazing how the ship of 400 years old is preserved and to learn about her technology. There are archaeological exhibits on display. The souvenir shop also provides postal service, so you can send postcards home.

Sweden,Worldwide Traveller,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I had not planned on visiting the Vasa museum with the logic being that it could not be worth paying to see an old ship.

I could not have been more wrong.

This is a unique opportunity to see an actual 18th century ship which has been perfectly taken care of and which will afford you a chance to really understand the magnitude of this kind of ships, the terror they must have inspired on the unsuspecting victims of their attacks (saw picture the idea of seeing all those cannons firing at the same time).

While you cannot step onboard the ship for obvious reasons, you can admire it from every single angle. Pictures are allowed too yet I would not use the flash to help preserve this one of a kind ship.

Do go to this museum, you will not regret it. If you have a young child, this is a perfect experience to share.

The atmosphere of the museum definitely matched the Vasa and its history. You pay to enter then have access to multiple amenities such as a multimedia display, free tours, and stories. There are multiple levels in the museum, each with a different focus. You will definitely want to spend 3 hours here! I recommend watching the film, doing the tour, and walking around the place yourself. It is huge, and the amount of effort they put into the museum made it even better. My favorite exhibit was the one about the women and the one about the people on the Vasa. There's a gift shop at the end.

In my opinion, one of the top museums of the world,
I already visited it 4 times and I always enjoy it to the most.
It is the museum, the story behind, the recovery of the ship, the science to help protecting it for the future generations, etc.
I cannot imagine to be in Stockholm and not visiting Vasa.",Feb 2020
Sweden,Simon H,Vasa Museum,4.0,"Interesting place to visit, ship is impressive, nice cafe and all very well organised.

Sweden,De_Dag_Plukken,Vasa Museum,2.0,"Slightly underwhelmed with this. Hyped as the most visited museum in all Scandinavian countries, it must count as a striking example of flawed ship design. The ship is a monstrosity and the museum is funny for showing how the eternal aggressive drive to impress and rule over the other has led to a shameful disaster. It does provide a nice insight into life on a ship. But it’s still odd to do that based on a ship that never really sailed.",Mar 2020

Even if you're not , there's enough well presented and intriguing reconstructions, displays and films to keep the whole family entertained. The actual ship, rescued almost intact from a 300 year watery grave, is awe-inspiring. The second you go through the museum's front door and catch sight of the gorgeous 50 foot-high vessel towering above, you can't help going:""Wow!"" Imagine the Mary Rose, if it had been perfectly preserved and you get the idea. In case that's not enough - the restaurant/cafe does really great cakes!",Feb 2020

Seriously remarkable restoration project— very cool to walk around and look at all the details— there is a LOT to see in here! Personally I had a hard time discerning which of the stations accompanied the audioguide— it would be nice if these were more clearly marked. The restaurant was pricey and the food was not great, but the service was excellent.",Feb 2020

Sweden,mfb632016,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I am not a great fan of boats or naval history. But this is so much more. The Vasa itself is a stunning sight – it is difficult to imagine how awe inspiring she must have appeared on her maiden voyage. The detail of the ship and the lives of those who would have seen her, sailed on her or maybe helped to build her are told in an engaging way. Knowledgeable tour guides (in English for us, but pretty sure in other languages too) explained the background to the Vasa being commissioned and the intriguing elements of the many decorations, her maiden voyage and subsequent sinking. As the ship is so complete this feels like living history involving people we could visualise. We spent a couple of hours but could have spent longer - with the numerous interesting side exhibits (we had to leave for home). Nice waterside walk there for us from our hotel (25mins) gift shop and café. Lots of stairs in the museum but there were lifts too. Highly recommended.

The museum is well organised with free guides at certain times of the day in numerous languages. Theres also lots of boards in English describing each part of the ship and even a section on the women of this time period. There's lockers which can be used for free, which I advise you take advantage of as you can spend a long time here. There's also a restaurant in the museum which seemed pleasant. All in all, I'd love to go back!",Feb 2020
Sweden,yiuyiut,Vasa Museum,5.0,"While doing research, the Vasamuseet has been recommended by many other visitors. I agree it’s one of the museums that is a must-go in Stockholm.

Remember to try to catch a guided tour (included in admission fee) because the history and details that these guides can give you make the whole experience much more interesting. Knowing why and who built the Vasa and why it sank are important information to make your visit enjoyable.

Being winter, there was no line up at the entrance. 60-90 minutes should be enough for the visit.

Sweden,woolwich_boy,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Everyone said ""you must go see Vasa"" but it's just an old boat right?

The trip on the tram in the steady drizzle did not help to set expectations high, the entrance to the museum is relatively low key and there were not many people buzzing around but I gave it a go and paid my money.

After passing a succession of airlock doors you are finally stood in front of the most amazing sight. I cannot overstate just how impressive this boat is, it is incredible.

The perfect combination of conditions of silt, salinity, temperature etc preserved it for hundreds of years until it was raised in the 1950s. The boat is also so much bigger than I expected (it was a warship so I don't know what I expected) but having grown up near the Cutty Sark I thought I knew what to expect, wrong.

I only had a couple of hours to wander the many levels of this great museum and I was very fortunate to tag along on a guided English language tour which just provided so much detail, context and anecdotes to help me understand it all.

Brilliant, it really is a must if in Stockholm. I will go back.

Sweden,Jani J,Vasa Museum,5.0,"The Vasa Museet takes the visitor right next to the restored battleship from the 1600's, which is something that you don't get to experience too often. The ship is unique and the story behind it is indeed interesting.

We visited the museum with the family and the kids (8 and 11) enjoyed the museum too. There's also a movie theater showing a few minute long documentary about the Vasa ship (document available in many languages, also in Finnish, chinese etc.) and a room dedicated to telling the story of the women behind the Vasa ship.

Definitely recommended place to visit, if you're visiting Stockholm! Buses and subway take you quite close - just download the SL app on your phone and use it to navigate and buy tickets.

On entry to the museum the staff seem happy and friendly and helpful. After buying a ticket there are 3 weighty doors to pass through to help with climate control.

The ship is in the main piece as you would expect. With various surrounding exhibits relating to what life on the shop would have been like as well as how they lifted the ship. There are regular short build tours on the museum in various languages with the guilds happy for people to join them in progress. These mainly sum up the meanings of symbols on the ship and how the ship sunk from its construction.

It is family friendly but would also be good for solo tourists too. Would definitely not pass on this one if you are in stockholm.

There was some kind of serve yourself restaurant in the area, quite nice actually and the food was good. A truly wonderful afternoon.

The restoration of the ship, the size of it, actually seeing how it would be living in a ship to how it would look like coloured was certainly extraordinary.

BUT for me certainly, it lacked a certain something. Don't get me wrong, the exhibition itself was awe inspiring. But you may need a fully charged phone to do the audio tour or good wifi (would advise on doing the live tour)

I didn't want to fight for an English guide so I just walked around and looked at the exhibits. Little did I know that some of the topics in this including the Vasa itself would start connecting some mental dots for me later in my trip elsewhere.

The museum spans several levels which allows different vantage points to view the ship's intricate designs. There was an elevator for wheelchair access to the left. There was also a screening room which shows a short movie on the launch and tragedy of Vasa and the recovery attempts. Each level of the museum showcases different aspects of the Vasa detailing designs, recovery methods, history and significance.

Allocate 1-2hr for the visit.

We were absolutely wrong! We spend almost 4 hours here and had to tell ourselves to leave so that we could make it to the other museums. We bought the tickets which was really smooth and then stored our jumpers and excess bags in the free lockers provided. We then headed to wait for the free guided tour in English to know more about the ship. The tour was very enjoyable and allowed us to understand the significance of the viking ship in Vasa. After the tour, we were advised to watch the documentary to see the recovery and preservation process. We really enjoyed it. There were more exhibits next to the boat which you could view and also go to different levels for a better view of various parts of the boat. It is really an amazing place and I highly recommend it.

Yes, the massive ship is impressive and I did find the preservation process as well as how preserved things remained after all of that time under the water fascinating, but, a whole museum on a ship that didn't make it to sea is odd to me. That being said, it was a cold day in Stockholm and not a horrible way to spend a couple of hours but can't imagine going here in the summer (unless of course you wanted to escape the heat).

You enter the museum and immediately you are presented with the ship. No waiting and passing thru smaller rooms for the build up. The Vasa is the museum and the star here.

The entry level of the museum is set so that it approximates the water line of the Vasa. However you can see from the keel to the mast.

The levels above are dedicated to what happened on those levels. IE the lower gun deck is the first level above street level and so on. Each has artifacts and information about that deck of the ship.

The lowest level shows the keel and also is the workshop of ongoing restoration efforts. The museum also has an audio guide program that works off of their website. Your phone become your tour guide for this museum.

The only thing I was disappointed in was that it closed when it did and I still had at least 60-90 more minutes of gawking to do! The ship is a stunning piece of artwork and unbelievable as a time capsule to the 1600s. One of the neatest things they did was build the ground level at the ship's waterline so you could get an idea of just how big the ship was. Unbelievable experience.

Sweden,AustralianOverseas,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I was not expecting to enjoy this quite as much as I did, but it was a wonderfully insightful few hours. A beautifully curated exhibition, with incredible attention to detail. We did the guided tour which provided a little extra insight. If you only have a day in Stockholm, this museum is worth the visit.

Sadly, only Nobel laureates are able to see the interior of the ship, but the gallery layout allows you to experience the views from several vantage points.",Dec 2019

Sweden,Wolfgang A,Vasa Museum,5.0,"We decided to see that ""ship in a musem"" we were told about.

We started with a walk from Gamla-Stockholm to the Vasa-Museum (but 30 minutes)
which was an experience in itself. After arrving some of us where happy to find a public toilet :)

Arrived in the Musem we bought a ticket (normal prices for a musem in my opinion) and enterd. We got to the information desk to check for guided tours and that 20 minute movie alsao were told about. not approaching the indfo-desk right away we lookt at the info screen and were talking with each other in or native language (german) to whcih time we gonna see the movie and other things. After deciding we first wanted a guided tour and then see the movie we approachd the desk, After asking in english for a giuded tour the girl behind the counter repkied to us in german.

We ware pleasantly surprised about that, I mean come picking up on two random peoples language and acoomadoating them in this manner? Respect to that.

The gudied tour (30 min in english) was entertaining and informativ and as we suspected the better choice to do it before the movie (as told by the gudie)

The information movie is available in many differnet languages and subtilte combinations (we chose the german one)

After waling while on our own and look at all the exhibits. we decided to grab a little bite in the ajoing restaurant. It was a warm place with some nice little treats after a few hours in a rather cold museum (it has to be to preserve the Vasa).

All in all a Must see when in Stockholm.

Sweden,Rachel548,Vasa Museum,5.0,"After reading all the reviews, I knew we needed to visit this museum, but we were all surprised by how much we all ended up liking it! We were all fascinated and really got caught up in the story. I do agree with another reviewer who said that there isn't as much for children here as some other museums, but my boys (ages 7 & 8) really found it interesting. There is a small section devoted to children, but they were just interested with the boat itself. My husband and I did a lot of the reading and then summarized for them, and this seemed to work well. The were fascinated by the skeletal remains and everything that could be told about a person just by looking at their bones. We all said that this ended up being our favorite museum of the trip, which surprised all of us.

Sweden,Beach Panda,Vasa Museum,5.0,"The only reason we visited this museum is because we had an hour to burn before dinner. We were incredibly glad we went. This museum highlights Stockholm's strength with museums in general. Every exhibit is bursting with deep knowledge and you come away feeling like you have to know more.

It is amazing how big these ships were and the extent of the ambitions of Empire. I was also gripped by the hardship the average sailor went through. I was amazed at the scientific talent involved in raising the ship, preserving it and reconstructing the sailors from skeletons.

A must see if you are history or science buff.

IMPORTANT: Do not take the taxis back to the city from up front. They are scammers and will ruin your Stockholm vibe.

Sweden,Pamela C,Vasa Museum,5.0,"This museum is really interesting and definitely worth a visit. I would recommend taking the free guided tour. You always learn more on a tour and get more engrossed into the subject matter, and this tour was no different. You can easily spend a couple of hours here looking around, watching the short documentary film about the Vasa and enjoying a nice kanelbulle (cinnamon bun) in the cafe, although the tour guide did say that the museum is extremely busy in summer months so your visit may be limited at these times. The cafe doesn't have much vegetarian food, so if you're vegetarian or vegan you're better off eating in the main part of Stockholm before/after your visit.

Sweden,Wombat AUS,Vasa Museum,3.0,"It's hard to go to Stockholm and come away and not be able to tell others that you have seen the Vasa, but in reality it's nothing more than a monarch's folly in a dark, noisy and crowded shed.
We had a guided tour which was probably the best way to see the Vasa and we got a good deal of the history of the ship and as importantly its restoration and preservation.
My travelling companion first saw the Vasa in the 1980s and at that time you climbed scaffolding in an atmosphere of 110% seawater, that might have been more fun.
The fact that there is so little damage after 300+ years underwater is fascinating and the detail especially on the stern is superb.
I'm not sorry that we went, but I had to bail and go outside and sit on the grass before the tour ended as the noise and dim lighting was beginning to stir up a phobia or two.

You can walk up several levels to get different views (yes there are elevators too). It’s a nice walk from downtown Stockholm - just to follow Google/Apple maps.

The work that had gone into building the ship in the first place and then to raise it 300 years later was amazing. Great place to take kids.

To spend so much time and money on constructing a vessel that sank on its maiden voyage some 1500 metres from the start in the harbour must have been regarded as a complete disaster - yet no one was blamed for a design that could never have floated yet alone be a warship. Amazing.

See the move that continually runs before setting out across the various levels of the museum. It'll wet your appetite and you'll understand (and appreciate) it more as you go through the exhibits. VERY IMPRESSIVE and such a monumental undertaking. Good for all ages young and old.

Unfortunately, my photos didn't turn out very well because the ship is so massive you'd have to be able to stand far away to get it all in and the lighting inside is fairly dim.

One negative experience. When you get off the trolley, the signs point you down the street, then to cross, then to walk back against the direction from which you just came....a ridiculous route. Instead, when you get off the trolley, cross the street and go behind the big art museum building and you'll find the Vasa Museum is right there!!

There are a lot of artifacts on the different floors of the building. Be sure to go to the 7th floor in the back of the ship( you can’t go to the front) and look down the whole ship. You are not allowed on the ship and there are workers on the ship keeping her together. There are bathrooms and lockers but I don’t remember any restaurants inside, there were food shacks outside but they are closed for the winter. It was an enjoyable museum.

If you visit Stockholm or maybe this could be a reason to visit, I highly suggest stopping by the Vasa Museum.",Oct 2019

Sweden,Helen R,Vasa Museum,4.0,"Spent a good few hours here on a rainy day. Despite some of the 1 star reviews, we thought it was an interesting museum. We didn't watch the video or do a tour of any description, but instead wandered around reading the info and looking at the boat. To be honest, that was enough for our 6 year old; you don't want to overwhelm them with info. She read the boards and we looked at the features of the ship and learnt about 'the olden days'. The exhibitions to the side were good - skeletons of people found and how they might have lived - and the set up of the officers' quarters that you could explore.

The downside for us was that the cafe had a really long queue for lunchtime (across a couple of hours). They could really do with a separate cafe where you can just grab a coffee, but instead it's all in one so people queuing for lunch/food as well as a coffee. Woudl recommend taking your own lunch/snacks as there is a picnic room/area on the entrance level including water available for all (if you have a bottle to fill, this is handy)

The museum is great value for money. Adults were about Kr150 and children under 18 years were free.

We watched the film to understand the story and we joined an English language tour. Both lasted 30 mins and were well worth doing.

Would totally recommend this activity.

It's mind-boggling to see the work that so many people have put in to bring the ship back (almost) to its original condition.

Sweden,Pr0fess0rn,Vasa Museum,5.0,"This is just one off those places you shouldn't miss while visiting in Stockholm. Great museum if you can avoid the bus loads of tourists that often take over this museum. This ship is sadly rotating away and will only be available to se for a limited time as an object. The moment they toke it out of the sea the process started.

Great place for a family to go one afternoon, as well for a couple that might want to see something different. Fairly easy to reach due to its central location with many comuter options available.

If there are big tours in town the charm of the museum can be lost so call ahead and try to visit it when there isn't to many people there at the same time.

Sweden,miowmiowmiow123,Vasa Museum,3.0,"The exhibitions were breathtaking - besides the ship itself (amazing efforts to maintain, well done to museum for that!), there were many small collections of preserved objects and small interactive set-ups. Insanely interesting!

However, I must say I found the layout of the museum very confusing. A map was given which had different areas numbered, so that you could walk over to the different sessions in order whilst listening to the accompanying audio clips. The numbered areas were not labelled accurately on the map, and were not at ALL visible on the exhibitions themselves. I had to skip a few audio chapters because I simply could not locate the displays for them. Also, lighting was quite dim which gave a nice ambience to the place, but made it near impossible to use the maps provided. I had to use my phone's flash lighting often.

The fact that audio guides could only be used via your own smart phones meant my mother could not listen to any as her phone battery had died off, another inconvenience.

Furthermore, the audio was online available once you're connected to the museum's wifi, so you could imagine my frustration with the skippy wifi coverage! It kept disconnecting and I had to set everything up again. Very annoying.

Overall I would give the actual exhibitions 5/5 but 1/5 for organization and layout. Unnecessarily wasted lots of time trying to find my way around.

Most of the displays on the preservation efforts were boring, as were the other displays. This is a quick museum that takes around two hours to see everything. It is strange that this is considered the main tourist attraction in Stockholm when there are so many other things to see and do. I was expecting more for the #1 attraction. This museum ranks low on my list of best museums.",Oct 2019
Sweden,David & Patsy,Vasa Museum,5.0,"My Friends live in Stockholm and they asked me what do you fancy doing. My friends had visited Stockholm, but I could not go for other reasons. So I was thinking and I remember my friends saying if I ever visited Stockholm that they said you must see the boat and I was thinking what just a boat and I thought of Vikings and Long Boats. My friends from Stockholm with the 3 children and me and my partner chose to go. I was very apprehensive due to me not doing any research. So in total there was 4 adults and 3 young children. We paid the fee and it was very reasonable the children were free and it was only us adults to pay. We were not expecting too much when we saw the most beautiful preserved boat you could imagine we were in awe what a sit to see a fully intact 17th century ship what a great fantastic site for our eyes. My apprehension faded when my friends said this is great wonderful and I knew then I had chosen well for all of us. The Vasa that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628. You can see all the outside of the boat and you can see the decks. The Carpentry on the boat is too a very high standard and you can imagine the ship wrights working away. These guys are trained to the highest standards in the 16th century I am not too sure if we could do the work to such a high standard. We did not have enough time to digest all the features and mini exhibitions of the Vasa within this wonderful well executed museum. We spent 2 hours and that is not enough you need more than 3 hours plus to appreciate what a marvel this ship is. They have Skeletons of the crew who died with the ship 53 lives. Around the ship are numerous exhibits and models portraying the construction and the personal who worked on this vast ship. You can see the sails from the Bow to the stern. The ship is very narrow for the size of ship and is top heavy and this instability caused this wonderful ship to sink. There are places for a bite to eat inside the museum or a bite to out just outside the museum so chose the later the reason was to see more of Stockholm and its beautiful buildings. There are lockers provided for coats and valuables, which we all thought was a great idea. I have been to the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth and that is mouth watering, but hand in heart I would say this just wins mainly because this ship is in full preserved condition. Just go and be as excited as us all and the other thing we will be visiting again thanks Sweden and Stockholm for making our short trip a wonderful time. We will return :-)

The retoration of the Vasa has been carried out superbly and its sheer size is awesome; the quality of the original ship is brought out magnificently, and the multi-level viewing floors, plus the (free) guided tours, bring home the scale of what has been achieved.

5 minutes cue when we arrived exactly at 10 when they opened.

Once inside we saw 3 lines. The group one, one leading to ticket machines. Since we had bought tickets online we picked line 3. People here seemed to go straight in.

Anyway. When we reached the end of the line we reached a dead end. We slipped under one of the cordons and was met with a stern “WHERE do you come from” we really didn’t know how to respond. Country? Place of birth?

The person pointed at the cordon and in a shrill voice exclamated “THIS is a BARRIER!!” 3 times.

Then he quietly scanned our tickets and let us in, only to a few seconds later again yell at our backs “A BARRIER!!”

I guess that’s a Swedish power trip.

Anyway, once in the museum is amazing. Well worth the cheap cost. One can easily spend 3-4 hours here if one is interested in history. Or still get the highlights in an hour if you’re here with impatient kids.

When we entered the building, the first site of the Vasa ship in subdued lighting took my breath away. Almost ghostly in all her magnigicance and we were fortunate it wasn't too crowded. There are different levels where you can view the ship and there are constructed areas around the building where you can see what life was like on the ocean waves in their day.

Whether you are a history buff or have zero interest in history or ships this is an absolute must-see. The reconstructed ship is astonishing and the building is exactly the right setting for it. You can walk around the Vasa at all levels and you really get a sense of just how huge impressive it must have been when it was launched. The craftsmanship on every bit of it is hugely impressive and the supporting information, exhibits and films are first class too. A must see!",Oct 2019
Sweden,Roger D,Vasa Museum,5.0,"The museum is super, the exhibitions very well laid out, and the whole building is very accessible. But avoid cruise ship tourists. When we came there, there were several groups of cruise ship tourists there at the same time. And when you are in a big concrete building the noise from all the guides shouting at each others groups were almost unbearable. The museum should have given them all audioguides, which were available for several languages. Or they should have given the groups theit own slot times at the museum. The behaviour of the guides were also very unpolite, and I was elbowed to the side by a passing Chinese group. The movie at the ground floor was very informative and is recommended.

Detailing provided at each places related to all the events happened with VASA can easily interest even for not interested persons.

This is must visit places in Stockholm and yes it would take time also so I would recommend to purchase ticket online and have at least 2-3 hours minimum for visit.

It has a cafeteria, you can have refreshments and even have a lunch also here, Carrot cake is must to eat.

Souvenir shop outside the museum is also good but a lit tile bit pricey but do visit.

I would advise everyone to go and visit VASA museum.

There is also a small cinema where they show a movie about the history of the ship. This is defenetly must seen in Stockholm. Just be prepared for crowds inside, so plan an earlier visit.

Sweden,NikoliGogol,Vasa Museum,4.0,"We had a guide with us for the visit. Apparently this ship on display had all the features and weaponry that were desirable in a ship in the 17 century. Unfortunately the engineering work was not well-thought-out and the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. It was quite well-preserved under water and then salvaged. The ship is now on display. Original wood is used and those areas restored can be differentiated from the original construction.

The only quibble I have is that there is little room to observe the ship as a whole. You certainly can get very close to it but the ship is hard to see the full profile.

Styrsö's Stora Rös has incredibly 360 views of the island and surrounding harbors. The other island we visited, Brännö, has fewer homes and is noticeably motor vehicle-free. It has a nature reserve that is a decent walk from the ferry stops but provides beautiful views, a couple of beaches, and a few bird and sheep friends. The island is charming and picturesque and is a joy to just simply walk around. Before going to either island or once you get there, take note of ferry times -- they can come once an hour or some stops close after a certain time. We made the mistake of planning to leave from one stop in Brännö without realizing it closed early and had to walk across the island to the other stop when we were tired and hungry. Not a ton of restaurant/food/bathroom options on either island, so plan accordingly or take advantage when you see them!

The ferries are not very well labelled and it is confusing which ferry goes to which island. Suggest you ask locals who just board the car ferries when you are at the ferry terminal.

For some reason the day we went, there was no ticketing and did not pay for the trip there and back.

Hono is an island not far from where we started. We paid for a bus ticket which took us to the other side of town where all the restaurants and cafes were. Because we went there on a Sunday morning, not many things were immediately open but we managed to find a small cafe which served delicious meatballs.

The whole area of Hono is absolutely gorgeous and is worth the trip from Gothenburg city centre. If you have a drone- do take the chance to send it up around this island. Absolutely amazing shots!

Sweden,Danks Knows,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"At the entrance to Gothenburg harbour there are two archipelagos: the southern and the northern. The southern is the easiest to visit from downtown Gothenburg. Go to a 7/11 store and purchase a 24 hour transport ticket, this covers, buses, trams and ferries and costs 95 KR. In the centre of Gothenburg take Tram 11 to Saltholmen, the final stop. Here you will find three ferries to the Southern archipelagos - they go to different islands, the ferry numbers are 281, 282 and 283.
These ferries stop at several islands and with your 24 hour ticket you can hop off and hop on the ferries to see as many islands as you can.
We did 281 to Vrango one day and the next day we did 283 to Branno Rodstan - both were great days out. The 281 takes over an hour and stops at five different islands along the way. Whilst the 283 to Branno stops at one other island and only takes about 20 minutes.

Sweden,Machotraveller,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"The trip to Branno Islands is a refreshing one day excursion to a virgin beautiful village community with cute and beautiful houses and nice trekking paths. One has to take a ferry from Santholmen to reach the islands which in itself is an experience, watching the frothy sea and seagulls flying about. If you have a one way ticket from the city (Gothenburg) it works to transport you by bus, tram and the ferry as well if you are within its 90 minute time limit. If you have a day pass then its no issue.
Santholmen itself it is a sight watching hundreds of boats moored on the jetty. At Branno you get down and take one of the paths where you can trek for whole or part of the day. If you have carried lunch with you its still better but there's also a restaurant and bar available on the island. We had a hearty lunch sitting on the rocks enjoying the breeze and watching the blue sea.

Sweden,rapariga_madeirense,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"This was my top experience.

Go early. Check ferry times, or you might get stuck on the islands.

Make sure you take water, good shoes, a cardigan, and food. Only found one food store on Vrango.

I liked Vrango, its a small island, easy to walk around. Great views. Great signage.

Danso is bigger, i got lost. Found it confusing. Lacking in signage

Styro was another favourite. Walked to the highest point for an amazing view. Stick around for sunset, you won't regret. I was there alone. It was surreal

Be aware, finding bathrooms on the Archipelago, is a nightmare. If you find a cafe, buy a drink/ icecream to get access to there bathrooms facilities

Sweden,Helen C,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"This was my favourite day when I was in Gothenburg. I used my 3 day travel card to access the ferries. I used an online timetable to get the times of the ferries, and although it was the current version it was somehow wrong. I recommend picking up printed copy from the ferry terminal which had the right times. It took an hour to get the southern most island, Vrångö. I spent the longest time here just exploring. I loved how small all the islands were, and how everything is walking distance. There are no cars on the islands, just golf buggies. I also visited Donso and Styrsö. All the islands were really chilled and relaxed, which led to the perfect day. I took a map from the ferry which had the walking trials and roads marked. All the islands had public toilets of some description. A must do when in Gothenburg.

Sweden,Resiak85,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"A good way to spend 1 or 2 sunny days in Gothenburg. Buy a Vasttrafik travelcard so you can take the tram to the Saltholmen ferry terminal and then travel from there to the islands of your choice.
We decide to visit most of them and, even if they have a lot in common, each of them has something peculiar. Our favourite were Köpstadsö and Galtero. Köpstadsö is less known to tourists that don't usually stop here but it has a lot of charm with a few narrow streets where no cars are allowed and locals use wheelbarrows for transportation. Galtero is a completely unspoilt island and a nature reserve where visitors will find wildlife (sheep and birds) and can enjoy long trail walks.
Tourists usually stop at the bigger islands (Brännö, Styrsö and Vrångö) that also offer nice trail walks but are much more spoilt with buildings all over the place. On these islands though visitors can find a few shops and restaurants while the smaller islands are mainly for locals so walking around is the main/only activity.
Whatever island you choose to visit, I recommend you take one of the trail paths and go looking for secluded bays and beaches.

We first took the direct ferry to Vrango and although there were a lot of people getting off the ferry they just melted away within a few minutes of landing. Many locals go to this island to be by the sea. We took the southern nature trail and found it very relaxing and peaceful after being in the city. Word of warning though, use insect repellent!! I was badly bitten even under my clothes. my wife however did not get bitten. From Vrango we caught the ferry to Styrso Skaret and another nature walk. Ferries run regularly between the islands late into the evening so there is no fear of being stranded.

It is a beautiful place, where we even saw a deer in someone's yard (How did it get here?) There aren't that many residents or tourists, and almost all the traffic was 4-wheelers or bikes.

Sweden,kay186370,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"I got a day ticket (get the one for travel not attractions), took the number 11 tram to the ferry departure point at Saltholmen and took off for a wonderful day. Depending how long you want to spend at each island you can easily visit two or three, four at a push if you start early. The ferry boats and trams run late into the evening, and it stays light until 10:30 in high summer. Or just go to one island and languish there all day there if the weather is fine.

The ferry trips are quite short, 10 to 40 minutes crossing calm waters (the area is quite sheltered I cannot say whether it ever gets choppy). The first island I chose to stop at was Styrsö which is just beautiful, all of the islands are quite low granite islands with attractive villages and lovely cloastal walks and stunning views. Very easy walking but you do need to walk quite a bit if you visit a couple and want to see the best of them. Spectacular natural beauty will surround you all the way!

Cafes with outdoor seating areas offer refreshments with stunning views. No cars, golf carts, buggies and bikes provided transportation but exploring on foot is fabulous. I crossed the bridge to Donsö, a much smaller island, also with a lovely village, bathing areas, a cafe, and a grocery shop selling excellent provisions. Great if you want to pick up items for a picnic.

Lovely areas to explore, the town is charming and the full beauty of nature is all around you. Enjoyed a late lunch at Styrsö Bratten, the main village, before walking the picturesque lanes to Styrslö Tangen and taking the ferry to Brännö. (The name means burnt, looking at it I cannot think why this name has been chosen - I am sure there must be a good reason though.) Styrsö and Brännö both offer the possibility to get off the ferry at one place, then to walk to another port to pick up a ferry to another island. Although these islands are granite outcrops which they are amazing lush and green with beautiful trees and gardens. All of the islands feel like places which time forgot which makes them very precious in today´s world.

For me Brännö was the most glorious but they are all really special. I arrived after the local museum had closed (it closes at 15:30, but just enjoyed the nature and a visit to the bathing beach close to Husvik, the port where the ferry from Styrsö comes in. The trees provided much needed shade in places as I explored the lanes (again no cars other than service vehicles) on the way to Rödsten, the ferry port on the other side of the island. Brännö offers many walks around its coastline and also through forested areas. A day or longer visiting Gothenburg (Göteborg) Archipelago is highly recommended. I would suggest choosing Brännö if you just want to visit one island.

Tip: Dress for the weather, comfortable footwear is essential but hiking boots are not really necessary in summer. Consider your sun protection needs in summer you will be very exposed on a fine day.

Tip: there is parking at Saltholmen but at busy times it can get full so the tram is recommended.

It wasn't the best time of year to visit Donso - althoguh the smokery was open, not much else was - but the restaurant by the ferry dock on Vrango was perfect. The islands themselves are fascinating - quiet, wild, but inhabited with friendly people going about their business, so you feel that you are in a real, working environment. There are no cars here, just golf buggies and trikes; there is the odd shop, and a few churches, and beautiful neat houses. There is clean sea water and silent beaches. It is an utterly unique atmosphere and if you do one thing outside the city during a visit to Gothenburg, you should explore these islands.

Sweden,Skye Coote,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"I had read the other reviews that assured everyone how easy it was to access the archipelago, but I was a little hesitant, not speaking the language, but it is very simple.
I caught the #11 tram from Brunnsparken (which was close to my hotel). This is a major transit hub, right on the main canal,so very central. You can buy a travel card at an information centre or there is a vending machine on the tram (takes credit cards only). A 24-hour pass costs 95 and lets you travel all forms of transport, including the ferries.
Take the tram to the final stop at Saltholmen, which is the ferry terminal.
From there, pick the ferry that goes to
Your island of choice. The ferries are all clearly signposted with the names of the islands and whether they’re direct it via another island.
The trips to the islands is quick and smooth. The ferry has a toilet on board but nothing to eat/drink.
I had a brochure on the islands from Tourist Info, which helped me chose which ones to visit.
Most islands have toilets and my 2 (Styrso and Vrango) had cafes (although not all of them were open on a weekday)
Getting back you can take the tram,but it can be standing room only, or there are also buses back to Brunnsparken

Sweden,RLH1955,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"Quiet, calm islands, but do your homework...either do-it-yourself with a Tram 11 ride and Ferry ride (part of the Tram card system) or there are tours/guides (we did not use). Buy the one day or three day Tram tickets in the convenience store at stations, or on-line. Pretty easy, cheap too.

Some of the ""easy Ferry service"" runs only a few times a day, so your quick trip can be extended a couple of hours. Hit the Ferry before your choice of line leaves, and pre-paln a return. We did a quick run on a Monday, walked the island of Branno south and then back in about an hour. Grabbed a late lunch back in Gothenburg.

The restaurant options on Branno, are more than limited, kinda just one, and it is closed Mondays. There is a small convenience/grocery store mid island.....

Bring your own activity, from bike, hike, beach, etc.,and on a hot sunny day, bring some shade, water, and sunblock. There are restrooms, but consider it all free ""no services"" beaches.

Great if you like rustic rocks, sea splash, harbor views. If you want to eat overlooking the water, bring your own picnic and cooler.

Travelling on my own, I was a bit worried about getting there and what to expect but it was very easy. I got tram 11 from the city centre and it didn't take long before getting to the ferry port. There were a few boats going out and I didn't really know what was what so just got on the first one. It was incredible but very very cold. I perhaps should have taken note that part of the sea was frozen so standing outside on the boat was not the best idea I've had. Because it was still winter, everywhere seemed quite quiet but this meant the whole experience was very peaceful and I felt I got a good helping of fresh air! I think it would be amazing to visit in the summer when people are swimming in the sea and there's probably a lot more going on.

There a fast boat to this island, not stopping at all islands before if you prefer. The boat takes you to the eastern side (and here is a café), but walk just across (about just 800 m) to the western side. Here you will find the harbour for fishing boats as well as the harbour for private boats, which is pretty busy in the summer time. There is a pir and here you have a wonderful view of the sea (and Vinga lighthouse far away).

It was perfect weather, and we loved the scenic ride on the ferry--you get to see the other islands on the way there and back. Vrango itself is walkable and very scenic, well worth a half or even full day (though there is not much to do besides walk, as far as I know). Depending on the time of year, you can have lunch at Fiskeboa restaurant.

For those like me who worry about availability of bathrooms, there are 4 clean WCs across from the rental office near the restaurant, and I think there are also WCs near where you get off the ferry.

We were staying near Brunnsparken so took the #11 tram to the Saltholmen Ferry Terminal. We took the 5 pm ferry back from the island to Saltholmen, and when we got to the #11 tram found it very crowded (I think because we had gotten the last ferry).

We repeated this on the next island and then took a ferry back to the main dock and a trolley back to the city center. A low cost way to see some beautiful scenery!",Nov 2017

Sweden,breadfish,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"I asked the locals if I could visit Vrango in half a day's time. They told me yes! But what I have learnt is, do find out the boat timing. From Elite Park Ave Hotel, I took 2 trams and reach the Saltholmen boat terminal. It was a comfortable ride going into the suburbs area seeing the locals houses etc which took about an hour.

However one needs to be mindful of the timing of the boats, otherwise you may spend unnecessary time waiting. I bought the Travel card which can be used for trams, buses and boats. Highly recommended as that is hassel free and worthwhile as long as you do 3 trips in a day.

The boat is new and very comfortable. It takes abt 1 hour to get to Vrango one-way. Do plan ahead so that you have enough time to explore the islands. There were a couple of other stops on other islands along the way. Lovely day to go out to the islands.

Sweden,nysingle,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"Going to the archipelago is a ""must do"" for a tourist in Gothenburg, I suppose, especially if you have the transit pass. The boat rides are worth the pass $ by themselves.

Basically, you take a boat onto these cute little islands and walk around. Most of the walking is on local streets, though there are some nature trails as well, but they are a little out of the way).

I went to Branno and Styrso. I found them to have pretty different characters. Branno is quieter. Styrso is more populated and has more roads. The islands are pretty small, not even two miles from one end to the other I think. There is not a lot of services on the island, so bring water / snacks. A boat schedule is useful as well, though even in late September, the boats ran fairly frequently, at least once an hour.

The tram to Saltholmen (from city center) is longer than most of the boat rides, fyi.

Sweden,MaxMaxi,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"The Southern Archipelago is a magic collection of small rock islands with tiny villages
that are bustling in the summer and very quiet in the winter. The islands are best
experienced by taking a stroll along the shore and through the little towns.
You can take many miles of nature walks, or relax at the harbor bar.
Each island is unique and has its own charms. You will need at least
half a day to explore the entire archipelago, but I would take a whole day,
spend time on each island and enjoy the views. it is definitely worth it.

The islands are easily accessible by taking Tram 11 from the city center to
the harbor and then boarding the ferry. The ferry is included in the tram ticket.
If you get a day pass, you can hop on and off the tram and the ferry boats
as often as you like.

Sweden,GoAlong2,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"On a sunny fall day, I had a great trip to the islands. It is easy to get there from Gothenburg by taking tram 11 to the end and hopping on the ferry. The same tram ticket can be used to get onboard. I took the ferry to Styrso, the largest island in the southern archipelago. The northern part of the island has a village of quaint houses and gardens with paths winding through them. Most people use electric golf carts or bicycles for transportation. Walking south along the shoreline I went up a trail to a viewpoint then continued up to the top of the highest hill on the island with views all around of the other islands and the open sea. The islands are glaciated and rocky; reminding me of the coast in Maine. Light forests cover the slopes. This island has a couple small cafes and a grocery where picnic supplies can be purchased. It is easy to spend 3 or 4 hours here. Heading back to town on the boat, a group of school kids came on board to commute home to nearby islands that we stopped at on the way back. This is a great way to spend a sunny afternoon.

Sweden,Mickyta1,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"The Gothenburg archipelago is a great place to go for one day trip. You can take a tram number 11 directly from the city center to Saltholmen and take a ferry to the southern islands. It would take around 30-40 minutes for travel. On the island, you can walk around, find a place for a picnic, or take coffee in a Cafe. I recommend stopping at Styrsö Bratten or Vargö. During summer, you can take a ferry back and forth directly to/from Stenpiren - City center.",Jun 2017

Not that many places to get food/snacks/drinks (especially off summer season) so come prepared if possible. Very refreshing day/weekend trip.",Sep 2017
Sweden,KafftheWaff,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"We caught the number 11 tram down to Saltholmen and as we approached the terminal a ferry was about to leve so we dashed onto it not knowing where we were going. The destination was Branno. We disembarked, and wandered slowly over to the other ferry terminal on the opposite side of the island. It was a gentle 2.5 km stroll. The housing is lovely, all different and as there are no cars it was peaceful. Nothing much happening at the far terminal so we headed back via a local hostelry for a glass of the local beer - very tasty.

As we still had time to spare we took the ferry back to Saltholmen and then another ferry to Vrango which stopped at Donso on the way. Vrango was a bit disappointing. We walked across the island to where we thought there was a restaurant but sadly it was closed. Again there are no cars which is lovely but the island felt more like a holiday village with similiar shaped, newish houses crammed into the space available. But lovely just to wander round with only cyclists or scooters as the means of transport.

Ferries were clean, fast and included in the travel ticket. Travelling through the various islands was peaceful and the sights beautiful.

The first one was - Kopstados
2nd- Styrso, this is the largest of the southern Archipelago and rather lovely. We hired bikes and rode up the the highest point, which gave beautiful. Jews out over all the islands and out towards Norway. We walked the whole island but there are three different stops for Styrso, which I recommend you take. By the time we found somewhere to eat after walking for miles, I nearly ate the waitress!!! The houses are stunning and I loved it although traveling around with a 13 year old probably is g a great idea!
The 3rd island was Branno and this was great too.
The ferry was Saltholmen was super easy to get- they run till midnight and you can hop in and hop off. It cost about 250 ark which was about £25 for the three of us for 24 hours.

Sweden,KEJ1964,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Take a number 9 or 11 tram from the central station to Saltholmen and you'll find yourself at a sort of bus station for boats with ferry services to various islands for the same price as a bus ticket or included in a day pass for Gothenburg public transport. Some meander around several islands and some are quick direct services.

We went to Vrångö which is the most southerly inhabited island. A large part of the island is given over to a nature reserve but there is a fairly substantial village with a couple of restaurants and a well stocked shop. Where the ferry comes in you come to one restaurant straight away but the main village is the other side of the island about a ten minute walk. There are no cars but look out for bikes and the odd moped.

Gothenburg natives flock to the beaches here on nice summer days. If you turn left from the ferry you rapidly come to the most popular bathing area. This is great for families but for adults who want deeper water to swim in go straight ahead partly across the island then turn right ( north ) , walk up past the old graveyard towards the northern part of the nature reserve and you will find a bathing spot with the mix of smooth rocky outcrops and areas of sand which is typical of this part of Sweden.

The marked paths through the nature reserve looked tempting but we didn't have time to explore them.

I would love to return for a longer visit.

If you have the full day ticket, it is valid also for the ferries, so no additional charges. It is so quiet, lovely, dreamy, clean and out of space place, that it makes you wonder if you're still so close to everyday life. You wish to spend there more than one day! The sea is cold, but it doesn't stop you from swimming, then you spend some time just sitting on the rocks and watching how much nothing is going on.

My favourite island is Brännö with it's nice inn and B&B plus adjoining island Galterö, which is only nature, sheep and sea and small arrows suggesting a path. All islands are reachable by ferry from Saltholmen and one can do island-hopping with a Tram-daycard that also covers the ferryfee. At Brännö Rödsten you can easily rent a yellow bike and cycle around the island or just walk, since it's not too big. Suitable for all!
Important: now and then the marine may have armed excercises at sea near Brännö and the peace may then be disturbed. But these excercises are announced in advance, so can be avoided if you check this before deciding when to go there.

Cars are prohibited on the Islands som on Brännö you can take a nice walk through the old genuine part. Brännö used to have pilots for ships. After 20 minutes you can make a stop att Brännö Värdshus (inn) with a nice restaurant. If you have planned the trip som you can take an afternoon boat from the other end of the island called Brännö Husviksvägen it is a 15 minute walk - but take more time. From Husviksvägen there are already few ferries that dock at serveral Islands on the way back to Saltholmen ferry terminal. It gives a nice view of the archipelago.

For Styrso, based on my own research, your grade pretty much depends on whether you managed to make it to the Tangen port (western part of the island) for those white houses. I visited only the Skaret & Bratten parts of the island.

Stayed there for a picknick and then back to the ferry and on to the next island. Styrsö is more lively, more tourists and more locals. Also stopped at Dönsö but took a wrong turn and wanted to walk the bridge across but a local offered me a ride. So I hired a bike, cycled around for about an hour and then I thought I would go back to Gothenburg. The ferry made one more stop at Kössö (Köpstadsö). W.O.W. There is not even a supermarket but what a gorgeous island this is. Nothing to do apart from swimming but it felt like I was in heaven.

Sweden,Corway,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"I decided to visit Vrångö on a whim. I hadn't prepared or planned a thing; I just wanted an adventure.
You take Tram 11 from anywhere in the city in the direction of West.
Stay on it until the final stop 'Saltholmen', that's where the ferry leaves from.

I saw that Vrångö (the furthest island away) is a nature reserve, so I opted to visit there.
It is a one hour ferry journey, which is absolutely gorgeous. Especially if it is sunny. Luckily the weather was abnormally good for April; warm and clear.

I arrived on the island and first thing's first; visited the restaurant for coffee and cheesecake (served by a really friendly girl called Petra).
I spent the next few hours just wandering around the island, most times going off route and climbing rocks or walking through forests. At one point I was walking for an hour without having seen a single other person, the only noise being the wind, the sea or some of the beautiful bird wildlife in the woods.

Of all the great things I did in Gothenburg, visiting Vrångö was easily the best decision.
Cannot recommend it enough. I'm sure it's even more fun in the summer (because you can go swimming) but I think it would look prettiest in winter.

Go there now, you wont regret it.

I can both recommend visiting the islands Styrsö and Vrångö, there are amazing hiking trails from 2 to 5 km, which can also be combined. You find kafés (one on Vrångö, several on Styrsö which is the biggest island) where you can relax and have lunch or coffee. The views are genious and it is beautiful to spent some hours outside town, without any cars or traffic noise.

Sweden,MRunnicles,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Despite visiting in mid winter (February), we had a beautiful sunny, cloudless day in Gothenburg and opted for a day out on the Ferry visiting the islands with our two girls (age 7 and 10). Thoroughly enjoyed - but I would probably recommend saving this for a day when the weather is good! After a long winter working in the office, standing outside on a Ferry watching the sun glinting on the waves and feeling the breeze on my face was heaven! Good value - we bought two adult travel cards at our hotel for 90SEK each - covering all buses, trams AND the island Ferry for the whole day - with both children going with us for free. We jumped on and off at several islands, eventually enjoying some lunch at the restaurant on the furthest island, Vrango. There is a small kid's playground in the village centre too, which our girls enjoyed for a little while. Well recommended to ""get away from it all"" for a day.

Sweden,Mme_X,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"We were here on a bright, sunny January day that was about as good as it gets in winter in Sweden. We were in the mood for some air, so took one of the ferries to Branno. We spent the midday time wandering the island, by rocks, beaches, quaint houses, a sheep farm, etc. Very picturesque.

There is a fairly quick ferry, and one that is longer but gives a nice cruise of the islands. The ferry is included in your monthly travel pass for trams and buses if you bought one. You can get on and off as you like at the island stops.

We spent some time on Branno island, and had lunch (see my restaurant review - it was good.) I can imagine what a lovely place it is in warmer weather. There is a beach area.

Be forewarned: get to the ferry on time. We were a few hundred feet offshore (we departed on time) when we saw some people coming around the bend who probably wanted to catch that ferry. The next one wasn't for a while on Sunday.

The nicest island that people live on is Styrsö. Remember to bring drinking water and food if you are staying at Vrångö or Vargö for a day. You can not buy anything there. Also - plan ahead which ferry you'll take to get home, so that you don't get stuck overnight. They only call out the names of the islands in Swedish and you need to get off quite fast, so follow the route on a map during the travel.

The archipelago is more beautiful closer to Norway, but you'll get a good taste, very cheap and accessible.

I would one-hundred percent, hands down, recommend taking one of the ferries from Saltholmen to any of these islands. It is beautiful and clean and so refreshing to be away from all of the city noises. We went to Vrango first (the furthest out on the 281 ferry and it took about 30 minutes) and it was gorgeous. The town is tiny though, and we went on a Sunday so the only grocery store was closed, leaving two options for food: a small seafood market next to the grocery store and a cafe right next to the ferry docks. We had a beer at the ferry dock but did not order food out of fear that we would miss the next boat. After Vrango we headed back to Donso (the next stop on the way back to Saltholmen on the ferry) and had a delicious lunch at a small pizzeria (the only thing open - again, it was Sunday). The ferries are very easy to use (especially if you have the transportation pass) and were very clean. From Gothenburg, we took the 11 tram to Saltholmen, which took almost an hour (from Brunnsparken). If we ever do this again, I think next time I would like to take a picnic to one of the islands and find a nice, scenic spot to relax with my husband.

We did the 4.5km green/white (well marked) route in about an hour; it had great views, especially of the bay. There were maps available just off the boat. We were then able to complete the easy and short (and well signposted) walk to Bratten and still had about 30 mins to sit and read before we got the 11:57am ferry back to the mainland. We could probably have gone to an island further away or completed another walk, but we both had a great time and feel that we made the most of our time rather than simply waiting to get the airport bus.

Sweden,Lisetteki,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"I would highly recommend taking the ferry between the islands in the archipelago. You can stroll the islands or just sit in the cliffs and watch the ships go by. There is such a history here that I would recommend getting a guide or even a book on the Harbour and spend a full day.

Sweden,sadiebruno25,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"I visited Styrso by myself on a rainy day and had the island and hiking trails ""to myself"" aside from the grazing sheep I encountered. I started by walking through town to the Seaside Cafe which was not at all what I expected but a great adventure. It was basically a small shack on the dock on the ""fishing boat"" side of the island run by a cute little couple. When I arrived it was just the husband who spoke very little English but was kind and inviting. I had tea with him until his wife arrived. She spoke English and gave me a map and tips to explore the most beautiful part of the island. I ordered a sandwich and some homemade banana bread which delicious while out hiking. Great little adventure even in the rain as a single female!

Sweden,Tom F,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"There are several ferries that leave form Saltholmen for various islands in the Southern Archipelago. The one most would recommend is the ferry to Vrångö via Dunsö. Both islands have good restaurants, marinas, plenty of places to walk or stroll, and places to go swimming. There are beautiful old homes, a nice restaurant, and a grocery store on Dunsö. Vrångö also has a restaurant and lots of nature. Parking at Saltholmen can be a problem because the area is so popular so I would recommend parking at Långedrag marina, which is a 10 minute walk from Saltholmen. If walking is problem, there is a tram stop at Långerrag and it is just one stop to Saltholmen from there. The ferry has a snack bar that serves snack food, sandwiches, ice cream, and drinks. Th seats are comfortable. Tickets can be purchased at the ferry terminal.

Sweden,CatalinaPetre,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Both me and my husband were very interested to visit the archipelago as we have read a lot about it. We were very lucky to go during a lovely day, sunny and bright, but not too hot. What a treat. We took the nr 11 tram all the way to the end of the line and after that caught the number 283 boat to Brännö and spent most of the day there. We walked up to one of the highest points on the island and then walked around the trails. The trails are very clearly marked and well kept. We did not want to go and see all the little shops and houses as we were interested in the nature reserves. The Island is absolutely gorgeous, clean and quiet. We also stopped for fika at one of the local cafes and their pistachio pastry was delicious. We then went on to the next big Island for a quick tour and a coffee. We loved it so much we will return towards the end of our holiday. Great day outdoors with gorgeous scenery.

Sweden,horaxx,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"We were in Goteborg only for 1 day and a half, but we did our best to take a boat trip to archipelago as was recommended by a lot of people. Even it was a rainy day, the trip was great ! At the beginning, we thought to make a round trip, from Stenpiren to the southern island-Vrångö, and back, but on the way, we changed our mind and jumped off on Styrsö island, even was very windy with small rain... Honestly, we weren't sorry at all ! On this island, on its top (after 20 minutes walk through nice areas), there's a point called Stora Rös, which offers you an amazing and breathtaking 360° view around the archipelago. On a sunny day, you can easily spend a few hours there !
Even if you won't jump off an island, the archipelago tour really worth, so try to not miss it !

Sweden,Bonezee31,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"We travelled over to the southern archipelago (car free) on a windy and overcast day in August.

We used the tram system to get to the ferry terminal on a 24 hr ticket which was approx £8 per adult and children under 20 are free. The ticket is valid for all trams and ferries.

U need to get the 9 or 11 (in the summer the 9 is an additional harbour service) tram down to the terminal at Saltholmen and then it's a short walk from there to the ferries.

You can get either a slower 'old style' boat which stops at many of the islands on the way to the southern most one, Vrango (75 mins) or a fast hydrofoil type one which is direct (approx 20mins). The slower one affords you a better opportunity to see some lovely scenery en route. In the summer these were running approx every 30 mins.

However, there is an efficient free app you can download which tells you real time information about planning your journey both from central Gothenburg to the islands, and from island to island. The app is called 'To Go' and is searchable using the words Vasttraffik.

Despite it being very un-summer like on the weather front the scenery was still outstanding enough for us to have a fabulous day and all for approx £16.

There is a great cafe on the harbour side where the ferry stops on Vrango which did amazing cakes and coffee (fika).

What I did notice is that the Swedish people are all so friendly. When we were talking together on the ferry on the way over Swedish people of all ages wanted to talk to us (embarrassingly in perfect English) and find out where we were from and giving us top tips on where to go on the islands.

You really should go to the southern archipelago if you're in Gothenburg and have enough time.

Sweden,TripleCake,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Take a public ferry from Saltholmen or Stenpiren (in summer season) and go there for the whole day. Your ticket is valid for your trip back.
Choose one of the islands - it's nice if you have a time visit different islands, but if you want to rest choose one. Take a blanket and some snacks and spend your day laying back on the rocks,, listening the sound of the sea and seagulls. Just relax. Archipelago is perfect for that.
There's no much to visit, but what you can really enjoy is the architecture, crab cages, little harbor and shops with fresh fish.

Sweden,Canberrafella,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,We caught the long boat trip to Branno Island rather than the direct express boat in July 2016. The great thing about the trip was we got to see many of the other islands of the archipelago on the way. The trip took about 50 mins and stopped at about 6 other islands before getting to Branno. We then took about 2 hours to explore the island and walked across it to catch the direct/express ferry back to the mainland. If you like swimming take your togs/swimmers and towel as there are lots of little bays where you can relax away from the crowds of Gothenburg.,Jul 2016
Sweden,Suzy M,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"If you visit Göteburg, you simply HAVE to take a day out and visit the archipelago. Seriously, we only had 2.5 days to enjoy this city and we nearly decided to skip the archipelago but so glad we went ahead. Don't let the travel time put you off. It's easy to get to. From Brunnsparken (there's a blue ticket shop right outside the stop-we purchased a 24hr flexible ticket which costs £8.50 - this covers not only all the trams you catch that day but also your ferry ride -excellent value! As soon as you get on the tram, just scan it on the little machine and your 24hrs begin- so simple!).
Take the no. 9 or 11 tram to Salthommen - it takes about 30 mins but that will fly by as there's plenty of the city to see on the way. Then, catch a ferry to whichever island you'd like to - you can go up on deck and feel the wind in your hair and take your photos. Don't forget sunscreen!

We chose the island furthest away called Vrångö - we chose a ferry that stopped at all the islands on the way so if you wanted to hop off, you can. The journey takes approx 1 hr 15. Vrångö is simply beautiful. A nature reserve in its midst and a quaint little town with no cars and some stunning houses with Swedish flags proudly on show. Take a wander around and enjoy the peace, the nature, the birds and the butterflies. Take your swimming things as well, they have bays you can enjoy.

There are free toilet facilities by the ferry port and a cafe that sells beer and snacks if needed. We didn't want to leave the island, it was just gorgeous. If we had more time, we would have checked out Donsö and some of the other islands too. Just stunning, my photos do not do this day justice, we will remember it forever. I even got to do my impersonation of The Little Mermaid in one of the bays - as you can see, on a hot day, it wasn't as crowded as you'd think it would be in high season.

Go, go now! You won't regret it :D

Sweden,0504sally,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"We didn't have a lot of time, but we're glad we visited the island of Branno in the Southern Archipelago outside of Gothenburg. Take the 11 tram to the end Saltholmen. You walk about 3 minutes to the ferry terminal to pick an island to visit. There are limited places to buy food, but bring cash as there are fruit stands with luscious strawberries, cherries and other fruit. If you want to sit on the top part of the ferry, get there super early as there are few seats and they get filled up quickly. It was a short 20 minute boat ride to the island. As it was the Gothia Cup week, we followed the masses along the path to the main swimming area which is about a 20 minute walk. There's a diving area that was popular with the kids. The ""beaches"" are really rocks but there are a few ""sandy"" spots. Bring your own food and drinks, but there are a few cafes if you don't have time. If I had more time, I would have explored other islands. And upon your arrival at the island and before you leave the ferry check the ferry schedule back to Saltholmen as they only run about once and hour and you definitely don't want to be waiting too long to head back.

To my mind, the islands are absolutely THE MUST during the journey to Gothenburg. I was overvelmed with emotions by the beauty of this place. The views of swedish nature, small houses, boats and rock beaches are absolutely picturescue and amazing.Take tram 11 (+ tram 9 in summer) to the Saltholmen station and then public ferry to get there. Private property is not usually designated, so be careful not to disturb people by walking through their gardens or close by their windows. Though no cars are allowed there and people use small electric cars, mopeds or bikes, traffic can be quite dangerous on narrow roads of the isles, so watch out! I strongly recommend to take one day to get there and see all this northern beauty. Hope to get back and explore the rest of the isles one day.

Sweden,GothenburgProfessor,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Styrsö island in the southern Gothenburg archipelago offers all the variations typical of the coastline. Along the rockface a footpath leads to the family-friendly beach at Brattenbadet. Around the church lies the old village with its buildings set out along narrow alleys. To the west lies Styrsö Tången, a traditional fishermen’s village where the houses are clustered along the alleys above the quayside. The modern fishing harbour is at Sandvik, further out to the west. From the football field there are nature trails that have recently been revitalised. These lead towards the outlying land in the south with its grazing sheep, shallow waters, sealavender and orchids. Among all the rocks there are plenty of vantage points and picnic places. The paths lead further towards Styrsö Skäret, where there is a guesthouse with a restaurant.

Sweden,rebecca r,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,3.0,"A half hour tram ride from central Gothenburg takes you to this ferry terminal which features about six jetties serving the nearby islands in the archipelago. The walk from the tram stop to the ferry office is about three minutes. There is a waiting room containing payable toilets but we found that on sunny days most passengers wait close to their jetty, each of which features a departure time and destination notice. Close to the terminal is a sizeable car parking area and a couple of small takeaway shops selling ice creams and some food. I found the booking office staff to be friendly and helpful with timetable information. In the summer it can be busy so be early and wait close to your departure point if you want to be first onto your ferry and secure your choice of seat. Whatever time of the year, wear something warm on the ferry if you intend to sit outdoors. It can be very cold out there.

I recommend buying a Västtrafik travel card if you plan on going here, as you can use it to pay for the tram and the ferry between the islands as well. There's a Västtrafik customer service building at Bruunsparken on the northern side.

The island is beautiful, and unlike others, has one-lane paved streets ... for use only by the ambulance, fire department and visiting nurse who looks in on folks. Otherwise it is bikes or on foot. The relatives then took us to neighboring Vargo, where ancestors once lived and worked. There, there are no streets, just walking paths, including one that climb up a high mound of granite where early settlers dug a huge cistern in the solid granite, and used the rocks taken out to build a long stone wall. And from the top you get a grand view of Styrso and other islands ... including Stora Vanso, which locals call the tower island because of a large, round tower. Part of the old hospital when the island was a place where sick folks were quarantined for things such as cholera.

At the end of our stay, we simply boarded the ferry from Vargo and headed back. The day was cloudy, cool, and we even got sprinkled on, but it was still a wonderful trip.

Coming back, we sat inside, on the upper deck and enjoyed a very inexpensive but very good cup of coffee.

We then caught a boat to Vrango before heading back to Salthomen.
Good day overall...we spent half a day...Vrango and branno had two look out points which gave us a good view from the top

Sweden,Sofia M,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,Whenever I have visitors from abroad I take the on a ferry trip to see the archipelago and it is always really appreciated. In the winter moths we usually stay on the ferry without visiting any of the islands. Some of the ferries have a cafe and it is nice to hot drink when the weather is chilly. But in the summer we visit the islands for a swim and sunbathing. A visit to the archipelago is a real treat and it's so easily accessed from the city centre.,May 2016
Sweden,Guillaume R,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"The southern Göteborg Archipelago is easily reached by tram and boat from the center of Göteborg.
During the summer of 2016, there will be even boats from Stenpiren, in the city center.

Leaving around 10.00 from Göteborg center will allow you to arrive between 11.00 and 11.30 to different islands.

If you prefer nature, go to Vrångö, the southern most island. A tour of the southern part will take you a leisurely 90 minutes, and you can then finish at the café while waiting for your return boat. The northen part of the island is also nice, especially the sandy beach on the north east coast.

If you prefer to walk among houses and gardens, Styrsö it is. There are some nice walking paths, and cafés at both landing locations.
Styrsö is connected to Donsö, which is a still active fishing village, and you can experience a real fishermen activity.
Branö is similar in spirit to Styrsö. Asperö is small.

As a tip, if you are visiting outside of summer and long weekends, I recommend you pack coffee and a lunch. You might not find the café opened.

Enjoy your trip!

Sweden,Huskorset,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Take a Ferry out to any of the islands, for example Brännö - there is an excellent and picturesque café in the little shipyard, called ""Café Varvet"", a five or ten minutes walks from the wharf ""Brännö Rödsten"". No cars on island, a lovely beach of both rocks and sand lies right across the island, a thirty minute walk. There´s even a small kiosk with ice-cream, soft drinks and candy. Once every year there is the Brännö Fleemarket, where the main streetwalk becomes loaded with tables full of clothes, craftswork, old trinkets and occasional furniture. A hike out to se the sheep grazing by the sea on the protected Galterö is also highly recommended. And that is just Brännö! Asperö, Styrsö, Vrångö Köpstadsö and lots of smaller island are all an adventure.

Sweden,PJMS_11,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"We visited Göteborg for several days last summer while picking up a new Volvo. We had purchased full day travel tickets and decided to get our money's worth one afternoon by taking a tram out to Saltholmen and hopping on a ferry. (Travel tickets in Göteborg cover trams, busses, and ferries.) As we only had a few hours, we only had time for one island, so we picked Brännö. We were pleased with our choice!

We stepped off the ferry and walked along the water to the right until we reached a beach. Since we all enjoy water and swimming (and were wearing swim wear under our clothes... just in case), we were able to hop in! Afterwards, we walked back toward the ferry landing and sat in a park-like area, where we enjoyed some live music from a nearby cafe. It was quite picturesque.

We only stayed a couple of hours, but thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would definitely recommend this for a half-day or full-day excursion!

Sweden,DdP,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,3.0,"I love that transport to the southern archipelago is included in the city pass, however I ended up on a very small island with *nothing* to do on it. I had expected to be able to get something to eat as the tourist guide said it was a fishing island - but that could be my fault for drawing the wrong conclusion (and I didn't check by asking anyone...). I'm sure this could be great, but make sure you know what you're expecting from the island you chose to visit.",May 2016
Sweden,Feistytiger,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Pick up a day pass outside the train station, one easy tram to the end of the line and you will see a ferry port to get the boats out to the islands. The ticket is valid for all trams and ferry's for the day and is very reasonably price (£8) The day we picked to visit the islands was a strike day however their were still a few boats running and it made it easy to decide which islands we wanted to visit, We visited two islands on our trip, the first being Branno one of their 'main islands' we walked across the north of the Island from one ferry port to the other, seeing some beautiful houses along the way and getting a taste for island life. Unfortunately as of the strike the other ferry port was closed but we met some friendly locals who gave us a quick route back to the ferry port. This was nice as it was a different way but equally as beautiful. We stopped for some lunch near the ferry port at a cute little café.

Then we got the next boat over to Vrango. This was different, a lot more sparse with a beautiful walk through a nature reserve with some spectacular scenery and views (we walked the whole island and it didn’t take us very long). We headed back to the port and had two hours to kill till the next boat, so we stopped in the beautiful cafe, with lovely views and excellent cake and took another walk around the island.

Both these islands are unique, have beautiful architecture and very much worth the visit. We visited in April when it was very cold, and i can imagine they would be even more spectacular in the summer. Defiantly worth a visit, one of the prettiest places i have ever visited. Plus everyone is friendly and helpful and they are easy to navigate with lots of signs and maps to get around. i Would recommend picking up a guide book on the ferry and seeing where the ferry takes you and then just wandering around whatever takes your fancy.

Sweden,MaryandMungo,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"We took the tram down to Salthomen from Gothenburg which only takes about 15 minutes and then got on a ferry to Vrango. There was a mix up with our tickets and we only ended up paying for one way which was incredibly reasonable, about £5.00 for both the tram and the ferry. Everyone seemed to be very trusting as no-one asked for tickets and we couldn't find out where to pay for the return trip. The island is inhabited across the middle and there are nature reserves to the north and south. Walking these takes about half an hour each and they are stunningly beautiful with lovely little secluded beaches in some areas. When you get back to the ferry terminal give yourself half an hour to visit the little cafe there. The food and drinks are delightful - it's called the Skargardens Cafe.

Short walk through the woods takes you to the coast with views to Kattegat and a small bridge to the neighbouring island. You can also walk to the other side of the island and get a different ferry back to the mainland. Excellent day- or half-day trip",Apr 2016
Sweden,Angel57,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Caught an early ferry to Vrango to make the most of a glorious sunny day. The fast catamaran got us there in 30 minutes and on arrival we set off to do the North trail. This is a fabulous walk through forest, and out to some secluded beaches. The water was so clear and very tempting but just a little too cold to try.
This walk ends up at the little village on the west coast where there is a small supermarket and also a restaurant (not open on the day we visited). However we had brought our own lunch, complemented by a couple of Pripps Bla beers from the supermarket, which we enjoyed at a picnic bench while watching yachts come in and out of the small harbour.
Rested, we decided to do the South trail which is quite different in scenery than the North trail and ends up by a beach just a short walk from the ferry stop.
We had the most fantastic time on Vrango. The north trail takes about approximately 40-50 minutes of gentle walking and you will probably not see another soul. The south trail takes about 30 minutes and seemed more popular, probably because it is easier to find from the ferry port.
We caught the 2.48pm ferry back to Saltholmen which is a slower ferry stopping at more islands which was interesting.
Some tips for travelling to the archipelago are:
Get your tickets in advance from the circular building in front of the Clarion Post Hotel. You can get a return ticket for SEK 56 or an all day ticket for SEK 85.
Ask them for one of the Archipelago booklets which has information on all the islands and a map of each which is very useful.
While buying your tickets pick up schedules for the tram and ferries as it will help you plan your day.
Take some food and drink as shops and cafes may be not open.
Finally, the ferries do not dock for long so make sure you are ready to get on and off.

Sweden,kevin a,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"One of the coolest day trips I've taken anywhere in the world! Pay for a day trip card for 85 SEK at Gothenburg Central and the Southern Archipelago is short metro (#11 to Saltholmen) and ferry ride away. There are different ferries that follow different trajectories to different islands, all included in the price of the day pass. You can stay on the ferry and enjoy the ride, or use it as a hop-on-hop-off ride on the islands. We enjoyed the ride for about an hour or so and then got off the ferry on one side of Branno, walked across to the other side of the island and caught the ferry back to Saltholmen.
The Southern Archipelago was a very dreamy and picturesque, I got some of the best photos of my trip here.
It is low season (March), so a lot of cafes are closed; though you area able to get fika (coffee/treats) on the ferry. It was also a bit chilly on the deck of the ferry if you choose to go outside (better area for photos).
I highly recommend taking a day for the Southern Archipelago!

Sweden,atthehandlebars,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Regardless of what time of year you visit the archipelagos south of Göteborg, you will find the charm and beauty you are looking for here. Winter of course means that it will be colder, so wear proper winter gear if wanting to hike here. Don't be put off by the weather - there is many trails to follow depending where you go, and the snow will add to the mystery of the forest shrouded land. Frozen waters linger at the edges of the land, making for picturesque scenes.

If you are not so adventurous, but still wish to visit in winter, the small villages are easily reached by foot once off the ferry, and here you will find friendly swedes on their tray motorcycles and golf carts. No cars allowed here (excluding the transit vans). Cute houses are layered in tiny streets, especially with the snow covered roofs. Might be hard pressed to find places to eat however, so bring lunch. Highly Recommended.

The journey was easy and cheap and part of the overall experience. We caught a ferry across from Lindenholme to Stepiren and walked down to Jon Torgon tram interchange, stopping for a late breakfast on the way at a delightful cafe. The tram was clearly signed and went direct to the ferry port where a boat was waiting. People were, as ever helpful and friendly showing us where to go and pointing things out to us. It took twenty minutes to reach Styros where we disembarked and started a gentle walk to explore the island and then over the bridge to Dondas. We like people watching and being nosey so it was fascinating - little golf buggy electric cars, mopeds with luggage platforms in front, bicycles with a box for the children. Dondas was a pretty fishing place with lots of huts still in use. Nice motorboat to covet too. We had an ice cream, went to the supermarket and had a coffee and pizza for lunch before pottering back to the ferry port. Really good 'us time'. Teenagers might be bored. Ferry back to the mainland then a bus direct to Stepiren. All for an £8 travel card.

The trip is only 30SEK, ad it takes from 30min to 1h depending on the boat.
The boat is part of the portfolio of the local transport company.

Once on the island noise is a memory, the only audible comes from birds and the sea that meet the wind.
Despite the wind and the temperature, the visit was inspiring. A 40min walking ring around the island offers stunning panorama in a row environment as well as a fast view on the local community, an handful of BIG houses which make a village like many seen in the movies.

Some islands don't have anywhere for you to eat so bring a picknick, something to drink and also varied types of clothing, in case of rain or weather changes. If you go to Brännö or Styrsö there will most definitely be some place to eat during the summer season. There's a bridge connecting Styrsö with Donsö if you want to explore further, maybe by bike even. Styrsö Pensionat is a wonderful place to eat, and to stay overnight too. Maybe not the cheapest alternative, but worth the while. I'd suggest for you to both go to ne of the bigger islands and a smaller one, like Köpstadsö or Asperö to vary a bit.

Sweden,Estelle,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"I visited friends in Sweden a couple of days ago and we took the boat out to Gothenburgs archipelago, stopping off at the island of Brännö for a couple of hours. It was very cold and windy! But dry and sunny, so we were able to stroll around the quiet island and take in all the pretty houses and scenery.

The island doesn't allow cars, so everyone has these kind of moped bikes with big wooden trays on the front (We saw people riding their children in them too!) The houses are beautiful and very typically Scandinavian looking and it's lovely to walk around and take it all in. The island of Brännö also brews it's own beer which is for sale in the pub.

There is also a small beach with a path and rocks to climb on, even in winter this is beautiful to go and see. The ferry is very quick and you can stand outside (and brave the cold!) to take in the views of all the islands and boats on the way. There is a cafe on board too, and you pay to get on using the usual Gothenburg travel card, so no need to book a separate ticket.

I'd definitely recommending a visit to one of the islands for something different and to get out of the city for an afternoon!

Sweden,Chelsea222,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,My friend and I caught tram 11 to the ferry terminals where we caught the ferry 281 to Vrångö. Very smooth trip out with views of all the beautiful islands. The weather was raining and overcast but still really enjoyed our visit. We did the southern walk of the island which took approximately 20-25 minutes at a constant walking pace. Great views! I would suggest a long pancho or rain pants+jacket if going in such weather as we did get wet and was too windy for an umbrella! At this time of year the ferries aren't as frequent so best to plan ahead with timetables etc. Overall a fantastic experience which the weather shouldn't deter from.,Nov 2015

Sweden,Samanthalouise,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,As all boat trips had ended we decided to look at ferries to see the islands. We got our ticket with a detailed itinary from the bus station reached through the central station. We took a bus then no. 11 tram to Saltholmen. There we caught the 281 ferry. This calls at various islands. The final destination was Vrango. We got off and walked across the island. Although the cafe only opens certain days th e toilets were open. The island and it's houses were stunning. The ferry back had a cafe so we ate there. It would be easy to see at least two different islands in one trip. The cost was 26 k for the return trip from Gothenburg 's central station. Incredible.,Oct 2015
Sweden,Suresh C,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,4.0,"We stayed in Novotel and from there took two trams to reach Saltholmen. Without any wait time, took the 4:40pm ferry to reach Styrso Bratten. We took some photos and as we did not take next ferry, all the tourists left the place and we were the only one in the island. Locals use Golf carts for travel. There was a small play area and my kids enjoyed there sometime. We then took a ferry to Dorso, lovely Scandinavian looking Red buildings, gorgeous sun set and some nice looking boats were there to enjoy. We took the return ferry to Salthomen at 6:43pm. Ferry travel was really pleasant compared to others that we have taken in other places. Islands at some parks look remote so best to keep snacks and drinks. We saw a super market at Dorso but closed at the time we went. By hopping on and off using a one time fare ticket we could spend a lot of time here by explore and enjoy.

Sweden,Chris B,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"This is definitely the number 1 thing to do in Göteborg, although make sure you pick a nice day to go as you will be outside all day. I chose to go the furthest island Vrångö, as I was told it had a very nice hiking trail. The tram to the ferry terminal takes about half an hour, and then it takes 30-40 minutes to get to Vrångö depending on how many stops the ferry has on the way. The ferry ride is very pleasant and the views along the way were spectacular, plus you don't need to buy an extra ticket for the ferry, as your tram ticket is valid. Vrångö is split into two halves with the village in the centre and hiking trails to the north and south. The landscape along the way is quite varied, with grassy plains, rocky outcrops, forests, rainforest, and even a few nice beaches. It is all very easy to navigate, there is one main path, although you can take some detours along smaller paths. The only time I had any difficulty was going from the north trail to the south trail as I did not have a map of the town with me and I wasn't sure where the trail started, but that was a perfect excuse to have a walk around the car-free village.

Sweden,John R,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"You can easily park at the ferry except i high season. Better is the number 11 tram. We went yesterday 6th October in kind clear weather and not too windy so could stand out on top deck of ferries. Note there are no seats outdoors as these are working passenger ferries not tourist boats. Take a warm windproof jacket and hat even in good weather. There are many varied routes and I would strongly recommend viewing a time table and read up on the islands to decide what you want to do and for how long. It is easy to buy a 'round trip' ticket so you can jump on and off and explore which islands you want. We were limited by time but took the ferry first from Saltholmen to Vrango the furthest out.(35mins) We stayed on and then got off at Donso. This is a pretty little village with a fish restautant and an ICA supermarket. If you didnt take anything stock up with liquid and food at ICA as the limited cafes and shops have very varied opening hours or do not open like on mondays or in winter. From Donso we walked through the village to see lovely rural wooden houses avoiding the old motorbikes with carriers attached which wizz around. There are no cars on these islands only bikes, golf buggies and wheelbarrows! We walked across the bridge linking Donso to Styrso and to Bratten where we picked up the next ferry baqck to Saltholmen. There is no shop at the ferry point at Bratten it is 1km inland! Both cafes were closed even though it was 1pm. So in 4 hours we had a brief look at the islands, a good walk and a beautiful hour and a half of panoramic coastal views from very efficient ferries. visit styrsobolaget ferry website to see timetable, much useful information and excellent 'excursion tips' in English. Wish we had had these before we set out!

Sweden,Mattias B,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"A must if you visit Gothenburg during the summer, especially during a warm and sunny period. Many options to get out to the ocean archipelago exists, either from Saltholmen ferry terminal and out to the islands, or if visiting the northern ocean archipelago ferries depart from Torslanda out to a other set of islands. If going to Saltholmen, be early, it does get crowded during the good weather days and the journey out with public transport does take its time. Limited parking space if you have a car. The ferry is public transport and is cheap, parking is a bit pricey but there is no real cost of doing this activity unless you rent kayaks or similar.

Sweden,Lasse H,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"Take the 11 Tram to Saltholmen, or the car (as we did - during off season it is easy to find a parking spot). Ferry 281 will take you to the most southern island (accessible by public transport ferry, at least), Vrångö. The trip takes about 30 minutes, and is stopping by some islands on the way. Once on Vrångö, we had 20 minutes to walk around the mooring or so, before the ferry went back. An alternative is of course to stay longer and catch the next ferry. They depart at least once per hour, depending on time of day and season. On our return trip, we realised that it was possible to shift ferries at ""Asperö Norra"", to the Brännö Ferry (number 283).
We only had to wait for two minutes before the ferry came. And this one had a cafeteria onboard!
Coffees, cinnamon buns, fantastic views and a very narrow waterway into Brännö made the day, so to speak.
This trip is highly recommended!
We used the tourist card, one can purchase from the Tourist Office, since it includes Public Transport (i.e. Trams and Ferries) as well as Parking and entrance to various museums and stuff.
The archipelago really delivers, in terms of great views and tranquility.
In season, you are also able to sunbathe and take a swim in these clear salty waters, wherever and whenever you wish.

You go to the end of the line on the tram to Saltholmen, take a 5 minutes walk to the quayside where you can hop onto any number of small ferry boats (approx for 300 people) which take you on a trip through the archipelago, stopping at different islands where you can hop on and hop off as you like. The captains of the boats are very talented how they manoeuvre these boat like small motor launches. Beautiful trip if its nice weather and lovely scenery on the islands where you can walk and enjoy the fresh air.

Take tram to last station on one of the lines. About 25-30 mins ride. Boat station is near the tram stop.

Please do a little planning to maximize - there are plenty of islands. Maps available there but I suggest look on the net while learning tips from other trip advisors. The waiting areas have electronic indicators for next boat / destination.

It's really easy by tram 9 or 11 from the town centre to Saltholmen and then easy ferries to all the islands. Bargain at 85 Skr for a day ticket to travel everywhere (from the ticket office in the square at the station). Get a map and a ferry timetable to get best value from your explorations.

The islands are fascinating to explore, there are beaches, and hill summits to give great views, interesting villages and the crowds arriving on the ferries seem to disappear into the countryside on arrival at each island.

We preferred Vrango, but all the islands are interesting in different ways.

This is truly a must for anyone who likes exploring somewhere new and interesting.

There is a traditional cafe' on the small harbour, with a delicious homemade vegetarian pie. Hoping to come back. Highly recommended.",Jul 2015
Sweden,cybercharlie,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"If you have a day to spend and you like hiking around, the southern archipelago islands are for you. They are conveniently connected with the mainland by the public transportation system so the day card covers the tram to get to the ferry dock (9/11 to Saltholmen) as well as the ferry system. You can hop on and off the ferries, as well as hike across islands and take the ferry at a different port. If you are blessed by a sunny day as i was, bring some sun cream :)
You can find shops and cafes on the larger islands but the smaller ones have nothing so you'd better bring some stuff to have a picnic on the rocky shores.

Take the #11 tram to Salthomen, and get on the ferry. Your tram ticket covers your fare as long as you board with 90 minutes of purchasing your ticket. Warning to non-Europeans: while everyone will tell you that it is really easy to buy tickets on the tram, since you need only swipe your card, the tram, like many other Swedish public transport services, does not take cards issued by a non-European bank. The ticket machines on the tram also do not take bills, so make sure that you have change (you can use your card on the ferry). I went to Vrango, a pretty island with two nature reserves, and Donso. The ferry trip gives you a nice view of the others even if you don't get off. It was a really nice way to spend the day, I highly recommend it.

Catch tram n. 11 at central station and drop off at Saltholmen, it only takes 20 minutes, more or less. At the pier you can choose what island to visit first. We took the 12.30 pm ferry to Styrsö Skäret and we had a very pleasant walk to Styrsö Tången where we have stopped for a break and a sandwich at a very nice café. In the afternoon we took the ferry from Styrsö Bratten to Bränno Husvik and after another stroll through many gorgeous houses and perfect gardens we went back to Saltholmen from Brännö Rodsten pier.

Sweden,Axel B,Southern Gothenburg Archipelago,5.0,"I suppose my views would be taken for subjective since the archipelago is just outside my own hometown, but this is very much a breathing hole for myself and my family no matter what time of the year. However, I guess people from outside would appreciate the archipelago more during the warmer parts of the year. There are loads of different places to go for a swim (esp from mid-June - mid-Sept, most people would find it too cold for a swim outside that period), both from smaller beaches as well as from the rocks. There are usually a number of smaller cafes and restaurants to be found on the islands during the peak period in summer. Outside this period it may be more difficult to find somewhere to eat, or even to buy something (esp during Sundays).
If you are going here during autumn, winter or ealy spring, you might just want to take the slow ferry from Saltholmen to Vrångö or Brännö Husvik. Both will give you a nice tour of the archipelago and if it is chilly you can always stay inside in the onboard cafe where you can usually pick up a cinnamon roll or the like and a cup of coffe, hot chocolate, etc. Winetertime on a clear day this is a really nice outing and you may even spot a seal or two popping their heads up for the passing ferry.

You can travel to Saltholmen ferry port by tram - a pleasant tram ride takes about 45 mins. Catch the ferry which tours and stops at most of the islands from there. It is part of the public transport system, so if you have purchased tram tickets, this ferry is included. Great value for money. You need to allocate a day to tour the islands really.

Personally, I liked Kopstadso best - the small island where the transport system is wheelbarrows! But any of the island stops are good fun and very scenic. Styrso has a lovely cafe literally at the ferry stop and is what you might call the 'main' island.

It was a lovely sunny week when we stayed, so the ferry was smooth and views amazing.

We were in Copenhagen but just 35 minutes and £17 later we were in Malmo in Sweden.
The bridge is stylish to look at and the train is efficient and comfortable. However, it is a commuter service and I felt a bit sorry for all the people returning home from a hard day's work to have excitable tourists on board.
I can recommend the cinnamon buns in Malmo Station, by the way.

Love the bit in the middle which is the border with Sweden and Denmark. We didn't have time (nor the car) to drive over (which gives you the best view), but did go over on the train a few times, but you're on the underneath bit, so you can only see the water!

After about 45 minutes, we were at Malmo Central Station. On our way back to Copenhagen, we took the Flixbus and it was then that we saw the breathtaking beauty of the Oresund Bridge.

On our return to the UK we found they were still taking money off our credit card for journeys the hire car was making but we weren't driving!!!.

Sweden,Drew B,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,5.0,"Thought I’d leave a review as I found there were few informative reviews available for a popular trip such as this. Well worth seeing the bridge. Recommend getting the bus (we took Flixbus from Copenhagen) at least one way to get the breathtaking view from the road. You can take the train for the other trip to experience that- no view from above as rail is under the road. Flixbus coach was nice and was punctual (leaves at a stop a few hundred metres from the central Copenhagen train station- street name is on the e-ticket). You can book the bus online. Travel time around 80 mins. Make sure you have your Passport for border control.
The train back was comfortable, efficient at 30 mins and easy to book (we bought the ticket at Malmo train station). Bus was equivalent to £13/ €13 one way and train was £10/ €10. It appears that the earlier you book the bus the cheaper it is, so worth bearing this in mind. By the way, Malmo is beautiful with amazing parks and nice buildings. Hope that helps.

If you want a slightly quicker crossing then you can catch the train at the airport and lose probably 20 minutes, this is a great big of engineering yo view. Travel across and of course made even more famous by the dark Scandinavia dramas of late.

This bridge handles both cars and railway, and it's a pretty quick and convenient low-cost way to get from Copenhagen to Malmo, Sweden.

The Oresund bridge has become so famous that there was a TV show called THE BRIDGE. it's about a murder, where half of a body is found on the swedish side and the other half on the Danish side.

For a day trip to Malmo this is a great option. I do recommend a day trip to Malmo once on the swedish side things are a bit cheaper.

What we were paying for I have no idea. Apparently the bridge has long since made its money back. Frankly 100 euro would be outrageous even if the bridge were still trying to make its initial coat back.

It is really convenient if you live in Malmö and need to get to Kastrup airport or want to visit Copenhagen as the it takes around 20 min to get there. I have worked in Copenhagen and lived in Malmö a couple of years ago and I have to say that the trains were late at least once a week so in my opinion the planning is not top notch so to speak.

To summarize, its a good link between Malmö and Copenhagen and really convenient but I wish they would be better prepared when it comes to windy weather and planning for unforeseen weather overall. Although the view is outstanding.

I could've taken the train but as this runs under the road section it means you miss the best part of the view and a lot of the bridges features. it does, however, take only half the time if you're in a hurry. I wasn't.

being driven also allows you to savour the journey more, freeing you up to be able to have a good look around and to take plenty of pics. the best part, for me, being just after you've emerged from the tunnel section. as you whizz along, you see the whole of the bridge ahead of you as it curves towards Malmo and you see the central section with those imposing stanchions that are so recognisable.

beautiful bridge, great journey, well worth the trip.

We didn't see any crime scenes but did learn a few things that surprised us:
1) We spent 24 hours in Copenhagen without seeing The Bridge. This is because The Bridge is 15km from central Copenhagen.
2) We got there and it was a tunnel! Well for half the crossing anyway. 8km of tunnel and 8km of bridge with an island in the middle.
3) The Denmark-Swedish border is before you get to the uprights of The Bridge. It is not in the middle!
4) It cost an eye watering 59 euros (£52.50) one way! I think it's a little cheaper if you do it a lot.

It is an amazing experience going through the tunnel first, realizing that we are driving under the water, well under the sea level, and then suddenly appearing in the middle of the Oresund strait between Denmark and Sweden, continuing driving on the bridge (quite steep incline). The experience is similar driving on the bridge first and then ""diving"" into the tunnel that leads you to Copenhagen.

It may be the longest in Europe. It provides access between Malmo, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark. We have traversed it a few times, driving on the bridge portion and descending into the ocean as you approach the western end. The tunnel, of course, eliminates problems with the many ships plying this part of the Baltic Sea, without requiring a bridge so tall it could be a problem for the nearby international airport. The view from the bridge is impressive, of course, and that structure serves to make a highway and rail connection between Sweden and western Europe, which did not exist before (except by ferry). The bridge also carries the data cable for internet. We have also traveled the bridge via the railroad which hangs underneath the bridge highway. The train is so fast and almost silent, as it speeds along over the Baltic and then beneath the water, coming up eventually right into the Copenhagen airport. It couldn't be better!

Sweden,Pat B,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,4.0,"As fans of ""the Bridge"" we wanted to cross into Malmo. We went over by train which was quick and easy although we didn't get he full impact of this amazing feat of engineering.

Malmo around the central station was very pretty and we had a wander and a drink in the Moosehead bar- very evocative if you read Scandi detective novels!

We tried to come back by bus but the driver said he was just leaving and would not allow us on to pay-a pity but we went back by train.

Worth doing - although don't be tempted to drive yourself as apparently the toll charge is around 40 euros a time. I hope those commuting detectives have passes for unlimited journeys!!!

The bridge is a combination of tunnel and bridge it’s really impressive. The trains travel on the bottom half whilst cars and boats travel on the top. On return into Copenhagen we sailed under the bridge which was again a great experience, many people come out on the top deck as with the size of the bridge one would wonder if the ship would fit under it.

Sweden,Isepise,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,3.0,"Öresundsbron is the brigde that connect the cities Malmö (Sweden) and Copenhagen (Denmark). Thousands of people travel on the bridge everyday, most of them workers, but some travels to visit friends and family and some travel in other errands.

If you are a fan of the tv-serie ""The Brigde"" (in Swedish ""Bron"" and ""Broen"" in Danish) it might be fun to travel over the bridge in the footsteps of Saga Norén.

The bridge is almost eight kilometers long and 200 meters high on the highest place, but you do not have any breathtaking or spectacular views from the brigde.
You are not allowed to stop at the bridge and look at the views.

Both cars, trucks and trains travel on the bridge. Every vehicle going over the bridge has to pay a fare, if you only travel one or two times it is really expensive, but if you travel often and buy a yearcard it gets much cheaper.

Öresundsbron is good for travelling on, but it is not a place to visit for fun, since the views from the bridge are not exciting and the cost for travelling on the bridge is high. However if you are a fan of ""The Bridge"" a drive on Öresundsbron might be fun.

Sweden,agnitfom2000,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,4.0,"The bridge is very impressive viewing it from Amager Strand or the Blue Planet Aquarium. It is a very quick way to get to Malmo from the airport or even from downtown Copenhagen. Trains go a couple of times per hour and are not too expensive.

If you go, ride the train because you want to see Malmo, not just because you want to have the experience of crossing the bridge. The train is efficient but it is rather hard to see much out of it. Others have stated the bus trip has better views, but I don't know since I have never taken it.

A couple of warnings about the trip:
1) You need a passport to go to Sweden. I don't think you need a passport to return.
2) Make sure you have a proper ticket. Otherwise, the police will catch you and fine you 10X+ on the spot! I saw some Americans get caught and they had to pay a fine of around $130 US.
3) Swedish kroners are not the same as Danish kroners. You can't use Danish kroners in the Malmo train ticket vending machine. Bringing a credit card with a working PIN is the easiest way. Otherwise you have to go through the currency exchange.

Sweden,Teylen,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,3.0,"When travelling from Germany to Sweden I decided to go by car to pass over the Oresund Bridge.
On my way to Sweden the weather was foggy, thus I couldn't see a lot save from the really massive pillars which were impressive. On my way back from Sweden it was sunny and clear and the sight was quite cool.

Yet, be prepared to pay somewhat over 50€ ($60-$70) to go over the bridge. One way. It was tough. Thus the average rating.
Maybe there are busses going over the bridge that are cheaper?

I crossed the bridge by train when travelling to Malmo from Copenhagen. One problem the tourists come across travelling to Malmo or Copenhagen is that there is little information available for tourists. i could not find tourist information at Malmo central station. To see better view of bridge i decided to return to Copenhagen by bus. For bus tickets for return journey i had to ask so many people for ticket office which was located at plateform 5 of central station. At the time of purchasing ticket i was not explained about the location of bus departure terminal. later i found out it was on the other side of Malmo station and it caused great inconvenience.

Sweden,Wargravian,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,4.0,"Decided on a last min trip to Sweden. Remember your passport! One chap got escorted from train. They check everyone’s ID before crossing border.

I had issues paying (HSBC Visa) via the ticket machines. They don’t accept Amex either. Called bank to fix it, they said there wasn’t an issue. So queued in ticket office and visa worked with their machine! Lost me about 25 mins but I left plenty of time so all was not lost.

Train super fast. About 40 mins. So smooth. Great views of the sea. It was a clear day. Had a seat on way out, stood on way back due to sheer number of prams, buggies and suitcases. (Airport stop en route)

Malmo Station- you have to pay to use the toilet. They accept cards or Danish notes. But they will give you Swedish currency in change for the latter so be warned. Lots of food outlets in the stations. Really impressive selection actually.

Weather differs greatly from Denmark. Snow everywhere and really quite thick. None in Copenhagen!? I was prepared but others were not.

Cost 170 danish k return. Ticket machines only let you by singles it seemed so at ticket office you could buy a return and save 10 k.

There is a bus that runs too. Limited service. Details attached via photos taken from hostel noticeboard.

You can also see it from the Blue Planet Aquarium and from Amager Strandpark of the weather allows. Or just cross it by train if visiting Malmo. And if you visit Malmo, do buy a family ticket with return, preferably in the ticket automate at Kastrup Airport, you pay in Swedish crowns and save quite a lot!

Sweden,MickyC-AUS,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,5.0,"In its own right, Oresund Bridge is a spectacular sight and an engineering marvel connecting Denmark with Sweden and the stunning towns of Malmo and Lund. For a wonderful self-guided day tour from Copenhagen, board the train at Central Station fairly early and take the one hour trip through Malmo to the historic university town of Lund. Take note of the station's location then wander the very walkable and beautiful cobble stone streets of Lund. Check out the magnificant churches, the wonderful market areas and the stunning old buildings with their beautiful architecture. There is a tourist bureau nearby with friendly staff and maps of the area. Spend a couple of hours in this glorious town and then make your way back to the Station. Travel back to Central Malmo (about 15 minutes) on the train, get off and begin the next phase of your walking tour. Malmo has a beautiful waterfront area close to the station and a magnificant central shopping area with long pedestrian-friendly areas to wander. Choose a restaraunt, cafe or exquisite coffee shop (there are many) and take a well deserved rest over coffee and cake before continuing your tour of this very walkable town. Cross the waterways on one of the many bridges, observe the famous spiral building, the Turning Torso, and check out some of the shops and markets for a wonderful afternoon out. When ready, return to the station and travel back to Copenhagen over the Oresund Bridge. Some hints: remember to take your passport for the border crossing; the staff at Copenhagen Central Station are extremely helpful with ticketing; take some Swedish Krona (or a credit card); and the Swedish stations have easy to use ticket machines.

Although this is not necessarily the best way to see the Bridge, I had been lucky enough to get a glimpse of it in all its glory when flying into Copenhagen a couple of days before. It really is quite impressive if your interested in architecture and impressive builds as I am.
The Oresund Bridge is the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe and connects two major metropolitan areas: Copenhagen, the Danish capital city, and the Swedish city of Malmö. It connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with those of Central and Western Europe. A data cable also makes the bridge the backbone of internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden/Finland. It is approximately 8km or 5 miles long and now enables an easy commute between two countries.

I would say it is a long walk and if you want a good view of the bridge, then maybe to get off at a stop nearer the bridge. I wouldn't walk out this far again. It was a beautiful clear and cold day so there was a good blast of wind to clear the cobwebs out. A long walk and could do with renting a bike out there to cycle up and down the sea front.

Sweden,TJB @ Rodney Stoke,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,4.0,"Was working in Malmo for a couple of days, so flew into Copenhagen from Heathrow, and managed to get a flight that ensured I would see the bridge as I travelled across the Oresund Strait to Malmo. The ticket prices were reasonable (even though I could expenses these), with a single ticket from the Danish side costing DKK 89.00 (approx £11.00) and the return from Malmo was SEK 110.00 (approx £10.00).
The arrival and departure was efficient and hassle free.
By far the most economical way to travel between these cities.
A fantastic feat of engineering, linking two cities and opening up endless possibilities for business and commuters alike.

To get a closer look of this giant bridge, the easiest way is to going from Malmö, Sweden. Take the green bus number from Central Station and get down at Hämmerväg Park stop. Then walk toward to the sea along the bicycle path (approximately 2km). Ultimately you will reach to the start point of the bridge. If it is not foggy day you will take a beautiful scenic picture of the bridge.

Sweden,MsWithnail,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,4.0,"I was dead against it. A lot of people from Malmö were, in the 80's and 90's. We all thought it would be bad for the sea and environment in general and demonstrated in the streets. Since the 60's I've been going back and forth to Copenhagen, along with all the Malmöitians, in a ferry or hovercraft (full of eels) and we all thought it ought to stay that way. Then suddenly, one day, in the year 2000, I was standing on the pier at the Ribersborg beach at sunset. I lifted my eyes and saw it, The Bridge, floating over the blue and glittering water like the most beautiful spectre you ever laid your eyes on. And I just fell in love with it. This is a true story. The Öresund Bridge is sooo beautiful! I don't think I've ever seen a big landmark as beautiful as this anywhere. There are issues, of course - it's ridiculously overprized to drive your car on. You'll want to take the train. But from the train you can't see it. However, it's quick and it usually works well, if there's not a storm. Do I miss the ferry? Yes, sometimes. In summation - it's one thing to see it, in its glory, and that is something you do from the beach! Another thing to use it, which has practical connotations. These Tripadvisor forms do not really take things like that into account.

From the coast and the sky the bridge looks very impressive, no doubt one of Europe's finest engineering feats. Don't forget that when you're on a train crossing the bridge there's not much to see, just sea and wind turbines. Perhaps consider admiring the bridge from the coast!

Sweden,Koalashooter,Göta Canal,5.0,"I spent 4 days - 3 nights on the MV Juno, the oldest river cruise ship (built 1874) in active service in the world, travelling from Gothenburg to Stockholm. It has to be one of the nicest cruises I have been on and a great way to see southern Sweden. The attraction lies in the leisurely pace of the cruise, the interesting shore excursions and the experience of being transported back in time in many ways.

The Juno is not a modern cruise ship. You get asked your height and weight as part of the online application because the length of bunk beds are limited. The ship does not have laundry facilities (my only real complaint) and is obviously geared towards European tourists. The max number of passengers is around 46 with about 11 crew. The Scandinavian seasons means the ship only operates about 3 months a year, in summer.

The food on the ship was excellent with a different menu based around Swedish cuisine every night. The crew were without exception excellent- mostly young and clearly having a lot of fun. You are allowed the run of the upper decks including the bridge (wheelhouse) except at certain times, such as critical junctures when the ship enters and leaves the many locks to be found in the canal. The canal is shallow and occasionally the ship runs aground which makes for interesting manoeuvring.

The scenery is of course beautiful and quite varied. You start off sailing through a major city, travel through some very large lakes and sail past farms and forests and then end up in another major city at the end (Stockholm or Gothenburg, you can sail either way) with a few towns along the way (such as Motala). There are several interesting stops along the way that are deserving of separate reviews.

Definitely highly recommended.

Sweden,N0madOne,Göta Canal,5.0,"We travelled the 6 day (5 nights) Grand Sweden Cruise from Stockholm to Gothenburg on the Diana. It was a wonderful way to see Sweden, slowly, with good company from different countries, we are so glad to have had the experience. The crew were excellent, welcoming, friendly, and hardworking. The bridge was almost always open (except when concentration was needed). The food was amazing, two course lunches and three course dinners every day, buffet breakfast. My food sensitivities were looked after better than anywhere I have ever been. Cleanliness was a priority, for instance the shared showers/toilets were cleaned several times every day and night. There is also a 24-hour coffee station on the bridge deck (free) and snacks to purchase. The cost of the tour included all meals and shore excursions and we only paid extra for drinks and souvenirs. The shore excursions were interesting and well paced, most within walking distance of the boat. One day we had to put into a port unexpectedly because the wind was too strong - a coach was quickly organised to take us to the place we would have visited, nobody missed anything and the captain made a good call in the interests of safety. Having said that, all of the sailing (except this one patch) was smooth as silk. We docked every night. I recommend this trip but please be prepared - the cabins are very small like a train sleeper so only pack the minimum of things and take a small bag to fit under the bed (larger bags can be stored below decks). Be prepared to share toilets and showers but there is a wash basin in each cabin.

From the welcome at the Quayside on the first morning ,the relaxing speed of travel, the marvellous food, the extremely helpful host and friendly staff to the interesting visits and guided tours along the way - all added to the experience of travelling via canals and lakes across the country.The young able/trainee sailors dealt with the 58 plus locks quickly and efficiently...a real team effort ! Granted, as you would expect from such an old ship, the cabins are extremely small with shared facilities on each deck. The doorways have high thresholds and the stairs are narrow and steep but that was all part of the charm.The guests were from six counties which made mealtimes and informal chats even more interesting. Later in the season the lack of water along the way may cause the cruise to be altered -strong shoes and waterproofs are recommended at this time of year!

Sweden,Charlotte I,Göta Canal,1.0,"My parents booked a trip for the upcoming summer with friends. From experience they opted to pay extra for a cancellation insurance.
Unfortunately fate had it that my father passed away so I called to cancel the trip assuming that everything was in the clear thanks to dad’s good planning.
Cancelling was no issue however it turns out that the cancellation insurance does not cover the so called “admin fees” of 500 sek PER PERSON!!!
All of a sudden the insurance (1200 sek) only guarantees getting your money back - in reality there is a ‘hidden’ cost (if you don’t super read the contract) of another 2000 sek for, in this case, admin fees for the 4 people who cancelled.
In what world does it cost the company 500 sek per person to push a button to cancel the reservation??!!

Must give them one + : since my dad did not choose to cancel, due to his passing, along with the delicacy of the situation; Gota Canal volunteered to remove his admin fee after some opposition from my side.

Worth noticing is, however, that the contract does say that the admin fee still applies incase of death...

Sweden,ZincAlloy63,Göta Canal,5.0,"Göta kanal was appointed Swedish construction of the latest millennium. The canal runs through multiple lakes and many sceneries. It is accessible not only by boat, but also by foot and bicycle. Highly recommended when travelling through Sweden.",Jul 2018
Sweden,CathyV63,Göta Canal,5.0,"We had a wonderful boat trip across the Göta Canal all the way from Mem to Goteborg. The scenery is pastoral. The weather was sunny and hot. The lockmasters make it all run smoothly and there are some lovely places to visit en route. We had a pass that allowed us to use the canal and stay at the associated marinas. All that was fine until we tried to use the laundry facilities at one place (Kaptain Billes) and they had one washer and one dryer that took forever. Three loads of laundry (nothing fancy) took over 6 hours. That is insane. That needs to be fixed.
Shower facilities varied from awesome and well maintained to not so great and not well maintained. It was hit and miss even in the same marina.
The BIG Huge flaw is the lack of communication between the Göta Canal experience and how the experience on the Trollhättan Canal. At the end of the Göta Canal, the lock master told us that we had to get information once we were in the Trollhättan Canal. We had to find the canal office at the start. That was useless and stressful. And wrong. We learned pay your Trollhättan fee when they have you in the lock - they come to collect and you do not need to leave your boat to find a canal office (which turned out to be closed in our case). We learned our premium Göta Canal pass still covered Trollhättan lock charges but there were no associated marinas so we had to pay marina fees in Vänersborg and other spots as we worked towards Göteborg. Again, why could this not be clearly communicated from the start? All the Göta Canal literature treats this as one big long canal. Not so once you get there. Saying that, the communication between locks on the Göta Canal leg was excellent and there was no guess work. Trollhättan is obviously very commercial still and much less touristy. It was very cool to see the larger commercial boats and the locks were huge. You never saw a lockmaster at all but the remote cameras worked well and we never had unreasonable waits for locks or bridges.
Five stars is for the great scenery, nice lockmasters, and for the great patient Swedes who put up with my English and were so friendly and helpful in all ways.
Fix your brochures and online articles. Explain the Trollhättan leg works, too. That may go some ways to eliminating the nickname of “the divorce ditch”!

Sweden,nuala102016,Göta Canal,2.0,"The good first:
I was on the boat Juno.

The landscapes are gorgeous and the paths along the canal idyllic. Wonderful way to see the countryside of Sweden. Beautiful small towns along the canal. The boat is beautiful although the cabins are very small, however they make that clear in their brochure. There were two old bikes on board for passengers to use which was nice. However, they were not well maintained. It can be very cold and windy, definitely bring a warm coat. They do have blankets on the chairs on the upper deck which is nice. They have coffee and tea on the upper deck at all times but it is all self serve.

The not so good:

1. Lost a whole day of our cruise sitting on a bus. There was not enough water in a portion of the canal for the boat to pass. None of us were told that before leaving. As a sailor myself I would have thought the Captain would have been aware of the conditions on the canal ahead of time.

After being on a day, we were told the canal was too low to pass and we had to get up an hour early the next day to eat breakfast quickly and then board a bus for a full day. They removed us and all the furniture. We were then taken to a nearby town that was closed with empty streets and parked behind some buildings next to dumpsters. We lost a whole day of our 4 day trip sitting on a bus staring at garbage. The passengers finally approached the cruise director and asked that we all be taken back to the canal because we would rather sit there. This was done.

My Swedish cousin later told me that Sweden had been in a drought all winter so
I highly recommend doing a little research about water levels or rain/snow fall before going.

2. We hit another boat. When we finally got back on the boat we continued down the canal and came up to a lock. Our Captain missed the lock, bounced off a concrete wall and hit another boat. As a result we were delayed some more as accident reports were written up etc. More time was lost on our cruise.

3. Due to all the delays they knew we would never keep our schedule so they gave everyone two options. You could opt to not finish the cruise and be put on a bus that would get you to Gothenburg at the time we were supposed to arrive or you could stay an extra day to finish the cruise. We opted to stay on the boat an extra day but still never got the full cruise. They got us as far as Mariestad, then stopped and spent the night there, and then put us all on a bus to Gothenburg in the morning. I'm not sure why they didn't go through the night and complete the cruise but they did not. It also would have been nice to have the option at that point to go to Gothenburg that night rather than waste a night in Mariestad for no reason.

4. Poor Cleaning: The brochure stated that rooms were cleaned everyday. Out of 5 days on board our room was cleaned twice. The two times it was cleaned the beds still looked sloppy.

5. Food-no extras!!: The food was good but apparently limited. A gentleman at our table asked for a second dinner roll and it was brought to him. I then asked for one a bit later and the waitress then gave our whole table a lecture about how there are only a limited number of rolls and that she can't do this for everyone. For the price you would think you could get a second dinner roll. Oddly, the next morning at breakfast there was a whole basket put out filled with the very same rolls.

6. Poor waitress service at meals: The food was brought out timely enough but If you asked for anything typically the response was ""no, I'm busy."" ??? This happened to several of us at the table multiple times. Either they didn't have enough staff or this young girl did not know how to handle herself.

7. Overall the crew seemed very young, inexperienced, dismissive and at times juvenile with their responses. You were often left with the feeling you were inconveniencing them.

8. Lack of professionalism: The cruise director started crying in the middle of a daily meeting where she was updating us about bus times etc. She fell sobbing into the arms of an older crew mate standing behind her who then explained she had been working hard and was tired. She finally gathered herself and finished then ran out of the room and was found sobbing at the rail. Either she was not trained well or not mature enough to handle the pressures of her job.

9. Noise at night: We had a cabin on the middle deck in the back. At night the sound of the motor was incredibly loud. It sounded like you were sleeping in a washing machine. I do not know if it was quieter more upfront but I recommend inquiring about that.

10. Bad decision making. There was a time when we went to leave a port we had docked at and were grounded. The Captain kept revving the motor to push the boat and finally succeeded. However an hour or two later when we were in open water on a huge lake it was announced that we possibly had a broken propeller and we might have to go to a port. We never heard a follow up about that.

11. Unknowledgeable crew: We asked a couple of different times where we were along the canal and the crew had no idea. Once we were on one of Sweden's largest lakes and the crew member could not tell us what the name was, nor did she offer to find out or give guidance on how we could find out. She was very dismissive.

12. Problem solving was poor. Clearly our trip had issues with low water and boating accidents but there seemed to be a lack of any Plan B and a lack of ability to problem solve as these things occurred.

13. Not helpful: There is a small store on board where you can buy books, sweatshirts, boat models, etc. I had asked the director if she could help me in the store and she was too busy. When she did find the time she had little knowledge about any of the products or her stock. She said that the store was not the ""thing"" and that she had to go because she was busy. Seemed odd that they would be too busy to sell you their goods. She had told me she was out of certain books which another passenger found right after she left us both to fend for ourselves.

14. Not forthcoming: I asked the director for the name and contact information of the person that I could speak to about my concerns. She kept avoiding giving me that information and on the last day she finally gave me a card with no name on it and a general email address. She said that they said not to contact them that they would contact me. I had to pump the name of a manager out of her. Needless to say no one attempted to contact me, I ended up contacting them.

15. Incorrect bill: Upon check out you pay for any items you may have purchased in the store or wine/drinks you bought. In the store you write down on a piece of paper anything you bought. My bill was incorrect and I when I questioned them they said that was what was on the paper. I asked to see the paper which they had in front of them and they could not find anything nor would they show it to me. They also charged me for the wrong bottle of wine. We had bought 3 bottles of a 35 SEK wine and they charged us for 3 bottles at 55 SEK. They rushed me onto the bus so I couldn't go over it with them anymore. I called the company upon my return and they did correct my bill. However, that became a difficult month long task requiring multiple emails and lots of follow up because for some reason they could not credit my credit card back. They had to wire the money. This took weeks of pursuit and emails and became very time consuming.

All in all I was expecting an old boat but a classy boat. Unfortunately this was not a classy experience.

I do not recommend the Gota Canal cruise.

If you do choose to take a chance get info on water levels in advance and find out what the boat draws. The cruise company claimed the canal company told them the water was deep enough for the boat to pass. Obviously there is bad information going on so you will have to do your homework. Bring warm clothes and rain gear (even for July, it was mostly in the 60's and windy). Inquire about which rooms have less engine noise. Check your bill thoroughly before deboarding. My Swedish cousin did say there tended to be less rain in August.

Sweden,Porly R,Göta Canal,5.0,We rented a boat and did the Gota canal in 5 days. It is lovely. The people at the canal lock are really helpful. The marinas are in perfect condition and offer always different activities...I would come back,Aug 2017
Sweden,Peter L,Göta Canal,5.0,"Travelled Gothenburg to Stockholm on the MS Diana a 50 passenger restored 1930's canal passenger ship. As advertised cabins are small and the shared bathrooms even smaller but entirely satisfactory and functional. An interesting mix of passengers from all continents except Africa. Crew were very friendly professional and efficient nothing was too much trouble to satisfy the whims of those on board. Sweden has had quite dry weather and the water level in the canal was below usual resulting in us running aground ( not permanently) just before the last port before Stockholm and finished the tour by bus so the ship could return to Gothenburg before the water level got any lower. Having said that we did not miss any major sights and the organisation of the change of plan was seamless. This is one of the hazards of a canal cruise and in no way detracted from the experience. In all a most enjoyable trip which I would highly recommend.

Sweden,annwoodall,Göta Canal,4.0,"Went on the 4 days/3 nights cruise. Originally planned from Stockholm, but the water in the canal was too low, so we spent the whole first day on a bus/boats to get to Berg, where we boarded M/S Juno. Amazing ship, crew, and countryside! The cabins are ca. 1.90 x 1,50 m2, so absolutely no space for suitcases. We were told to bring small ones, so we could store them under the lower bunk, but they were still too big. Two persons can not change clothes at the same time in the cabin. Also, you don't get to chose your partners at the dinner table yourself, so that can be quite interesting. A great - and very expensive - experience!

You can also choose from a variety of cruises. We decided to cycle from Borensberg to Berg, which was an absolutely beautiful experience. Bikes are easy to rent from Borensberg.",Jul 2017
Sweden,wheelchairmike,Göta Canal,5.0,"We sailed from Stockholm to Gothenburg on the M S Juno in July. From the moment you are welcomed onboard there is a feeling of stepping back in time. This ship is a small piece of floating working history, built in 1874 and still going strong As the itinerary papers stress, cabins are small say 6' long by 5' wide and 7' high and I might be exaggerating. This includes a daybed with a fold down upper bunk and a wash hand basin and a small hanging wardrobe but there are lots of hooks. The trick is to pack layers to wear as it can be cold, wet, windy or sunny all in the same day. There is plenty of room under the bottom bunk to store clothes in a squishy bag. We put our big suitcase in the hold as we were going to stay in Gothenburg when we disembarked. People are encouraged to dress a little more smartly in the evening but nothing OTT.
There is coffee on tap all day at the rear of the bridge deck, an honesty bar and afternoon tea is served there daily. There are also a number of wicker seats and blankets so you can watch the passing scenery in comfort. You will travel through canals and lakes and the ever changing scenery is fantastic. You can get off and walk along the towpath as the Juno goes through locks and there will be organised excursions everyday if you wish to go on them with a tour guide. The meals were excellent, self-service buffet breakfast and waitress served lunch and dinner. You are allocated a seat for the lunch and dinner and most people stuck to these for breakfast. There must have been 40 or so onboard most were Swedish, Norwegian or German with Switzerland the UK, Australia and the USA also being represented. In a nod to the 21 century there was excellent WiFi onboard if you wanted it.
As you may know I am a wheelchair user but I can walk a bit; critical on this trip as my wheelchair was useless on board, but the Juno is so small that I could walk round the ship using the outer handrail and a stick. I had clearance from the company before we signed up and they assigned us cabin A4 on the weather deck that meant I could walk to the dining room and the loos. The weather deck cabins seemed to have much better ventilation and larger windows than those down below on the main deck. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful to me.
A very different cruise experience from the big river cruise boats but it was fantastic watching the world glide by at 4 mph and you could not fault the professionalism or the enthusiasm of the crew.

Sweden,Olaffen,Göta Canal,5.0,"Last year we had a really nice experience going by our Nord Star Patrol 24 all the way from Narvik to Oslo. This year it was time to transport the boat back to Narvik. We decided to trailer it from Kalix in Bottenviken. On the route from Oslo to Kalix we decided to include Gøta Kanal. A wise decision.

It was really relaxing cruising at 5 knots through the Swedish farm land. Nice people all around.

We made the trip early June which is before the busy periode in July and August. That periode is worth considering if you have the freedom to do so.

Sweden,Pete B,Göta Canal,5.0,"I travelled the canal between December 27th to January 1st, on a cargo ship. It was COLD , but what do you expect ??? Beautiful nights, still and too cold to snow, the mooring ropes were frozen solid and difficult to handle. We arrived at a paper mill at the far end of the way, 1 metre of snow covering the ground. We had those Swedish Clogs on and were able to walk around outside, in the blue moonlight, without socks on and yet still have warm feet ! The quietness of the place is startling and a sensory pleasure.

After a week stay in the paper mill port, we had to be broken free by a small icebreaker, spun around and follow it to the first locks, where we were able to proceed by ourselves. It was STILL damned cold, but the Swede have a method of dealing with the cold. Get blootered and ignore the conditions ! They used alcohol as an anti-freeze !

Now it is a tourist amenity, I reccomentd it for a short break away from the bustle of city life, for anywon.

Sweden,Ronald D,Göta Canal,5.0,"I had read a bit on the Canal cruises and decided to take the 6-day Grand Cruise from Stockholm to Goteborg. I sailed on the Diana and it was a wonderful experience I will remember for the rest of my life.

The crew was simply fantastic, from the Captain to the guide, the servers, the deck.hands and the kitchen crew. Every one of them went out of their way to assure we had a fantastic experience.

The food was simply wonderful. A breakfast buffet, a 2-course lunch and a 3-course dinner ... every meal was a new experience and every bit of it was just delicious ... and I never thought I would ever eat an anchovy salad or pickled herring. But I was wrong: I ate it and loved it.

Yes, the cabins are small and the shower miniscule, but you get used to it fast. The shore excursions were terrific and interesting ... and the scenery of the passing Swedish coutryside was stunning.

We were extremely lucky and had nice weather for most all of the trip.

And I met and made new friends. All of the passengers got along very well and we all had a great time, with folks from Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Scotland, Australia and the U.S.

It was so much fun and so enjoyable that I am very likely to do it again!

Sweden,Russell H,Göta Canal,5.0,"Much has already been written about travelling on the historic canal boats on the Gota Canal. I joined the six day cruise from Gothenberg to Stockholm, on the MS Diana.
The experience was top class in every way. The tiny cabin did not detract from the enjoyment. I knew this before booking.
Travelling in a manner of a bygone era was most enjoyable.
The crew members are all very highly trained and did anything to make the journey so enjoyable. The food is of a high caliber, with so much variety. Surprisingly, MS Diama was fitted with free wifi, which functioned really well, no matter where the boat was situated.
Whether your interests are in rural Sweden, waterways, locks, fauna and flora, architecture, history, meeting passengers from other countries, relaxing, etc etc, you are catered for.
Sweden's national day (6 June) fell during this cruise. A special cake was baked, and the national anthem was sung at dinner. As a visitor to Sweden, I really felt included.
A cruise through the many locks of the Gota Canal is an experience that one will never forget. It is a different experience.

Sweden,Paul E,Göta Canal,5.0,"I sailed with the Gota Canal Steamship Company's MS Diana on the 6-day voyage which departed Stockholm on Wednesday August 12 for Gothenburg, under the command of Capt Ola Wikander, with Ms Johanna Lingaas Türk as the Cruise Director.

As a passenger in this instance, might I say that (and the magnificent late summer weather assisted greatly) it has been one of the loveliest marine - or any other - experiences of my life. A wonderful vessel, a fabulous crew - and I mean each and every one of them - creative and wonderful food, and entertainment provided by the crew.

The Able Seaman/Engineer on our voyage, Håkan, was tireless and showed wonderful shipcraft and love of the boat, his job and fellow crew. People like Håkan, the charming, very funny and insightful Captain Wikander, the tireless, elegant and very caring Ms Türk and every one of her hard-working and very likeable fellow crew members (First Officer Karin, chefs Ursula & Sara, hands Oliver & Johanna, stewards Maria & Ellen) made a tremendous impression with the extremely sociable passenger group (circa 50) on our voyage.

Prior research explains the quirks of tiny cabins and all passengers sharing toilet/bathrooms. Do not let this put you off however, as the boat is beautifully maintained and facilities are kept impeccably clean throughout the voyage. As long as you are reasonably mobile the movement through three three decks (max) is easily negotiated - film stars and other celebrities have made the voyage over the years without qualms.

One thing: if at all possible, spend the extra and do the 6-day voyage, as you tie up overnight and visually experience the complete daylight aspects of the voyage along one of the world's most interesting and remarkable canal/lake transport routes and the equally wonderful countryside and towns of southern Sweden. So much more rewarding you'd have to think - even if you don't get the continuously fabulous weather our passage experienced.

Lovely and interesting local excursions (principally on foot) are thrown in, as well as the chance just to walk the canal paths alongside the Diana, at regular intervals.

Although travellers can otherwise work their way along the canal and region by car, bus, train and hire boats, these canal boats are the very epitome of style and grace of a bygone era. Enthusiastically recommended!

Sweden,Aussie2424,Göta Canal,3.0,"The views on this trip are spectacular, you get to go through 66 locks...quite an experience. Get up at 3.30am (yes that's right) if you want beautiful sunrise photos, and yes there is coffee at that hour.

Food was delicious.

Brochure was upfront and honest that rooms are tiny so no surprises which is good. Shared shower and toilet which again was no problem as was clear in the brochure. They offered to store large suitcase for the journey but I left mine in my room as I was by myself (not cheap because you must pay single supplement).

There were 6 of us who didn't speak Swedish, everyone else did. They take a maximum of about 41 passengers - we had 31 which was good.

I met 2 other Aussies and the three of us felt it was the Swedish tour and we were just tagged on because all commentary was first in Swedish then a summarised version given in English rather than the full version. On one of the shore tours we were put with the Swedish people and given commentary in Swedish then English. However the 2 Swiss people were given their own tour guide in German!!! The tour guide knew English and so did the Swiss people. We were not impressed!!!! They could have put the Swiss with the Aussies and the French person and given the tour in English as we all knew English.

For the captain's dinner night the captain sat all the meal with the Swedish group in the other dinning room...he could have eaten entree and main with them and came and ate dessert with us but chose not, we were given the tour guide in his place.

The Swedish people on the tour were nice, but often when sitting with them they would start to speak in English and include us but later turn to Swedish speaking....after 5 mins I walked away as I didn't understand them and felt left out.

Travelled in July 2015 on MS Juno. Great sights, very good food but we felt it was the Swedish tour and we were just tagged on so not impressed on that aspect.

Sweden,Travelscan,Göta Canal,5.0,"We cruised from Goteborg to Stockholm on the historic MS Juno.
Juno was built in 1874 and is reputed to be the oldest passenger ship still in service. Juno has has 29 cabins on 3 decks. The atmosphere is all mahogany and brass. Cabins are small, rather like those you find on a train, with comfortable bunk beds and a fold down wash basin. Shared shower and toilet are along the deck.
The back half of the upper deck is a covered area where passengers can sit in wicker chairs and watch the superb scenery slide by. The journey follows the Trollhatten and Gota canals that link with a number of inland lakes to provide a passage that includes 66 locks, numerous lift, swing and tilt bridges along with two aqueducts to carry you from Goteborg to Stockholm. This is a photographer's dream.
We found the journey exceeded all our expectations. The staff were amazing and ensured that everything ran like clockwork. Nothing was too much trouble. The meals were superb, considering the tiny galley, and were served in the wood paneled dining room set with linen, crystal and silver. There were a number of walking side trips, taken when the ship was negotiating locks, to museums, churches and other places of interest.
There are however a number of caveats.
This is possibly not a journey for young people or children. There is no TV, no video games, no piped music. In fact you are urged to turn off your phone for the peace of your fellow passengers. The only entertainment is the passing scenery and stimulating conversation.
Also realize that Juno was built in 1874. The cabins are small with bunk beds to climb into. The decks are connected by steep narrow stairs. Doorways have high sills to step over. To enjoy this journey you need to reasonably fit and agile.It would not suit those with a mobility problem

Otherwise put this journey on your list to do before you die!

The historic canal and 140-year-old boat served us well as we passed slowly through the countryside and 50 some locks. The food was terrific, the staff very accommodating, and the shore excursions interesting. It was a great way to begin our stay in Sweden, recovering from pre-trip hassles and jet lag, and getting acquainted with Sweden and many Swedish people - as well as new friends from other countries.

Sweden,Anders W,Göta Canal,5.0,"This channel was dug by hand and all sea locks hand crafted. The idea of the canal was actually born out of not splitting Sweden in two halfs but rather creating a fast lane from the Baltic Sea to the Atlantic. The construction started 1810 and 22 years later the entire canal was completed. The Channel is by far one of the biggest construction projects ever in the Swedish history measuring 190 km in length with 58 sea locks. Yes, this is a great boat ride!",Jul 2015

There were daily briefings and some side excursions if you wished. Although the cabins are quiet cramped, after all, this boat, the Juno, is 140 years old, they were very clean. No one wanted to spend much time in them anyway, when you could be topside visiting and siteseeing.

The greeting from the first moment gave a very good impression and the friendliness, efficiently and enthusiasm of the Captain and crew continued to the moment we left the boat.
The atmosphere of friendliness spread to all the passengers and everyone joined in conversations in their different languages.
The boat had benefited from its recent refit and although the cabins are tiny, they are laid out well and the adjoining toilets and showers kept in good order.
We ate an excellent range of Swedish style food and were impressed with the standard and the presentation and always looked forward to the meal.
The inclusive excursions and walks were well organised and we were particularly impressed with the way that the Captain was able to make special dropping off and picking up stops for those who found walking difficult.
This trip would appeal to anyone who has experienced small boat sailing as it was impossible not to be impressed by the skill of the Captain and crew when handling the many locks and narrow channel navigation.
This was the most relaxing and interesting of holidays and we would recommend it highly. We will certainly return to Sweden as the trip has shown us a beautiful country.

Sweden,CatharinaSweden,Göta Canal,4.0,"Last Saturday night my husband, daughter and I went on a prawn cruise on Göta Kanal (channel) and Lake Roxen, with a motorship called ""Wasa Lejon"". The trip started at Bergs slussar, which is in itself a very beautiful, scenic area by the water, with vast lawns, a mini golf course, and a café. We went throught the many locks (I think there were seven locks before we reached the surface level of lake Roxen), and then around on the lake Roxen. The locks in themselves are very exciting - and a little scary - especially for kids. All in all the trip took four hours.

When on lake Roxen, we were served our prawns. You could eat how much you wanted, and the waitresses went around and took away the shells for you and served you more prawns, bread, butter and mayonnaise. Ice-water was included in the price, and then you could also order wine, liqueur, coffee, lemonade etc. if you paid extra. The prices were moderate.

The waitresses did their job adequately, but I think they could have been a little nicer and more service-minded... I felt that they were a little too young and unprofessional in their attitude towards the guests. This small fault is what makes me detract one point in my grading - from five to four.

When we had finished with the prawns, we went out on the bow deck, watched the sunset over lake Roxen, and felt the fresh breeze against our skin... There was also a entertainer, who sang and played on a small electronic piano for an hour or so. He was not very good really, but in that romantic environment and with a few glasses of wine inside you, he was quite good enough! :-)

I strongly recommend this trip, if you have one night over here in Linköping!

The food is on par with Guide Michelin recommendations and the service was also excellent.

Sweden,mart52002,Göta Canal,2.0,"Gota Canal all very nice , good food 5 & by and large staff were ok & friendly - thats whats good said and out of the way.
Firstly it is way over priced - on the verge of ridiculous and one could quite easily (with a minimum of what Gota Canal 7 day trip would cost !) afford a holiday to the Bahamas from Europe and be ""guaranteed"" sunny weather. We heard stories of passengers from prevoius trips locking themselves away in their cabins ( cabins so small you have to take it in turns to get up in the morning as its so cramped) because of inclement weather for the duration of the trip. Luckilly we had almost 3 days good weather before the heavens opened and with that it rained the remaining 4 days of our trip.
So if you are thinking of booking remember to bring an umbrella as this could easily be the wettest holiday you never dreamed of !
P.S. If you do happen to be a vegetarian please note the food as a whole is pretty much of the frozen food variety and not very imaginative - a big disappointment.

The boat we were on will be 100 years old next year but is meticulously maintained and wonderfully staffed. Extremely small cabins (as on a train) but you use the cabin only for sleeping. We were on the bridge deck (top) which gave us excellent access. Great weather helped and every day brought new sights as the boat stops at least once during the day as well as good companionship with the less than 50 other passengers.

The restaurants are on the pricier side but the quality in the seafood place is very good.

Overall a very clean park.

I do recommend!

Almost all attractions are fun rides or experience.
Lots of laughs is almost guaranteed .
Extremely long queues !! Sometimes you have to wait for 2 hours to ride a 2 min ride !
Therefore i advise you to
1. Buy the 2 days entrance and plan well .
2. Go in early even if you miss hotel breakfast.
3. Book a near by hotel , we stayed at Gothia towers and it was nice .
4. Buy the fast track without hesitation.
5. DO NOT even think of going during a weakened and try to avoid going on a holiday

We went for 2 days , the first day was sunny so it was crowded, while the next day had some light rain and it was just perfect we had the chance to try all attractions within 3 hours only !!!!

Worth the entry fee of Sek120.

Beautiful Christmas displays, great Christmas market & of course the theme park aspects which was great fun to watch. Would love to bring my kids & grand kids!!! Wonderful entertainment and rides for young & older.

Sweden,Love2Globetrot,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"We visited the Liseberg because of the Christmas markets and attractions at the park. What can I say...I have never seen so many Christmas lights in one place! The lights, the Christmas music, the market stalls, the fake snow, decorations and ice dancing performance....it’s all incredible and you definitely feel in the mood for Christmas once you’ve visited the park. Did not go on any rides. Wheelchair accessible except for getting up to the giant Ferris wheel. That is a very steep path to get up there. Just another tip...you can pay cash to get into the park and if you want to pay cash to go on the Ferris wheel, they buy a ticket at the entrance. Otherwise you can only pay for tickets by card up by the Ferris wheel. Really enjoyed our time at the park, it’s just a shame it was chucking it down with heavy rain the whole time....did not know Gothenburg was the rain capital of Sweden until the locals told us! You can buy ponchos at the park if you forget your umbrella. There are not many places to be able to keep out of the rain...so prepared to get soaked if you head there when it’s raining!

Sweden,TerryDMatthews,Liseberg amusement park,2.0,"Dec 19
My partner and I visit someone each winter to experience a new city and usually enjoy the winter markets - Liseberg was advertised as the place to go to do this in Gothenburg.
However, this is basically a fun fair with some tinsel.
Neither of us were interested in the rides, and found that after 45 mins of walking around, we had mostly seen everything.
Yes, there are the usual street sellers, but those are intermixed with gambling everywhere, which is surely not appropriate for younger children?
To its credit the ice dancing show was impressive, but on the day we visited there was just the one performance - i would have expected this to be every hour or so all night for something that lasts 15 mins?
There was none of the warm and cosy atmosphere experienced elsewhere in the city, more a very commercial very over priced experience, which will be fine for some, but not for others.
Go, but know what you are getting, this is a theme park, not a winter market.

Sweden,Mary Griffiths,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"Liseberg is really stunning at Christmas. I have to admit that we have no interest in the rides (though they looked good) and visited purely to see the Christmas decorations, which were well worth being outside in -5'C for. The trees and the whole park are really decorated so attractively and it looks so magical. Also, nice music is played through the park - Christmas carols and classical piano music - so that it's all really relaxing and enjoyable. The only downside we found were that the eating places were very busy and the ones that looked nicer had queues outside, but it was a busy time, being a Saturday night and the first weekend of advent (and, I gather, the first dry weather for a while!). We did manage to find some fish and chips, which, luckily for me, was gluten-free, and kept us going for the evening, even if the surroundings were a bit busy and not as relaxed as we might have chosen. Definitely recommended for the Christmas decorations.

Sweden,Rūta A,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"I have read reviews that this place is quite busy, especially during holidays and weekend, but we had a free time, so we decided to take a risk since it was a middle of December and it was saturday. We have bought tickets online in advance to avoid queues. It was a good idea because with that purchase we were able to choose 3 attractions from the list (biggest, scarriest and the most popular attractions) and a visiting time, so on that time we got a priority boarding on that attractions, nice!! There were some problems with my phone and wasn't able to open tickets on entrance so a very helpful staff at the entrance helped us to solve the problem. On entrance we also get a cheque where it was printed our chosed attractions and visiting time, that we have booked when bought tickets. Very good reminder! Before our visit I was contacting them and asked about luggages. The staff was very polite and operative answered that there will be no problem even with a big luggages. So when we entered, we just left our luggages near Main Entrance at staffed cloakroom. Despite it was already Christmas season and a weekend I can say that queues both at the entrance and at the attractions wasn't terrible. Of course there were some places where you had to wait but it really didn't take very long. At some attractions there where no queues at all! Except Lisebergshjulet - a queue there seemed to be endless!! So we gave up because we had to fly home.. We have spent there more than 6 hours and though it was quite cold outside, but a time flew so fast!! I think we really would stay longer if we could. There are a lot of thing to do and to see, not only attractions. It was very nice to be there when outside there were no snow but inside Liseberg there were a lot of decorations which reminded that soon there will be Christmas! So you were able to feel Christmas even if outside wasn't white winter.
We went there without children but if you still feel a child inside you (and even if you don't) I really can recommend this place. We are not a huge fans of things like this but it was great. So if you are in Gothenburg and have a free day or even half a day, go here, it is worth!

Sweden,Anders,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"Liseberg is located conveniently in the centre of the city. Parking is best done in the Focus house that seems less attacked by car thiefs which can be a problem on the south side. Best food in my mind is to avoid the burgers and fast food places and instead opt for the meatballs at the Taube restaurant close to the big stage. For a good snack i suggest the waffels. These both options provides the best bang for the buck.

Obviously the rides Valkyria, Helix, Balder and Loke is a must but expect 60-80 min queueing during high season. Pick a less sunny day if you want to cut the queing. Drizzle is possibly best for this. First time visitors with kids or teens should opt for a two day stay - as a local getting the season pass, although expensive, is typically a good idea since the park offers not only rides but also restaurants and artists performing concerts.

Ride-wise the top rides are among the best in northern europe, food could be improved and prices a bit stee with a bigger family.

The rides felt quite safe, queue times were mostly short, except for maybe a couple where we had to wait 30 minutes, but it was worth it! The only incident towards the end that left us slightly shocked and disappointed was in the Ghost house. The guy at the entrance asked us ""how many are we"" in swedish (which I don't speak very well as I have been in Sweden for a year and took a while to understand what he was asking), he then lets us through and rudely says ""there's no education in England?"". My friend and I were quite shocked - how does speaking a language translate into education? We both are Masters students and we don't even come from England.

The park is really compact but there are loads of rides to suit all ages from a kids section to thrills and 2 water rides.
The rides are not just carbon copies of other parks which is nice - our teenagers loved Mechanica, Helix, Valkyria and we all went on the mine train - although this was more like a normal lower level rollercoaster.

Grounds are really well done - lots of places to sit, walk - gardens to wait in while kids were riding. Plenty of shops too and place to eat. Escalators take you up to some rides. Bit painful when they’re not working as it’s a lot of steps. Lovely quaint feel but with modern rides too.

There seemed to be a unusual element in the park which was lots of huge oversize bars of chocolate being won in roulette type games were to pay 20 SEK ( about £1.70) a go to get 5 numbers and wait to see if you win! Everywhere you looked people were carrying giant toblerone I or snickers or diam bars! Needless to say we had a go and our kids came away very happy having won!

Great roller coasters where you felt safe sitting in them. I really recommend a “Express pass” where you can chose to skip the lines for four rides of your own choosing. Because the lines there can get really long depending on which one is the most popular at the moment.

Almost €100 for 2 people with a wristband for all rides. You could buy tickets for rides which worked out at around 250kr €25 for 9 tickets (some rides require more than 1 ticket) but decided the full pass was best to make use of the park. When we entered I could not believe the amount of people the park had admitted entrance. For almost EVERY RIDE there was a queue between 1 to 1 and a half hour wait time. We went on one ride. Queued for a hotdog for another 30 +mins. In no way was this fun. Frustrating is an understatement, capacity overload. Which shows the park is not committed to an experience but rather volume of people for profit gain. So 1 ride, 1 disappointed teenager , €100 and 3 + hours of my life later we decided it best to leave the park as it was getting busier and busier as the day went on ..as if it could not get worse.

All the restaurants are expensive with crappy food and cheap seating despite fancy building facades . Simply nowhere nice at all to sit and escape the crowds.

It was rainy day but it did not affect us much.
We took tge admission ticket, then we bought tickets for each ride as needed as we did not have the time to take advantage of all in one ticket.
I recomend to visit the park, it worth it.

Sweden,SolnaSean,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"This is like a miniature version of a Six Flags amusement park in the States. The roller coasters were fast, thrilling and fun. The carnival games mainly consisted of a roulette wheel and you pay 20kr for a block of 5 consecutive numbers. If the wheel stops on one of your numbers, you win a giant candy bar (e.g., Toblerone, Daim, Ferrari, etc.).
The things we didn't like were the 30 minute wait on each ride, the crowd (you will get thousands of people there on a sunny day), smokers (yes, they can still smoke in designated areas....even next to the child rides) and the parking (very little parking lots, so be prepared to spend a good 45 minutes searching for an open spot).

Sweden,Ida Heiseldal,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"I have been visiting Liseberg annually since I was a very small child in 1996, and I seem to never stop loving it. As a an enthusiast for world-class roller-coasters and sufficient amounts of adrenaline, it is an amusement park that absolutely delivers, each and every time for me. I can also only speak for myself (an adult woman who adores everything that goes at a high speed), but I feel like it has a little something for everyone. It has some of Europe's most critically acclaimed attractions, like the dive-coaster Valkyria and the wooden roller-coaster Balder (my all-time favorite amusement park ride), a varied selection of other rides; water rides such as Flume Ride and Collorado which are wonderfully refreshing on hot summer days, thrilling flat rides, such as Mechanica and Loke, a massive drop tower called Atmosfear as well as entire sections of the park dedicated to a younger public.

The food selections are quite plenty and rather varied for an amusement park, with vegan/vegetarian options for those interested as well. I would specifically recommend the Austria-inspired Tyrolen, which plays live music from time to time, and the more fancy Stjärnornas Kro for a decent bite in between rides.

The last time I went there, in June 2019, I actually ordered my Liseberg-tickets online in advance, which gives you the ability to skip the queue in four attractions of your choosing, free of extra charge, which was a wonderful idea and offer I will definitely take advantage of again.

I have pretty much always had nothing but excellent experiences with the staff here; the servers in the restaurants I've visited have always been polite and hospitable, the people operating the rides have been security-minded and professional and the people at the ticket desks patient and amicable.

To top it all off, the park is simply breathtakingly beautiful in the evening, with so many bright, shining lights to accompany the ecstatic rush of adrenaline.
I will definitely continue visiting Liseberg annually, probably until old age. A beautiful place which holds many dear memories for me, and I seem to be making more every time I'm there.

Sweden,rashig,Liseberg amusement park,2.0,"Went there on a Saturday, rainy day, park too crowded, too expensive even to enter, not enough places to sit, and pretty mind boggling because of the rides which seemed so dangerous. Also there was nothing much for the tween group, my kids are 8 and 11, and the one section (where you have a rabbit performance, in Swedish) with kiddie rides seemed like too small for them while the bigger rides were too daunting and I was not comfortable sending my 11 year old on them. Several places you had these chocolate winning games, we did not win but people were carrying huge packs. Took a giant candyfloss but it got all melty and sticky.
All in all, Liseberg is the way you look at it - a smaller and Swedish version of Disney, or just a rip off and cacophony, and for me it was probably the latter - it got to me beyond a point, and I only liked the souvenir shop.

Food tasted really bad, took a long time to get and when we got the food there was nowhere to sit. The food queue reminded me of ancient tales of food queues in the old soviet union.

We visited on a Sunday, but despite it being a weekend - we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for any ride, and most were less than 5 minutes of waiting time.

We got the All-in-One ticket, which was by far the best value, as we went on too many rides to justify buying admission and ride ticket separately.

There's a great variety of rides and shops, and the souvenirs are lots of fun.

I definitely would suggest visiting Liseberg!

We enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere of this fun packed amusement park. It has something for everyone from the scary, fast, spinning rides, children and water rides and arcade games. There are plenty of places to eat including a Tyrolean Austrian restaurant and beer garden. We liked the picturesque mock fishing harbour too. A great place to visit and recommend it.

Only disadvantage for us is the temporary closure of helix and stratosfear due to maintenance. For me a reason to come back and test it... walkyrie was the best... food at lunch time was brilliant for a fun park and not so expensive.

We came with the intention of walking around, having some nice drinks and maybe some reindeer burgers as we read about. We walked past lots of nice stalls with samples of foods.

Unfortunately we never found suitable food and anywhere we went was a long wait so never got the most out of this amusement park. A lot of the decorations felt dated and somewhat tacky. Whilst we eventually found a nice spot indoors for drinks, we didn't feel like it was a must do in Gothenburg.

Sweden,familytravelsguy,Liseberg amusement park,2.0,"After several visits to Liseberg, we have found the same things each time. First, the good: There is some good food and fun rides. Our oldest loved the larger attractions and roller coasters, while the younger ones loved ""driving"" the cars and taking all the small kiddie rides. The food selection is also descent and tasty. Staff was generally helpful, with most being very polite.

However, the negative is what mainly comes to mind at Liseberg. First, you pay big park prices. This is not a cheap park, either for entry, experiences or food. This is somewhat to be expected, but the park is constantly full, limiting both movement and leads to a lot of standing still and waiting in cramped roped-off areas. Think you can come early to enjoy the smaller crowds before the park gets full? It doesnt make much of the difference with rides we tried....with no lines....staff members take their sweet time starting rides, so that a simple kiddie ride takes a full, literal 20 minutes to load a ride with 6 kids. (Experienced multiple times on multiple rides), even though the attractions appear to be staffed with 2-3 staff members--The rides were already prepped and tested as well). Add to this that everything is overpriced and it was a pain getting to and from the park, we will choose to simply go to other parks.

Lots of small ""shops"" selling hot chocolate, cinnamon/saffron buns and roasted almonds etc. We did not take any rides, but several of them were open. Even the new Valkyria.

Tip from our side is to concider going there on a weekday or maybe Friday or Sunday. Saturday evening was packed with people (14.000 had been there Friday and they expected 40.000 on Saturday), so felt like walking in a queue from we entered until we left.

The park opens 12:00 to 23:00 so loads of time to enjoy all on offer at a cost of approx £23 (entrance and unlimited rides)-bargain. Although not all the big rides operate in the build up to Christmas there are still enough that are-my favourites have to be Valkyria, “Europe’s longest Dive Coaster – a roller coaster with a vertical drop of 50 metres!” which was downright scary and a ride I missed most of as I was too busy screaming with my eyes closed and Balder, expecting a tame wooden roller coaster but instead experiencing an adrenaline/scream filling 90 seconds!!! Queue times were minimal-in fact for my rides you could walk straight on, although it was a 30 mins wait to get on the Big Wheel and it’s amazing views. As well as adults there are lots of rides for children so it does not matter what age you are-you will have fun!!! Lots of Christmas stalls too selling festive food and mulled wine and Xmas gifts, I arrived at 14:00 and left 20:30 and had more than enough to see and do. Only problem is it does get cold so wrap up warm-if not then perhaps an excuse for another mug of Glog!

Sweden,CJG45,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"The park reopened our last night in Gothenburg for their Halloween season and we decided to check it out. The staff out front was especially helpful, they walked us through buying tickets from their kiosks, and that allowed us to avoid a long line to get in. Once inside it was clear this is a great park, it was clean, it had a nice mix of rides, it was a very nice crowd, and I have to say their best rides were all top notch. The park puts on an impressive effort for Halloween, everything was decorated and there were lots of cast members dressed up for the occasion. The Zombie apocalypse toward the rear of the park was amazing, if not a little freaky. The park is centrally located and easy to get to via a tram, a cab or a short walk. Compared to US prices for amusement parks this was a down right bargain. This park is a great place to spend an afternoon or evening.

The play areas were cute and fun. It kept our little one busy and she had lots of fun. We did do the car ride which was fun for our child and it was cool that you can get your photo taken on a 'drivers licence' card after the ride.

They had many places to eat as well as a beer garden for the adult crowd. Park was clean and well maintained.

I wish I had won one of those big candy bars but it was fun to play.

Sweden,sir_meeshoo,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"While it cannot match the scale of Europa-Park, I found it nicer than Heide Park. It has a balanced number of attractions (thrill seekers would probably want more than 3 ""big"" coasters), nice layout, full of greenery and its own character. We visited in late August 2018 - both on Thursday and Friday. Opening times were 15-23 (what is rather non-typical, but it allowed us to explore the city before). Planning seems crucial, as there were virtually no queues at all. Only Valkyria (as a new attraction) and Spökhotellet Gasten (do not miss) required us to wait no more than 30 minutes, you could ride Balder or Helix virtually on-the-fly (0-10 minutes). And these two are definitely worth multiple rides, I doubt they get old at all if you are not a local. On Saturday waiting times for top attractions already excided an hour. Buy a full day all-in-one - a day is enough (given you do not pick a busy day) and buying coupons is pointless (we would use them all in an hour or so). If you are trying to defeat your fear of heights, AtmosFear is perfect - not only a huge free-fall tower itself, but also placed on top of the hill...

Definitely worth it.

Sweden,Rhiannon H,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"I spent a good few hours here in the evening - it's generally open till 10pm, though do check the opening hours/days on their website as they can be unpredictable. There was a great selection of rides, including several exciting rollercoasters, such as the Helix, their wooden rollercoaster Balder, and the new coaster Valkyria, my personal favourite. Queuing times were very reasonable, mostly between 20-40mins for the most popular rollercoasters, and as little as 5mins for some of the smaller rides - I basically walked straight onto the flume ride and the Lisebergbanan rollercoaster.

There are lockers near the Valkyria and Balder which can store your bags for hours if necessary, though many rides also have boxes nearby to store bags and small personal items.I felt safe and secure on all of the coasters, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The food is mainly expensive fast food and overpriced snacks, which is to be expected at a theme park. Entrance is 475SEK for an all-inclusive admission and rides pass, which is not unreasonable, and definitely works out cheaper than buying individual ride tokens if you want to go on a lot of rides - I went on 8 rides in total, going on the Valkyria twice. There is a tram stop right outside the park, too, which makes getting there from the town centre incredibly easy.

I had a lot of fun here, and would definitely recommend it as a great afternoon or evening out in Gothenburg.

Valkyria was sadly not opened yet but I know key feature of the ride from sheikra at busch Gardens Tempa and it is an amazing ride!

But for the best experience you should look in to which days is less crowded and buy a prio pass where you get to ride all the largest ride 1.5 hours before the official opening hours.

We got to ride Helix twice, atmosphere Loke and Balder once with no queue times at all before the park even opened at 11:00. And this became a unbelievable crowded Saturday with unbearable queue lines for the rest of the day.

Its a bit pricy for entrance and a wristband to enjoy all the rides, and the main problem with Liseberg is that you have to wait in line for the good attractions, could easily be up to 50 min, for us I think we spent half the day waiting, not acceptable. If you get hungry for a snack or a cold drink, there is plenty of places to pick from at Liseberg.

The biggest surprise was that the usual food price gouging was absent while the quality of food was quite decent.

I don’t have young kids but I observed that there were a lot of rides for small kids.

Since they are open to late at night, and with their mobile app that shows how long the wait for each ride, it is easy to avoid long lines.

It can get pricy but they provide surprisingly satisfying amusement park experience.

One thing to watch out is the weather. Most attractions are outdoor so when it is rainy, it may not be as fun.

Besides that Liseberg is a little better than Grona Lund in Stockholm. Mainly because the area is bigger and they have the possibility to have bigger rides.

I recommend the Lisebergshjulet for the best views and panoramic photograph potential inside and outside of the park as it rotates around fairly slowly 3x and if the day is clear, all the better.

There is a good selection of flat rides, spinning rides as well as the coasters and a couple of wet rides. I enjoyed each ride I went on, but disliked the haunted hotel, Spökhotellet Gasten, partially as the queue was horrendous and it is not a ride although is certainly interactive it was not appealing to me, found it boring.

Adored the gift shops they were filled with tasteful charming park memorabilia and keepsakes and appeared to be of good quality. The staff were efficient and friendly for the most part.

Helix and Balder are the obvious favourites for any thrill seeker but the new dive coaster Valkyria, coming soon, looks set to be amazing too.

Only 20 mins away from the airport. A little bonus for us was the world cup was on. They have a big screen set up on the pub gardens! Great night! We will be back!",Jul 2018
Sweden,MphsQueen,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Amazing.

The kids area has a wide range of rides with some the adult can take the baby on and others that our preschooler could do by himself (based on height).

The “drive your own car” ride comes with a proper hard plastic drivers license at the end, which our 4 year old treasures and takes everywhere. While waiting in line at another park a few days later, he was telling the other children he had his license!! It’s a great souvenir.

Baby changing and feeding area near the free playground with free wipes. The playground is incredible - so extensive and where we spent most of our time!

As you pay a small entry charge and buy tickets for rides, this worked well for us as we only did a few rides but mainly just played. Big rides looked amazing but not to be with the wee ones!

Sweden,FlyingDutchman80,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Rides were exceptional for kids and adults of all ages! My 3 year old loved the kids attractions and my 6 year old was a real dare devil to join her teenage cousins. The cues were short as the park has so much to offer that even on a busy sunny Saturday in July we never waited longer than 30 minutes. I would dare to rate it better than Disney!

My only problem was the straws in the park. These are still plastic which this day and age should have been paper and environmentally friendly.

Football fans be aware. I even saw a Millwall fan around. Surprisingly well behaved ;)

We will be back!

There are more then enough different Things to test for all People in all ages. Okay there was limit for small kids if they was below lenght they could not do this and that. A lot of small shops for buying Food and candy. Play vending machine hall. Outside the park and inside it was walk of line stars. Sold sale stall where You could win chocolate or teddies and more.

Sweden,travellinscot,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"We enjoy a theme park and decided to visit here during a recent flying weekend visit. It’s well geared up for young children but a bit limited for older children who don’t like the big rollercoasters. It’s quite a small park so easy to walk around in an afternoon. We paid at the door and then paid for the rides we wanted to use and found this to be cheaper for us - as the kids don’t go on everything. Lots of places to eat, from snack bars to nice restaurants. We were lucky that it was a fairly quiet Sunday, so didn’t need to queue at all. The new rollercoaster is still being built, so a section of the park was closed - it looks like that will be great! Good for a day trip if in the city. Easy to walk in about 20 mins from the central train station area.

During high season the line is long till certain attractions.

This year they hade a BIG new rollercoster. Valkyria. But this is not yet ready so you feel dissapointed because we went there to take this ride.

There are rollercoaster with low and high adrenalin kicks and for thoose that doesnt want to ride anything and just take a walk in the park or play games may do that instead.

The park constantly works to be better and one big improvement is that even though there are plenty of deliscious restaurants to choose from you have the possibility to take with you your own food and it by one of all the benches in the park.

There is artists performing yearly at the stage which is advanced to even bigger artists and performance. The prices are pretty high but ask the staff what choice is best for you and your company comparing to what you want to do cause they are very serviceminded and helps you out the best way possible.

No animals are allowed. Almost no smoking is allowed, its only at some restricted areas and there are cashmachines in the park so you dont have to think about taking out money before you enter.

Liseberg has special themes during Halloween and Christmas and if you have a year card you may enter the park without any extra cost.

Sweden,Malin G,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Having a note from your doctor will help immensely, take it the information desk to the left of the main entrance. They will set you up with a disability pass, having that will help the people who are operating the rides to adjust to your kids needs. If the kid can't wait in line, they will help you. Also, if it's a hazzle and you only get the kid to try this one ride, sometimes you can go twice in a row.
The volume of the noise at the park can be loud so earplugs or equivalent is a nice thing to bring with you.
If your kid needs to run off some energy, there's two good options, the hill has a playground just next to the old fashioned carousel. Also, the rabbits house has 3 exits and if you're 2 adults supervising you can cover all the exits. The Rabbits in costumes are awesome and understanding, make sure to talk to any of the actors guiding them and they will greet your kid in a manner that he/she is comfortable with.
If your kid needs to get away from all the commotion, the path up the hill just to the right after the main entrance leads to a calm park-like garden. Also, it has a little stream leading down to a pond.

If you need to visit a lavatory, the loos in the little arena like building to the left after the main entrance is often less crowded than other facilities, and there's disability toilets.

Playing the lottery is fun, but if not winning turns out to be too much of a disappointment, the fishing pond by the rabbits village will always award a prize.

The most important thing of all, by the main entrance there's a booth with blank bracelets, fill in your phone number and instruct your kid to talk to a park employee if you, God forbid, would get separated.

Allinall, going to a busy amusement park with a kid on the spectrum can be a hazzle, but the employees are great and will help you make the best out of your visit.

Halloween cannot be missed, when they cover the grounds with pumpkins, hay and scarecrows and create a selection of amazing spookhouses, nor can winter, where the grounds are filled with Christmas decorations, markets, an ice skating rink with ice performances and carol singers. The Christmas buffet is delicious also. No expense is spared in making this place amazing.
Also, if you have children the spelhuset inside offers unlimited gaming over three floors of pinball machines, virtual reality, air hockey and arcade games during school holiday periods in winter which is fantastic value.

Sweden,James F,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"Great Amusement Park which feels modern while still retaining a traditional Scandinavian feel. On the surface this park looks more targeted towards Thrill Seekers such as Thorpe Park, however there is lots of attractions for everyone to do. So The rides, Helix is an outstanding roller coaster, truly world class, after riding it became my new number one coaster! Balder is a excellent wooden coaster, the prefabricated track make the ride silky smooth, so if you don't like the rickety nature of wooden coasters, Balder is certainly one to try, the ride has some good airtime as well. Lisebergbanan is a ride which took me by surprise, great family thrill coaster which is just really good fun to ride as it interacts with the park's hilly terrain. The park has lots of other great rides such as the new 'Loke' as well as their classic Log Flume. The park is beautifully landscaped and is kept very clean, staff are friendly and polite as well as being efficient. The ride operations were running well, with two or three trains on the major coasters, meaning the lines were not too bad considering I went on a busy weekend. The park is open long hours, so there is plenty of time to get in all the attractions you want. The food was good,I would recommend going to the Skeppsmagasinet Restaurant as the service was quick and the ribs were good, not too pricey either. As for issues or improvements, I would only say the it would be better if the queues for the rides closed at the park closing time, for people to get in one last ride and I feel that the park lacked entertainment and shows when I went, I am not sure if it was because I went in September though.

Overall Liseberg is a excellent amusement park which I would recommend any Theme Park enthusiast to hop on a plane and visit, heck Helix alone is worth the trip!

Everything is well maintained and Balder is the best wooden coaster I have ever ridden. Liseberg puts a lot of energy in everything they do. During 2017 I was at liseberg on summer season, Halloween season and Christmas.

Personal tips. Try to avoid Liseberg during peak season. Easy for me to say who lives close. But try to look for Green Day’s on Lisebergs website.

Did you know that:

The wall outside the entrance to Helix is signed by coaster enthusiasts?

Somewhere on balder it is also signatures.

Try to find them.

Sweden,happytime19,Liseberg amusement park,2.0,"Came to Gothenburg just for the Christmas Markets and the highlight was going to be Lieseberg. We arrived by boat which was very atmospheric and I can recommnend - even go through a lock to get there! The lights were wonderful too - giant Christmas tree, lights in the trees and bridges etc.

However, once we arrived the place was packed - really, really crowded. We weren't interested in the rides so headed for the market stalls and had to get crushed walking slowly through the throng of people. Some of the stalls appeared to sell nice products but we couldn't get close and spent less than an hour at the park before deciding we needed to leave.

If you like crowds and lots and lots of fun fair type stalls and attractions this could be good but not for us!

Sweden,Rebecca M,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Had a great evening out at Liseberg to explore the Christmas markets and the funfair. It's really beautifully decorated - probably the most festive and prettiest of Christmas markets I've ever been to.
The Ferris wheel was around £6 per person which we thought was really reasonable.
The market stalls sold some really unique and well made gifts and weren't your typical Christmas market stalls that all sell similar things. Around 6/7pm it was quite busy and was hard to move in places.
We walked through the children's area and it looked great too. It's definitely worth the £10 to get in.

And the lisebergbahnen was surprisingly good! The park offers a great range of flat rides, the food was standard theme park food.

Sweden,Augusto VJ,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"A really good amusement park with a great atmosphere, a must visit for anyone who enjoys this kind of place.

I went on a Saturday, so I knew there would be a lot of long queues, and indeed there were. So for me it was worth it to purchase the basic entry ticket at the entrance for 100 SEK. I then went to the Balder roller-coaster (4 coupons), two spinning rides (jukebox and the Chinese platform, 2 coupons each) and the Ferris wheel (3 coupons). Each coupon was 22 SEK so 11 coupons cost me 242 SEK. Plus the entrance fee = 342 SEK. The experience was enough for me because I still wanted to visit Universeum, and those rides took me around 3 hours already. If I had bought the full day ticket (460 SEK I believe) wouldn't have been worth it.

I suggest studying the ticket options on their website before going.

Sweden,James B,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"I must start this review saying how impressed I was that every ride at the theme park was open during the whole duration of my visit on a very wet day. Coming from the UK where sometimes even a spot of rain can close some rides, this was a very positive experience and praise to the ride teams who work here. Despite the rain I had an excellent time at the park. Helix was most definitely the highlight, an incredible roller coaster which is almost as fun just to watch from the ground. Liseberg also has a great range of flat rides and a whole area dedicated for children. I would also recommend the train themed restaurant under Lisbergbanan. Very well themed and great for a train fan like myself. The day finished with a live act on the main stage, although I hadn't heard of them it was still a good time.

Sweden,Adrianmama,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"We couldn't purchase online tickets from our home country (just cannot be directed to the payment page via a smartphone or a pc), probably the tickets with the express pass (for 3 rides) are sold exclusively to the Scandinavians. I tried accessing the same page with a local sim when I was in Sweden, it seemed that I might be able to buy the tickets as I was directed to the payment page right away. However I didn't complete the purchase as the tickets were supposed to be sent by SMS and I was afraid that I couldn't receive it with a data only SIM card. I should have asked the hotel's concierge for help but .....it's all my fault!

We went on a Saturday, again, a terrible mistake! We arrived the park before it opened and managed to get on Helix,Balder & Loke within the first 1-1/2 hour but the crowd began to grow then. The waiting time for Helix or other popular rides was 60+minutes. It's such a grueling day though my family had tried all the targeted thrilling rides... three times on Helix & 2 times on Loke & Bumper cars respectively, 1 time on mechanica, Balder, mirror house, screaming swing and Aerospin...until park closed at 2300. In between, we had lunch at Trebello (good food, reasonable price and no queue at all) for about 45 mins. We also went back to the hotel at 1830 for dinner and a nap and returned to the park at 2130.

My 14 years old son and 9 years old niece are adrenaline junkies and both of them like Helix. It's not at all thrilling to them but at least they don't call it tame. Balder is a rather tame ride by comparison but as described by my son, it is well designed, runs smoothly and not feeling a bit bumpy. Loke is also fun but not as special as Helix but I guess Valkyria, the Dive Coaster which is scheduled to open in 2018, will soon take the place of Helix and become the signature ride of Liseberg.

To conclude, the overall experience would have been better if we had got the express pass.

Sweden,jonesylovestotravel,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"I have been going to Gothenburg yearly for the past 16 years and inevitably go to Liseberg with my grandchildren for a day out as they love it. There used to be free passes for parents with small children and this was discontinued a couple of years ago. There is no problem with the bigger children as they don't need to be accompanied. However my daughter has a 3 year old and a five year old. They cannot go on the rides by themselves so she is forced to buy an adult card for the day, effectively doubling the cost. When you add this to the cost of parking - SKR 160 - plus lunch, plus ice cream and drinks, the total cost was in the region of SKr 1500. That is for a mother with two children and doesn't include me. I think this is extortionate. There is also a shortage of seating for those who are not going on the rides. There are a lot of families of three generations who go together, so these two small things - the FREE PARENT PASS and the INCREASED SEATING - would go a long way to making the experience more affordable and comfortable. Other than that, the park is very well maintained and clean and the rides are great with safety measures in place - as you would expect in Sweden. My grandchildren love it.

There are a lot of different food options including familiar fast-food brands. Some are good some could be better.

Sweden,spicezoe,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"I went to Gothenburg in July and had to have a visit to Liseberg on my agenda - it's Sweden's best theme park after all and I had seen it advertised as one of Europe's top theme parks too. I have to say that attending in July (and on a Saturday, no less) that I was expecting long waits for the big rides but I'm happy to report that was not the case. On the whole, we waited 10-20 minutes for most rides, maximum 30 for one. July in Sweden a lot of Swedes go to the country abroad for their big vacation so the place empties out, leaving a little more room in the city and at the attractions for those that choose to visit then.

The theme park is a good size, with some cool big rides (Helix and Loke were my faves), lots of smaller ones for all the family and the opportunity to win giant bars of chocolate (why do other theme parks not have this, loved it!). The location at Liseberg is excellent - it's not a massive trawl to get there as it's in the centre of the city - score! The food looked okay (Max, Ben & Jerry's, a vegan/veggie buffet, etc.) but just outside the park there are restaurants too and you can leave the park if you get a stamp before exiting.

All in all, my friend and I had a brilliant day in the sun. and were worn out (as you should be) by the end of the day. Would definitely return if I go back to Gothenburg!

There are rides for all ages - the young kids' rides are all conveniently in one area. The biggest rollercoasters are suitably terrifying and an even scarier one is coming 2018. The classic ""FlumeRide"" is the best bet for the whole family but beware you may get very wet.

The best option is to buy the all-day pass. If you book ahead you can also get early access to the park (0930 instead of 1100).

In the early days there was a casino there, not a serious affair, with low limits on the bets etc, but it was fun - I miss that, but it has to be said that everything else in Liseberg over these years has only gotten better, bigger, higher, and faster. :) My two kids (5 and 9 years) could both stay here for days and TBH, so could I since I enjoy the atmosphere, the care that has been taken to make every detail and experience look and feel right. During the summer holidays it has a tendency to get slightly overcrowded at times, this varies from time to time - this last time the queues were tolerable (at worst 15-20mins waits for the popular rides), kids rides mostly half that time.

Sweden,Geir S,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Being a father of three it is inevitable that a certain amount of summer vacations are spent at this kind of place. Of the available alternatives in the eastern Norway/western Sweden area, Liseberg is much preferred.

Having kept at least some of its century-old charm, it has also obviously put much effort into making visiting the park an experience in itself, regardless of the attractions.

And the attractions are well worth the visit, both for the toddler and the older children. Some even for the adults.

Plus for easy and affordable parking, directly off the highway. And for well organized entry.

Make sure to order tickets online before arrival.

Sweden,AJB100570,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Brilliant amusement park, largest park in Northern Europe and I think much much better than Euro Disney if you're happy to leave Mickey behind.

We only planned to visit for a short time and bought a book of tickets. Each ride either costs 1, 2, 3 or 4 tickets to ride and we quickly used the 16 in the book so had to buy more. So in retrospect the day passes offer much better value.

Brilliant selection of rides for all ages.

Highly enjoyable and would visit again.

The roller coasters go really fast and when we went (during the week) the lines weren't so bad. Favourite ride was the Balder and except for the chair ride I loved them all.

Great for kids with lots of smaller rides and roller coasters for little ones.

Spend the extra 50Kr and go to te haunted house. That place is frightening.

10/10

Sweden,IndyKelly,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"The kids loved it. We stayed at the local caravan park and so we got tickets that enabled us to get it 1.5 hours before the general public. That was perfect because the kids got to try the biggest rides before the queues.

The food was very good quality, staff were friendly and the kids loved the rides. I went on the HELIX a few times with the kids and they just wanted to keep going on it all the time.

They tried the ghost house which has actors in it. Had to pay extra for this, but it seemed to be worth it because the kids and the wife got very scared.

Lots of fun at this park. Tip - get there early!
There is a large carpark on the other side of the road with the shopping centre is.

Facilities are clean and tidy and are accessible for disabled people. Staff is very service minded and seems to like their job. Restaurants offer a wide range of choices so all should be satisfied.

The park offers shows and entertainment included in the entrance fee. And one can enjoy the nice gardens almost everywhere in the park.

Sweden,LauratheExplorer1992,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"We visited the park in December and the whole experience felt like a much more authentic Christmas experience with classic white christmas lights, much nicer than some of the tacky multi-coloured light displays you often find in the UK. The park had a real festive feel, and there was plenty to explore. Some of the rides are still open during this time, but not all- and you can buy ride tokens easily from machines. We went on the swings, the big wheel and a rollercoaster- all fun but the bitterly cold winter air hitting you at speed is not the most pleasant sensation. They had different lands including Santa's workshop which would be great for kids, and examples of typical Sami culture. Dotted around the park were also open fire pits to warm up which added to the festive atmosphere. There are plenty of opportunities to buy hot drinks and confectionary but the only criticism would be that there was not a great deal of food available outside of the main restaurants at the park. Typically at a Christmas style market you would come to expect hot food stands- the day we visited there was only one hot food stand outdoors and the only other options were based in the restaurants. Besides this there are opportunities to buy souvenirs and different homemade products. They also put on regular performances of the nutcracker on ice which was nice, and once the show is finished you can hire some skates to enjoy the rink.

Sweden,Lance I,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"I was attending a medical conference at a hotel across the street from Liseberg and kept hearing the periodic screams from the tall free fall tower at Liseberg (located across the street). I figured ""When in Gothenburg..."" so I crossed the street to check it out. Getting into Liseberg cost me 100K (around $13) and after entering the park I walked around to the left (clockwise) and then took the long escalator up to the base of the ""Atmosfear"" tower. If you only paid admission like me, you'll have to buy a ride ticket that costs 22K (push the UK flag on the touchscreen of the ticket machine so you can do the transaction in English), and then take the stairs down and get in line (you'll hand the ticket to the operator when you go through the turnstile). About 15 minutes later I was strapped-in and enjoying a great view of Gothenburg on a beautiful sunny day. Then the ride stopped. Four seconds later we were released and then experienced 2-3 seconds of ""zero G"" weightlessness as we returned to the staging area. Aside from the screams and roller noise, it was fairly quiet (the platform blocked most of the wind). Braking was very smooth and not harsh at all. I'm and old man with a sore back (that is highly prone to motion sickness) and I had no problem with Atmosfear at all (that would almost certainly not be the case if I had taken the roller coaster). Ten minutes later I was back across the street at my conference learning about neuropathic pain. The net ""investment was about 40 minutes and 122K (less than $20). I can't recall a similar excursion that produced so much fun for so little time and money ""expense"" (particularly in Europe). If you're curious (or hear the screams), seriously consider checking-out Atmosfear. You won't regret it.

We took our children and spent most of the time in the part of the park with rides for younger kids. Everything was spotless and the variety of choices kept us entertained for hours. I also really appreciated how kind and friendly all of the workers were towards the children. On the bumper cars, they did a fantastic job of teaching the kids how to drive and getting the crowd to cheer for the kids and high fives on the way out. Staff was extremely professional throughout the park. This was such a memorable day for our family. We will definitely be back!!

The Ghost Hotel was a great experience and plenty of screaming ensued! The big wheel afforded distant views over the City and we went round three times. The water rafting was fun but we did have to sit with another family and where I was directed to sit seemed to be the wettest position!

As recommended, we had bought tickets online, which got ut relatively fast into the park, but in order to get our travellers passes, we had to stand in line for 30 minutes. In the line marked ""express""... And that was kind of the story of the day. Long lines and losts of waiting, and rather short activities. We had travel passes for 21 activities and after six hours we had managed to go on 5-6 rides + have lunch, which was also a long, long waiting line. Buying an ice cream was also a project that demanded 20-30 minutes in line. The rides were mainly nice, except for the hurried experience of the adventure castle, where they wanted us out so fast that we did not have time to see the presented fairytales. Other than that, the park is nice looking and varied, but if there is a next time we will go there on a freezing day, because it was not made to handle this amount of people.

The Santas workshop display was the best i have seen anywhere, the entry though a maze of snowy tracks was fun, and then seeing all the moving displays of the Elves at work was awesome.

Definately worth a visit if you are in the area at Christmas time.

It was a bit frightening, just because we were up so high, but it is clean and well maintained and not rickety in any way, so that helped me feel safe.

Sweden,Siew Feun K,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"I have visited Liseberg for many different occasions from the theme park, flower shows and Christmas market. Every event is SUPERB and so well organised.

Three days ago, we went to the Christmas market and it was pleasantly not too crowded during the weekday. The whole park is lit with more than 5 millions lights and it really brighten up the whole dark and cold winter. I really love how they decorated the statues trees in the park and turned this place into a winter wonderland.

There were so many stores, from handicraft, food, drinks, decorations, jewels, chocolate, clothes etc... It was so fun just to go around to sample all the food and drinks, looking at the beautiful Christmas decoration. It was a great experience (especially for tourists).

If you have kids, don't forget to visit the Santa's workshop. Very Swedish/Nordic!
There is an iceskating show that runs all the time. very entertaining as well.
Nonetheless, this is a huge amusement park, there are tons of rides that can keep your kids busy and entertained. if not, go play and win some gigantic chocolate bars. :)

Entrance fees costs 100 SEK and it is totally price worthy!
So, take your family or your girl/boyfriend along and enjoy this wonderful winter wonderland.

Sweden,_rhd5832,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Our hotel staff recommended we paid this place a visit and we were so glad we did as it had such a great atmosphere. The trees had even been lit by wrapping branches with lights so you could make out individual branches - like a lit tree-skeleton - so beautiful, especially as some were 80ft or more tall. We just wandered through the little stores, soaking it all in. There was also an ice rink with a Mad Hatter on ice show. We were told it was the biggest funfare in Scandinavia but we didn't go on any rides as we were more interested in the other attractions. From a distance you can't miss it as there is a giant ferris wheel, all lit up, and a 85m tower with trailing lights giving the appearance of an enormous Christmas tree. Even without sampling the rides it was a great evening, as the snow effect and the lighting was fantastic.

It advertises blankets but we didn't get offered any so wrap up warmly as it's a chilly ride. The fair itself was magical and the vegan restaurant was great offering a vegan buffet for &£20 per head. Try your luck on the many tombola stalls as many people were winning huge bars of chocolate well worth a go!,Dec 2016
Sweden,Maximilian H,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"Wow, the theme park Liseberg is dressed in winter/Christmas/snow every December. The artificial snow seems very real, so many lamps on the trees etc.

Some stalls where you can buy food, glögg (the spicy wine) and Swedish and non-Swedish products.

But I can't help feeling disappointed by how average this park is: we visited on a Saturday at lunchtime in December, during the Christmas season.
There was no magic, the Christmas statues and props looked cheap, the overall park and the experience felt tired.
Above all, not all rides were open, most notably the rollercoasters.
I had a delicious reindeer kebab for lunch though. Sorry Rudolph.",Dec 2016
Sweden,clairestraveltales,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"It was the start of the Christmas season at Leisberg and I'm so glad I visited Gothenburg when it was up and running (20th nov) (check the parks schedule as it doesn't open daily until later in the season). It was such a spectacle. Enjoyed the Christmas market stalls, the nutcracker ice show, the carol singers who randomly popped out of a house and just wandering round taking in all the lights and decorations. I'm not a person who enjoys theme park rides so gave them a miss but still spent a few hours here and the rain did not deter me one bit. One of the highlights of my trip to Scandinavia!

We had decided to come to Sweden from the United States to see what Christmas was like in Sweden. Boy, did Liseberg provide the answer. The lights, music, and shops take your breath away. There were far more shops than I imagined and the Christmas products and the food and drink were of a very high quality and value. Everything was right there for us to see: candy stores, confectionaries, clothing and gifts, and especially Lapland with its displays and meats for sale. Finally, there was the Tomte workshop - regardless of age a visit to see Tomte is an absolute joy.

Sweden,Sueste33,Liseberg amusement park,4.0,"Walk about 25 minutes from the centre of Gothenburg and Liseberg appears before you in all its sparkling glory. It's not massive but it's so beautiful especially as the darkness falls and the lights take centre stage. Cost 100 sek per adult and then coupons for the rides which we didn't investigate but were exciting enough to watch. Up 2 long escalators was a small area selling Swedish designed decorations, worth a look and you get a lovely view across the park.
The ice ballet was very professional but get rinkside early to get a good view as it's rightly very popular. Don't miss Tomtors workshop to see the elves making the children's presents, really sweet.
Lastly, there are loads of stalls which are like a roulette wheel with giant chocolate bars as prizes and yes, there are winners as we can testify. 2 kgs of Toblerone, a sweet treat that will always remind me of Liseberg!

Sweden,tyketyke,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"We first visited our friends in Gothenburg 10 years ago and they took us here. After many visits both ways we asked if we could go again. Grandparents now, we feel like little kids wandering round this magical Christmas extravaganza. It is a very large site, quite a lot of it a theme park with all the crazy adventure rides, but come Xmas it morphs into a winter wonderland with all the trees festooned with thousands of lights. There are many stalls selling; chocolates,toys,jewellery, clothing...you name it. Rather oddly, they have many stalls featuring roulette games with the winners walking off with enormous bars of chocolate..toblerone etc...there were many people carrying these around. A visit to father Christmas made us both wish we had our grandkids with us....a large area was filled with mechanical elves making presents and then - and here technology breaks through - kids are given the chance to email Santa so that when they get to see him, he knows exactly what they want. Do think about it for your kids/grandkids. For us (Norfolk), flying to Gothenburg is cheaper than taking the train to London. For the record, entry is about £10 pp, more if you want to go on the rides. There are at least 4 restaurants (inc vegetarian) ranging in prices. Cost of living in Sweden is a little bit higher than UK but not so much as to deny your kids Christmas magic.

Entrance to these wonderful gardens is free. You could spend hours walking through the different areas, admiring the beautiful plants and flowers, watching the huge fish in the pond, walking up the steep path to the viewpoint and taking a break in the excellent cafe. We had a late lunch at the cafe, salad and a sandwich. Both were beautifully fresh and delicious

The gardens are stunning and so well looked after. Although the weather wasn’t at its best when we first arrived, it all still looked lovely. are so pleased that we made the trip out.

The garden connects to a forest trail in the back, good for running or hours of hiking. The meat eating plant section is also very cool. Coffee shop in the garden could be better, poor quality, and no service. You are better off bringing a picking with you. Many locals do that and enjoy a nice meal on one if the large patches of grass. They have various special events throughout the year.

The university of Gothenburg has a botanical education here.
In the garden there is also a restaurant where you can have a Swedish fika (coffee break) and if the weather is good you can sit on the outside. A bit expensive but you only live once.
There are a lot of public restrooms around.
The garden does not cost anything to visit but if you enjoyed it a small donation is always welcome.

Sweden,John H,Botanical Garden,5.0,"You can reach the gardens on Trams 2,7 or 8 from the city centre. We had a 3 day Vasttrafik pass for public transport (not the city pass) which we found very useful. At the entrance there is a recepticle for a 20SEK optional donation. The only part with a compulsory admission fee is the Green houses (again 20SEK abount £1.80) There is a phone app that can be downloaded to guide you around the gardens. We followed a trail which should have take about an hour but being fairly new to gardening it took 3 hours of photographing plants and their labels. (Working on the basis that anything that grows in the Swedish climate would survive in the UK). There were also 2 other routes to follow or just ramble at random. Had a nice salad lunch in the cafe near the perennial garden. Beyond the gardens there is an extensive nature reserve. We found the wooded area around the small lake particularly lovely. Having sat quietly for a few minutes various creatures started to emerge - in particular a red squirrel (only usually see the grey ones in the UK).

You could also pay the same time enter the glasshouse although in our opinion giving these a skip if time is short is not a great loss. The cafe areas are very nice but are cashless so beware.

Entry is free and the gardens are big enough to spend some decent time wandering through, but not so big you can't see it all in a couple of hours.

From the main entrance you need to go quite a bit into the garden to reach my favorite spots: the rock garden and the Japanese garden (which are reached by climbing a substantial slope once you've passed the cafe). Climb to the top of the rock garden and you're rewarded with a good view of the southern parts of Göteborg.

If you time it right during early spring you can enjoy the blooming of the Wood anemone (Vitsippa) in a ravine just behind the cafe. Sweeds enjoy this period and sight almost as much as the Japanese enjoy the blossoming of the Cherry trees.

Sweden,nysingle,Botanical Garden,5.0,"The Botanical Garden was my favorite thing to do in Gothenburg.

The unique aspect of the Gothenburg Botanical Garden is that it's not just a botanical garden, there is a nature preserve / woods attached to it. It's also bigger and quieter than the typical botanical garden, with some isolated woods within the garden itself to explore.

It's free. They ask for a 20 Skr donation. There's a tram stop a few minutes away. You have to walk up and over the highway. It's about 30 minutes from city center.

The highlights of the garden were the woods, flowers, and a waterfall. There's a little cafe there that serves yummy food, but it's not cheap. They have a good greenhouse exhibit that also asks for 20 Skr.

The big nature preserve is at the tip of the Botanical Garden, past the Japanese garden. It's called Anggardsbergen (separate entry in TA).

For people who enjoy hiking, the trail to the viewpoint is a short hike with sweeping views in all directions. Adjacent to the gardens is a large natural area for even more hiking. The gardens are divided into several sections including a herb garden, formal garden, Asian garden, rhododendron garden, rock garden, and perennial beds. While I was there, a display of several dozen varieties of apples was on display in the old barn on the property. A few fountains and sculptures are worked into the gardens as well. I enjoyed the hike to the viewpoint on top of a rocky outcrop. The waterfalls and ponds in the rock garden were also very beautiful. Although it was late in the season, the perennial beds still had some blooms and the tree leaves were beginning to change color. Near the middle of the property, a cafe with a large patio services lunch and coffee throughout the day. Near the entrance at the bottom of the hill, there is a gift shop and restrooms. The gardens are a long walk from the center of town, but tram service is frequent and convenient.

The massive waterfall and surrounding rock gardens were amongst the best we have seen. The Chinese and Japanese areas had a lovely calm feel.

Sweden,Clas-Erik S,Botanical Garden,5.0,"This is a beautiful hide away in Gothenburg. The botanic garden is located just a outside city center, to get there is easy, either by buss or tram. Taking the car can be little bit difficult simply because limited parking space in the vicinity of the park. However, if you do take the car, there is a bigger parking place across the road with a short walk. In the park itself, you will find both cafés and possibility to eat. I suggest that if you plan to visit the park, set a side enough time since there is a lot to see and experience, in my point of view at least 4 hours (including coffee brake) is necessary without having to rush through the park. This is a sort of visit that suits all, couples, family, friends etc.

Sweden,Caroline W,Botanical Garden,5.0,"Botanists will be in their element here, but anyone who appreciates the beauty of nature will find something to enjoy. It is a short tram ride away from the city (although the walk from the tram stop involves crossing a busy road).

The glass houses have a range of different environments, including tropical rainforests, the desert and the Mediterranean. The orchid displays and the pitcher plants are particularly impressive. There is also one of the last surviving Easter Island trees (in the Begonia House). The outdoor places are very beautiful, especially the rock garden with its cascading waterfall. My favourite part was walking through Smith's Hollow, which felt like a true wilderness. But be careful if you are wearing sandals as I was bitten by something! There is an App available to download so that you can access more information about the exhibits, but I did not try this myself. The gardens are open until sundown.

On the other side of the road, the free Slottsskogen park offers more natural spaces and a zoo featuring seals, penguins and elk.

It is the sort of place you could only spend an hour or two though as there is not that much to do. It's more of a kick back and relax kind of place.",Sep 2016
Sweden,Tom E,Botanical Garden,5.0,"If you visit Gothenburg you simply HAVE to go to the Botanical Garden. The people of Gothenburg themselves go there not only because of the beauty but also because we are proud to contribute with this Garden to preserve the diversity of life on earth through the exchange program with other botanical gardens in the world. The place is also a very good school for youngsters who search for wisdom in this field.
Sometimes extraordinary events take place and this week I discovered on my monthly visit the exhibition Land Art. I specially fell in love with the piece of the Korean artist Jaehyo Lee who has created an installation assembled from pieces of chestnut wood, 3 meters high. It gave me a strong sense of power, almost magical seeing it in contrast with its place in the garden. If you hurry you can see it for yourself. The exhibition is soon to be ended.

Sweden,Aqua_Uomo,Botanical Garden,3.0,"I always visit botanical garden everywhere I go. It is relaxing and takes some stress away. This one here actually gave my some stress. I was told I can get out from the opposite side of the entrance through the woods to the Sahlgrenska hospital, many locals know the way, a short cut, but I managed to get lost in the woods. There are no signs once you leave the concrete path, no direction or anything like this. The whole park lacks directions in English, we would expect more from an educated city like Goteborg. A girl walking her dog got me out off the woods, literally, to the Hospital. The map and directions given were very poor.
The park is ok, not more or less spectacular than other large city botanical garden. I was there mid September and the blooming season was off. Nice displays but, again, nothing wow. It is a retreat for locals to relax after a week of work but not really a must see objective for a tourist looking for culture, architecture and history or one that saw better gardens. It just doesn't cut it for me, sorry

Sweden,Sofia M,Botanical Garden,5.0,The botanical garden is lovely if you fancy a short break from the city. If you want a longer walk you can just carry on into the nature reserve that offers really nice views of the city and you can see the ocean in the distance. A nice place to spend an hour or two.,Apr 2016
Sweden,Huskorset,Botanical Garden,4.0,"""Botaniska"" is a wonderful, relaxing and inspiring park, not only for people with gardening as hobby.

Well worth a visit!",May 2016
Sweden,Cleo5675,Botanical Garden,4.0,You can tell the summer is coming when you start to see more and more people visiting the garden.

Sweden,Guillaume R,Botanical Garden,5.0,"We went back to Botaniska on a sunny weekend late April, just in time for the cherry blossom.

It's a beautiful garden with varieties from different places, with a focus on Asia and Scandinavia. The japanese garden is a personal favorite.

Big lawns make it a perfect place for a picnic.

Don't miss the flower shop at the entrance : reasonable prices and your money supports the park.

Good photo opportunities with almost all year round displays

I spent just over an hour there and found it restoring after a busy day of seeing Gothenburg. Worth walking all the way to the nature preserve if you have the time...and exploring the paths to the herb garden as well. Tulips and other bulbs blooming; greenhouse has terrific selection of orchids and palms. Definitely worth a visit! When you get off the tram and cross the street, follow the signs and then keep walking to the entrance. It takes 5-10 minutes to get there. Lovely gift shop as well.

Sweden,nrw38,Soderasens National Park,4.0,"This was a wonderful adventure in the beautiful Soderasens Beech Forest! I wanted to go on a short outdoor adventure with my sister while in Sweden but we had limited time in Malmo, so I decided that Soderasens National Park would be a good idea - it was only 40 miles (65 km) from Malmo. I am an outdoors enthusiast so I enjoy hiking, camping, and many other outdoor activities. I love landscapes and nature - if you don't love this type of thing, this might not be the best trip for you. But if you do, then you will love it. We only hiked on this trip - no camping for us but there were camping options here. Overall, the trip was excellent and I was able to enjoy some beautiful outdoor tranquility in the Skane region. We went on the Yellow trail (see the most in the shortest time - 1.5 hours) and Gray trail (20-30 mins) with the few hours we had at the park because we arrived in the afternoon on a Sunday. I wanted to go on the blue trail but I simply didn't have enough time. There is also a volcano here but you will need to a little more time at the park - I was told it is about 30 minutes hike (from the information desk) one way from the main entry point. There was a fire in the park while I was there so some parts of the trails were shut down for a period of time.

OVERALL EXPERIENCE:

Pros:
1. The park is clean and organized. Trails are easy to identify and are safe.

2. People of multiple ability levels can enjoy the park either by hiking, nature walk, picnicking, camping, etc.

3. The scenery is beautiful and very tranquil. You do not feel overcrowded on the trails here - it is very open. There is very nice oxygen here and there is a river that runs through the main area with a nice pond/lake at the front.

4. There is a lot of wildlife - mostly birds that I saw.

5. The train ride to Soderasens is through what seems to be a more country landscape in many areas, but it is a beautiful journey. The region is littered with fields of Yellow crops (to make Vegetable oil), cottage-like homes and lush green grass/vegetation.

6. You can buy the return ticket on the bus (which can also include the train ticket if you ask to save time and money) using a credit card in case you don't want to get stuck on a specific timetable. Note: You cannot buy tickets using cash on buses or some trains, so FYI.

7. There is a restaurant on site in case you need food.

8. There is also a spout for water (saw people drinking from it) outside the restaurant building nearest to the restaurant picnic tables. Lavatory facilities are accessible in many areas. Note, this is the outdoors, so on the trails, the bathrooms are more like outhouses.

9. I had cell phone reception in most places in Soderasens Park. I use AT&T and live in the US. So I was able to look up train schedules, text, and use the internet out at the park. Note; you will incur charges - so get an international plan set up to avoid a huge bill.

Cons:
1. The return journey time was nearly 3 hours back to Malmo, but only 1 hour from Malmo. This was because I had to go through Klippan (with transfer through Hasselholm to Malmo) on the return trip.

2. Fires shut down parts of certain trails at the park temporarily - but this is normal in any park.

3. Bus schedule runs about every 2 hours or as advertised. Last return on Sunday is 18:39 from Skaralid Nationalparken (bus #518 bus stop). During the week, the scheduled showed return around 8:00 pm - so please check in advance.

GETTING THERE:
The total travel time was about 1 hr from Malmo to Soderasens National Park. I took the train from Malmo Central Station - Cost was around 188 Swedish Krone (SEK) for two people one way. This fare included the train from Malmo to Stehag and the bus ride (#518) directly to Soderasens National Park from Stehag. Bus #518 is located right outside the Stehag bus stop - it is very easy and the driver was already sitting there when we got off the train. The driver was super friendly and helpful - I speak English but he was able to help us no problem. The bus stop for Soderasens National Park is right across the street from the Park - so that is also very easy. Just remember that this bus runs mostly every 2 hours or so, so if you plan to return, you will need to check the bus schedule in advance to plan accordingly. Bus 518 does not appear to return to Stehag so you will likely need to get back to Malmo via Klippan Station (via Hasselholm to Malmo).

Other Tips: You cannot pay with cash on the buses and some trains you cannot buy tickets on the train (i.e. SJ train ). So ensure that you have your tickets in advance if possible. If you buy a train ticket in advance, just ensure that you get on the right train, because there are many companies that offer train rides.

You can buy tickets these ways that we figured out:

Trains-
1. At the train station ticket counters (not all are open or present)
2. Kiosk machines at the train stations
3. Using an App on your phone - ask at the ticket counter in Malmo Central.

Buses-
1. By Credit Card / Bank Card but you will pay an upcharge - I think it was 15% but I don't recall. Truthfully, it's not much.
2. Jojo Card - you can get information at Malmo Central station about this - ask the ticket counter people or go to the tourist center across the street - note it is closed on Sunday so FYI.
3. Using an App on your phone - ask at Malmo Central.

RETURNING TO MALMO FROM SODERASENS NATIONAL PARK:

We went back to the bus stop (#518) and got on the bus - bought tickets using a credit card to cover the bus fare to Klippan Station. From Klippan we went to Hasselholm and from Hasselholm, we went to Malmo. We got in after 9:00 pm. The journey back was 2hr 47 minutes because we had some lay over time (about 1 hour) waiting on the transfers. We traveled in May 2017, so there was light outside till almost 9:30 pm. So we were able to enjoy the scenery and landscape. This journey was tiring on the way back, but the trains were comfortable. The area around Klippan station is run down and dirty in comparison to Malmo but it was not extreme. No one bothered us here. It was fine. We bought the return to Malmo from Hasselholm. I recommend buying the full leg from the bus driver instead of what we did. It appears to be cheaper if you buy the whole fare one time. We paid 125 SEK for transit for 2 from Sodaresens National Park to Hasselholm and then paid another almost 200 SEK from Hasselholm to Malmo. So it is better to buy the full ticket one time from the driver or in advance all the way back to Malmo.

Overall, it was a great trip and I would return to this park to check out the other more challenging trails with more time to explore and maybe camp. As for stuff to bring on the trails, I recommend bringing ample water, snacks, good hiking shoes (boots for ankle support) for more challenging trails - also there are a lot of roots in this park and some areas with rocks. Many people wore tennis shoes as well. Also, you can get a generic map at the information booth. If you need a better map, try to order one online in advance. There are some older maps that might be available but that is not guaranteed.

Sweden,kumarsourabh,Soderasens National Park,3.0,If you like walking and love nature then this is a place in Ekeby to spend time with family and friends.

Sweden,Anette12345,Soderasens National Park,5.0,This is the perfect place for a hike or a picnic. It is beautiful here all around the year but especially in the spring. There are several paths if you want to go for a hike and the view from Kopparhatten is really fantastic! You can bring some hotdogs and barbecue them in one of the designated places for that. We come here several times a year and always when we have guests from abroad.,Aug 2016
Sweden,KhatriRocks,Soderasens National Park,1.0,"Sweden offers nothing but useless attractions. Looking at the review I thought it would be a good park to visit.
All I could find is landscapes and trees and snow, well its good but that I'm seeing everywhere in Sweden.
There is no animals or anything interesting.
Its pure waste of time here unless you want to do some small picnic.

Photos of landscape were interesting but I was not too impressed saying that it is a national park

When visiting the park, you can choose from visiting the more ""known"" parts of the park like the ""Kopparhatten"" vista point. There will be some people here and the view is, for sure, magnificent, but you can also choose to go deeper into the park. Down in the gorge and follow the stream. It is in easy reach from almost all cities in Skåne (Scania) and a treat for all members of the family.",Jun 2016

The clear ravin that once tore Skåne in two pieces. Visit! Walk! Enjoy!,Sep 2015
Sweden,rackoo,Soderasens National Park,5.0,"There are lots of different trails with different lengths. There are only a few areas with relatively steep but short ascents, otherwise it's rather flat. Wear sturdy sneakers at the very least, hiking boots are better. There are some rocky parts of the trails.

There are two entrances, the main north entrance at Skäralid and the south entrance at Röstänga. If you go to the Skånetrafiken web site, you can get a train + bus route from nearby cities (the north bus stop is called Skäralid Nationalparken).

The landscape is quite varied and it's worth exploring different trails if you have time. Get a trail map at the entrances and they're very easy to follow.

Sweden,nealz,Soderasens National Park,5.0,"Söderåsens national park in Skåne county is a great place for a beautiful hike through during summertime. We started at the main entrance near Ljungbyhed and were surprised that not only the entrance was free but also the parking. Since we arrived early (9am) there were only two other cars in the car park and we had the whole area to ourselves.
After heading towards the visitor center and the restaurant we started to climb the wooden stairs into the national park. At the top of the stairs we decided to walk the norra (north) trail marked with red dots. A 7.3km long trail. We decided to walk to the right from the top of the stairs which turned out to be a good decision as these leaves the highlights to the end of the hike.
It was a sunny day in July but we only met a single person along the trail until we nearly reached the look-out point at ""Kopperhatten"".
As I mentioned already, a restaurant can be found near the car park and the lake. It is a nice finish to sit here in the sun with an ice cream or a cold drink before heading on. We will for sure come back to do the blue trail (Korsskär).

Sweden,Wandering_Noldo,Soderasens National Park,5.0,"This is a beautiful national park. Deep ravines and prominent hilltops covered with old-growth beech forest. Lots of well-marked trails, some easy and some more difficult.

Skäralid is a gorgeous ravine starting with a very pretty lake at the Naturum Information Centre and then a 2-3km walk up the ravine - relatively easy walking. The first part around the lake is even suitable for wheelchairs.

Odensjöen is a lake inside a very old volcanic crater (or so it is assumed). 30m from the crater rim to the lake, and the lake is another 20m deep. The walk is short but very beatufil. Park at Röstånga Tourist Information, walk down the stairs and follow the broad gravel road.

The wallmark of Söderåsens National Park is that fallen trees are left to rot. This means that there is a great number of mosses, liverworts, fungi and beetles (+lots of birds to eat the beetles). So there is some absolutely stunning scenery, but also a lot if you fancy the little things in nature.

The gardens are a joy: colourful, well-tended, magic.
The manor is a rich source of information about the royal couple of Oskar II and Sofie, with some very interesting exhibits and photos.

There is an amazing rhododendron valley (which I've seen before) and that place is probably the best part so a visit during the flowering season would be the best time (early/first half of June I think). Right now, however, the flower beds are wonderful instead. There is also a possibility to enter the castle itself and from a historical perspective, it is somewhat interesting. However, besides those few rooms with a historical approach, the other rooms are the scene for temporary exhibitions. Right now there is a rather pointless exhibition about Swedish design. You'll need to be a fan or have a special interest to find this worth your time. It will be a nice couple of hours to stroll around here. Nice views over Denmark as well.

Sweden,Mitchcort,Sofiero Palace,5.0,"Lovely palace and gardens. You could easily spend a full day here. Thane a picnic and sit in the beautiful grounds. The gardens are so well tended with tasteful sculptures which appear to have had much thought in where they have been placed. Thre are gorgeous flower gardens and the kitchen garden is also worth seeing. The rhododendrons must be stunning in the spring time as there are so many of them. There is a small shop where plants are sold though a little pricey. There is a small children's play area.
We had lunch in the restaurant which was well cooked and presented. The restaurant terrace has stunning views over the water towards Denmark. There is also a small cafe at the back of the house which also serves food and the usual coffee and cake again with views towards Denmark.
This was one of those days that won't be forgotten.

Sweden,Meowycat,Sofiero Palace,4.0,"I, and my 2 children (7 & 8) visited july 2017. good free parking on site, admission is free for children, and sek120 adult, given a map, and off you go, immediately impressed at the large lawned area, and the peaceful atmosphere, kids loved the map and finding our way, The main house is built up the hill from the beach, very well managed with paths etc, I suspect those with hip or walking problems would need time to go down and up the valley, but the flower gardens are close to the entrance, we enjoyed the different areas aspect. for the flower enthusiasts the roses are beautiful and if you can smell them, heavenly. the children really loved this place as it was not too small not too big, and plenty to keep them focused. Our slight disappointment was descending to the beach to find is all fenced off and the gate obviously is locked for security. But my kids would have loved to go to the beach itself, which looks out to denmark and all the ships etc. We will go back again, to see the next phase of the summer garden in bloom. I highly recommend going but would probably avoid weekends. The cafe is expensive and disappointing, so take drinks and snacks with you.

A majestic ""castle"" (more like a mansion) built in 1865 as one of the royal family's country mansions and later donated to the city of Helsingborg, today it is a museum with a magnificent heritage of flowering beds and kitchen gardens. We toured the gardens and each section was lovelier than the next! We ate apples we picked right off the trees and ate them with glee.
We had a delicious luncheon of fish (what else!!) with a fabulous dessert. Not sure if they serve to the open public.... we toured the house after and the upstairs rooms provided a kind of artistic picture into the interests and artwork of the royals.... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Sweden,Aqua_Uomo,Sofiero Palace,5.0,"The building itself is ok, nothing extravagant though. Sweden has this habit calling everything ""castles"" .
It is actually a mansion, just a summer house for royal people, nicely and originally decorated with lot of art, paintings done by the royal family, some show some talent some others lack the impact. I walked through all and watched everything that was in it, from small childish sketches to family videos. Not impressed.
What is worth mentioning is the rest, the grounds, the gardens, the hot houses, the orchard and the herb garden. Those I liked, see my pictures.

Sweden,viveaverandbyakapov,Sofiero Palace,4.0,"Sofiero

The story of one of Sweden’s most famous castles begins in 1864 when prince Oscar with his wife Sophia of Nassau visits the city of Helsingborg. They fall in love with the beautiful views, the lush greenery and the closeness to Denmark and decides to build their summer house here. Sophie-ro, later Sofiero, translates into Sophie’s peace and once one visits the place it is easy to understand how it came to such a name.
In 1866 Oscar and Sophia spend their first of many summers at Sofiero. Originally the castle only had one floor but is expanded ten years later once Oscar becomes king. 1905 Oscar and Sophia part with their beloved Sofiero giving it to their grandson, Gustaf Adolf as a wedding gift when he marries his Margareta of England. Being brought up amongst marvelous English gardens Margareta brings both an interest and a knowledge for gardening to Sofiero. Shortly after their arrival at the castle the newly weds begin to build the fantastic gardens for which the place is famous for today. Both Gustav Adolf and Margareta partake in the construction themselves and during their time at Sofiero they plant more than 5000 plants and over 400 different kinds of rhododendron; their favorite. Today Sofiero is well-known for the rhododendron and people travel here to see them bloom from mid May to mid June.
In 1973 Gustav Adolf donates the castle to the city and today there are several experienced gardeners that ensures that Gustav Adolf’s and Margareta’s legacy is well taken care of so that one can still marvel at its beauty and find peace of mind wondering the grounds.
As you pass through the main entrance you are greeted by the magnificent main building that stands at the end of a gigantic lawn. This is the first sign of the English inspired design that Margareta brought to the castle grounds. In the summer time big concerts are held here and musicians from all over the world come to play here as people sit on the grass listening to their songs filling the air in the Swedish summer nights.
As photographers we were very curious about the gardens so we took to the right and followed the path leading passed a little pond with benches. Soon we stood at the entrance to the first one. Ready with our cameras we had to put them down for a while just to take in the scenery. While we have been to many gardens in Sweden, this one truly does stand out, particularly in the selection of plants and flowers that is found here.
In the next section we found quaint little greenhouses alongside well-trimmed bushes and trees, pottery from a different time, galleries and the garden nursery. Here you are able to buy plants to start or add to your own little piece of natural tranquility. Observing the visitors we found people of all ages visiting for various reasons; family outing, partaking in the events of the day, finding inspiration to create or just to get out and find some peace of mind.
The constructions of the gardens with the different sections along with the classical hedge maze further speaks of the English influence that Margareta brought to Sofiero. During our visit it was the end of the Dahlia season with guided tours and you had the possibility to choose from the many different kinds of Dahlias to put together a lovely bouquet to bring home. Once you feel done with the gardens you can wonder off into the more wooded areas in which a little Hansel and Gretl inspired house stands. This is part of an area that has been constructed specifically as a children’s playground namend “the children’s Sofiero.” From here you see the backside of the castle with a big terrace overlooking the wood-covered ravines with the paths leading down to the water.
The castle grounds also offer a small shop with exclusives such as jams, honey, pottery and other nick-nacks as well as one of the best rated restaurants in the area. Many couples choose to have their wedding party here and one can certainly see why.
On a whole we were both pleasantly surprised by what Sofiero had to offers us, both in our profession but also as two individuals enjoying a peaceful, beautiful place with loads of enjoyable spots. The grounds are much larger than what they first appear; seventeen hectares and even on a busy day (there is an average of 170 000 visitors per year) you are able to find your own little piece of tranquility that we are sure is what made Oscar and Sophia fall in love with this place back in 1866.

The grounds are open year around between 10 - 16 with an extended two hours in the evening during peak season in the summer.

The best you can say about it is that everything was ok. Absolutely nothing unpalatable but also nothing to remember.
The people serving us last year were top notch. This year they didn't have a clue about wines. Example: Do you have any elegant chardonnay?, we asked. We don't have any chardonnay? Let me see I said. And found a quite acceptable Chablis....

It took about a quarter of an hour. Watch out because there is no stop called « Solfiero Slott » and the bus driver, who knew we wanted to go to there, apparently took great pleasure in driving four tourists way past the castle because noone rang the bell in time! Early August was of course too late to see the hundreds of different types of rhododendrons for which the park is famous, but the huge gardens still were well worth the trip. Unfortunately on the day of our visit (August 4, 2015) there was a very unpleasant smell hanging over part of the park and the outdoor seating of the really lovely castle restaurant. So we had a quick open prawn sandwich (räksmörgås) in the castle café instead. The entrance to the castle and gardens costs 100 sek. We were advised to buy a 2 days culture card (2-dagarsKulturkort) at 120 SEK, combining the entrance to the castle and gardens with entrance to the medieval tower (Kärnan) and the exhibitions in the amazing Dunkerts Kulturhus in town (Kungsgatan, 11) and it turned out to be a good deal.

When you walk the garden you can both watch them from below and from above.

Parts of the park was designed by the previous swedish crown princess and by the late king. The park is very well preserved and it has many other flowers and plants to offer than the rhodendendrons. You can also enter a small castle and other buildings which offer different special exhibitions, some of them telling parts of the interesting history of this wonderful place. You can approach it by car, bus, bike or choose to walk from Helsingborg (appr 4 km) along the shore. Most times we take the bus to the garden (20 min from the city center) and walk back (appr 1 hour). The garden has a nice cafe with beautifull distant seaview (and a restaurant that we have not tried yet).

The passion flowers in the orangery (which was hard to find) weren't quite in flower when I went in early June. One of the greenhouses contained a vast vine, the other was empty. The peace was spoiled by someone mowing. It was nice that there were labels on all the plants. Ensure you get the map (and a disabled map if you have difficulty walking - there is a small ravine to avoid in the centre of the garden). There is also a garden centre, gift shop and café - views were limited due to overgrown trees. Sadly didn't have long enough here as was on a coach tour.",Jun 2015

There was an exhibition focused on the life of an earlier queen of Sweden. We've visited royal residences in many other countries in Europe, and the contrast is dramatic: Sofiero is less ornate, less pretentious, and more comfortable. You could move right in!",Jun 2015

Sweden,Matt E,Sofiero Palace,4.0,"I walked from downtown Helsingborg, along the sidewalks and it took me about 1 hour to get here (5km distance). It was an easy walk and very easy to find.

The grounds are open in the off-season, and are free admission, but other than the evergreen rhododendron species, everything was dormant for the winter(I knew this going in of course). The grounds are beautiful and were deserted which made for some nice pictures.

The exterior of the house is quite beautiful especially the ornate chimneys.

With streams, ponds, sculpture gardens, and the vast flowering gardens, it would make for a very lovely time in the spring and summer.

Temper your expectations for a winter visit though. Being free admission in the off season certainly helps budget travelers.

Upon walking back I took the path system that runs above on the bluff, with really nice views all the way back into Helsingborg. Not as accessible as the sidwalks for stroller and wheelchairs, but it made for a nice change. Look outside the entrance for the map of the trail and where it starts.

The gardens were beautiful and there was lots to see! Give yourself at least a couple hours here if possible, especially if you are the type to stop and admire the beauty.

Sweden,jameskul,Sofiero Palace,3.0,"We visited Sofiero while on a road trip from Göteborg to Malmö (its about 3/4 of the way). Admission is 100 SEK, parking is free. Signs on the E20 make it easy to find. I was kind of expecting something much more grand than this place really is. From the entry gate it is an impressive home and the gardens are indeed extensive and well cared for. We enjoyed the walk down to the waterfront. Tours are only offered for groups by prearrangement, so you can visit the interior (upper floor) on your own. This is where the disappointment begins... there just isn't a lot to see. A few small rooms are set up in period furnishings and decor, but most of the rooms are devoted to exhibition space. The only part of the main floor you can visit is the restaurant. All of that said, we were glad we went because the exhibition currently on display ""Royalty through the eyes of the media"" (running until Sept 14, 2014) was fantastic. I had no idea this was on display prior to arrival and I wasn't sure it would be very interesting until starting to view it. The exhibition explores the fascination of the media and public with the Swedish Royal Family. It was well done and quite enjoyable!

While walking the grounds I noticed that the castle has an extensive program for kids, with a large activity area that was absolutely buzzing with excited children. The gift shop had an interesting assortment of items, many focused on the royal connection.

Overall, I would say if you are interested in gardens or the royal family connection, do go to Sofiero. If you are on a tour of Sweden's castles and aiming for completeness, then also go. But if you want ""wow"" or have no interest in the royal family, this place may not be for you.

Sweden,BonnieSwede,Sofiero Palace,5.0,"This castle is surprising as it is not full of furniture and paintings as most British castles are. However some rooms show how the royalty would have lived years ago and a very entertaining film is shown in another room.
There is an art exhibition which gave rise to lots of discussions on our visit.
The castle also has a restaurant - which looked nice but we did not have time to try it - and a cafe. The cafe overlooks the Sound and you see Denmark clearly on a nice day. Our visit however was on a very wet day so Denmark could only be seen in a haze. However the cafe itself was clean and the lunch was terrific.
Then of course there are the incredible gardens. Even though it was wet we walked around and enjoyed roses, herb gardens, vegetable gardens as well as the vinery (retreat from the rain) and the Orangery (another retreat - but turned out to be very interesting).
There is a huge childrens play area too so this is a place for the whole family.

Sweden,NillaJ,Sofiero Palace,4.0,"This is the kind of attraction that works for most of the family: It is a great park, with lots of space for the young ones to run around (even if it might be a little unsafe for the toddlers). But it also works for the romantic couple who wants to have a picknick on the big lawn or for the older ones that wants to look at the truly amazing and - in parts - very un-Swedish garden. If you are in a wheelchair or partially handicapped it might be difficult (impossible) to take in the canyon, but there are still parts to be seen that are beautiful. Just to sit in the sun on the castle porch and look at the view is an experience in itself.

Here, in the northern part of the city of Helsingborg is a micro climate in a small canyon, sheltered from the worst of the north winds but with lots of sun and this has created a wonderful walk on paths almost hidden amongst the huge rhododendron bushes. Sofiero is at its best when all these are in bloom, depending on the spring, sometime in late May - Early June.

There is an excellent restaurant, well-known for its fine cuisine, but a bit on the expensive side for me. Picknicking works fine for those on a budget.

You can visit the castle, the summer home of former Swedish king Gustav VI Adolf, but as casle goes, it is a small and not very awe-inspiring. Here the garden, overlooking the Öresund and the so close Danish coastline is the main feature of the attraction. Works best for an outing on a semi-sunny day. The garden is sometimes used for big summer concerts and can be really magic, like a concert with Leonard Cohen a few years back. An evening noone wanted to end.

Lots of parking spaces or take a local bus from the centre of Helsingborg. Check for operning hours as they change over the year. This is not a winter attraction :-)

The beautiful residence of queen, that is now a museum was well maintained and having various social activities running for social causes. There was one such activity during my visit is an painting exhibition from a Japanese Boy (Don't remember his name though), who was a special children and we loved the paintings very much.

The short trails in between the jungle with narrow water streams, kids area with small rides, scenic beauty of sea, totem poll, and of course the rhododendron flower plants were the must watch there. There were many other flower plantation going on (one such was orange and yellow tulip sowing). There is also a green maze, where you can not exit until you reach till the center.

There is a nice garden shop and a two gift shops that are interesting. On my last visit, I was with a group of English people. We paid 1500 SEK for a tour in English. Because it was raining, we got a 20 talk in the green house! Not worth the price! So, my advice is go with your own food and don't book a group tour. Go on your own, eat before or after in Helsingborg and learn about the history and the family but looking at the exhibits in the castle. The view from the castle over to Denmark and Kronborg castle are wonderful.

There is also a smaller aquarium with all kinds of sealife. So if you're tired of the concrete jungle just step inside and relax for a while and look at the wildlife,Jun 2017

Sweden,Janice H,Tropikariet,5.0,This was a brilliant afternoon looking around the animals and fish. The leaf cutter ants can be tracked around each part of the attraction. The sections offer a new surprise with each doorway entered. There is plenty of interaction with all the animals and we all learnt something new as a result of our visit.,Jan 2019
Sweden,Giorgio B,Tropikariet,4.0,"A visit to the Tropikariet in Helsingborg could not start on a better note, with hundreds of leaf-cutter ants wandering through transparent pipes that - from the box office - spread across the whole building to the upper floors, and right at the beginning the lemurs welcoming you in the first ""area"" of the establishment. From there, it is one experience after another, including being plunged in the darkness of a rainforest night, where your eyes will have to try hard to spot an owl monkey.
On the top floor, the visit continues in a forest environment where you walk among pigmy marmoset monkeys, among others, while tucans fly overhead.
At the end, you may want to experience the ""tactile"" tanks in the basement. Also, keep an eye on the day programme when you start your visit, as it might include something you do not want to miss.

Sweden,George T,Tropikariet,5.0,"We've been in Tropikariet last year and came back this year as well as out boy asked for it. Place is not far from the city center just next to the Zoega coffee factory. You can smell roasted coffee and that's where you have to park. Tropikariet is a small place but has a lot to offer. There are few nice animals, and all you need to get entertained. Entire concept is cool as the animals are not locked and they just move around you. It is prohibited to touch them, however i was about to touch the monkey nearly jumping over my head :). If you get hungry the place has a nice cafe and a shop where your kid will buy something for sure. If you are looking for a small zoo near Helsingborg for your kids then visit the Tropikariet. If you are looking for a proper big zoo than got to Copenhagen.

The cellar holds a Maldivian reef aquvarium and three tanks with cleaner shrimp/fish. Dip your hands and be amazed.
Ground floor holds a big room with lemurs. They run free in the room. Don't pet them and watch where you stand. There can drop ""accidents"" from above!
First floor holds a nightime jungle room, there are loose monkeys and low flying bats. Varm and humid.
Next is jungle room, loose birds and silkmonkeys.
So cute. You can get very close to them!
Next floor is a mix och fishtanks, snakes and other creapy crawlers.

Kids can also dig for dinosaurbones in the indoor sandpit.

Note that ALL dangerous animales are behind locked glass. So don't worry!

It might be small, but it is well worth a visit. A exellent chance to get very close to the animales.

It is a grwat experience, as always. They have a decent variety of animals and habitats and your proximity to them is unbeatable. They do offer special tours and have dining. It's really a great place. To north Americans: it may not seem inexpesive, but the cost is generally in line with the typically high swedish price point. They barriers between you and some of the animals are also not in line with a typical North American attraction, so please be aware of that before you go. They do have a gift shop too. They are in a small industrial area and you'd never know they were there.

Peering through the darkness trying to look at the animals in their habitats, with bats occassionally flying across our heads. Great experience!",Oct 2017
Sweden,131GordonS,Tropikariet,4.0,"We loved the advertising about 'free roaming monkeys' (actually lemurs) but from the get go this rather peculiar place grabs you. At the ticket office you are faced with a very busy line of leaf cutter ants marching across a pool of water centimetres from you. As you move from room to room through heavy plastic curtains, you are met by Lemurs, toucans, skin nibbling fish (stick your hands in the tank! Go on I dare you!). And guess what the ants are patiently following you up through the floors... In the night-time zone you are in the same space as the night dwelling animals, just stand a while and you start to see them moving around you, and often very close indeed. From our four year old, 10 year old and 16 year old, up to grumpy old me, we all found something to wonder at. It is in a slightly strange location, but ignore that and let your inner curiosity take over. It is a great place to visit on a rainy day, but better than that it seems to do a better job that many zoos in bringing you closer to animals and bugs in a way that surely represents the wonderful interests of whoever curates it. It is not 'polished', but you hardly notice it. It certainly awakes the 'inner child' in adults, and excites the young rather well. They could have worked on the 'gift shop' as well as they did the exhibits (wormery anyone?) but that is to be a little harsh. Go back again? I rather think we will.

How cool is that? And there's not just ONE level, but multiple levels with lots of animals from all over the world, special acclimatized areas for the various animals. They're being taken care of in a fantastic way, so they actually thrive inside this building by specialists and caretakers, very high standard!

You're free to take photos too, as long as you please PLEASE - pretty PLEASE - respect the animals and DO NOT USE FLASH! They can get scared too you know.

The most thrilling part is that most animals roams free, while there is a guided bridge that takes you trough the entire indoor ZOO/park - they are free to jump onto your shoulders, so don't be surprised if there's a little monkey on your shoulder who think you're just another branch, don't worry - they really don't bite!

There's birds, insects - and all kinds of stuff, you'll want to go there 2-3 times the same day, because you'll see something new that you probably missed every time.

We got there pretty late (4pm; it closed at 5pm), and I would have loved to get to spend some more time there. The Madagascar-area and the area in the dark were absolutely amazing with some close interaction with some of the animals (you weren't actually supposed to pet the lemurs, which I didn't see until after I did it, but the lemurs were nice about it >.>) Either way there are no or next to no barriers between you and the animals; some of them even walk/jump/climb/fly around freely around you. They all seem completely at ease and it looks like they're properly taken care of despite of having to deal with us nosy humans, which was nice.

You can even play at being an archeologist by looking for dinosaur bones in a sand pit =D

The whole vist is like going through a maze, with constantly changing ""nature"" and ""climate"", allowing us to see different sorts of animals and habitats. It ranges from the ocean to the rainforest, from sharks to crocodiles.

It's not the biggest place, and you wish for more afterwards, but considering the circumstances it's almost perfect. And it has a nice restaurant (and a gift shop) afterwards. I recommend everyone in the area to visit.

You walk through different habitats and, in some of them, the animals are free to roam and fly in the room along with you. It really was a far better experience than any type of zoo I've visited before.

It was little far from main road bus stand as against what was mentioned in their website and entry fee was 120 SKK not 100 as listed on website. But once I found it and went inside, it was a pretty satisfactory visit. They have different live animals roaming around freely. Tourists get to enter their enclaves and see them in close corners. Visitors are not supposed to touch the animals, which sort of limits the experience, but I guess it is for the safety of animals and people, as they can't put a staff everywhere to monitor things.

Madagascar counter was very nice, so was basement aquarium- you can have free pedicure on your hands as fishes come close and clean it. I feel space is a bit constrained for the birds and animals, but this looks like a private property and they are doing the best they can.

This place is close to the open garden museum- so you can club both.

Sweden,Dave,Tropikariet,5.0,"The entire place is in a smal4 story warehouse-type building, but the exhibits are amazing. The level of interaction with animals is unlikee any zoo in American that I've ever seen. If you have the chance, do not miss it!",Apr 2015
Sweden,showa58taro,Tropikariet,5.0,"My cousin has a season pass to this place, and so when visiting Sweden with my family, we decided to give this place a go. It looks very dull from the outside, an industrial estate with a fairly small parking lot. But the outside doesn't do justice to the attraction itself. Once inside, even at the desk you pay in, there's a display full of ants that are walking across the pricing sign. They make a recurring appearance quite a number of times throughout your visit. You then go inside, and can either head upstairs to the third floor or downstairs to the basement, as you see fit.

Upstairs you find yourself walking through specific habitats with the harmless creatures wandering along with you, as it is all open with monkeys and birds jumping above your head and flying past you. My daughter loved the monkeys that almost walked across her feet. I myself got a bird whizzing over one shoulder on one of the floors. This continues for a while, with less ""friendly"" animals well enclosed, including crocodiles, bats, snakes and smaller creepy-crawlies in their assorted boxes. Daughter loved them, I was perhaps a bit more less enthused, but it was interesting all the same.

Downstairs there was crocodile petting (nobody lost a limb, all very safe) as a one-off timed attraction and a fairly small aquarium with sharks and tropical fish. The real highlight is the ""petting zoo"" style room where kids can pet crabs, starfish, and get their hands cleaned by shrimp and little fishes. A lot of giggles were had here.

To finish (for us anyway) we went to their cafe which offered a perfectly nice selection of sandwiches, a couple pies, swedish hotdogs, and a good amount of cakes and icecream. Lots for everyone. As with any modern zoo-style experience, the exit is ideally through the gift shop. Good luck not buying something cute there, parents. I managed to get away cheap with a long snake (now named Larry) and a mermaid.

All told, it's a great way to spend a morning/afternoon with kids, exploring different animals and playing in some of the interactive play areas.

The only down-side for us was that there were very few bathrooms. This appeared to be under construction, but as of early August, there were only 2. A small flaw in an otherwise exceptionally nice little attraction.

Sweden,Line L,Tropikariet,4.0,"It's a nice place - not that big, but the animals seems to have a good time, and so did we. The first thing you meet is some ants walking in a plastic tube.

Our daughter (2 years old at the time) thought it smelled, and see was also afraid of some of the abes, but she liked the room where she could dig in the sand.

It's a nice activity, when the weather isn't good.

Sweden,AllegraLC,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"A great place for a leisure walk around the quaint streets and alleys. However, it is very touristy. Since we stayed here, we explore it twice, one early in the morning and one when everyone was up and about. It is paved with cobblestones, so it is better to wear comfortable footwear to avoid spraining the ankle. Some of the paths especially those back lanes are quite steep and uneven.

Since most of the premises are occupied by tourist related business establishments, it has lost its vibe as an early settlement of Stockholm. Nevertheless, it is still an interesting place to explore. Read up some of the history to have a better understanding of the place and it’ll make your experience more memorable. On our first night, we also walked to the Royal Palace after Stortorget. On the morning of the 2nd day, we passed by the Royal Palace again. From here, we walked to the Parliament, Gustav Adolfs torg, Museum of Medieval Stockholm and vicinity.

There’re plenty of eateries here and we encountered one which does not accept cash.

I sat by the harbor for a good 20 minutes just watching everything (many interesting ships and yachts there) before my eyes while enjoying a good cup of coffee. A cheap “excursion”, but the best thing ever.

Sweden,Sheila R,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"Stockholm is a brilliant city to visit in its own right, but the old town has a charm all of its own. Its cobbled streets and attractive buildings are a delight to wander around and there are several cafés and restaurants in which to linger. For those of you who prefer tea to coffee, there is a dedicated teahouse in Svartmangatan (opposite the Tyska kyrkan) called Chaikhana. It offers a very large selection of different teas as well some very tasty snacks.

While in the old town (Gamla Stan), the Royal Palace (Kungliga Slottet) is a must to visit. Every room bears testament to the grandeur and power of its kings and queens. There are at least two tours a days in English but you can also wander around on your own with an audio guide.

Stockholm has several interesting museums, among them being the Vasa Museum, which houses the 17th century ship Vasa. Having sunk in 1628, the Vasa had been left to rest on the seabed. However, 333 years later, it was finally salvaged and brought to the surface. It was miraculously mostly in tact, with only the rope rigging and sails having rotted. Although minus the sails, the rope rigging has subsequently been replaced. Now on permanent display in the museum its presence is breathtaking.

As far as the weather is concerned, it is probably best to visit Stockholm in June, as it is much warmer then. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we went at the end of February and were greeted with snow and freezing temperatures. However, even then it did not spoil our visit as we were well prepared with warm clothing.

With the aid of a map, we found it easy to get around. Although you can buy passes for the hop-on-hop-off buses, the best way to see Stockholm is on foot. Places are closer to get to than it looks on the map. Everyone we spoke to was friendly and helpful, and to our shame spoke immaculate English – although they did appreciate our efforts to use the very few words and phrases we had learnt before our visit.

The only downside to Stockholm is that it is very expensive to eat out, especially if you like to drink alcohol with your meal. Even mineral water and soft drinks can bump up the price. However, if you hold on to your empty water bottles, most restaurants and hotels will allow you to refill them with tap water. For us though, living in London meant we were already used to high prices.

All in all, I can thoroughly recommend Stockholm as a city break destination.

Sweden,Gary Sheridan,Stockholm Old Town,3.0,"We had a local guide, who walked us through this area. You could probably just walk around by yourself and not have the need for all the 'back story' information. One thing I did notice, was the amount of graffiti on these 'historic' buildings and also the amount of cigarette butts on the cobble stone streets. This is supposed to be a tourist area, come on Stockholm city fathers - this litter and graffiti problem should be addressed. Areas around the Palace were well kept.",Jan 2020

Sweden,triSarahtopsNZ,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"Old town is packed full of really well preserved old buildings and feels like stepping back in time hundreds of years. It's great for just wandering around because you can come around a corner and be in a whole new gorgeous spot, but there are also a lot of great cafes and sights within old town to check out too (although the food is always quite expensive in this area)

Would recommend turning away from some of the more main streets to avoid crowds of other tourists & the souvenir shops to see some of the quieter (but just as gorgeous) streets. If you do this, wear comfortable shoes as the cobblestones on the smaller streets can be more difficult to walk on.

Super easy to get to, a few minutes walk from the central train station or if you have a public transport card you can take the metro to Gamla Stan station

Quaint cobbled streets, very clean, lots of small shops, many cafes and bars that have live bands. Also upmarket restaurants like Vapiano Italian. You can get round the whole place easily on foot. Palace 500 m from centre. Note: most places do not take cash, have your money in sek on a preloaded currency card. Prices are very high be prepared for a shock.... One beer, one double JD& coke, one plate of chips no change from £30 at bar, prices published. Overall a good time but would not go again as once seen is enough.

Sweden,Mayowa O,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"I loved visiting this town. So much to eat and souvenirs to buy. The cobblestones give it a very old feel. At the end of the walk we got to the other side and saw the river with Grona Lund on the other side.
As charming as the old town was, finding convenience was very inconvenient. We walked to two public toilets close to the train station but neither was functional. My wife was super pressed. The only eatery with a bathroom insisted we buy stuff and it had to be by card. We only had cash on us. We had to walk ALL THE WAY to the river side before we finally found another public toilet which, no surprise, was in a bad state. Considering we'd just come from Paris where (self-cleaning and automated) public toilets were all over the city but so aesthetically well done, Stockholm was disappointing for a city that gets so many tourists who would need to use the loo while on the move.
Asides that, Gamlastan is still worth the visit any day.

Sweden,Giarcbob,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"We like to walk the streets and take in the architecture when we visit a ""new city"". Gamlastan is lovely. Pretty buildings, some grand architecture, innovative metro art, clean, easy to get around. It is the first holiday we have had where local currency was unnecessary, to the extent that some places don't accept cash; so make sure your plastic cards work! It is relatively expensive for eating out in Gamlastan. We found a small cafe in the heart of things called The Corner Bar (or some name similar) where the atmosphere was very local and friendly, the staff were friendly too, and the price reasonable. If you plan on buying your own wine you will need to go to a government alcohol store. You CANNOT buy wine, liquor, or strong beer at a supermarket; just beer up to about 3.5%. Definitely take a trip on the metro to view the art, a tourism plan will indicate the most spectacular stations.

There are some good traditional shops alongside the typical touristy ones, and some wonderful restaurants...we visited 'Tradition' this time which has clean Swedish design and, as the name suggests, authentic Swedish fare, and just delicious.
The houses in the area are colourful and there are tiny lanes to explore. It's all surrounded by water, the atmosphere is great even late in the evening in summer
There's a medieval cathedral and the Royal palace as well. A great place to visit.

You're not far from the water at any point and the transport links are really convenient for all other areas of Stockholm. A bit more expensive than the UK but we were surprised at how much we 'didn't' spend!
It was lovely just wandering around the streets and alleys in the evenings looking at the shops and checking out restaurants and bars. A lovely area and somewhere we'll visit again.

Even got an earlier birthday present to me, a silver ring very unique. Some of the shops sell by the jewelry piece weight but anyhow try to negotiate the price with a smile. Yes some areas are very touristy but nevertheless take the time to explore them. I wish my State had places like these around. So when I go abroad I always take the time to check them (very historical downtowns)out. Many restaurants, pubs, coffee shop around for you to choose!

No one is pushy there, either....cordial and helpful assistance only when asked, which is how I like to be treated when shopping. Gamla Stan is a jewel, and I recommend staying there if you have a chance, but if not, definitely a worthy of a day's visit.

When we disembarked from our cruise ship at the port, for the day, we took a hop on, hop off bus into the city. After hopping off and back on again, several times, we eventually found ourselves in Stockholm Old Town.
Our first experience here was a visit to the Royal Palace which was open with free admission because of the national day holiday. We then took a pleasant stroll through the old town. The area was full of locals out enjoying the sunshine on their public holiday. There were also many tourists in the area as several cruise ships were in port on this particular day.
We enjoyed the elegant, traditional architecture of the beautiful old buildings located within the old town. There were many small shops located in the area but most of them were closed due to the public holiday.
The old town is certainly a “must visit” location for any tourist spending time in Stockholm. Considering its central location, it is difficult to imagine how anyone visiting the city could miss it!

Sweden,Alex J,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"Stockholm's Old Town, also known as Gamla Stan, is the real heart and soul of the city. A small island, right in the centre of the city, it is easily accessible by public transport (bus, subway or tram) and you ought to walk its small narrow streets and alleyways to get a feel for ""old"" Sweden. Soak up the atmosphere. It is a larger ""old town"" than that of Prague, and to me it felt more authentic. But, this being Sweden, things are very very expensive. Food is very expensive, and even having a coffee here will make a deep hole in your pocket. But, what the hell, the idea is not to have a gourmet meal here (though you could if you wished, there are any number of fancy restaurants), but to just walk around, and see the place. And take photos. This is paradise for photo buffs. Don't miss the even tinier island of Riddarholmen. Very good maps are available, free, so you won't get lost. If you are really pressed for time, go the main square, Stortorget, see the Nobel Museum, and walk along the roads radiating out from the main square. Wheel-chair users and those with strollers will find this place challenging: cobblestoned streets and steep inclines in places. But, even they can find something interesting to see. Give it a go.

Sweden,Friendlytravler,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"We stayed at the Castle Inn in Gamla Stan and the first question was - How do you get there? F of the Central Train station you can walk (20 minutes). Go out the front door of the train station and turn left. Walk down to the large pedestrian street with carved stone lions and turn right. You can see the towers of Gamla Stan in font of you.

Or you can take the metro (marked with a T) from across the street from central train station to the Gamla Stan stop on line 14 (one stop).

Or the easiest - take tran #12 for the front of central station - just to the left of th fro door - walk down and find the first stop. Take that to the Nybroplan (Sp ?) stop. It is the st stop on the waterfront. Then take bus #76 back the opposite direction and it will go right down the harbor side street of Gamla Stan.

You can buy the bus-metro-local train tickets at the tourist information counter in the train station or from kiosk stores and 7 - 11. Each ticket lasts 1 1/2 hours and there are lower rates for seniors. Of you buy the tickets from the metro stop or from a machine the time starts immediately - if you buy from the tourist office or from a 7-11 or other shop the time starts the first time you use it.

Nice place to stroll around and people watch and enjoy a drink on the waterfront. Favorite bakery - Brod & Salt for breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner.

Sweden,JDSor,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"Among the many old towns in European cities, Stockholm's is a fairly balanced one, featuring everyday businesses as well as some rather touristy bars and restaurants. As it is a living and breathing part of the city, it doesn't feel like some sort of theme park, but a part of history that melds naturally with the 21st century.

The architecture is quite well-preserved and it is obvious that everything is being kept in shape. Hordes of tourists do wander about the narrow streets, but creative scheduling will help you avoid them. Plenty of good photo-opportunities are available.

Certainly worth a wander whenever you are in Stockholm.

Having a beer in the small square in front of the Nobel Museum is hard to beat. The Royal Palace is also pretty beautiful.
We found a great live blues bar and a superb wine bar. But there were also lots of touristy restaurants and shops with nothing but reindeer souvenirs. And the place was very busy even though we were here in mid September.
Its a great place to spend a couple of hours wandering around the old streets but they are all cobbled so ensure you have on comfy shoes with thick soles.

Sweden,CAZMeetings,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"My cruise group of 4 couples stayed in Gamla Stan for a pre-stay prior to our Viking Ocean Cruise. We stayed at the Victory Hotel and booked a 3.5 hour private walking tour with ToursbyLocals. The Hotel was wonderful, so much charm and history. The Hotel staff was welcoming, friendly and assisted with restaurant recommendations and reservations, booking taxi for transfer to Ship, and always available to answer questions. The hotel's included breakfast provided lots of options and was very good. Our private tour with Ebba (ToursbyLocals) was amazing. She met us at our Hotel and provided a very informative and interesting walking tour including all of the 'must see' in Gamla Stan. I had requested we end our tour at the Royal Palace to see the changing of the guard. As a certified guide for the Palace, Ebba was able to continue as our private guide for the Palace rather than joining a larger group. Her timing was perfect...as we departed the Palace tour, the Royal Guard was coming up the street for the Changing of the Guard ceremony. At the end of our Tour, Ebba lead us to the Public Ferry ticket office to show us where and how to purchase tickets for travel to Djurgarden to visit the VASA Museum and other sites on that Island. Our time in Gamla Stan was a perfect way to adjust to the time change/jet lag and to see this historical part of Stockholm.

Every Restaurant in the main streets is Pasta and Pizza.. I had to actually look closely and go online to find a Swedish restaurant with Swedish cuisine inside this Swedish Old town

I chose hotel in the Gamla Stan (Old Town situated on an island) called the Victory which was an outstanding , quirky hotel with seafaring motif. However, RE: the old town , after our dinner we strolled the main streets and some of the back alleys. The souvenir shops are mostly ""touristy"" type of items not appealing to us, and we found the streets very dirty. Case in point is that at one juice location , there were 4 or 5 large garbage bags full of orange rinds just standing against the storefront in the street!- I am assuming they collect garbage in the morning-not very appealing. Compared to other old towns in Europe , we were somewhat underwhelmed. We would probably not stay in Gamla Stan again! One nice feature is that the Hop-On Hop-Off boat (red line) makes a stop at the Gamla Stan, which we did and enjoyed cruising the harbor at the (8) stops.

Sweden,Mary V,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"As Sweden has remained neutral in wartime for the last 200 years, their buildings were not destroyed as so many others were in Europe. As a result, Gamla Stan in particular is still original and you get the opportunity to walk streets generations of Swedes have and get a feel for their history. Add to that the Changing of the Guard at the palace (watch for the time and get there early as it will be very crowded) (also protect your stuff - pickpockets are everywhere in Europe these days), waffle street food stands and cafes that spill out onto street patios, and you have a lovely day in a very historic area.",Aug 2019

Sweden,ushrit,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"Dating back to the 1200s, Gamla Stan is everything a medieval town is supposed to be: narrow, picturesque, cobble-stoned streets; old, colourful buildings; church steeples suddenly rising up before you.

Unfortunately, it is also very crowded around the Stortorget, or main square... so quickly shoot your best-possible photos and then disappear into the streets around the square. Meander aimlessly, shoot beautiful photos in which some frantic guide's flailing arm isn't getting in the way, and soak in the atmosphere.

Allow 3-5 hours for this fabulous place. If you're vegetarian, check out the Gron Hermitage. They serve excellent food. On the day we went, they had dal soup!

It is full of cobbled streets and small alleyways that are full of bars, good quality restaurants, ice cream waffle shops, and shops selling local produce and the usual tourist items. I would recommend exploring every nook and cranny of this area of Stockholm because you come across so many hidden treasures when you do. There is also a small pharmacists located here, and a Co-Op supermarket where we purchased some drinks and nibbles. All the restaurants and bars have toilet facilities.

It is also home to the palace residence of the Swedish royal family, which is how by chance we came across the changing of the guards ceremony one lunch time which was worth seeing.

You can pick up the famous Red Tour buses here too. We went in August and there were always taxis available.

You simply cannot visit Stockholm and not go to Gamla Stan. It's too quaint to miss.

It's fun to wander around the historical buildings and pedestrian streets filled with shops, cafes and restaurants. It also makes for lovely photo ops. The two main shopping streets are Västerlånggatan and Österlånggatan. Both offer an array of similar souvenir shops where you will find your typical touristy gifts like magnets, t-shirts, caps, etc. Head over to Stortorget, which is the famous public square that you see on all the postcards and travel brochures. There are plenty of cafes where you can ""FIKA"" and relax. Gamla Stan also houses parliament buildings and the Royal Palace. This is where you can catch a glimpse of the daily Changing of the Guards around noon. There are several museums in the area as well like the Nobel Prize Museum, the Royal Armoury, Medieval Museum. If you're in Stockholm for just one day, I highly recommend you put Gamla Stan on your list.

We were looking for an ice hockey shirt for the Swedish national team to give to our grandson and we did find one here in a tourist shop. In the afternoon, we visited the Icebar in Hotel C (worth a visit) and then the Old Town and riverfront area. It was a beautiful, sunny day and the waterfront area was stunning.

For changing of guard, stånd in intersection Skepsbron and Slottsbacken. Follow guard up the hill.
I recommend Medeltidsmuseet close to Riksdag/Castle, good tour (at cost), free entry.
If you have money to spare visit Zum Franziskaner (Skepsbron), eventhough it's Germanish it brings back Hansa feeling. Be prepared to pay a lot for meal and beer as well as experince some poor service (don't tip) most of the time. Still I like it!

There are so many interesting things to see and learn about. However, I suggest the you skip the parts that sell crap to tourists, e.g. Västerlånggatan.
It's very safe to discover the Old Town, but wear good walking shoes as most of the streets are still cobble stone streets!",May 2019
Sweden,Raban62,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"The Old Town (Gamla Stan) is Stockholm’s original city centre and was founded in 1252. It is a glorious labyrinth of charming cobbled streets and alleyways. All of Old Town are like a living pedestrian-friendly museum full of sights, attractions, restaurants, cafés, bars, and places to shop. The Old Town is one of the places in Stockholm that is truly a must to visit and which will not disappoint any visitor.",May 2019
Sweden,Kathie D,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,It was really interesting seeing the old town in comparison with the rest of Stockholm. There were interesting shops and cafes along the way.,Jul 2019
Sweden,E R,Stockholm Old Town,1.0,"The museum is called national, inspite of being everything but Swedish. It includes several significant paintings of Rembrandt, and some other mostly Dutch and German painters, and other European art, including some very important art pieces plundered from Prague during military expedition of Carl Gustaf during the 30 year war, in which Swedes played significant part, for no other reason than to try to plunder as much artifacts as posible. It's pity these artifact had to be deposited into such unskilled hands as the curators of the national museum. It seems they decided to hang on the walls of the museum all the pieces of art according to dates, without any consideration that would need to use some skills, they obviously not have. The result is walls with densely filled paintings, with no intelligent concept. The curators made two decisions, that exposed their poor capacity of intelligent judgement even more. The first, painting of Ell Greco, hidden among some other religious paintings from the middle ages, I discovered accidentally. Probably the curator never heard about Ell Greco, if he put this masterpiece among some anonymous ikonas.
I would still give to the newly reconstructed building of the museum some better points if not the stupid arrangement of the toilets. First there is no gender difference between the toilet cabins, second the hand washing is in the cabin of the toilets, what means an even more prolonged use of the cabins. The result is unneseceryly long queues of visitors of all the genders, even if there are many cabins.
The entrance to museum is free of charge, so it enables to make V for many visitors.

Sweden,JWPL,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"We spent an afternoon walking around looking at shops. Lots of tourist trinket/t-shirt shops, likely much cheaper than near hotels, took in a local restaurant and also an ice cream shop, both were amazing. Walked by the Nobel museum but did not have time to see it. Well worth spending some time in, similar to other medieval town centers (e.g. Paris)",Jul 2019

Sweden,WhereToTry,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"We really enjoyed the old town. Very authentic.
The streets are narrow, filled with people, shops and restaurants as far as the eye can see.
Though expensive on this part of town, we returned twice as it is such a lovely experience over there.
Be prepared for cobbled streets, uneven, cobbled streets. Luckily we were in flat comfortable walking shoes but saw plenty of people caught out in heels or shoes just not made for the cobbles!

Sweden,abbafan,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"Been to Stockholm many times and Gamla Stan is always lovely to wander around. It does get crowded with tourists but that's because it is so picturesque.
You can always find a quieter side street and there are many coffee shops, bars and restaurants. It's nice to visit Stortorget late in the evening when it is less busy.",Jul 2019
Sweden,Benamard,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"While the old town is well.. your typical European old town, filled with lots of tourist traps, there are also some unique shops.

My recommendation is to simply wonder around the small streets and don’t just stay in the mains street with all the souvenir shops.",Aug 2019
Sweden,fatheya123,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"A must while visiting Stockholm, full of activities for the whole family. Highly recommended. You can visit the Royal Palace or simply just walk around.

Sweden,Donna B,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"Our group visited Old Town on a walking tour. Cobbled streets, colorful buildings, museums, and souvenir shops greeted us, There is so much history in this part of Stockholm to immerse yourself in. We had some free time to explore after completion of our tour but I did not venture very far. The winding roads were all a bit confusing to me without a map to guide me.",Jul 2019

Sweden,Manava,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,This is a very beautiful place. Gamla Stan is slightly hilly. Cobbled street. One feels like one has travelled back into the 1700. The pastel color building are very pretty. Lots of cafe and souvenir shops. But at STOTORGET square. BEWARE. The Italian restaurant there can charge you random more. They charged me for sharing my pizza. Avoid this place. The rest is fabulous. Lots of photos here for sure.,Aug 2019
Sweden,Florien D,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"Careful where you tread as the streets are quite crowded.
Old town (Gamla Stan) is one of the main attractions of Stockholm in my opinion. I didn't care for the rest of the city, it was too much like most other European capitals. But Gamla Stan was lovely.

Price ranges of restaurants and cafés are normal-expensive (as are most Western European prices), so if you're not prepared or willing to pay for that go to a bakery or a market to get lunch and enjoy it at the water side where you can see the ferries or some of the docked cruise ships.

Sweden,Francis D,Stockholm Old Town,4.0,"Stockholms Gamla Stan is a very nice area to walk in for a couple of hours. Not only does it provide picturesque settings with multi-colored houses, but it also boasts some nice architectural views.

There are also a few side streets, which can't even be called streets as they are more passageways. Get lost in this area, you'll enjoy it. Especially if you stay away from the main tourist streets and all the souvenir shops.",Jul 2019

From Royal Palaces and the amount of marble used until fire insurance during old times.

Its about the only place to find ""tourist type souvenirs""! So go here to buy those things because i didn't see them anywhere else in stockholm. however, after a while, the stores all seemed to sell the same things. But there are plenty of other interesting stores that this place is definitely a must see when in stockholm. when i go back to sweden/stockholm, i will go back to old town, definitely worth it!",Aug 2018
