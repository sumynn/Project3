Norway,Zvi,Fram Museum,5.0,"A very nice museum about the polar explorer. There are 2 buildings, each with a ship you can go onto and explore. There is also a lot of information and other things to see around the museum. Very nice.",Oct 2021
Norway,costas,Fram Museum,4.0,Someone must spend at least 2-3 hours minimum to fully enjoy this unique museum. It is very interesting to say the least,Aug 2021
Norway,Patrick D,Fram Museum,5.0,"The museum is located on the Bygdøy peninsula. It tells the story of the polar conquest, and of the Fram vessel, built especially in 1892 for the explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who used it in 1893 to explore the Arctic Ocean. During the first campaign to the North Pole, the Fram was taken by ice. Its rounded shape allowed the boat to be pushed back to the surface of the ice where it remained until the thaw.
It was used a second time in 1898 by Otto Sverdrup who led his own Arctic exploration expedition and attempted to go around Greenland via Baffin Bay.
The Fram was also used by Roald Amundsen on an exploration mission to the South Pole between 1910 and 1912..
The Fram is on display in its original version, with interior fittings and objects intact.
Really impressive .. Must a visit

Norway,Catherine L S,Fram Museum,4.0,"Well-made museum -- but if this is not your type of thing, you might not want to spend too long here. The whole peninsula is fascinating, however, so it's worth a trip there... just maybe not so much time in this museum if it's not your thing... so much more to experience... the charming natural history museum, that is mostly outside, is far more enriching. And, of course, there is the Kontiki exhibit (mostly recommended for boys between 8 qnd 14). A trip to the peninsula is definitely worthwhile... you can go by boat/ferry, or take a bus (less charming).",Sep 2020
Norway,veggiedyke,Fram Museum,5.0,"Really fascinating. They have thought through how you can explore the entire ship (and keep social distancing!) by having a clear path to follow. So much info. The extra activities for children (the cold room, the igloo, etc) were also fun, though I didn't like the gun one.",Aug 2020
Norway,Anita & Steen,Fram Museum,5.0,Extremely well designed exhibition. You really get a strong impression of the hard conditions the polar explorers had to suffer 4-5 generations ago. A must-see location in Oslo.,Aug 2020
Norway,lyndawilson72,Fram Museum,4.0,"Informative and well-laid out museum detailing the polar expeditions.
Amazing to see the Fram boat and be able to wander through this piece of history.
Great views across Oslo harbour from outside. Small grassy & beach area where we went for a swim on a sunny August afternoon.
Worth an hour or two of your time.",Aug 2020
Norway,LauraSanengen,Fram Museum,1.0,Boring and uninformative...do not waist your money on this place please. Plus I’ve heard they treat their employees terrible.,Aug 2020
Norway,Graham L,Fram Museum,5.0,"The banner that greets you as you arrive at the Fram Museum tells you this was the 2018 Norwegian Museum of the Year here on Trip Advisor.

Why? Well because it tells the story of Roald Amundsen and his fellow intrepid explorers who became the first to reach the South Pole in December 1911. They story is simply presented and is easily digestible with some great photos and even name checks some of the forgotten ""heroes"" - the dogs that pulled the sleds all the way to the pole.

The fact that Amundsen beat Captain Robert Scott to the pole by five weeks is reflected, too, but there's nothing overly partisan about that. Just huge respect for these amazing pioneers.

The star of the show is The Fram, the boat that took Amundsen and co to Antarctica and even following Covid social distancing did not diminish the sense of adventure clambering the decks.

Norway,1979Chas_Deb,Fram Museum,5.0,Fram Museum is very interesting with its key being the historical boat that travelled to the far north and south polar regions. It was nice to actually walk its deck and trek trough the 'cold' room.,Sep 2019
Norway,mikiza,Fram Museum,5.0,"Well preserved ship used for polar expeditions by Norwegian explorers including Roald Amundsen. In front of the museum there is also a statue of explorers facing the Oslo's bay.
You can explore the ship and read details about preparations for expedition (the ship was specially strengthen and left on purpose to be fully ice/locked to test the strength and shape of the hull, as it was designed to be uplifted by the expanding ice rather than to be locked and crushed).
While on upper deck the multimedia projectors project (on the walls and ceiling) the night sky of polar regions and icebergs floating around ship to give you a hint of what it looked like to be onboard. The ship even has a slight vibrations as if its diesel engine is still powering the ship.
Inside ship you can see crew's compartments, dining room, storage...
Great experience!

Norway,66AMS,Fram Museum,5.0,"This is amazing, a must when in Oslo an easy bus ride from the city centre. The self guided tour is excellent, you go inside and outside the ship. The video displays are excellent. The whole museum is very informative with lots of displays and information boards. The best maritime museum I have visited.",Feb 2020
Norway,Ylenia A,Fram Museum,5.0,"I didn't know about this expedition and I found that learning about it by going on the ship, seeing what it must have been like to live and work on it, give a try at the daily polar activities (like load a sledge, try and drag it, shoot animals etc. ) was the best way. It's interactive (brilliant for children!) and fun. The bar is also polar-themed so a plus if you need a bite.
It was a bit crowded but there's enough space for everyone to go around on the ship, inside and around the exhibit. Well worth the money (and time)",Feb 2020
Norway,EmeraldDiva,Fram Museum,5.0,"This is a fabulous attraction, how often can you visit a ship, inside a building? The set up is simply stunning and the fact you can go on board the Fram and follow the self guided tour inside the ship is brilliant, and so much fun. It is so well set up, you learn a lot and have a great experience at the same time.
There are many more displays on the walkways around the ship and there is also a very good gift shop on the way out. They had so many interesting books that unfortunately we could not purchase due to weight restrictions on our flights home.
Another wonderful museum within easy reach of Oslo.

Norway,Garioch Loun,Fram Museum,5.0,"Make sure you have enough time when you visit this excellent museum, you could spend all day there are so many interesting exhibits. Fascinating even if you know nothing about polar exploration, but if it’s a subject that interests you even better. All the exhibit boards are primarily in English and then Norwegian, but there are electronic screens nearby with 6 other languages as well. Being able to go onboard the Fram and experience the crews living condition is an eye opener. Highly recommended.",Mar 2020

Norway,Ken R,Fram Museum,5.0,A great experience. The centre piece is obviously the Fram herself and walking through the ship really gives a great atmosphere. On the deck you are treated a display of the different polar conditions Amundsen and his crew experienced. In the storm sequence I would swear the ship moves. Highly recommended. We returned the next day for more.,Mar 2020

Norway,Scarrowmanwick,Fram Museum,5.0,"If you’ve only got one day in Oslo you could do a lot worse than to spend it here. I have to nail my colours to the mast and confess to having a bit of a fixation with the golden age of polar exploration but even putting that aside this is a fascinating museum which will to people of all ages and persuasions. I took my fifteen year old daughter largely because the idea seemed marginally less dull than going to see Munch with her mother. I was astonished at how the exhibits gripped her. And of course the story of the race for the pole, with its triumph and tragedy absolutely enthralled her. It did no less for me even though I’d read about it over and over. As an aside, the neighbourhood is rather nice and a pleasant change from the main part of the city.

Lots of good books to pick up upon leaving .",Jan 2020
Norway,okeedoke,Fram Museum,5.0,"This museum is unique and one of the most intriguing I've ever visited. Fram is the strongest wooden ship ever built and still holds the records for sailing farthest north and farthest south. The museum provides wonderful insighst into the exploration history of the Canadian Arctic, and how it became Canadian... and why most of the names there are Scandinavian. The Fram Museum also has a polar simulator where you can experience the cold and the dangers of polar expeditions more than 100 years ago.

Next to the main building is the Gjøa building with exhibitions on the Arctic and the Northwest Passage. You can actually visit an original vintage Polar expedition vessel and walk in the footsteps of famous explorers...FUN for all ages...Highly recommended, and very worthwhile.

Norway,Ethan M.,Fram Museum,5.0,"The Fram Museum is such an amazing museum! It holds many neat artifacts, including parts of real viking ships. One of the neatest parts was going inside the ship. Inside the ship, you can walk around and explore, or you could play the interactive games. Outside the ship, sounds effects and 3-D videos make you think that you are sailing in the water! The Fram Museum also has a movie theater where different movies are played. Finally, there is so much information about the Norwegian explorers and their life style. The Fram museum is a must-see in Oslo!",Jan 2020

We’re glad we did as it was a very interesting museum with lots of information about the exploration and race to the icy bits of our planet.
It was great reading about how and why they designed the ship as they did and great to be able to walk around the ship in the footsteps of these brave explorers.
The sled pull simulator and igloo are good fun too.
Would definitely recommend a visit here.

Norway,Marius B,Fram Museum,4.0,"Really liked that there were plates everywhere explaining every stage of Fram ship had, so you don't need a guide to explain everything.
But honestly, it's a bit too much, IMO - I agree it's a great boat with some interesting history behind it, but to have a museum specially dedicated to it is too much. We got a pass which included many attractions and visited this as well, othewise would have probably skipped it",Sep 2019

Norway,Carmen8765,Fram Museum,5.0,"Information are well presented in this museum. Information presented in panels are easy to read and short enough to keep the attention span of children (mine are 10 and 13), yet enough details are given to tell the amazing story of a successful exploration. And of course there are many other exhibits that used other medium to give information to visitors too so it is not boring. You can get onto the ship ( the real one) and have a feel of what it is like to live on board of a ship. Beware there are a lot of steps and narrow passages in the ship but worth seeing.
This museum is right along side with the Kon -Tiki Museum as well as Maritime Museum. We love this Fram Museum as well as the Kon-Tiki Museum. The Viking Ship Museum ( which is also very interesting) is also within short walking distance as well so you can plan to visit all these museums in one go.

Norway,Happiii-ness13,Fram Museum,5.0,"During our city trip to Oslo, we decided to visit the Fram Museum. We spent here nearly five hours. It was really impressive and informative to read and see everything about the expedition to the south pole and north pole, not only from Amundsen. Each information in the museum is written down in English and Norwegian language, so it is no problem if you speak English, but if you don‘t speak English very well it is really hard, because most of the screens with the information in additional languages don‘t work. We bought a combo ticket, for the Fram and Kon-Ticki Museum, but if you are really interested it is not possible to visit both museum in one afternoon.

Norway,crosis,Fram Museum,5.0,"The Fram Museum is an excellent place to visit and is incredibly well done. The history and the personalities are really brought to the fore in a very informative and engaging manner. The boat is the central feature and has been superbly modified to make a great experience for young and old. Around the edge are some fascinating exhibits and also some great interactive features too. I really liked the cold room walk through area.

The shop has a good range of items, although I am not a person who buys souvenirs myself. The only downside for me was the little cafe on the ground floor. It had a poor range on offer and I was rather abruptly dealt with when I asked if they had anything vegetarian.

However the overall experience was so good, it meant the cafe was just a small blip on the radar and quickly forgotten. I recommend the Fram to everyone as a great place to visit. Even nicer if you take the ferry over from Rådhusplassen wharf area.

Norway,Alex W,Fram Museum,5.0,"From the outside, it does not look large, but inside, it is densely packed with exhibits and you will need an entire half-day to look closely at them all.

Although Fram was one ship – a specialized ice-riding vessel – the museum is about several expeditions to the polar regions (north and south), on other vessels and aircraft as well. There were quite a number of different explorers around the same time (the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and as a result, it can get quite confusing who was doing what, who was going where, when.

It does help to read up and get an outline picture of the most important expeditions (and explorers) beforehand, in order to get the most out of this museum.

There are two ships on display, both look as if they were original (at least in parts): the Fram and the Gjoa. You can wander onto their decks and inside them to get a sense of what life was like for the explorers who spent years (literally) in them in the arctic and Antarctic cold.

Actually, for a fuller story of the Fram expedition, go to the Polar Museum in Tromso.

In the underground passage between the two halves of the museum is a chronological story of the many expeditions as Europeans tried to find a Northeast and Northwest passage to Asia, complete with maps. There is so much detail, it’s mind-boggling and very absorbing. Thank goodness the bathroom and cafe-bar were nearby.

On one of the walls is another chronological display, this time of the race to the south pole between Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott. Again, it does not shy away from recounting the life-threatening difficulties the explorers faced.The narrative is told in such day-by-day detail, it is actually quite gripping -- a very rare achievement for a museum.

The main labels are in the English, with supporting text in French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Italian, Russian and Norwegian.

Bus #30 from Tollbugata Road in the city centre goes there quite frequently.

Entry: 120 kronor. I bought a combined ticket for the Fram and Kon-tiki museums for 220 kronor, instead of 120+120. The Kon-tikie museum is just across the road.

Norway,Jay Idris,Fram Museum,4.0,"FRAM museum is a museum telling the story of Norwegian polar exploration. The actual boats are displayed here and visitors can get inside to have a glimpse of life as a pole explorator at the time... insights about the journeys and the boats, but also the equipments, and even the dogs, needed in such extreme conditions, and the relationship built with local communities along the way such as the Inuits and their valuable survival teachings. Inside the museum you can go on board and take a look around in her cabins, lounges, cargo hold and engine room. So you feel how it is like to be on board and how it feels like to sail in!

You can enjoy a northern lights show every 20 minutes from the main deck of the Fram. In the activity centre behind the ship you can test your strength and accuracy. There is a cafe and books and gifts shop inside where you can find interesting things to buy.

Entrance fee is KR120 for adults. But it’s free for OsloPass holder.

Norway,minnesotans4,Fram Museum,5.0,"Buy a one day cheaper ticket for the Fram, Maritime Museum and Kon Tiki which were adjacent to one another. We took Bus #30 to this area.
The Polar ship Fram was the strongest wooden ship ever built which broke all farthest north and farthest south records. Be sure to see the surround sound film in the Gjoa section before you explore the museum. The Gjoa was the first ship through the Northwest Passage.
It was really interesting to board the Fram and see how life was like.
Trapped in Ice experience was a simulator to depict what it felt like to be caught in ice.
For me, it was the best of the three museums.

Norway,Aussie135,Fram Museum,5.0,"I was on a cruise in Norway and I wanted to see the ship museums of Oslo . the first one I visited was the Fram museum and it just blew me away. The Fram was the ship that Nansen and Amudsen used for arctic and antarctic exploration. It was specifically designed to cope with the Arctic conditions and this museum really shows you what that meant.

When it went into dry dock the museum was built around it! The museum is triangular in shape to accommodate the tall mast, although one third of the mast had to be removed ! There is a lift which takes you to the third floor which is the access to the deck of the ship, so a wheel chair user would be able to see the exhibits and reach the deck of the ship but not fully explore the ship

The internal walls are video projected with images of the arctic ocean, so that when you are on the deck of the ship you feel that you are at sea. A Storm blows up and the ship begins to move! Quite incredible. The whole ship is open for exploration from the pig sty on deck down to the hidden chocolate stores. Lots of interactive stuff on the ship to help you to understand what exploring the Arctic meant. for example , you invited to say what you would put in your sea chest for a three year voyage.

the ship is full of interesting information and there is lots of displays below the ship. My favourites were the igloo, having a go at trying to pull a 300kg sled over ice (failed I could only pull 150 kg) and shooting ducks to feed the crew- I managed 8 and I saw off a polar bear. there is also a dark room which you can enter to really feel the cold and dark of the Arctic and how the ice moves, so people with mobility issues need to be careful

I could easily have spent a couple of hours there because it was all so well presented and interesting . I stopped at the café and enjoyed the explorer's favourite pancakes and hot chocolate. there are toilets and a small gift shop too. I would strongly recommend a visit .

We spent a few hours in the museum, my brothers in particular were fascinated by the exhibition on the lower floor about the race to discover the poles through history. It was fun to be able to climb onboard the original Fram ship and see how the crew lived on board during their three-year excursion. There were some interactive parts of exhibits that were interesting to see, some of my family enjoyed it more than others. The food was limited and rather expensive but it was enough to fill a void.

The Fram is an actual ship that was part of the polar exploration. The museum features a neat 10 minute video (in multiple languages), many actual artifacts, lots of back story, and the actual ship. Depending on how much you like museums, if you read everything it will take a few hours. You can also just skim the highlights like I did over an hour.

There are some kid friendly exhibits, but overall its not a children's museum. Inside is also a cafe and a gift store. They do have an elevator, but the way its laid out there are some stairs and a lot of walking.

The ship is brilliantly presented, it has a real WOW factor when you enter the building and it was a real bonus to be able to go onto it and walk around seeing all the tiny rooms that the explorers had to live in during their expeditions. There is a place where you can walk through a corridor and experience a simulation of being on a ship in the freezing cold with ice crushing the ship. It's a bit daunting but worth a couple of minutes, you won't stay in there longer it's far too cold. There's also a corridor that leads to another ship exhibition. You can't go on this ship but the history of its expeditions are on the walls. Overall, a great museum and entry is free with the Oslo Pass which I would highly recommend buying if you plan to see a few museums in Oslo as it really saves on costs.

The layout of the museum could have been better. (When you look at the brochure it mentions that you should start off by watching their movie first. But then you have to go through quite a bit of the museum to get to the movie theater.) However, the movie was well done. You can select which language to listen to it by the headphones that are at each seat.

The museum itself was fun and interactive.

There is even a fun lunch cafe with ‘cabins’ to eat your food in. They sell alcohol in the cafe!

To be able to walk on the Fram boat and see how they crew lived for years on end and to better understand life out on the boat was fantastic.

It starts with a 10 minute video with a brief history of Roalds life. But I would recommend reading the last Viking if you wanted to get more of a background on his life before going to the museum.

The multiple ships, voyages and explorers tell the story of one of the most intensive eras of human exploration - many of them with nothing like a safety net - protected only by exquisitely careful planning and perseverance that beggars belief. There is good access and information for people of all ages.

The stories of heroism go well beyond personal ambition and fame - for example, Amundson’s risking (and losing) his life supporting the search for another explorer who had greatly annoyed him on a previous joint venture. Amundsen’s place in history was totally secure - he could have just stayed home. Plan to stay a while.

The living quarters especially convey what it was like to live and travel to uncharted areas.

My only complaint with the museum is that you are so close-up to the ship that it is difficult to see it. Photography was also a problem. Problems solved: I treated myself to one of the many books regarding the ship and its crews.

Norway,To Travel Is To Live,Fram Museum,5.0,"Such an amazing museum. When entering the FRAM ship looks and is huge. Exploring the ship gives you an idea on how the polar expeditions took place, how they spent their time in the ship, where and what the would eat, where they would sleep and how they even had fun.

The amount of preparation for these expeditions was key to their success. They didn’t leave anything to luck.

There are also many interactive things to do. You can enter the ship while hitting the ice, feel the cold and the shakes. You can hunt and shoot ducks etc.

Definitely visit while in Oslo. Next to Fram you can find Kon tiki, maritime and viking museum so you can spend the day there and take the boat or bus back.

Norway,599Angela,Fram Museum,5.0,"The museum consists of two ships - the FRAM and the GJOA, each of which has its own distinct history. There is also a film which gives you a good overview of the time and place. Both ships are well preserved and you can go on them and explore many aspects of them - the FRAM, especially, has a good collection of artifacts and sounds and music that bring you into the lives of the explorers and the preparations they made for these arduous voyages.

There is not much on how the ships ended up in the museum and how they are being conserved.

Many interactive displays as well - on hunting, igloo building, and the like. And some good interpretive panels on why Admundsen was better than Scott. Nothing new for the historians, but good for those less informed.

Norway,Magdalena S,Fram Museum,5.0,"We've arrived on the rainy Saturday to the museum which was rather far away from the city centre (be sure to take a bus or e-scooter - though the later is a bit dangerous given there are not always appropriate routes for it).

The exhibition was very extensive, had a lot of photos, and other actual pieces from the period. We got a bit lost how to start the viewing, as probably the best way would be to go all the way up and then go around. We started with the 1st floor which turned out to be the most interesting (the actual race between Norwegians and British to reach the South Pole). After this, we saw the boat, and thus the top (2nd floor) wasn't as impressive. The space is also quite dark so sometimes you need to be very close to the pieces to read the description (or use iPhone's light :).

Travel to the museum could be even nicer with a ferry from the city centre, but it was completely full and we ended up taking a bus (20-30minutes). Uber doesn't reach there (or at least we couldn't get any) so be prepared for a bus ride.

Next to the Fram Museum is the Maritime museum and across the street you'll see the Kontiki Museum.

You can also reach all these museums with bus 30 from downtown Oslo.
The bus, the ferry and the 3 museums are free with an Oslo Pass.
There are 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour Oslo Passes.
It depends on what type of tourist you are, whether or not the Oslo Pass is beneficial for you.
If you don't intend to visit many museums in 1 day, it might be better to pay the normal entry fee of the museum you do want to visit.
Most museums also have a child and senior rate.

For my husband and I the Fram museum turned out to be much more interesting than the Maritime Museum next door, and also much more extensive.
In the first hall you can view the Fram polar ship on several levels and even follow a circuit inside the ship

On the galleries around the ship there is ample information on the Norvegian explorers and their polar expeditions.

Just when we thought we saw everything, we discovered a subterranean passageway to a second hall where the second polar ship Gjoa is installed.
In this second hall there also a is small movie theater where an interesting introductory film is shown.

The Museum also has a book store, a gift shop and a cafe.

We really enjoyed our visit here.

If you want to continue to the Viking Ship Museum and/or the Norsk Folkemuseum, you can either walk 1,5 km or take bus 30 in the direction of Oslo for 5 stops/5 minutes. It has stops at both museums.

It is an amazing sight. In the parallel exhibit hall, the smaller ship Gjoa is on display. These vessels were pivotal in Norway’s exploration of both poles and epic voyages of discovery such as the Northwest Passage. The story boards and pictures are very informative and captivating. Amundsen was one inspiring character. It is possible to walk over the ships, which is a great interactive experience. The short video is worth viewing. These explorers had great courage and this is evident in their stories. It would have been tough for families and friends at home not knowing about the plight of these brave souls.

Norway,Sundancer47,Fram Museum,5.0,"There are a lot of things to like about the Fram Museum.

Firstly, we arrived by ferry across the harbour, which was enjoyable in itself.
When you get there, you find a museum that is modern, efficient and well laid-out, so that it tells the story of Amundsen and Scott’s race for the South Pole with humanity and a real understanding of the issues that they faced. A lot of the artefacts on display were actually used on the expedition.

And then, right at the centre of the building, sits the Fram, a powerfully-built vessel, designed for ice exploration and so beamy that she must have rolled in any sort of seaway. To underline the point, as you stand on her deck, there is a panorama of monstrous seas, followed by a calm sea littered with icebergs, and you start to feel the magnitude of the sea voyage alone, not to mention the walk to the South Pole. And finally, as you walk round the ship, you find realistic mannequins, laughter in the messdeck, creaking beams in the hold and all the everyday noises of a wooden ship at sea.

You come out of the museum with respect. Respect for great men with a powerful curiosity and a sort of unquenchable courage. And you realise just how primitive were the tools, the clothing and the life-support systems that they could call on one hundred years ago.

It’s detailed, humbling, educational and above all sobering.

Well worth a visit!

But the exhibition about the voyages of the ship Fram and the ship itself are very interesting and set up outstanding. Might be that this is because of the stories that are told in here about Amundsen, Nansen and Scott and the poles and polar seas.

Fascinating how they built the museum around the ships, how you can climb and observe them from the very bottom to the main deck from the outside to inside!

Another accomplishment of this museum is the ability for adults, teens, and younger children to simultaneously glean their own takeaways from the displays and text while interacting as a family.

We loved the detail of everyday life aboard the Fram - sewing, food, quarters, engines and so on, and how well that was conveyed in the museum.

The whole museum is big and full of exhibits essential for fans of the north or south and the history of their exploration. The epic voyages of the Fram and the Gjoa were well described. The timeline displays on a wall and a curved screen were a great way to tell the parallel stories of Amundsen's and Scott's south polar achievements in December 1911/January 1912 (a British obsession!!!). Nansen's remarkable explorations were matched by his humanitarian work which is also celebrated on the wall of the Oslo City Hall.

We arrived at the Fram museum by boat and had a peaceful wander at the landing stage in the sun. On the return trip to City Hall pier, we enjoyed excellent sandwiches bought at the interesting museum cafe - we were leaving Oslo later that day and had a schedule to keep!

You can clamber around these and really feel what it was like to be at sea in them.

Norway,TheLandshark,Fram Museum,5.0,"The Fram Museum is located on the Bygdøy peninsula. You can get there by ferry or by bus. Of course the ferry is nicer, at least on a sunny day.

As the name suggests, the museum houses the polar research vessel Fram and the Gjøa, the first ship to sail through the Northwest Passage. You can board both vessels and tour the belowdecks.

There are exhibits and dioramas on polar research, too.

Unfortunately, the hall that houses the Fram is very cramped, so while you get up close and personal to the vessel, it's almost impossible to get an overall impression of the ship. A very interesting museum, if only the main hall were a little bigger.

Norway,Jim B,Fram Museum,5.0,"Anyone who appreciates the challenges and suffering of the Arctic and Antarctic explorers in the late 19th century and early 20th century must visit this museum. The Fram is a sight to behold, and experience, fully preserved in shipshape condition, along with iMax-like video surrounding you on the main deck, gives you a frighteningly realistic feel for what it must have been like for Amundsen and Nansen... the mere scale of the ship is overwhelming (i.e. double layer planking of 7.5 cm and 17 cm timbers, steamed oak ribs every 10 cm throughout the entire ship, 800 tons displacement, stowage for over 90 sledge dogs, and the first-ever diesel in a ship!)

Norway,Majje76,Fram Museum,5.0,"We visited Fram Museum in one of the most beautiful days, whilst most locals rather enjoyed the sun shine and the blue sky upon the beach. However, none of us wanted to leave the museum, or the ship itself! It feels like taking a refuge from a rather cynical reality to a fairytale like realm, in which resilience and logics would always defeat any means of natural or profane hardship, regardless the actual condition! I was tearful at the end, not because I was very impressed by their accomplishment, which I did, but due to the simple reason, that their experiences aspired me to craft my own fantasy, in which I have the courage to work towards fantastic goals!

Please visit this museum, if you are going to visit Oslo! The detailed description of the ship's mechanical construction will blow your mind! The story of Nanssen's life will probably alter your expectation upon what you could do with your own mundane everyday life!

Norway,chtof2018,Fram Museum,5.0,"The Fram Museum is a museum telling the story of Norwegian polar exploration. It is located on the peninsula of Bygdøy in Oslo, Norway. Fram Museum is in an area with several other museums, including the Kon-Tiki Museum; the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History; the Viking Ship Museum; and the Norwegian Maritime Museum. Bygdøy Royal Estate, the official summer residence of the King of Norway, and historic Oscarshall are also located nearby. The Fram Museum was inaugurated on 20 May 1936. It honours Norwegian polar exploration in general and three great Norwegian polar explorers in particular—Fridtjof Nansen, Otto Sverdrup and Roald Amundsen. The museum also exhibits images of the fauna of the polar regions, such as polar bears and penguins. The Fram Museum is centered principally on the original exploration vessel Fram. The original interior of Fram is intact and visitors can go inside the ship to view it. Fram was commissioned, designed, and built by Scots-Norwegian shipbuilder Colin Archer to specifications provided by Norwegian Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who financed the building of the ship with a combination of grant monies provided by the Norwegian government and private funding in 1891. In May 2009 the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Fram Museum signed an agreement for the Fram Museum to take over the exhibition of the Gjøa, the first vessel to transit the Northwest Passage. Roald Amundsen and a crew of six accomplished that feat in a three-year journey which was finished in 1906. Gjøa is situated inside her own dedicated building at the museum. In 2017 the ship was made fully accessible to visitors.

Don't miss the huge area off of the side corridor which has information about Roald Amundssen and the fated Robert Falcon Scott trip. The main hall as you go in is quite dark and it can be difficult to read the information on the side walls as people are constantly walking past- a one-way sytem would have been more helpful.

It is all reading...which I loved. There is no audio tour. The information is localized in both Norwegian and English. Once you have completed the journey of all 3 levels, you may board the ship and spend another 30 minutes exploring the ship below deck. Great exhibit. Beautiful displays. The Fram sits on the harbor and you can take the ferry back to the main harbor for 60Nok each. It was a great way to see the city from the water during the 15 minute trip.

Also some interactive bits: model igloo, harness where you can test your pulling strength and a rifle simulation to test your marksmanship. The highlight though was the ship itself. My only criticism is that I didn’t find signage below deck at all clear, so I gave up on that. But up on deck was very impressive, especially when the graphics playing on the walls depicted a storm; I really felt like the ship was swaying in the wind and waves. Very impressive.

Moreover, there is a cafeteria where you can enjoy a good sandwich with ham, cheese or fish and vegetables or pancakes and a variety of drinks. The prices are reasonable, you can also buy dessert.

This tends to work well because museum fatigue is a real thing and this prevents it. This is a very well presented museum with a mixture of display, information, artefacts and actual experience. You can go through the chiller to experience what it would have been like sleeping in the ordinary cabins and have a go at pulling the weight of a laden sledge. It's a wonderful experience.",Apr 2019

Norway,RonTSmithers_B_C_,Fram Museum,5.0,"Excellent presentation on (mostly) arctic and a bit of antarctic exploration. Detailed exhibits on Norwegian as well a British and Russian arctic explorers and various attempts t get to the North Pole by airplane and dirigible as well as by boat. The 2 exploration ships are interesting and fun to walk around and to consider spending years on a single arctic exploration on one of them. For Canadians there is a welcome nod to (Norwegian) RCMP Captain Henry Larsen who commanded the St Roch, which also navigated the Canadian northwest passage (after the Fram) and which occupies a similar sort of museum in Vancouver, BC.

Norway,Mary Jo C,Fram Museum,5.0,Amazing polar ship Fram of the NorthPole expedition 1893-1896. Fram was the strongest wooden ship ever built breaking all previous farthest north and farthest south records. Surround polar environmental film the experience runs from the Fram deck!,Apr 2019
Norway,Jim R,Fram Museum,4.0,"Surrounding the whole race to the South Pole, so I obviously loved looking around the Fram.
But the most surprising thing was how dark the top deck was, hardly any lighting whatsoever. My CLP had to resort to the torch on her mobile to see. I'm not sure why it was so dark since the lower decks were properly illuminated. I can see some good claims being made...
We approached the museum from the ferry,( Ruter tickets not valid) it also stops near the Folk and Viking ship museum. Or you can take the no 30 bus from Oslo which stops at them all.
Overall if your into the story of the race to the pole you'll love it, otherwise give it a miss and visit the others nearby.

Norway,WanderLust1776,Fram Museum,5.0,"This museum is really extraordinary. Housed inside the walls is the actual polar ship which sailed to the South Pole - and it is huge! As if that isn't amazing enough, you are even allowed to go inside the ship and explore the decks. The museum has done a wonderful job of recreating the whole Polar experience: the rooms of the ship are decorated with actual artifacts and even outside on the top deck you are made to feel you're at sea because they've projected a moving seascape on the museum walls.

The rest of the museum if full of information about the Polar expeditions. There's so much to see and read that you really need at least 2 hours to give the place justice. My husband and I visited as part of a city bus tour and I really feel our visit was too short. It's definitely not to be missed!

The history is well explained and there a many things to see. In the main exhibition hall is the FRAM (ship) and I was really impressed, as you can go inside and experience what it was like to live on a ship. I like it, when you can touch the history and not only see it through glass (even if some places in the inside are protected with glasses). In a second exhibition hall there is a smaller ship, but I think it is worth it to step inside and have a look. I would say, that this museum is a good thing to do on a rainy day.

You can actually walk on and in the Fram but honestly they have put some creepy wax figures in there so watch yourself, especially the chef... I did not like the smile on that dude.

There is a lot of information about Polar exploration by different Norwegians who were the pioneers along with the Brits (but the Norwegians were certainly more successful), and the chance to see and walk on 2 of the most famous boats used as part of this.

The museum is made up of 2 adjacent buildings of 3 stories, each containing one of the boats.

The reason I gave this only 4 is that a lot of the information is repeated, and therefore unnecessary. A great museum, but probably best not to make this your last stop after a long day of touring.

The ship is for its time a high tech ship designed by Colin Archer with retractable rudder, a hull made to withstand the forces of the ice. The museum have several interactive exhibitions to give insight to Norwegian polar life, a ceiling with the stars of the south and to be within the ship and to come close to how they lived ( at the most 3 years) during their expeditions is great.

Some of the information does get a bit repetitive but there is no harm in that.

There are two ships from the main Norwegian expeditions which are fantastic to see and board. These parts are more engaging for younger audiences and there is also a little simulator section with colder temperatures and a little cavern to walk through.

There is a pleasant little cafe and gift shop to finish.

Additionally, while the stories were fascinating, the exhibits don't seem well-curated or managed, almost as if a scholar had free reign to design the place with no one providing editing of each exhibit from an aesthetic point-of-view. The end result is kind of like an all-out assault of words as you pass from each display panel to the next, with almost too much focus on granular minutiae.

Norway,OnThe50Yardline,Fram Museum,5.0,"I probably wouldn’t have went to the Fram Museum had it not been on the City Tour, but it was on the tour so I went. It was unusual for a museum to have an actual boat housed in it. I liked that you could see the boat as it was with kind of reenacted as it was on a voyage. There was a display of an igloo that you could crawl into which was something you probably would never had done. It seemed authentic and was incredible to witness. I like cold weather (and hot weather, too) and it was interesting to see how people lived in one. It was well worth the time spent and not something I probably would have chosen to do but glad that I saw it. It was a diamond in the rough for me.

I guess the big deal was Admunsen, the explorer who didn’t win the race to be the first one to the North Pole, but was the first to the South Pole. The group that they were competing with died on their journey to discover the South Pole after coming in second, so it was a real feat. Admunsen was Norwegian so it was a special national tribute to a countryman. Kind of like the competition the US had with Russia to be the first to the moon.

I didn’t get a thrill out of the race to be the first to discover the North and South Poles, but it was a pretty competitive feat, and just about a hundred years ago. It is much like the race we are having into space now, but think of it…a hundred years ago we were just discovering our own world. Now we are going into space and thousands of miles beyond our boarders, in a very little time period, relatively. It was pretty unique and truly fascinating! But I still liked the display of how they were when they did it over the feat itself, but you can’t have one without the other. It makes you stand back and look at things from a perspective you wouldn’t think of everyday. It puts into perspective how advanced we have become in a second of time when compared to how long we have inhabited the earth. It makes you think about things everyday life wouldn’t expose you to.

It is one of the reasons we travel and become exposed to things beyond our everyday routines. It had a real profound impact on me and it wasn’t even something that I would have gone to ordinarily. It really broadened my perspective on life. It is something I will never forget.

Norway,Fiona C,Fram Museum,5.0,"We had just an afternoon in Oslo and were recommended to visit the Fram Museum. The Museum contains two polar exploration ships which were used in expeditions by Roald Amundsen - the Fram in particular was his ship when he led the first team to reach the South Pole. As someone who'd only ever had an English education of the race to reach the South Pole (focused on Scott and Shackleton), it was a real eye-opener to learn about the very different leadership style of Amundsen, how he had learned from the Inuit and led in a firm but non-hierarchical fashion.

The museum was great fun for my 6 year old (who had studied the antarctic and Shackleton in school - but not Amundsen). He enjoyed the film introduction and then exploring the two ships and the interactive games. Everything was in English and Norwegian on the displays, with tablet computers around providing the text in a variety of other languages.

It was easy to reach by bus 30 from central Oslo and the bus driver was really helpful advising me to install the bus ticket app Ruterbillet and save money by buying our tickets on the app during our journey. The app also covers the trams and metro and worked in English.

Norway,JGSingers,Fram Museum,4.0,"I was on a whirlwind tour of the Museums and on a last minute whim decided miss my ferry and take a look inside the FRAM.

Well, apart from the claustraphobic interior of the ship - the museum is actually very classy. Interesting layout of steps,planks and ladders like any ship of that particular era. The ship ebbs and flows and the whole thing is actually very well done.

I'd actually have to say - I recommend it. It's much better than Contiki....

Norway,JaniceSmithAlvarez,Fram Museum,3.0,The artifacts and story were interesting and I liked the sound effects that made it seem the ship was afloat. Overall it was an average museum experience which I enjoyed. The counter staff could use some training because there were about 6-8 people in line and he shouted 3 times that we should know which ticket we wanted BEFORE approaching the counter. I didn't know which ticket to ask for because I needed to make inquiries. It's not like the place was overrun with visitors that they couldn't take the time to help the visitors (customers).,Jan 2019
Norway,Robert B,Fram Museum,5.0,One of the reasons we visited oslo was to see the Fram and so we were eager to visit the museum. I had a good knowledge of Fridtjof Nansen and his attempt on the North pole but we were blown away with how much was in the museum and could have spent all day there. I'd go so far as to say it was one of the best museums I have been to.,Dec 2018
Norway,Piotr Urbanski,Fram Museum,5.0,"The Fram Museum is one the best museums I have ever visited! It gives you a possibility not only to see the two historical ships, Fram and Gjøa, but to actually visit them both above and below the deck. The accompanying displays will make sure that you know all you need to about Fridtjof Nansen, Roald Amundsen and many other explorers of the polar seas, and the interactive exhibitions will show you how harsh and challenging the northern adventures can be. The admission fee of 120 NOK is quite reasonable given the Norwegian standards and is well worth it; you can also combine the Fram Museum with the Kon-Tiki Musem situated just on the other side of the street. Both museum are located a bit far from the city center, but are easily accessible by bus or, in the summer time, by ferry from Aker Brygge. When you get to visit Oslo, make sure you find your way to the Bygdøy peninsula and enjoy its wonderful museums!

There is a wealth of information in the rest of the museum and as we sadly discovered, this is not the kind of museum you can do at the end of the day, you really would need the whole day to take everything in.

The museum are exceptionally well done, with excellent use of multi-media and detailed graphical displays. I loved it, and learned so much, particularly about Amundsen and Nanson. Amundsen was an incredible explorer, ranging both poles, by ship and latterly by aircraft and airship, obviously becoming the first person to reach the South Pole, before eventually losing his life trying to locate another polar explorer.",Nov 2018

Norway,TwixUK,Fram Museum,4.0,"Having had very little polar exploration knowledge, we visited the Fram museum as we happened to be on the peninsula.

Easy access with the number 30 bus, we found it uncrowded and very interesting.

With large displays over three floors you can follow the progress of Norwegian polar explorers through time by foot, ship or plane.

There are the two actual ships on display, standing as tall as the three floors - which are very impressive. Even better you can go on them. We felt the way the Fram had been preserved and presented for visitors was superb - giving a real insight into what these explorers experienced.

A short movie was also available to summarise the explorers - telling the same story as the displays in a well put together movie format.

Wasn’t on our list originally, but well worth the visit and we all left having learnt quite a bit.

Norway,deuxchatonsinlove,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We had dreamed of this place and we have not been disappointed ! Everyone does it but you just need to look at the view to understand why ! The journey in funicular is of course part of its charm as you see the city getting further and further away.
We went up quite late so we didn't get to enjoy everything that the Mount Floyen has to offer but it will just be an excuse to come back !

However, if you are planning to use your Bergen Card discount to get to the top, be sure to come while the ticket office at the city station is open; as you won't be able to get the discount if you buy your ticket from the machine.

Thereafter, take a short walk to the lake where you can do free canoe for about 20 minutes (you can get in the queue and do it again if you like). This is a very nice experience. It starts at 11 AM so reach there before that.

There is no need to do advance booking for any of this.

We walked down the mountain like most people. It takes some effort and can tire your legs but would still be good to do once in a while if weather is good.

Norway,NK Annamária,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We spent an eventful half day on Fløyen mountain. Even though it is quite pricy for a 3 minute ride, we decided to take the funicular up the hill because the walk up would have been quite challenging for the children. Plus we wanted to experience the view from the funicular, which is really amazing. We only had to stand in line for about 15 minutes but I understand that usually there is a larger crowd.
On the mountain we found several playgrounds, a somewhat outdated Trollskogen, good ice cream and a souvenir shop with many little treasures. The view from the top is worth many photos. The walk to and around the lake is very peaceful and beautiful. We did not stand in line for renting boats as it was a weekend and many people wanted to try it.
We also saw goats and hamsters which was quite the attraction for our kids.
There are several possibilities for different hikes starting from Fløyen mountain but we did not have time to follow any of the longer ones.
Because we had good weather, we decided to walk down back to the city center, which took us about an hour at a very slow pace. We found a playground with an extra long slide along the way and that was a nice surprise for the kids.

Norway,Øyvind Wallentinsen,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Highly recommended. The funicular ride itself is nice, and the view from Fløyen is hard to beat. Once you're on Fløyen, I recommend the cafe past the souvenir shop for its delicious buns. Also, on Sundays you can hike a fairly short distance to Brushytten, where you can buy Norwegian waffles (just double-check that it's open before you go).

I also like about the funicular that it's not just for tourists -- it's also used by locals to get to and from the city.

If conditions permit it, I recommend hiking up or down the mountain for the scenic trails and the amazing views of Bergen.

Linger over a coffee or an Icecream from one of the cafés, and / or enjoy a really good walk like I did. The forest and the lake are lovely, or walk back into Bergen, or take another trail. If you take the railway back down my advice is to stand, you will get a grandstand view and great photo opportunities. Yes, on a sunny afternoon after a very wet 24 hours, there was quite a queue but the wait was much shorter than I had anticipated, probably only about 15 minutes. Highly recommended.

It is difficult suggest an ideal time for people to spend. Over 3 hours wouldn't be too much if you wanted to relax at the café and spend time walking. I hour would allow you to take photos and enjoy the view if you are really pushed for time. I spent just over 3 hours.

Norway,Kato122,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Our trip up and back on the Funicular afforded great views of the city and beyond. It was easy to use, clean and the staff efficient and friendly.

Norway,Lissa Reed,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,I always take the funicular up to the top of Fløyen for the gorgeous views of Bergen. The little cafe there is nice for a snack and warming back up before you go back down. When I thought I had lost my wallet up top the funicular staff were kind enough to go searching for it late at night - and even kinder not to laugh at me when I found it in my hidden scarf pocket. Always a wonderful experience to visit Fløyen!,Dec 2019
Norway,lyndawilson72,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Easy way up mountain from central Bergen.
Can pre-book on-line so no need to queue.
We got straight on the 9am funicular and whizzed up to top for lovely views over the city and coastline.
We set off from here on the Vidden hiking trail ... lovely 12.8km hike round to mount ulriken. You can usually get cable car down from there but it’s closed just now for renovations so we walked down the 1333 Sherpa steps instead.",Aug 2020
Norway,Graham L,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"A mid-afternoon trip up the funicular and little queue to speak of with social distancing occurring on board, perhaps more by design of the passengers themselves. What a view of Bergen in all its jaw-dropping beauty from the top! Unless you are short for time or have mobility issues, no real need to take the funicular back down to town. Much more fun to meander along some of the trails. Walking down at a leisurely pace takes about 45 minutes and once you leave the foliage of Mount Floyen behind, you can explore some of the quaint alleys at seemingly every turn.",Aug 2020

Norway,Yelena V,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"The ride is short and pleasant, as well as saves you >3km of going uphill on foot. The views are also nice if you manage yo secure a good seat in the front. However the waiting line makes you doubt that the trip is really necessary. Better to buy the tickets on the websiteand go to a faster lane than waiting to purchase on the spot (this time for example they couldn't ooen the door for the cassier so the whole line was blocked). It's worth it if you want to save time to get to the top and do the hikes there",Jul 2020
Norway,Sian,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"For a relatively small price you get a stunning view of Bergen, the harbour and the surrounding islands. In March we got a lovely mix of snow capped mountains and city, it really was beautiful. There's shops at the top for food and souvenirs, as well as a walking route through the mountains just above Bergen - it was a bit too snowy for us to do but must be lovely in summer. Definitely come up here when you're visiting Bergen!",Mar 2020
Norway,Patrick M,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Lots of fun and great views are to be had on the funicular to the top of Mt. Florence.

Norway,enur1979,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Surprised to see so many bring their dogs up to the mountain using the funicular but they all loved it.

Norway,Julia P.,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"If you're lucky and get a sunny day (like we did), this is the perfect spot to witness the majestic views of the city and its surroundings.

The view at the top is very nice, depending on the weather, so don't buy tickets in advance. (And if you're visiting Bergen on a cruise, do NOT do this as a paid excursion with the ship. It only takes about 15 mins. to walk to the funicular from the port & it's very easy to purchase tickets, etc. independently.)

Norway,1979Chas_Deb,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,We took the funicular up to the top the first thing we did in Bergen. Got a great view and we were able to orient ourselves with how Bergen is laid out. Sat out on the terrace and had drinks and food/snacks.

Norway,sydneyboxhead,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"This is a must do, but only if the weather is clear, otherwise there is nothing to see. It gives you a real sense of the size of Bergen.

Norway,QNH,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Lovely views over the harbour. On our second trip the funicular was closed due to the Covid-19 situation and we had to walk up.

Norway,EmeraldDiva,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We were on the 1st funicular of the day (8am), so we had the place to ourselves for some time. The views are gorgeous, even on a dull winter day, and the viewing areas are plentiful. The little shop opened at 9am and we enjoyed hot chocolate and cinnamon buns (literally straight from the oven!).
We had a great time exploring the walking trails at the top, including the very pretty trail around the frozen lake. By the time we returned heaps of people had arrived and the sky had cleared so it was time to take in those views again.
The walk back down to Bergen is lovely, going through some beautiful bush areas. You can also walk up if you prefer, or take the funicular both ways.
This is a lovely excursion from Bergen.

Norway,Celtic-Wanderer,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Bottom station is right in the heart of old Bergen and easy to find. For seniors, off season you can get a return ticket for Kr50 and although a number of things at the top not fully open, still worth going for the view and lovely walks. Looked like the Bergen council were preparing well for the new season with new pathways/planting etc taking place....so I imagine in a few months time this place will be a mecca for families/walkers/locals with a great selection of outdoor activities on offer.
The journey in the funicular took about 10/15 minutes and these run at regular intervals both ways, so never long to wait, if you've just missed one!
If you're not keen on the alternative highlight - the cable car to the adjacent mountain top, this is certainly an easy and stress free route....alternatively there is a pathway too!!

The cars give you a spectacular view of the harbour area as you ascend the mountain, and the view of the surrounding area is equally impressive. Rule of thumb: if it is clear go now, don't wait for tomorrow as the view may be socked in with fog or rain! There is a nice cafe on top for a cup of hot tea or a sode and a snack. The price is right and you will have a great memory to take with you!",Feb 2020

Norway,Phillip G,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,A must for any visit to Bergen. The Funicular railway station is located within the city centre and can actually be seen from the tourist information office. It is a out a 15 - 20 minute walk (via Bryggen) from the cruise ship quay and about the same from the main railway terminal. The view from Mount Floyen is spectacular and is a good place to familiarise yourself with the city’s major landmarks.

What we saw from atop the Mountain was breath taking. The whole city could be seen in our small Retina. It was an amazing view during day time but the night unfold a greater beauty, when the entire city lit up. O My God we were in love with this place.",Feb 2020
Norway,Chris P,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Well worth the trip up on the fernicular railway up the hill. There are some fantastic views to be had.
It's worth considering your footwear as sensible shoes/boots would enable you to walk around more at the top. We were restricted as there was ice around.

Norway,Stanley W,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"If you catch Bergen on a clear day, a visit to Floyen is well worth!

From the top there is a spectacular view of the city and the harbours.",Mar 2020

I loved the steepness of the ride and the views at the tope were amazing. The curio shop also had super gifts. The signpost was a great place to take photos from. The walk through the forest was delightful and the Christmas trees decorated by the children were wonderful. How I would love to go back.",Dec 2019
Norway,Miss O'Donnell,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"I can see why so may people have this as top of their 'to do list' when you visit Bergen. The views from Mount Fløyen are breathtaking.

At the top is a cafe and lots of play areas for the children. There's a troll forest, you can hire bikes, there's lots of lovely walks.

We were incredibly lucky as on the day we went it was blanketed in snow. It was like a Christmas card come alive. As we rounded the corner, there were children sledging, cross country skiing, lots of families having BBQs. It was beautiful.
We went back the following day to see the views at night and it was like the snow had never happened.

The funicular is fun. I'm sure kids would love it, but frankly if you get it up and back you're missing out and massively paying out..it isn't cheap.
Hike up.
Get the absolute maximum of the views, the surroundings, the freshness of the place.
Enjoy a coffee and pastry, hunt a troll and then get the funicular down.

Norway,Irishrover m,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The ride from town to the top of the mountain on the Funicular was wonderful.
The view from the top was spectacular.
I was last in Bergen fourteen years ago, and it showed me just how much the town had grown in that time.
It was not very busy when we went up, so we could walk around and take any photos we wanted.",Jan 2020
Norway,geert c,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"with the short (5 mins) rail track, you have a superb view over the city of Bergen. From the top, you can walk around in the woods. Attractive shop and restaurant.",Jan 2020
Norway,Aussie252,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"This is a popular attraction, even in winter, we were lucky as it was fine weather and reasonably clear.

Norway,Aurelija Š,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"It was a nice experience to climb here, the view was good, at the top there was a nice souvenir shop, cafe and a small lake. The nature in Norway is realy beautiful. I’m happy about this trip but do not expect something fabulous there🏞.",Jan 2020
Norway,Matt Hart,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We did two trips up the railway, one at night time and one in the morning. It is worth doing it in both lights to see the view.

Tickets aren't very expensive, around £8 GBP per person and can be booked very easily on the Floibanen App, then scan the QR on your phone at the barrier and you get straight through without having to queue at all.",Jan 2020
Norway,Olivia035,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,A great way to see Bergen. There are great views on the way up and down and when you are up the top you get to see all of Bergen. You can then walk around the lake and forest and you can walk back down to the centre. The Funicular is a great attraction and there is a gift shop and restaurant at the top.,Jan 2020
Norway,literarydouble,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"I LOVED this so much! It's no wonder it's Bergen's top attraction!

The funicular was lots of fun to ride, both up and down. You can buy tickets from the ground station but I bought them from the Floibanen website. It was super quick and easy and you get tickets emailed to you and you simply scan the QR code at the turnstiles.

The ride itself takes around eight or so minutes and stops at the stations on the way, giving you a great view of Bergen as you ascend the mountain. The carriages are a little small so when it gets busy, prepare to budge up!

The mountain itself was gorgeous. You can step to the edge and take in Bergen and the surroundings from viewing platforms near the Floibanen station.

There are a number of well sign posted trails and I walked two; to the lake and the troll forest. Both were lovely but a bit steep so if you or your companion have trouble walking, be prepared. Then again, it's a mountain, it makes sense!

The forest was lush and dense and beautiful and exactly what you imagine when you think of Bergen. You could spend hours up on the summit, meandering about and taking lots of photos. If you can catch the sunrise or sunset, absolutely do it! It's also exceptionally pretty when it gets dark and you can see Bergen all lit up. The main trails around the station are very well lit, too.

The Floibanen funicular runs every 15 minutes or so which changes to every 30 mins after around 19:00

At the viewing platform, there is also a restaurant, cafe, gift shop and toilets.

If you're going to do one thing in Bergen, make sure you do this!

Norway,Leeds270968,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"There is so much I love about the Norwegian Way of life. And travelling up the Floyen captures pretty much everything in one visit.
Here we have a fantastic tourist attraction that gives superb views of the city of Bergen, the surrounding mountains and even as far the the North Sea. Your can take the easy route (the Funicular train) which we chose (100 NOK each) or numerous walks from Bergen to the mountain top. Some of these are easy and some are much harder.(I know i tried one of the harder ones last year). Once at the top you then have access to even more mountain trails and treks as well as a couple of restaurants / cafes offering some well deserved nourishements.
But what has this all got to do with my opening statement. Well its all about the amount of families you see getting back to nature. Everyones out enjoying the fantastic scenery that Norway has on offer and i like that.
So grab yourselves a pair of good walking boots, somewhat good waterproof walking gear and get outside and enjoy what Norway has to offer. !!!

We jumped into ond of those things that took us on the top. I would definitely recomand to stay by the right side when you go up and to go around 16:00 so you can catch up both day and night views.
Once we got to the top we spotted a restaurant which was brilliant. The food was top notch! We then took loads of pictures. There are a lot of spots and all are unique. Definitely a must!",Dec 2019

Norway,Katy W,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The funicular railway is a must do whilst in Bergen for the best views in the city. I'd recommend standing in the bottom carriage for good photo opportunities on the way up.

We decided to walk back down to the bottom of the mountain. It is quite slippy on the way down, so probably not the best option if the weather has been bad.

There is a cafe at the top and a few lakes to explore. I imagine it would be really lovely in the summer.

The funicular stopped on 3 other stops along the hill for access to stops along the hill. Great lookout platform at the top on Mt Floyen.

As we got around 5-6pm, all the shops/resturants were already closed so we just went to the lookout and back down the hill. It looked like renovation works were being conducted the the area.

We got free tickets to do the ride as part of our hop on-hop off bus ticket. I can understand why this is such a popular activity and it is just a few hundred metres from the central area and fish market.

There are food and drinks at the top, but the ones we looked at were quite pricey and only offered basic food. Sadly the coffee and hot chocolates in each shop were just press button machines and not real coffee.",Sep 2019
Norway,Norris A,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Bergen is a beautiful city, seen on the ground. To see the lay of the land and witness the city in its beautiful location you need to get up high and the Floibanen makes that possible in the shortest amount of time. From the top of Mt.FLoyen you get to see the Big Picture.

We had pre-paid tickets bought online in Chicago which allowed us to bypass the snaking line in the forecourt at the street level terminal so no waiting in the sun or rain.
However, you will probably have to wait just to get on the platform for the tiny funicular train. Then once the passenger manager bids you come through to board on the steep steps you'll wait again for an empty train to come back down. Then you board in a scrum of elbows and pushing as some folks covet the few bench seats or a window position in the tiered cabin. So the getting to the top isn't super fun but worth enduring when you step out at the upper station and are in the fresh air, high above Bergen, a real beauty of a city and everyone has a chance to take photos and wander from the crowds lining the safety barriers for picture taking. The selfie takers tire quickly as they just need one iconic city shot but I was in no hurry and waited for my opportunities or shoot over their heads from the different elevations available..

The air is fresh up here as befits mountain air and the thrum of the city imperceptible. You'll see smiles, hear Wow, Awesome and Beautiful in many languages.

You will likely wait in line to come back down (see photo) and no one has priority there.
There's a gift shop if you have allowed yourself time to browse.

If, unlike us, you had a few hours to spend up here you could enjoy hiking through the woods at the top. You could walk back down to the city rather than take the funicular.

I was there in June just before peak season, there's wasn't much of a queue to get up, and there was none to get down. It's a bit pricey (everything in Norway is a least a bit pricey), but well worth it to avoid what must be a very difficult hike!",Jun 2019

Norway,Caroline,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We sent in September and even though we arrived early with prepaid tickets there was an incredibly long queue to board the funicular. It was jam packed when we finally made it into a car and taking photos was very limited on the way up because of being so tightly packed into the cabin.
The scenery from the top was magnificent and despite the light rain we had an amazing and exciting view of the port, the city and the fjords. We were amazed that we were actually standing in Norway!
The Hotel on the mountain was interesting and staff hospitable, and the souvenir shops were packed with tourists but the staff were very friendly. As expected everything was very expensive but we bought a few things before queuing to get back on the train to return to the city.
All in all a wonderful introduction to Norway and would love to do it all again.

Norway,Paul and Kim A,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We had one evening in Bergen and we didn’t expect much. The woman at the hotel suggested we take the funicular before sunset and then walk down. The ride up was nice, and the views of the city at arrival were stunning. BUT the walk down was the icing on the cake. It was a wonderful path far above the city with stunning views at every turn, locals taking their daily jogs down (and UP!!!) the mountain, surprise art installations, an athletic centre, a really steep slide and a chance to wander through actual neighbourhoods where people actually live, eat and work. Far from being just a pit stop, Bergen actually was one of the highlights of our trip.

Norway,Julie F,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Wonderful photo opportunities. Go it alone if you are on a cruise liner - save yourself ££££'s. Go early and miss the crowds - it is easily walkable and so much cheaper! If you are on a cruise ship you would have to walk back anyway. Lovely walks at top and a small area for children to play. lovely.,Jul 2019
Norway,Tim P,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The bottom station is only a short stroll from the main harbour area, and it is a simple case of queuing for your ticket and waiting for the next available trip up.

Although the total journey isn't that far, it is a steady old journey up, with several stops on the way.

Once at the top, there is a really good viewing area, with stunning views back down to Bergen. There is a well stocked cafe close to the top station, together with a gift shop. There are a number of well-marked routes radiating from the top area, of varying difficulty.

We took the path all the way back down to the town, which was easy enough, but still a lovely way to blow the cobwebs off.

This is a great way to spend a bit of time away from the hustle and bustle of the town.

After half an hour walk you'll be in the high mountain with scenery you'll never forget, if the weather is at your side. In special weather conditions you might see some of the oil installaions in the North Sea (using binoculares)",Apr 2019
Norway,Deborah P,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"On a family trip to Norway, our first stop was in Bergen. I'd read about the funicular ride, and suggested it to my family as we wandered around the city. We took it to the top of Mount Floyen. The ride was short, but it was fun to watch our journey up the mountain from the inside. Once we arrived at the top, we really enjoyed the view. The restaurant at the top was great, too, and I got as lovely platter of local meats and cheeses, along with a delicious glass of Hansa pilsner - a local brew. After snacking, we wandered around a bit and met the resident goats, who keep the brush mowed down to preserve the view. The whole family - three teens and four adults - found the experience amazing!

Norway,amewsing,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"If you’re keen to catch a bird eye view of Bergen, then I would recommend this. If you think you’re fit enough to get up there, then you may consider walking up which probably takes about 45-min or there’s also an option to cycle up. Else, you can pay NOK50 per person for a one way up to the peak and opt to walk back down to the city center. If not, a 2-way trip via the cable car is NOK90 per person.

The view is quite breathtaking - take some time to just sit and enjoy the view, while taking in some fresh air. I reckon the sunset view (if the sky is clear) would be quite a sight for sore eye. Unfortunately we were up there around 2pm and didn’t want to hang out till 5pm for the sunset.

There’s also a restaurant/ cafe up at the peak for some food and drinks. And there’s also a toilet inside the cafe that’s open to public.

The walk down on tar road is quite easy; you will be able to catch more view. And we also stumbled onto mountain goats (you can go near them and take photos; they seemed quite harmless). The walk down takes about 45 mins but we took longer as we made several stops for photos.

Norway,MICA_CHICK,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We caught the cable car up to the top for 45 NOK on line which was a slight saving and also to gain time better spent walking around the top area. The information centre was closed so we couldn’t get a map but phone coverage was good so we knew where we were and felt safe. Heaps of tracks everywhere but you need to head to the top to Rundemansveien which is a decent walk but definitely worth the peace and views you get when you arrive. Take food and water and warm clothes because there is nothing there and it was chilly to say the least despite the sun being out.
The paths are Sign posted but being in Norwegian it didn’t help us much, hence try and get a map of sorts. But times are included which is super helpful. We were on the 10 am cable car and spent the next 3.5 hrs exploring. We could have stayed longer but we didn’t prepare well enough with food and water. We walked down to the city centre which took around 2 hours from the top area to the start again.

Its highest point is 400 m (1,300 ft) above sea level. The mountain is easily accessible via the funicular. Floibanen takes you up and down for KR125 per adult. We took the funicular to the top and down which itself is a different experience. The views all the way to the top are breathtaking.

The mountain offers a beautiful way of Bergen city and port and also surrounding mountains.

The mountain itself has hiking trails through the forest and different activities like zip lining. We also got free canoe rides across one of the small lakes.

Has a restaurant and a small Cafe, a sausage stand, a playground and many other activities. There is even a hut with resident sheep.

Norway,mary p,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"You have to go up Mt. Floyen if you are in Bergen. And if like us you have little ones in tow or do not have enough time and energy for a hike, definitely take the funicular. The ride in the little glass cubbies of the funicular itself is a lot of fun. We were lucky to get in at the very front (or back, depending on which way you are going) of the cabin. So we had a lovely view both going up and coming down. We walked around a bit, once at the very top. There is a playground and a maze-like walk with troll statues. There's also zip-lining but it was closed for the day when we reached. Anyway, after the look around, it's nice to just sit on the steps looking over the harbor and enjoy the amazing view. Also, what with Bergen supposedly being the rainiest city in Europe and all, we lucked out with amazing weather and clear sunny skies that made the view even more spectacular.

The ride up and down takes about 6 or 8 minutes. It was super fun. The views from the top are amazing. We walked around and saw the goats and the troll forest , which is above the playground they are doing construction on closer to the restaurant. Then we went for a hike up the mountain for even more breathtaking views. Defniitely fun, but hiking shoes are a must espeially with the wet, moist Bergen weather. Lots of muddy trails.

We only caught glimpses of the city of Bergen, its seafront, and the surrounding fjords as we rose up higher and higher grounds. When we reached the top we were disappointed. It was all white as if we were in the clouds.

What was pleasant were the coffee shops that offered warm, cosy environment where we could have hot drinks and bakery items while we waited out the rain and cloudy sky. We were duly rewarded when we were about to leave. The sky cleared. Although the funicular was due to depart but the captain was wonderful. He allowed us a little more time so that we could take panoramic pictures to bring home memories of Bergen with us.

The downward journey of the funicular was, needless to say, spectacular!

When in Bergen take the funicular up to Floyen. You won’t be disappointed.

Norway,Varun_723,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Taking the funicular up to the top of Mount Floyen was very easy, simply buy your tickets from the ticket office at the front and queue up for the ride. There's a few stops along the way but you'll be up in no time. The views from the top are fantastic, probably the best views in the city. While you're there, say hi to friendly goats. If you want to maximise your trip, instead of hoping on board for the ride down, walk down the road on the other side, this takes approximately 30-45 minutes.",Sep 2019
Norway,Jorg S,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,A great experience. Very well organized and definitely worth the money. Trains go up and down every 10 minutes. Nice coffee shop on the hill this is a must for every visitor.,Oct 2019

Norway,Meagan B,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"We travelled to the top of Mount Floyen on the Funicular. The trip was smooth and you could view some great scenery. At the top of the mountain there is a restaurant, a souvenir shop and another food outlet. You are able to walk down the mountain if you wish ( about 1 hour) or return on the funicular. We walked around the top of the mountain and orientated ourselves. We picked out some of the places we wanted to visit on our return to the town.",Oct 2019
Norway,USCtraveller,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Great view looking out over the city. Can hike at the top and if you are lucky you get to see the mountain goats.

Norway,Joe_Cruzer,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,We paid for one way up only and hiked down from the top. The view of the city is remarkable. They have the essential facilities at the top. Very convenient. It is a 3 kilometer walk down from the top due to the zig zag design of the path. Some parts are rocky and it requires some effort despite of the downward direction.

Spent an hour at the top admiring the views. A guide showed us the passage our ship took out to sea. Interesting to see the oil rigs and landmarks around Bergen. Had a hot drink and delicious cinnamon pastries in the Cafe. There are also a restaurant, toilets, gift shops and goats at the top. We had a cloudy day but it was still a good visit.",Aug 2019
Norway,GKTravellers,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"With the sun shining we took the furnicular to Floyen to enjoy the fabulous views and hike in the woods. Being October the winter return price was only 95NOK each. The wide viewing platform provides panoramic vistas over the city and harbour. We didn't use the cafe, shop or restaurant at the top, preferring instead to hike along one of several paths. The mountain goats proved very tame allowing us to take close up photos",Oct 2019

Tickets for children under 4 years of age are free. The best seats up are at the bottom of the cable car with fantastic views as you traverse up and down Mount Fløyen.
Once at the top of the mountain there are multiple lookouts, a restaurant, gift shop, playground, picnic areas, and plenty of wilderness and walking tracks to explore. We saw so many people go up, take a few photos, and leave again. It really is worth a good walk around with plenty of signage and information boards.",Oct 2019

Norway,twovagabonds,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The funicular was only about 3 blocks from our hotel, but I got lost trying to find it. Because of this, we did not have time to take a hike once we arrived on top of the mountain, which would have been fun. Despite my ineptness, we really enjoyed this activity. The views are truly amazing and the goats are entertaining. We did not avail ourselves of the restaurant services, but they looked good as well. But the real star is the view and we enjoyed it immensely.",Aug 2019

Once at the top there are plenty on hiking trails for all abilities and plenty of recreational area for young children to play. We visited in September and the temperature at the top was a few degrees cooler than the town, so take a scarf and gloves. We did a medium hike, then walked down into the town. A wonderful few hours spent.",Sep 2019
Norway,7wonderstraveler,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,My husband and I love to hike so we hiked the trail up to Mount Floyen instead of using the funicular. The trail is wonderful and very few people. We arrived to the top in about 45 minutes and had incredible views of Bergen. This is one of the top things to do in Bergen and we were very happy we did it.,Sep 2019
Norway,Tony G,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Pre-purchased our ticket via a hop on hop off tour bus service. Very fortunate as the queue was enormous and the wait must have been over an hour. With our jump the queue ticket we waited a couple of minutes outside the station then started to file through the tunnel to the platform. Very organised as the there is only a single car which can carry approx. 60 people. You gain access to the platform which is a series of steps cut into the hillside via ticket scanning gates. These count passengers in and when the maximum for a car is reached they lock. One car goes up as another comes down, passing at the mid point. Journey time is only a few minutes (3 or 4?). We were first at the gates so we chose the first compartment so we could look down the track as we ascended. However as has been noted in other reviews the car is crammed to capacity so it is fortunate that the ride is short because it can be most uncomfortable.
The main point of this visit is less the funicular railway more the view from the top which is a few hundred feet above sea level.
The view makes the trip worthwhile. The whole town is laid out below you. There are facilities up here but as you would expect prices are extremely high. This is a must do in Bergen.

Norway,gordokj,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Go early to avoid the long lines. After leaving the funicular follow the hiking trails to climb higher for better views and to avoid the crowds. Climbed up to an old radio tower. Definitely worth the extra effort.,Sep 2019
Norway,LishMcM,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,We went up the funicular in the evening and stayed up to watch the sunset. The views were amazing. We had a little walk around the mountain while we waited for the sun to set. If it is a good day definitely try to go up for sunset.,Sep 2019
Norway,Tamber W,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,2.0,Views are beautiful once you get up but the ride up that should have been pleasurable was horrible. We were packed like sardines with few views because there were so many people. In addition the staff were rude. Not worth the money!,Sep 2019
Norway,Meggysmum,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"We arrived in Bergen by cruise ship on a cloudy morning. We walked around the city for a while but the cloud wasn't liftig so we thought we would just go on the furnicular anyway for fun.
We walked straight on and within a couple of minutes we were through the clouds in to glorious sunshine. We had a lovely walk around a lake and it was so beautiful and peaceful, when we walked back towards the station for the return journey the place was heaving. The clouds had cleared so there was a brilliant view.
When we got back down the queue stretched right along the street and since only a few people can ascend at a time I think they would have been waiting for a long time.
This is a nice quick trip with great views when the clouds clear but go early.

Norway,Tripstaker,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"If you’re lucky enough to be in Bergen on a bright day with good visibility, this trip is a must. There may be long queues, but two cars run continuously, and with five gates boarding from the car sides, it’s not too long a wait. The view from the top is lovely, highlighting Bergen’s natural harbours and pretty setting amidst seven hills.
The city's real size is surprising when you see its hinterland beyond the seafront areas. It’s an easy walk from the viewing platform round the lake and there are further walks and trails for those with time to explore.
If anything, going down is even better than going up - and fun if you can get the seats at the front of the car!

Queues are massive for the funicular so book in advance! As there is a separate line for pre-booked tickets which saves a lot of time. The ride takes less than 5mins and has good views but brief. The carriage is usually full with not many seating options so be aware.

This was a good experience and there are a few walks at the top with an option of walking down to experience more of the scenery.

Worth a trip and would recommend to anyone visiting the area.

Norway,ToniN705,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We had a five-hour window to take the funicular up in good weather, so we took it! The trip itself takes about five minutes, and most people stand up during the trip (there are a few seats for those in need). At the top, there is an amphitheater-style viewing area where you can look out over all of Bergen. It's quite stunning and a beautiful view, from the bay and cruise line areas to the sprawling community.

There is a restaurant at the top. When we were there (around 1:30 pm), they were offering snacks and drinks. But, they appear to offer a sit-down dining experience as well.

There is a paved path that takes you through the forest of trees and grasses. We went a tiny bit down the path (past a bunch of goats sitting on picnic tables waiting for their photo to be taken), but we returned to the top because we weren't equipped to hike down to the bottom (which you can do).

There is also a gift store at the top, which was quite crowded when we entered.

I highly recommend this trip to give you a good overview of the Bergen area.

It is very busy so be prepared for a lot of people. And don't pay attention to anything online that says advanced tickets aren't necessary. If we didn't have our tickets already we would have waited more than an hour just to buy them.,Sep 2019
Norway,ashka1,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Worth the trip just for the view alone. Lovely restaurant and cafe at the top. A welcome haven from the very wet weather.,Sep 2019
Norway,Michael K,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Funicular gives you head start, and you can hike a variety of paths from there. Most are accessory roads or paved sidewalks and there is little challenge. The day we went was rainy (Bergen is the rainiest city in Europe they say) and with brisk winds, making conditions suboptimal for hiking, but the views were still beautiful.",Sep 2019
Norway,Niroza H,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Floyen was a good way to go up and see the whole town . It was breathtaking from up there . The building s the surrounding water the fresh air.

Norway,Malcolm H,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"What a great way to see Bergen. After the excitement of listing off from the base ( we were lucky enough to be first in the queue and get a seat at the front window ) comes the panoramic view gradually unfolding, strangely interspersed by going Ned bridges and roads that wind up the mountain. OK so the rain was a pain, but it had stopped after a scrummy coffee and cake at the cafe at the top, then we captured the panorama on film.",Sep 2019
Norway,Yorkshirecritic,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We queued for over an hour to get onto the Floibanen and it wasn’t cheap but it was definitely worth it. The ride itself is breathtaking, climbing swiftly up a seemingly impossibly steep track from the centre of the town. The views from the top are spectacular across the whole of Bergen and far beyond. A must-see in this pretty city",Sep 2019
Norway,kent19,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"We booked our tickets for the Floibanen (funicular) from the tourist office at the Bergen wharf so that we don't have to queue up at the entrance point since the ticket queue at the Funicular station is always huge.

Well, as luck would have it, there was some mechanical failure and the personnel were unable to let us know when the funicular will be functional again or if it will be functional at all that day!! And yes, we have the option to get a refund but from the tourist office since we purchased our tickets there. On approaching the tourist office, we were told that the validity of the ticket extended beyond that day and hence we could use it next day or get a refund any time. So we decided to postpone it for another day since this was one of the items in our ""to-do"" list.

As luck would have it, while we were finishing our coffee at the Starbucks near the Floibanen station, we saw this huge serpentine queue move a little.... So we rushed, skipped that huge queue at the entrance (since we already had the tickets) and went ahead to board the Floibanen (there was a queue there too but much smaller and we did get in at first attempt).

The Floibanen is a small funicular - if one is lucky one gets to sit, but we had to stand both ways. :-)

The view from Mount Floyen is quite nice. You see the city of Bergen in a nutshell. ;-) We got busy clicking some pics since the sun god was smiling (sometimes a rarity in Bergen). Overall a good experience.....

I would recommend planning to go up the mountain only when you get here as the weather is quite fickle in Bergen.
I also recommend going early as the lines/queues can be long. The view is spectacular on a good day.",Sep 2019
Norway,Katie R,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"This is a must do for anyone in Bergen! We only took the furnicular up and back down, we didn’t do any hiking. It was a cold and rainy day, and we had just arrived after much traveling. We were able to buy tickets and get right on the furnicular with no lines (also, not sure if that might be because of the weather).

We were looking for something quick and fun to do and this was perfect! The view is incredible and it’s so quick, there’s no way to reason not going. As I’ve seen others post, there is a massive viewing space so it’s really easy to get your pictures.

Norway,Anna_Maria39_11,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"You can save yourself oodles of time by buying your tickets on line. You will bypass a potentially long line at the tourist information centre or at the Floibanen building. With ticket in hand you can simply walk into the terminal. If you want to hike either up or down, buy a one way ticket. Currently the funicular departs every 15 minutes and we didn’t have to wait at all. I can’t comment on any of the hiking or outdoor activities as we only went for the view before catching our train. The viewing platform is spacious enough that it was easy to take pictures without a wall of people in front of you. The gift shop was very nice with lots of variety, there was outdoor seating from the restaurant and the washrooms were clean and no surcharge to use them. Next time if I’m not pressed for time I will hike it.

Norway,Paul S,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We decided to take the funicular to the top of Mt. Fløyen, and I purchased tickets online, which turned out to be a very smart decision. When we arrived at the ticket office and entrance, we encountered a long and very slow line, but they were all waiting to purchase tickets. We were not, and so simply bypassed what would have been a 15-minute wait, and got directly on the funicular. The view of Bergen from the top was outstanding, and after a few minutes we ventured out onto some of the many substantial trails, finding ourselves quickly away from the mass of people hanging around the top of the mountain. We also hiked down to Bergen, which made for an excellent way to see a lot of beautiful woods and small waterfalls and some of the more beautiful neighborhoods in town.

The mountain has fabulous views of the Bergen city. At the top there are souvenirshop, restaurant and toilets. There are nice hiking paths to other mountains, playground for the children etc. It is nice area to get yourself activated. A nice trip.",Sep 2019
Norway,Sue S,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We hiked up Mount Floyen, which took about an hour. However, early in the morning, the wide, gravel path was almost deserted, except for the rare jogger. The huge trees provided a serene environment. Along the way, there were play structures for kids and large troll sculptures. Once we arrived at the top, the crowds emerged (arriving from the funicular). The views from the top are wonderful! The restaurant and shop were bustling. The cruise ship crowds were out in droves. We waited only a few minutes to hitch a ride down on the funicular. Great views going down! But once we were at the bottom, we saw the HUGE line-ups to go up the funicular.
Tip: if you have the fitness level, then climb UP the mountain and take the funicular DOWN to avoid the crowds! Enjoy!

Norway,Marty Bielicki,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"One of the most popular tourist attractions not only in Bergen, but all of Norway. Nearly a million people come up the thousand-foot mountain for commanding views of the city of Bergen and its harbor. The views on a nice day, are indeed, magnificent.

Most people take the funicular which is easy to find in Bergen. Over the course of its history starting in 1918, the funicular has been replaced several times. Today there are two passenger cars—one red and the other blue—which takes a hundred people each up or down on nearly the 3000 foot line.

Some people, like us, took the funicular up and walked down. The price of a ticket is half price that way. They will give you a walking map if you chose to hike down.

Some of the trail down is on doable gravel and later turns to a paved path. It takes a good thirty minutes to walk down. Your legs are breaking most of the way. The funicular takes about eight minutes each way.

On top of Mount Floyen is a decent café. We celebrated life with a few beers. Visiting Mount Floyen and seeing the city above is one of the “must-do” activities while in Bergen.

There are a number of trails. If you are so inclined, recommend bringing your hiking shoes. You can spend an hour on Mount Floyen or an entire day.

Norway,As1Cit,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"We took a hiking tour off the cruise ship. Walked from cruise terminal to funicular and then hiked to top of mount Floyen and then back. Well maintained wide path all the way. Some moderate inclines, but overall easy hike for anyone in decent shape. Weather ranged from pouring rain to sunshine. We could barely see the top and some returning hikers informed us that there was no view due to fog. When we arrived at the top 15 minutes later, the sun was out and we enjoyed a spectacular view of the harbor. This was a worthwhile excursion, but my advice to anyone visiting from a cruise ship is to do it on your own. The trails are well marked and there is no need for a guide. The return lines for the funicular can be long at times but you can continue your hike all the way down. Be sure to bring your rain gear.

The first time there was a long line but it went rather quickly. The second time and we went later in the day and it wasn’t nearly as busy. Most of the cruise ships had left so we enjoyed watching the late afternoon sun over the harbor. If you can definitely go later in the afternoon.

The view at the top was nice, but after seeing fjords and beautiful views from the Flam railway and ferry, I was not sure the trip up was totally worth it. We walked a bit after we got to the top, which was probably the nicest part of doing this. There are a lot of lovely trees and we happened upon a family of wild goats. We walked to a nearby lake which to be honest looked like a large pond and had a lot of flying insects near the water. If you are pressed for time I would not give up another activity to do this.

Norway,65Graham65,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,This is one of the absolute must-do's in Bergen. Its very popular so plan to go early to avoid a VERY long wait in line for the cable car. We took the cable car up and walked down which we thoroughly recommend. Fabulous views of course. not to be missed,Jun 2019
Norway,Carol C,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Seeing Bergen from the top of Mount Floyen puts the city into perspective. The views are awesome. Also riding up on the funicular is fabulous as well,Aug 2019
Norway,janerogers50,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We had a great 3 hours here. Warm, dry weather. Walked uphill to Brusytten cafe and back. Most of the walk was in forest. Great views of Bergen at top of funicular.
Impressed by runners and cyclists. Even saw some skinny dipping in Revurtjunet lake!",Aug 2019
Norway,Kat S,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,The scenery on mount Floyen was nice and it would be good to take cable car up and walk down the mount! It was a really nice path and it took about an hour only!,Aug 2019

Norway,Molly B,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We took the Fløibanen to the top of Mount Floyen and enjoyed the view. But there is more to Mount Floyen than just the ride in the funicular, which is pretty amazing as well. However, there are quite a few possibilities to hike Mount Floyen, some of the paths are paved, others lead you into adventurous situations and places. After taking a hike to one of the huts on the mountain, we decided to walk back down to the city instead of taking the funicular. I can recommend this version of visiting Mount Floyen.",Aug 2019
Norway,Salaaar,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We had to wait around 45 minutes before we could get on the funicular. The tickets are not expensive with respect to Norwegian standards, single is about 60 krona and return 120 krona. You can walk back down the trail if you wish. The views at top were awesome but a bit too crowded. There is a restaurant and a gift shop but I would not recommend buying anything from there as everything was more than double price. Better to shop from the town down.",Aug 2019
Norway,599Angela,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"I was in line for an hour for the funicular, but the ride was fun and it was a clear day in Bergen so the view from the top is amazing. You have to try to see the view, which is blocked by hundreds of stupid people taking selfies they will never look at again instead of admiring the view! Some cafes and food at the top as well, and gift shops.",Aug 2019
Norway,vietnor2016,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,I advise taking the Funicular but we have previously taken the Funicular and decided to walk this time as we had our dog. Dogs are allowed on the Funicular but it was crowded. It takes an hour + - each way and a nice scenic walk(my photos disappeared). The view is spectacular. It started raining while we were eating outside the restaurant. We had our dog so the staff brought us under cover outside the front door.,Jul 2019
Norway,Nesher2010,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Each time we looked at a long queue to the funicular diminished our desire to use it. We walked in the picturesque streets uphill to the Domkirken and then decided to continue our way to Floyen along a winding streets and roads, amidst a beautiful forest. On the mountain top there is a restaurant, free toilets, a lake with free kayaks, a forest and many paths to hike. After observing the magnificent view of Bergen from 140 m height we walked down back on a different path by Skansemyren stadium.",Aug 2019
Norway,Claudio J,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The view from the mountain is really stunning. There can be a lot of people, but still it is a „must do“ in Bergen. Take the cable car up but walk down, it takes only 45 min and is worth the effort.",Aug 2019

Norway,Brendan Walsh,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,3.0,"We had free tickets and used them. I've been on several in different places. This was fun, but nothing exceptional. We just went up and down. Friends rode up and hiked down and loved it (and they are an older couple)",Aug 2019
Norway,Andy R,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,I personally like to go to places to see an overview of a city and this was a great view of Bergen. It’s £12 for a return ticket for an adult. Easily located near to fishmarket and it’s a service that runs about every 6-10 mins. There’s a cafe and shop at the top and the mountain goats that roam free are a popular stop.,Aug 2019
Norway,Jan Evert P,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,Nice views of the city of Bergen and beyond. Price NOK 125 for return ticket. Be aware of potential qeues (with cruise visitors). You can also buy a single ticket and walk back ca 3 km or 35-45min.,Aug 2019
Norway,AndyP1998,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"And pre book your tickets. Arrived just before 10 and there was a small queue to book tickets, and those with tickets were on the ride within minutes. Came down around 11.15 and the queue to get tickets must have been nearly an hour and even the pre booked ticket queue was long. Having been on many funicular railways, the view here was better than many, even on a partly cloudy day. Walking to the lake probably wasn’t worth it but on the way back you pass the tranquil mountain goats and this was definitely worth it.",Aug 2019
Norway,caroline2,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We went up with the funicular (almost no waiting time to get our tickets) and chose to go down by foot and enjoy the beautiful views. Also at the top there is a superb panoramic view as well as a restaurant with plenty of seating in or out. Worth mentioning; there is a pretty lake nearby not to be missed, very peaceful settings.",Aug 2019

Norway,paulm1002016,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The funicular station was about 10 minutes walk from the ship, or it would have been if we hadn't been distracted by walking around Bryggen, the preserved old Hanseatic warehouses. The change in height at the top of Mount Floyen is amazing; the funicular seems to gain a lot of height very quickly. We had a stroll around, taking note of the goats with their GPS 'electric fence' collars and then back down to Bergen. Stopped at the fish market for a home made ('artisan' to Londoners) moose burger which was delicious and then back to the ship.",Jun 2019
Norway,Linda B,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Of course if the sun is shining, all the better for the magnificent views. The ride up on the funicular is fun and when you get to the top, there is so much to do. There are paths to walk, playgrounds, a lake, troll garden, restaurant, shops. Plan to spend a couple of hours! You can even walk back down to Bergen instead of taking the funicular for more to see. Watch out for the goats!!!",Jul 2019

Norway,LuViPortland,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"There are paths up Bergen's hills, paths that let you look into the communities perched on hills. If you have good walking shoes, take them. The funicular is a good option if the skies are clear.",Aug 2019
Norway,Emil A,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,First you need to buy tickets online. The funicular ride was good. The views from the top were breathtaking.

Norway,Marg D,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,The funicular cable train was the perfect way to see the city of Bergen. It was not expensive and there was lots of places to walk at the top. Lunch and refreshments were available and there were even some friendly goats. The view was superb!,Jun 2019
Norway,DMC454,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Twice during our stay in Bergen we took the funicular to the top of Mount Floyen, with a toddler in a stroller. Tips: buy your ticket online ahead of time to save a bit of money and wait time, and/or get there early to avoid the big line up. There is an elevator inside for wheelchairs and strollers, it's very accessible. At the top, there's a wonderful playground with things for all ages, there's food, there are trails and a forest of carved wooden trolls, there's a walk to a lake with opportunities to take a canoe out for a paddle, there are very tame goats to pat and there's a wonderful view. My almost-three-year-old grand-daughter was very eager to do this outing a second time, it was a wonderful, relaxing afternoon. Another tip: there's a Godt Brod shop right near where you'll be lining up for the funicular, grab a wonderful coffee and/or bun or sandwich to enjoy while you wait.

Norway,Beniamin2014,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,3.0,The funicular is not updated and many of the seats/ benches inside are removed. The top is amazing because you can see the city from the top. Not much you can do on a rainy day! Do recommend it!,Aug 2019

Norway,Nancy2518,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,We loved the funicular and the view of Bergen from the top of the mountain. Unfortunately we did our excursion on a rainy day so we didn’t explore too much. We went into one of the restaurants and the prices were expensive. They have cute things in the souvenir shop! We bought a ski with cups. Lots of fun but try to go on a clearer day with no rain!,Aug 2019
Norway,Lisa R,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"If you just stop at riding the Funicular, then you will miss so much beauty. The hike is not easy but is magical. The Funicular is amazing as it goes straight up the mountain and through the mountain, but the forest is green and rich with color. Don't stop, keep climbing and you will get a real treat!

Norway,TWal1,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The views from Mount Florence over Bergen are special. The funicular ride is efficient and a well-operated service. We took the funicular about mid afternoon under threatening skies that meant that we may not have had a view. We were pleased that we did, and we found that there was plenty of parkland with walking trails to explore. This would have been gorgeous on a sunny day. A cafe anda restaurant are also near the top funicular station so you can easily refuel for the trip down. A fun experience.
Thanks for your vote.",Aug 2019
Norway,niksk001,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Amazing view of Bergen - absolutely marvelous. Weather was nice to us. However, even on a rainy day it is still worth visiting.

Norway,Kathryn L,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"I took the funicular up amount Flöyen on a day of scattered showers, but the views were still amazing. Some earthworks meant there was a bit of a scramble up the hillside to reach the lake, but it was worth it. The walk back down gave stunning vistas at every turn. You could easily spend a day here doing one or more of the hikes, or taking a canoe out on the lake",Aug 2019
Norway,Samantha E,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"We went up mount Fløyen whilst in Bergen on a cruise. There were a couple of boats in and the queue was pretty long for the funicular so we decided to walk up with our teenage daughters. Whilst it is fairly challenging and took us a good hour (stopping to get our breath back and for photos) it was stunning. You got really great views. We had heard that you could get penned in on the funicular and not have a view going up anyway. Had a wander at the top for photos and walked back down. If we weren’t pushed for time would have been great to walk around at the top and this would have been the advantage of taking the tram. Have seen on previous reviews people complaining about the state of the loos. All the people going on the funicular only see the ones at the top of the track. Walkers see the nice loos at the back of the white cafe which you go past on the walk up there! No queues and clean and tidy! Would definitely recommend this for the views alone.

Norway,Fabian C,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Mount Floyen is a great spot in the top of the Mount to see the beautiful city of Bergen and the fjord from the top. However most tourist just get to the top to admire the view.... the is much more to see up there, there are several trails if you are a hiking lover, you can explore the mountain and get lost for hours discovering nature’s greatness",Aug 2019
Norway,Sophie C,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"I got the first tram up this morning as 3 cruise ships were due to come in. It was just me on the viewing platform and an 86 year old local man who walks up a few times a week. Well, that put me to shame.

I was so excited about the stunning panoramic view of Bergen that I dropped my phone over the viewing platform barrier. A wonderful man (with dark hair from a previous Russian province whose name I annoyingly can’t remember) was a saviour and managed to get it back for me. *Thank you* I’d have been so sad to have lost all my holiday pictures!!

Please go. And hold onto your phones.

Norway,IndyKelly,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Ok, you can walk to the top which takes about 40 minutes or you can take the cable car. During the summer, there are always queues so a tip is to pre buy your ticket.

At the top you can go hiking for hours or simply enjoy the views. There are tables and chairs to relax on, a restaurant and an outdoor kiosk serving local sausages and drinks.

Well worth the trip.",Aug 2019
Norway,DrSJ,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Good place to go and see the city of Bergen from top of the mountain. Go to this place at sunset or sunrise as the colour shades are magical. The rope way is good and transports you quickly to the top. Walk down to the city is wonderful, takes about one hour from top to the city centre",Jul 2019
Norway,TokyoTori,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"The funicular is a must activity, if you’d like an overall view of Bergen and it’s seven mountains. The panoramic views are outstanding, that’s for sure.
Plus you have the option of walking down, which we did. Going through the forest was lovely, especially with the giant birch trees along the way.
If the weather isn’t good, then simply ride the funicular back down.",Aug 2019
Norway,Colourqueen,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We attempted to go on the funicular on day 1 of our Bergen stay, but the que was crazy.

So on day 3 we got up early and was in the que by 7:45. Nice short que.......and then came a bus load of people from a cruise ship. Wow didn’t think they’d be up and off the ship so early. Now as they had all prepaid, they went to the prepay que and right up to the front. Fair enough, they’d booked tickets after all.
So to be a bit sneaky, we just got online right there on our phone and purchased tickets...and straight into the shorter queue we went.
But really at that hour of the morning the que is pretty short.

Up the top is the most amazing views, you really shouldn’t miss it. Lovely little walking tracks and a lake about a ten minute walk from where you get off.
Even though we had purchased return tickets, we decided to walk back down to town as it was such a beautiful day.
Good pathways and marked well. An easy stroll about 3.5 klm back to where the funicular started.
Enjoy!

Norway,Cindy Lou,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"Some friends and I heard the walk to the top would be about 45 minutes. We decided to take the funicular to the top and walk down.

At the top was a glorious panoramic view of the city! Amazing for pictures and relaxing after trekking the city.

To my surprise there was more to see up there at the top. There was an area with goats roaming that people were allowed to pet. There was a shop or two selling souvenirs and ice cream. With a bit of a walk, we stumbled upon a lake that made me stop and stare. It was gorgeous.

The walk down wasn’t terribly long but was of course on a bit of an incline. Very small children or the much older should probably take the funicular back down. Everyone else should trek down. It’s a beautiful walk.

Norway,321cameronm,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,Recommend taking the Funicular up the mountain and walking back down to immerse yourself in nature and then the beautiful back streets of Bergen. It’s well worth the trip and we were lucky with our timing; once a cruise ship hits the queues can be awful. Go later in the day or early to avoid the scrum!,Aug 2019
Norway,catherine s,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"A day in port on our cruise. Raining in the morning so waited and luckily the rain stopped so we took the funicular up in the afternoon. If you wish to walk up there are steps located on either side of the funicular station to start the walk. about 45 minutes to one hour ( allow for photo stops!)No queues when we bought our tickets and a lovely 6 minute journey to the top with great views en route. amazing views at the top. Great space. Loads to do when up there - walks , lake, shop and cafe. We took the 3km walk back down we chose the Tippetue route. Really enjoyed it At the start of the walk is the trollskogen the troll forest which as an adult I enjoyed. Walking through beautiful trees which occasionally open up to great view points.Thoroughly enjoyed the walk. Steep in places and slippery after the rain.

At the top there are many walking paths, there is a lake that you can walk around.

Norway,coljpsingh,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Definitely worth your time and a must visit while in this beautiful town of Bergen, Norway. A Funicular rail ride takes you to the top of Mount Floyen within 5 to 6 minutes covering a distance of about 900 Meters, this ride itself is very scenic, more so while coming down. There are 2 cars, each car having capacity of carrying 100 passengers.
This Funicular rail was used by Germans for military purposes during their occupation of Norway at the time of World War II but now it’s being used for tourist purposes only.
The view of the Bergen Town below from the top of Mount Floyen is simply amazing and awesome. Bergen Town and the Fjords look beautiful from the top. This is the most popular tourist destination of Norway.

We didn’t stay for too long at the top since it was raining, but got to enjoy the view a little bit. I’m glad we bought round trip tickets because it would have been a long walk down.",Jul 2019

Norway,TrMarek,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,3.0,We hiked up Floyen which wasn't particularly challenging but I did break a sweat. It took us about 1.5 hours to get to the top. There are some nice vintage wooden homes to appreciate on the bottom before you get to a pretty cool kids park with an awesome slide. The incline is relatively gradual. Have a look to the right before you get to the viewing center. There is a hidden place with bench that has a better view of Bergen. We took the funicular down which costs 65 kroner for adults/25 for kids-one way. It was crazy busy at the bottom so if you're planning on taking the funicular both ways they suggest booking online.,Aug 2019

You can prebook if on a cruise but we didn’t,
Spectacular views of Bergen from the top, you could see cruise ships coming into port.
There is a zip wire at the top but I think you have to pay extra to go on it.
We had a chat with the goats at the top, very tame and would wait for you to take photos.
There are refreshments available at the top if you want any.
Well worth the effort to go up.

Norway,clairann2000,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Bought tickets online, but the bar codes wouldn't work in the machines, so luckily I found a fellow to get us in...we were there when they started running and by the time we came down the line was probably 2 hours because there were four cruise ships in port.
Up top the places to get great photos abound, so take pics then walk to the lake and talk to the goats and enjoy the entire ambiance of the city seen from above.
We walked down and the first part is a very very gentle walk, then a number of paths branch off and we got a bit lost and ended up walking further than we needed to so by the time we navigated a number of steep stairs our knees were really hurting...but the scenery is so pretty coming down, I would do it again, but would map out which way to go before hand. We ran into a local who indicated some paths down were prettier than others and she seemed surprised the path we took was open after some construction...
Either way, this is an absolutely fantastic attraction that provides a stellar vista.

Norway,Bluerhinodoris,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"It was very easy to book funicular tickets from the UK, which eliminated to the need to join a massive queue at the ticket booth. It was busy, but the crowds were well managed - (nothing anyone could do about the Japanese woman, who thought that, despite there being a set number of seats/standing places and the right number of people queueing for them, it was still ok to literally and painfully elbow her way to the front of a queue and cause havoc). It was a short ride, but as not all of our party could have made the walk it was an easy way to make the ascent. It was a bit blowy at the top, but lovely views over the city and docks. We had a coffee before setting off, taking a few pics of the goats, and walking back down. I would say it was an easy downhill walk, good underwood, some steps but some of our party with dodgy knees took advantage of the odd bench for a rest. Pleasant way to spend a few hours in Bergen.

I'm glad we did as it started to get very busy in the queue behind us! The wagons get packed tightly which was not a pleasant experience.

Norway,BlueBadger222,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,We took the funicular up and walked back down. Fantastic views and some great trails to walk around at the top with good facilities. Easiest way to get a ticket is to buy them via the website or app. Tickets come with a QR code you have to scan to get through the barriers to the funicular so you may have to pass a phone around if you buy them all on one device.

Norway,Jason M,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We only visited Bergen for a day on a cruise, an interesting easy 15 minute walk to the Mount Floyen Funicular from the port, even with a wheelchair.

There are 2 queues going up, the one on the left is to buy tickets, and on the right for pre-purchased tickets and groups. The queue was quite long at 9:30am when we went up but much longer when we came back down at 11:40am

Wheelchair users should keep to the left and move forward as there is a lift to take them to the top of the stepped access platform. All easy to access for wheelchair users, there’s another lift at the top station.

The tickets are scanned at barriers which controls the number on each train, when the lights turn red you have to wait for the next car but it’s not too long a wait. The carriages are well packed!

As others have said, beautiful and interesting city, wonderful views from the top (weather permitting) and plenty to do on the mountain if you have the time.

We’ll definitely come back in the not to distant future.

I kind a felt anxious with at least 20 other inside in a small place. The trip takes 4 minutes and goes straight to the cafe. Its good to note that the condole goes every 30minutes and u may have to cueue for the next one. We went to see the sunset and it was beautiful. More nice was to walk from Tromso center to the spot and back, coz we saw local people beautiful homes.

Norway,CarolinaPS7,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"Even if you go for two days to Tromsø you have for sure visit Fjellheisen. It's a must. Really a must.
First of all - and before you go - something very important is to check on the web page if on that day at that hour, wind conditions are good. If are not, on the top of the web page you can find a message that says that due to the conditions they had to cancel the departures.
If all is normal I highly reccommend you to go for the first time walking from the city center through the bridge (if the conditions are good for you) because the view in the bridge is marvellous.
Otherwise you can take the bus 26 from Sjøgata S1 (bus stop) to Fjellheisen. (On this bus stop open your wifi because it has free wifi I don't know if on the bus stop or in the pizza shop - 😉 shhh don't tell anyone).

Once you are in the cable car all is excellent, first world technology of course and while you wait to the departures there is a climatized space that it's very good on winter. (Departures are every half hour).
On the top, views are majestic. And you should experience that on day hours and at night, because both experiences are wonderful and of course, differents. And you should also go with and without snow.
After the views you can drink a capuccino in the restaurant, in my case with cakes (apple and other traditional from Norway).
I encourage the owners of the café/restaurant that not only allow pets in the cable car but also allow stay with pets in the restaurant, under adecuate conditions and even paying for that. I'm pretty sure you can handle that! And would result in a better complete experience.

Norway,Katariina M,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"TLDR: Yes, you should go.

When someone tells they’re going to Tromsø, you tell them to go Fjellheisen. For real, this The Thing in Tromsø. Yes, it costs money (and everything in Norway is expensive for people from everywhere else), but you really should go unless you’re sporty kind of person who joyfully runs to the top anyway.

You should buy your tickets online, it’s 5% cheaper. Walking from hotel area is ok, you get to see Tromsø Bridge at the same time. The lift is gondola and similar to ones at skiing resorts. It’s quick and I think that’s why some people complain about price - but it’s actually to take you from the bottom to the top easily so I don’t consider that as a negative thing. The lift isn’t the main thing on your journey, what is up there is the main thing

From the top station you can hike to the top or just enjoy the views. It’s many ways cooler there than in the town, so make sure you have enough clothes. I think it’d be best to think you’re going hiking - even though you didn’t end up hiking after all. The café is ok and toilets, too. We felt that people in Tromsø are lucky to have that kind of nature so close to town.

We went back a second time and it was worth every second. The scenery was incredible and the views of Tromso amazing. Even though it was very windy and snow being blown everywhere, it was worth taking a long walk along the topside. Beautiful sights all round. We shall definitely be back next year.",Feb 2020
Norway,kris1089,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"I went up fjellheisen twice during my stay in Tromsø in Nov '19.
At the beginning of Nov '19 Tromsø got surprised by an unusual amount of snow for that time of the year. Plus polar night was about to begin on the following days, the sun was already hidden behind the mountains during the days.
This created a wonderful atmosphere: snowcovered Tromsø and scenery plus the change of lights from day to night.
The first time I went up there around noon and spend a few hours walking around and sinking in the snow until it got ""night"" at 4 p.m. In the night Tromsø is even more beautiful. You should definitely come here by night.
The second visit was not planned in advance. Me and some other travellers that I met during a whale safari tour were sitting in a bus retourning from Skjervøy. There were no clouds the whole day, so when checking the nothern lights forecasts they showed some activity, so we decided to go up fjellheisen. When we left the cable car on top of the mountain at 7 p.m. Aurora showed up right away.
And of course fjellheisen is THE hotspot for northern lights in Tromsø. Absolutely amazing.

Unlike many other reviewers I do not think fjellheisen is expensive at all. Yes, Norway is an expensive country, but fjellheisen is not much more expensive than many cable cars in Germany (approx. 23 € up and down). Some cable cars in tourist hotspots as Garmisch-Partenkirchen or Oberstdorf are even more expensive.

The café on top is very 'koselig'. On clear nights when it gets freezing outside you can get some warmth inside and a very sweet and tasty gløgg. If you are lucky and get a place at the windows you can enjoy the fabulous view over Tromsø. The prices are expensive (1 cup of hot chocolate and 1 waffle 10 €), but then again: it's Norway and not specifically that place.

One more tipp:
If you have the time do not take the bus/car from the city center to the cable car station, but have a nice walk (appr. 40 minutes) over Tromsø bridge and along Ishavskatedralen.

Once at the top, there was so much mist or low cloud that it was a complete white-out, couldn't see a thing! We thought we would have lunch and hope the weather would clear, but it seems that in winter the lunch menu is very very limited, really not much more than coffee and cake. Due the poor weather, the queue was long and slow and finding a table (even sharing with others) almost impossible. So really there was nothing to do!

Norway,Sharon T,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"I was on a small-group, singles holiday in Tromsø, and after an included city tour during the day our tour manager offered to take us to the cable car in the evening. It had been a pretty clear day, and we hoped that we might be lucky enough to get a glimpse of the Northern Lights (we didn’t, but were lucky enough to do so at Camp Tamok - see my review). With able assistance from our tour manager, we purchased our return bus tickets (full marks, Tromsø, for the discounted tickets for those aged 67 and over!) and caught the 26 bus to the base of the cable car. It wasn’t busy, and we quickly purchased our return tickets and were soon riding to the top and watching the city from our car.

We ate (I had delicious - Portuguese! - fish soup accompanied by a beer) in the nice cafe with stunning views of the city and its surroundings through the large windows before heading outside to the viewing platform for even better views. It was great to be able to work out where we’d been during the day. It was too dark and icy to explore further at the top, so after a couple of hours and numerous photos we descended and caught the bus back to the city centre.

Nevertheless, we really enjoyed the night views over Tromsø which are pretty with all the lights. We also decided to have dinner at the restaurant and that was good too. We shared the reindeer burger and the reindeer stew which were very tasty, as well as taking the opportunity to have a couple of pints of pilsner from the local Mack brewery. All in all we really enjoyed the experience and spent longer there than we expected.

Norway,Sonia,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"Though it's a bit pricey, in my opinion it's so worth the visit! We can stay as long as we want, wonder around in all the snow, and having a meal in the restaurant they have there. Perfect spot to take incredible pictures if there's a clear and sunny sky! The colours on the day I went were amazing, and it was such a nice weather!!
It is a fast ride up and down, the cable car takes lot's of people at once, but it does not feel discomfortable.
The restaurant is okay price wise, there's some places to sit by the window where you can be gazing at the town...just amazing!
Loved and recommend!!

Norway,Trencherman101,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"We walked to the lower station from our hotel across the Tromsobrua stopping off at the Arctic Cathedral. Luckily the cable car was running and we didn't have to wait long for the ride up. At the top it was blowing a gale and whipping powder snow everywhere. We went out on the observation deck which was a little more sheltered and quickly took some photographs. I ventured out the back but it was very slippy and the wind so strong I quickly came inside again. The cafe was very busy but we managed to get a table and have a coffee before decending and walking back to our hotel. Overall it was a good experience, we would have liked to have been able to walk further at the top. But we were still glad we did it.

Norway,Dj81,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"Finally after 3 attempts the cable car was open, during my stay we had very strong winds so the cable car was closed. You can apparently walk up there?
So make sure you check before walking along icy roads for 50mins to get there.

The views were stunning, you can go onto the platform of go and walk up the mountain, just be careful because it can get very slippery and the safety fence has a gap or two in it.

The restaurant was absolutely rammed when I was there so you could not get a meal because there was nowhere to sit. But from what I heard the food was nice.

So its worth coming here one evening while your here.

The views from the lookout are beautiful! However, be aware that this is not a safe place for small children to run around. The guard rails are low and the lookout is tilted and with snow is slippery.
We had a snow storm coming so the lookout close very quickly and every one was waiting on the queue for the cable car to get down.

On the top there is a quite roomy cafeteria, we did not try any of the dishes but a warm coffee is good when it is cold outside.

The view platform is towards the town and essentials the whole Tromsø Island is visible including the airport on the opposite side. You get a panoramic view of the fjord and the mountains around Tromsø.
The top is a good starting point for hikes higher up, notice that in winter it will be cold and windy as well the weather changes rapidly so you need to be well prepared.

There is also a footpath as an alternative.

Norway,Paresh Chopdekar,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,A must go destination when visiting Tromso as you get unrivalled views of the city during the ride up as well as from the top. Both daytime and nightime views are superb. Would suggest a late afternoon ride up so you get both daytime and nighttime views of the city in one ride. Alternately you can buy the multi-trip ticket option. Just make sure you are prepared as the weather can turn very quickly when you are up.,Feb 2020

We walked there on our first day but it was cloudy. The lady at the ticket office looked at the weather forecast on yr.no (a great app that I now use) and advised a better time to return.

There is a ride every 15 minutes and I guess around 15 people can fit in the car for 10 min ride. What you don't see from below is the chill and snow at the top. You can hike for as much as you want with snow all around and INNER PEACE which is so difficult to find in modern world. Tromso city and surrounding fjords look amazing specifically in evening.

Norway,nutondev,Fjellheisen Tromso,3.0,"I went there at a late evening. It was a cold cold night.

The views start to be breathtaking shortly after the car starts climbing the hill.
There is a ledge, a terrace, where you can set up your tripod and do long exposure shooting. However - the ledge has a wooden floor which was mostly covered with frozen snow, left unshoveled - both surfaces very slippery! Even though the parapet around the ledge is about 1.4m high, just enough to protect you from flipping over it, you can still be concerned about your legs, arms and the equipment in case your feet skids. Although you can see a lot of signs around instructing you to take off your boot spikes, the ledge is a place to actually put them back on for your own safety. I do understand that plowing the snow off in the streets is not really feasible given the amount of snow falling daily, but I don't understand why it cannot be done on this limited area. As a tourist place of interest, this was well below the par.

There is a self-service restaurant, but it doesn't offer too much for those uncomfortable eating reindeer or seafood. Good to take your own snacks if you are picky.

Advice for photo enthusiasts: be prepared and take your gloves! even if the temperature in the city is well above zero, your hands will get frozen after few shots up there in the skies!

Norway,Amanda F,Fjellheisen Tromso,3.0,"Really enjoyed the stunning views over Tromso at night, it is absolutely breathtaking, the cafe is also very good, however the thing that spoilt it for me is the amount of ice on the viewpoint and also when you arrive at the cable car you have to walk up a really really steep hill which is completely covered in ice, it's like a sheet of glass and very slippery,thank goodness I had shoe spikes (even hard work with those) otherwise I would not have even attempted it, witnessed some people have some really nasty falls on the ice so be aware!!

Of course dress appropriately: it’s a mountain in Arctic Circle so cold/ windy etc. Cafe isn’t such a delight as coffee & hot choc from machines and big queues. But just like a big ski resort cafe: don’t expect high quality or cheap and you won’t be disappointed. Can easily walk to Cathedral down snowy streets.

Norway,Marius Alexandru,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"A convenient way to go on top of the hill. For sure in the summer time would be an easy and nice hike, but for the snowy / windy winter times we prefer this.
Going up and down every half an hour from morning ‘till 23:00, easy ticket purchase at the cashier desk or online. The ride itself is very short, once you get up there you will get a very nice view over Tromsø & the fjords. The panoramic platform that you find on the right exit it’s a great spot for taking photos and admiring the landscape. It was pretty crowded, but if you wait a bit you will find your spot to enjoy.
A pretty nice coffee shop also available, with a decent choice of drinks, some sweets and few souvenirs.
It was no Aurora last night when we’ve been up there, but we will return with fingers crossed.
Recommend about 1.5 hours for this activity, and to go at evening as the view is more interesting above the lighted up city than at day time.

It has two bars. When we visited, despite the crowds one bar was closed. In the other bar we queued for nearly thirty minutes only to be told that the kitchen, without warning, had closed. We walked from tromso to the cable car. Then up the mountain, it was freezing and they would not sell us hot food. This was not good. We were cold and hungry in need of hot food. There were no apologies. We had to walk back to tromso for food.

Norway,LivingLovingItaly,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,This cable car is the perfect midday option after late night/early morning northern light chasing. We walked from the downtown Radisson Blu to the cable car. The only spot on the walk that was windy and cold was the middle of the bridge. The ride up is short but the views from top are long. There was enough midday light in the end of January to get some fabulous photos of Norway’s beauty. Yes it’s a bit cool on top but it wasn’t windy. When you return to the base there is an electronic sign to request a taxi back to the downtown area across the bridge.,Jan 2020

Norway,Edgar M,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"This place was perfect to have a good sight of Tromso, we were during January 2020 hunting Auroras, you can take a cab from Tromso and you arrive in 10 minutes, maybe the hardest part is when you finish your visit, no cabs out there! have to walk to Tromso! the place is good but the outside part to walk is a little bit dangerous because you need special boots or ice grips for your boots.",Jan 2020
Norway,Yorkybarkid107,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"If you're staying in Tromso you have to go on the cable car. If you enjoy walking its approx 2 miles from the Centre over the bridge and passed the Cathedral. Buses also run there.

230 Nok return isn't cheap but once up there on a clear day the views are fantastic in all directions.

At busy times the cars run frequently otherwise its every half hour.

There's a cafe at the top which we didn't use.

Beware its bitterly cold at the top we went in January and you couldn't leave your gloves off for more than a few seconds before your fingers were freezing. The snow can be a few feet deep too if you want a little walk away from the cabin.

There's a viewing platform to walk out onto that has a lift for disabled access directly for the car.

It's open late too for potential northern light watching though you'll be very lucky if you see them.

After pics go to the cafe for good food drink service and to get out from the cold as well. I totally recomend the potatoe wedges here, see if you agree?
Tip: we got the 26 bus from Tromso town both ways, stops at bottom of cable car, easy as. Bit weird with ticketing and times those buses. Found the Narvessen staff very informative on this topic, they will keep you right. Enjoy",Jan 2020

Norway,Propaganda_Machine,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"The cable car operates every a regular service and if you get there in good time before each gondola leaves, you shouldn't have a problem getting on with a queue. We took a taxi from the town centre to the lower station and then when we got back, walked to the Arctic Cathedral (reviewed separately on here) before getting a taxi from there back over the bridge into town

The trip up the mountainside is wonderful, with expanding views across the island part of the city the higher you get. At the top there is a cafe but most people are there for the views: you can either walk out either side of the upper station but the best position is from the dedicated viewing platform out through the glass doors. Wrap up warm should be common sense as it will always be windy but if it is not cloudy, you will be rewarded with a lovely panorama.

A definite attraction to visit when in Tromso.

Norway,Aussie252,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"Great experience. We were there in January and the weather shifted around in relatively short timeframes. Only had a small window of light to go, but by the time we got up top clouds have come in. When we purchased our tickets salesperson advised the wind was coming up and they may need to close the cars.
The ride up and down was a great experience. We did not stay long as we had a tour booked and didn’t want to get stuck. Good restaurant facilities available up top.

One downside - the queue to purchase tickets was very long and you are out in the open. If it rains or snows - tough. A tip we later discovered you can pre purchase tickets on line and go straight in to queue inside for the next available cable car. And save 5%.
If you walk there, be aware you need NOK cash to purchase a ticket on the bus (bus 26) if you don’t already have a ticket.
Can highly recommend.

We went in early January when it's only light between around 10:30 and 13:30 and we witnessed the full spectrum of light down in the city and out in the backdrop of mountains.

Despite the city lights and clouds, the Northern lights were still clearly visible. This was a great bonus as we had not been planning to see them up there.
We also had some dinner up there, the only type of burger available was a reindeer burger. This was fairly average as I didn't really like the texture of the reindeer patty, next time I would suggest having dinner in Tromso first instead.
However the view of the northern lights more than made up for the burger ;-)

If this man who was operating the cable car at 11.45 on 21 December doesn’t like his job (or tourists) then he should think about a career change.

The island and bridges, the Cathedral and port are laid out resplendently before you. I guess that you need to be lucky with the weather but if you are fortunate a special treat awaits. There is a great viewing platform to allow some of the best pictures to be had but walk a few metres either side of the cable car station and you can avoid other people and get equally good perspectives. An absolute must if you are fortunate enough to visit Tromsø.

TOP TIP: Don’t be completely seduced by the views in front of you, take a little time to enjoy the mountains behind the cable car station, they are totally gorgeous in the snow.

Giving the impression that we were an incumberance and that they'd rather be somewhere else. One female staff scowled at me when I asked where the cutlery was kept. Whilst I was on the viewing platform, my husband (who was waiting for me to re-enter the building) was accosted by an employee and told to get my wife and leave, as he had decided to close early due to bad weather. Obviously we appreciated the safety reasons behind this and our need to follow instructions, but why did this person then allow other visitors to walk past him and out onto the viewing platform? No announcement was made so that everyone could be informed. He just affronted my husband. My husband confronted this young man and informed him that, although he totally understood the reasons for closing, he had no right to talk to him so rudely. This person refused to give his name, the name of his manager. In my opinion, this person is not a good representative of the company or Tromso. He has no idea how to talk to people and should not be a face of a popular tourist attraction, which relies on the money people like us spend when visiting. To him, and to his scowling colleague....show some respect to people who work hard for the money they spend.

There is a viewing platform, and you can also take a walk out across the top to other locations to look down over Tromso.
Definitely worth it, and I look forward to returning on a clear winter's night to try and glimse the Aurora over the city!",Nov 2019
Norway,Elaine P,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"A must-do for any tourist as you get incredible views across the city and mountains. It’s also possible to hike up (rather you than me!) and there’s a nice restaurant at the top. You can walk out quite far when you reach the top. Word of warning - if you’re travelling in winter, it’s very icy if you go outside, so it’s advisable to take spikes. Also useful if you walk there from the centre of Tromsø like we did - it’s about three miles - as some parts of the pavement/road en route are quite treacherous.",Nov 2019

Norway,EEG,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,Absolutely recommend taking the cable car up to the viewing platform. The cable car schedule is once every half hour so you want to time it right or you’ll be waiting. The views at the top are 1000% worth it. Our group went up just before sunset also we were able to see views in lightness and at dusk which I would also recommend - our pictures were incredible!,Nov 2019
Norway,davrob89,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"We visited this attraction during our recent In Search of Northern lights cruise. We booked our tickets on-line prior to departure (you save 5%). We did catch the bus to the cable car base station - but it would have been easily walkable. The bus does drop you right at the cable car base station though - which did make it easy to find. I think we paid about £13 equivalent for 4 bus tickets, but only ended up using two as we walked back.

We ascended within 5 minutes of reaching the base station as there was no queue.
There are great views of Tromso from the top. We didn't walk too far as there had been recent heavy snow fall. Cafe at the top sold coffee at reasonable price. After descending (again - very little wait) we walked to the cathedral (about 20mins) , then walked back across the bridge (very scenic) into Tromso (about 20mins).

We made our way back to the Tromso city center on foot, among the amazing houses, covered in snow, heading to the Arctic Cathedral. That walk back was as amazing as going up in the cable car. Highly recommend it.",Oct 2019

We took a taxi to the base and enjoyed the trip up the mountain.There is a very pleasant cafe at the top and you can stay as long as you like. We were there during the day and after an hour , came back down and took a taxi back to the ship. There was a hiking group on the ship that rode the car to the top shortly after we got there. They did a hike and with the shortening day , actually came back to the cafe as the day was darkening.
My wife and I enjoyed some excellent views but the hiking group was also able to see the lights o the city below and their photos were beautiful.

Norway,Alan,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"Definitely worth a visit as you get a superb view of Tromsø particularly during winter when the whole area is covered in snow.
You can buy tickets online which work out slightly cheaper that buying at the gate. There is a cafe at the top which is quite reasonable considering the location.
I would recommend having a walk around once you reach the top, don't just stay at the building as you will get better views. Be aware though that the e is only barriers in a few locations and if the wind is strong do not go near the edge. If you visit in winter the car park at the base does get quite icy so make sure you have appropriate footwear and it gets really cold at the top.

The whole experience of being able to look out over the city of Tromso and the surrounding mountains and fjords is absolutely breathtaking. We were frozen solid with the cold but I would do it again in a heartbeat. The viewing platform is a very good place to start, and they have railings and paths marked out along the ridge of the mountain to see everything. If you're willing to do a bit of a hike you can climb further up the mountain, and even with the deep snow in the way the views from up top were even more spectacular. On a clear day you can see for miles around. The little café offers a warm place to get something to eat and drink after you're finished too, which was welcomed for sure. Over all an incredible experience.

Its a quick trip up to the top and well worth it for the views across the town and out to sea.
There area few different viewing areas which I imagine in summer could be very busy but in Oct it was quite quiet. You can walk up the hill a short way or out across to another lookout point before catching the cable car back down.

Norway,Saibal Mitra,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"I've visited Fjellheisen a few times, the last time in October this year. It's a great place to take pictures from. In 2014 I took a panorama picture that's displayed on the English Wikipedia on Tromsø (the second panorama picture displayed there taken during polar night). That panorama picture was compiled out of 150 pictures taken at different exposures to get to a good HDR result.

Fjellheisen has since been renovated, the viewing platform is no longer suitable to take high quality pictures from. The wall is now a bit higher making it necessary to use the tripod extension which is not ideal due to vibrations. I also noted that the platform itself tends to be more prone to vibrations when people walk. None of this is a problem for taking ordinary pictures, but it's something to keep in mind when aiming for perfection.

This time I attempted to take a 3D picture. I took pictures from two positions outside the platform, about 100 meters apart. This large baseline gives a good depth perspective, it also makes the elevation of Tromsø (about 100 meters in the middle) visible. The picture was too large to upload here, but it's included in my profile and also uploaded on flickr (username smitrasmitra) I uploaded here a crop showing Radisson Blu hotel and the library building and a crop showing Tromsø domkirke and the tourist office.

It's a very short hike to the Fjellheisen cable car which is 230 NOK per adult. Even though the cable car is supposed to leave every 30mins, it seems like they can cater additional rides up/down if there are more visitors. The ride up is less than 3 minutes, but the ascent can be quite steep. Would recommend if you rather not hike up the mountain.

We went back down the hill and located a small automated machine that we had to negotiate for a while until we were helped by another man. You also had to buy the amount of time you planned to park there-in advance! This was very irritating and afterward I had to keep an eye on the time since it was also expensive to purchase there and I didn't want to get an expensive fine!

But the view on the top in the evening hours is great.
And if you want to avoid the downhill walk, the cable car seems to operate to 23.00.
The trail to the top is indicated and separates at a certain point offering 2 options.
The longer on (1.7km from that point) is the nicer walk.
The shorter (1km) is mostly a stone stairs trail.",Sep 2019

Now we were extremely lucky and while it started to rain on our way up, The sun came out when we reached the upper station. Not only did we have a great view, we also had rainbows galore!

Less than stellar was the Fjellcafe, where we ordered two reindeer burgers and a Moose burger. Now pricing in Norway is of course different, but for 23 EUR I still believe a better quality could be served and actually both types of burgers were not very well made. The reindeer burgers had a ram-like stench, which should have been countered with a better spicing recipe, the moose burger on the other hand tasted like a neutral meatball.

Norway,gudogn,Fjellheisen Tromso,3.0,"We were planning to walk up to the top of the cable car for the view after we found out there is a 'path' just next to the ticket station so we were quite excited and prepared to walk for at least 1 hour. However, as soon as we got there, we realised the 'path' was not quite possible to walk on and rather , someone should stress that it was indeed a 'track'. The upslope 'track' was more challenging than we have anticipated. According to other comments, we thought there would be a 'proper' walking path that we could walk up, (we are reasonably fit exercise- regularly middle-aged adults), while the track was still able to walk on, it was the overgrown bushes around it that made it impossible. Having rained overnight, it was rather very muddy. On top of that, there were quite a few insects flying to attack us like 'bee sees honey' every step of our way! We had no choice but to abandon this 'walking' idea halfway and were quite disappointed as we were looking forward for a good work out with hopefully breathtaking scenery! Therefore if anyone plans to walk up to the cable car, please take this into consideration.

Anyway, we didn't miss much as that day was too foggy to see even a few blocks away.

If you want the most out of this ride, bring good shoes and some sportier type of clothes, and walk around on the mountain for a few hours. It is a very accessible mountain, and you can walk very far. Also, the mountain is much less crowded than the station café.
A tip for those with strong legs is to walk up the mountain and take Fjellheisen down. Don't forget to look back down every once in a while if you do so!

Norway,Mick1803,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,A trip up to Fjellheisen completes a Tromsø visit. You can walk to the cable car station from town over the big bridge or take bus 26. Once up at Fjellheisen there are hiking options either via the Sherpa stairs down or via not well marked but clear trails up along the ridge towards several viewpoints. Walk higher up I would recommend as the panorama opens up towards South and West. As weather and visibility can change fast take care when walking up from Fjellheisen.,Jul 2019

Norway,Themikanic,Fjellheisen Tromso,3.0,"Like some others who have travelled to Norway as a first world, progressive country I enjoyed the walk to Fjellheisen from our Hurtigruten ferry to join the cable car. The ticket seller was friendly and we paid our fare.

The ride to the top was scenic and we could see all over Tromso. However upon arrival, it was obvious there was no thought given to the hordes of tourists who are walking all over the place on unformed tracks and squashing what little Arctic flora is trying to grow there.

Hey lift operator...how about talking to the City of Tromso and do something about this mess at the top of your ride?

The unformed tracks also means plenty of dirt gets walked in to the cafe area and the toilets are totally inadequate for the numbers of visitors. What appears to be a length of string is not sufficient to stop some overly curious and carefree tourists from venturing close to the edge of the precipice.

The windows all around the place could do with a good clean as well. Guys you're not there just to rake in the $$.

Said that they depart on the half hour but I know that it was more frequent than that, perhaps due to the high season. Was a casual cafe at the top with great views and high prices. Small gift shop. Just fantastic views overlooking the city and fjord plus great mountain views with snow on the opposite side looking away from the fjord. Rough trails that you could hike on to get different views. Children’s playground available. Make sure you go to the viewing area overlooking the fjord adjacent to the cafe. Can take bus 26 to get here from the city center. Bus takes cash only.

Norway,835tim,Fjellheisen Tromso,1.0,"I bought tickets in advance of my visit, to avoid any queue due to cruise ships being in town. Upon arrival there was a large queue but as I had paperwork, with a bar code, I assumed that I didn't need to RE-queue and could simply walk to electronic barriers, shop the bar code, and gain entry. When I tried to do this THE RUDEST MAN IN NORWAY (well done sir, for winning this title!) sped out of the control room and barked 'buy tickets'. When I tried to explain that I had he simply repeated and pointed to the queue.
I therefore had to join the back of the queue and when I got the counter presented my paperwork and a miserable teenager gave me new tickets, without apology or explanation (this was also after a tour guide jumped the whole queue to get 60 tickets for her party!).
The attraction and place is recommended as gives great views and is a must do. JUST DON'T WASTE ANY TIME BUYING TICKETS IN ADVANCE.
Also, make sure you have NOK with you, if travelling by bus (or by a more expensive day pass) as although you can buy a bus ticket in the town using a card there is no machine at the Fjellheisen bus stop to buy a return ticket - and the buses do not take cards. I was left stranded at the stop (after waiting 15 mins) with four 80 year olds and had to get a more expensive taxi back to the town.

But as midnight draws close, more ascended and you must ready for the midnight cable if you don't want to wait as it gets crowded. Surprisingly, there is no public bus going there from the City Centre (maybe I missed something) , but a cab is the best as it can get late returning.

Norway,Daniel R,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"We climbed up the 850 meters.
The trek is well laid out, adequately signposted and the high gradient parts have well laid out steps ( making it safe for the not-so-athletic ones too).
The steps are placed in such a way that the effort to do the slope is not great.
We had done the Midnight Sun Marathon the previous night and so used the well defined cut-out trail rather than the running routes. I saw a couple run up the steps with their dogs!! Hats of to Leena and her dog Chiara who are friendly locals we met on the trek; both of who run the trail 4-5 times a week!!!!

The sceneries are breathtaking. I have posted some photos. At the top are small glaciers which have a path to trek through.

The trail we chose was the 2.5K one and the total height we climbed was 850 meters.

Once you reach the top there is a nice cafeteria, and true to Norwegian cafes we got to slurp some lovely, as always, aromatic smooth Norwegian coffee. There was a choice of Reindeer/Moose burger too. There is plenty of space to sit in the cafe and the walls have large glass panes, this one can continue taking in the mind-boggling scenery of the yonder Tromsø city ( which deceptively looks far away😁).

One can walk /run back. We saw some enthusiastic ones running back, but my wife, daughter and I chose the cable car.

Have a lovely time 👍😁

I was personally rather disappointed with the actual cable car ride itself, as you're crammed in like sardines and, unless you happen to be one of the lucky ones at the front of the queue, which I wasn't, you really don't see anything.
Once at the top, the views are amazing. I remember there being a kind of blizzard when I visited, but weirdly my photos look quite clear. There is a viewing platform, but there're better views further along in my view. It's very icy and slippery, especially right by the metal barrier, and I was surprised that it appeared that part of the barrier was missing at one point. There were people wandering off in different directions in the distance, but there doesn't really seem to be much direction as to where to go, so you kind of have to work it out for yourself. It's possible to walk up rather than taking the cable car, if that seems appealing.

The viewing platform which is off the building at the top offers stunning views, but make sure to walk away from the building to see more of the area around Tromso. The mountains and area behind the viewing platform were beautiful and we even saw some ptarmigan (white birds which were very hard to see in the snow). The building at the top of the mountain also has a nice coffee shop although we didn't eat there on this visit.

Norway,Ingrid Paola,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,I still believe its a bit pricey - but definitely worth the trip if you haven't been there. I wouldnt pay for it if its not on a clear day since the price is all about the view. The cafe up there is expensive so you might want to bring your own snacks.,Mar 2019

Norway,Margi,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"This is absolutely a must do in Tromso. The view is stunning and when it is not cloudy, you can see even further. My recommendation is to check the cable opening hours as it is every 30 minutes. Once you get up you can take a walk around and enjoy the landscape. There is also a restaurant with windows from which you can appreciate the view from the inside, while drinking a cup of tea or eating. If it is cold I recommend to bring proper clothes as it can be very windy and very cold.",Mar 2019
Norway,maryeee,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"We took the cable car up to the top of the mountain. The views were spectacular, would highly recommend. We walked from our Hotel With across the long bridge--there is a walking trail on either side of the bridge and there were several people who walked on it. After we left Fjellheisen, we stopped at the Cathedral but it was closed. The two spots are very close to each other.",Mar 2019
Norway,rmarks1,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"The Cable Car is very efficient and quick - we were up the top of the mountain in only a few minutes. A little pricey for what it is (around £20/210kr for a return) but you do it for the novelty. As we were only in Tromso for 5 days and had a large itinerary of other trips, we couldn't be so fussy with the day we visited Fjellheisen which meant we ended up going during a snow storm! This was a really cool experience, even when the views weren't as great as they are in the clear skies & sunshine.

I'd recommend going when there is better weather as you're able to see more. You will need to wrap up warm in lots of thermals and layers as you can definitely feel the drop in temperature. Not sure if it would be good for young kids as there aren't really any fences at the top of the mountain once you leave the building (I think there's one small wooden gate basically saying to exit it at your own peril)... it's just a sheer drop and if you're in strong winds and bad visibility you could get yourself into trouble.

We didn't stay too long as it was absolutely freezing in the snow storm, I'd say it felt like -5c! I had a quick look at the restaurant and the food up there is also a little pricey - around between 210kr-300kr (£21/£30) for a small meal so would be good for you to take your own snacks and drinks if you plan on being up there a long time.

Norway,Don C,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"The place is easy to be navigated by taking local bus from Scandic Ishavshotel’s nearest bus stop. Local people are able to provide direction also with the help of your google map.

When riding uphill/downhill, make sure to get best spot inside the cable car. The observation platform at the peak provides spectacular view of the entire Tromsø city proper.

The access to the mountainous ice , snow terrain during the month till march are very very good place to take white snowy terrain.

Fjelheisen also offers best cafe bar with best selected food and beverages.

Whilst I was up there we were lucky enough to get a snow cloud pass over. So it went from a clear blue sky, to not being able to see 10 metres and then back to clear all within about 20 minutes.

Norway,SnehAvi,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"This was the first thing we saw after arriving in Tromsø in February during winter time. My younger one, 4.5 years old was little scared at the beginning but enjoyed the ride later on. We took the family package (2 adults and 2 children for 450NOK) which was economical than taking individual tickets. The cable car goes up and down every half an hour. There was no queue at all around 6pm. It wasn't crowded at the top too. We sat at the cafe and enjoyed the view. We also went walking around the top, outside in the snow and were mesmerized by the breathtaking view. The city does look beautiful. We spent around 2 hours here. It was quite cold and better to have good winter gear like boots, hand gloves, winter hats and jackets.

Norway,Brigitte C,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"I am not really one for cable-car rides and I try to get off the beaten track a bit, but I have to say honestly that this is a must-do in Tromso since you can't really get this view of the city anywhere else. So for 210kr per adult you can take the cable car, or you could walk (about 45-50 minutes for those in good shape). Make sure to bring good boots, especially in winter, and you can walk up to the top peak (about 30-40 minutes at a casual pace, less on the way down since you can slide in the snow!)

There are good toilet facilities - One for passengers going up, and more at the top. We did not eat at the café since it was crowded and food was pretty basic. If you want to spend some time walking around at the top and exploring, you will want to budget for at least 2 hours including the wait for the return trip. During peak hours the queues can be 30 minutes or more.

Remember to buy a return ticket for the cable car (unless you're planning to hike). The cable car trip is quite frequent, they run around every 10-15 minutes.
Better to come here before sunset so that you can get the day view, sunset view and night view of the city.
Remember to wear warm clothes as it is MUCH colder up there compared to the city climate.
There's also a cafe on the lookout with quite a diverse options, but it's quite pricey.

I would like to go back and do some hiking in the summer months because I believe there is a lot more to do, but it being very cold and at night we did't particularly spend a lot of time outdoors up at the top.

The cable car is on a timed schedule and only holds so many people. There is a restaurant at the top, but was pretty crowded when we were there with people trying to stay warm and enjoy the views from inside. In the end we had a fun time and enjoyed the cable car and views.

We got the bus up and walked back as buses are every half hour, the walk back is 40 minutes and includes going over the bridge so it’s a pleasant walk. The cable car itself was disappointing, they cram you in a lot and I was expecting a bit of room to walk around and take pictures going up and down; it’s more like being packed into a rush hour tube train and if you’re pushy and a bit lucky you can get to a window; it’s a means of transport up the mountain rather than part of the experience. The cafe is busy and you have a long wait but the hot chocolate and carrot cake is good and worth a visit to warm up after walking around. The views are beautiful and you can see Tromsø from up the mountain and the snow is fresh. Worth a visit for the views and walks at the top of the mountain.

Norway,WinchesterCathedral,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"From the town, this is a 10-minute taxi ride or bus ride. If the weather is nice then this is a 30-minute walk to the base station of the cable car. The walk takes you over the bridge from the island to the mainland and past the Ice Cathedral which is certainly worth a stop and look.

If you are doing this walk, make sure you are good on snow and ice (we went in Feb) and have spikes for your footwear. These are an ABSOLUTE MUST when visiting Tromso in the winter
At 210 NOK round trip per adult (around £20 GBP) this is not a cheap ride and there is a way up on foot and back again if you do not have the cash or you want the exercise.

You can also save 60 Krone (£5.5 GBP ) by walking the trail one way and buying a one-way ticket at 150 Krone for a one-way trip. Be careful though. As noted above unless you’re experienced and have the right gear use the cable car. If you are in two minds, go and speak to the helpful people at the tourism office and get some advice.

The best way to justify a trip is to incorporate this on an afternoon/evening trip (the cable car is often open until 11 PM (but check first). In this way, you can:

1. See the the gorgeous views of Tromso and the surrounding Fijords and take a walk outside.

2. And if you time it right and are also lucky is the Aurora Borealis which is likely to appear over Tromsø. To give you the best chance download an Aurora App. They are pretty good at telling you the chances of seeing it. Certainly a cheaper option than taking a Northern Lights Tour.

There is a cafe at the top of the cable car which reminds me of one of those self serve places that are all over the Alps. The food looked okay. As it is Norway it's not cheap and for me, it was not exactly romantic dining. However, if you can get a table by the window, you could certainly make it so...

Just one more thing. Do not go up there when it is snowing/raining/cloudy/windy as you will see very little and you will not want to or be able to get outside!

Norway,julia m,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"At 210 NOK round trip per adult ($26 each), the cable car is expensive, especially when you also consider the high prices in the café at the top. But you have just two other options: You could skip it, miss seeing the gorgeous views and having a fun hike to the mountain peak, and regret it forever. Or you could save 60 NOK (about $8) by walking the trail one way and buying a one-way ticket (150 NOK) for the other way. Be careful, and don’t hike it unless you’re experienced with the requisite gear, as the snow on the trail can be deep and the wind powerful. Get advice first from the tourism office or one of the outdoors shops before risking it. A final thought: On a clear night, when the Aurora Borealis is likely to appear over Tromsø, the cable car and dinner at the top are cheaper than a guided tour to see the lights.

This is easily done if you are reasonable fit. We are in our 60's and found the walk easy.

The gondola ride itself was well worth the effort of walking across the bridge. Up the mountain though is a whole new world. There is such a huge area to explore. You can just keep on walking higher and higher. And the views over Tromso are amazing. A must do if visiting Tromso.

The cable car take you up or down in almost no time, and allows you to enjoy incredible views of Tromsø and surrounding areas. Totally recommended!",Mar 2019
Norway,DevilMayCriii,Fjellheisen Tromso,3.0,"Take the number 26 bus from town, you can buy a bus ticket via the little shops that are kind of like 7/11s for the bus as it's cheaper that way than buying a ticket direct when you board the bus. If your able you can walk it but it took us about 20 minutes to walk back into town so disability might be an issue.

As for the tram it was nice once up, they cram you in like sardines so you might be lucky and have a view, same goes for the return ride down. But you can get cake and coffee once your up there and there's viewing platforms and a snow trail you can follow when you reach the top so you can get all the pictures you want!

Norway,lizzie53,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"Went as part of a Tromso city tour, with Hurtigruten Cruise. Stunning view just around Winter sunset, from the viewing platform. Drawback - the disabled access entrance was up a steep and icy slope, which was hard to negotiate. On the way back down to the coach, the steps were quite slippery, and there were no handrails. Quite scary even with boots, and pole, as nothing to steady oneself. The car park was poorly gritted and easy to slip and fall. Otherwise, an excellent visit",Feb 2019
Norway,pollyoppy,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,Beautiful views and great walking in deep snow at the top.

The crowds in the cafe has died down by 2 o’clock with seats to enjoy a delicious reindeer burger and hot chocolates.

Norway,OldBill2,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"We went to the Tromso Cable Car as part of P&O organised excursion last week and had a very nice ride up the top of a hill which overlooks Tromso and the fjord. Fortunately we were the first to arrive and I had just managed to take my first lot of photographs when we were hit with a snow storm which certainly curtailed our activities. There's a small cafe in the lookout station which we were able to shelter in to get warmed up as it was freezing outside ! Although the snow subsided it did return within minutes so we called it a day and descended back down again. Very enjoyable and like all things Norwegian expensive at 210 kroner (£20) for those wanting to travel independently. I would definitely go again as I am sure that the views change with whatever the weather throws at you. We had a coach to catch but if your travelling independently you can spend as long as up like at the top. Definitely a must do when in Tromso !

Norway,Cheryl C,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"A perfectly clear day meant only one thing - we have to go up Fjellheisen cable car.
On the 4th February, we woke up to a perfect windless, cloudless day. Raddison Blu booked a taxi (the drivers are so friendly and helpful) and it took us around 10 minutes to get to the cable car. There were around 20 people in the queue for tickets, but it moved really quickly and we found it was cheaper for us to get a family ticket which is usually for 2 adults and 2 children cost NOK 450 as opposed to NOK210 per adult and 100 per child.
It was incredibly cold up there but the views were breathtaking.
The cable car was quick and spacious, not much waiting time at all. We did not eat a meal at the restaurant but did have a hot drink and cake. The restaurant was full and had beautiful views overlooking the city of Tromsø.
If the weather is clear, it is a must go!

We got the number 26 bus from Tromso centre (which was only a few Krone each) and which ran on time - very impressive considering the icy conditions.
Would like to have gone at night but the weather forecast was poor, and sure enough, the snow clouds rolled in and it began to snow as we were leaving, so keep a good eye on the weather!",Feb 2019
Norway,Anne B,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,Great way to get out of the city to experience the beauty of the surroundings without going far. We walked from the city centre (saved the bus fare) and it only took us about half an hour - was nice weather. Cable car a bit expensive over Kr20 but chance to get out on a snowy mountain top.

Norway,Michael K,Fjellheisen Tromso,2.0,"The weather took a turn for the worst when we went up, but having seen friend's pictures and based on what the view would look like on a clear day (I could still see the city), this just isn't worth the time and money. While it was quick to get up, it took an hour to get down... There really isn't anything to see from the hill except the relatively small flat city below. As a last note the lift line is in a cafe so it is super crowded and annoying to wait in.",Feb 2019
Norway,Hayley Beck,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"me and myself arrived in Tromsø for a 7 day stay. In this time we went up the cable car twice, once in the day time and once in the evening.

At the top there is a lovely restaurant with a great view over Tromsø (defiantly the place to have a hot chocolate). You can also go for a lovely walk at the top, although this can be quite hard work in the snow.",Dec 2018
Norway,Fred Foster,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,"Although the timetable says they cable car runs half hourly it was certainly more than this. An easy bus ride to get go it's a must do.

Once the clouds had cleared the views were breathtaking and you get to really see how beautiful Tromso and the surrounding area are.

Fabulous cafe at the top, with brilliant views.

If you are taking children be careful as the edge of the mountain isn't fenced so don't let them run off.

We found out that the night we arrived ( the 31st of January ) we had the best chances to see the lights, so the chance was to go to the top with the cable car. After an almost one hour walk , we got there only half hour before the las drive. At the top, the views of Tromso and the fjords are spectacular, but in the back of the plateau, on the top of the mountain, we really had the most fabulous experience; the Aurora Borealis showed exactly when we stepped out there.... and it continued for 30 minutes, the time we were allowed to spend until the last ride down.

A lot of the artifacts were taken for repair when I was there (right after it reopened post COVID), and from what I understand, won’t be back for some time.

Large archway-shaped rooms made of stone and painted white allow the stunning ships to be the absolute focus of the space and give an almost cave-like experience. They also lend themselves to the beautiful movie about the history of the artifacts, which is projected on the walls and ceiling. The ships and artifacts themselves are incredible - it's almost unbelievable that they have been preserved so well, the details in the wood carvings in particular are fantastic.

This was probably my favourite museum in Oslo and definitely worth visiting, rainy day or not.

So, it was so nice to enter on a early Saturday. We're all alone, except for a father with his little kid. It was so silent and so amazing. The view-sites over the ships. The way you got so close and could see them. It is out of this world. The way you see the wood, the carvings and everything.

What is also worthwile in the museum is to sit down and see the virtual video, which is playing on two walls and the roof. Its like a ten-minute movie showing the life of the life of the boats and the Vikings using it.

If your a history buff and want to see something magnificient. This is your place. Its not to big. Its two boats and they well kept. Considering how old they are, its really a special to be preserved that way.

One hour is more than enough time here. Than, you go to other museums nearby.

Norway,Matt L,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"We actually took a boat from Plac Rådhusplassen to Bygdøy with our 5 year old and 1 year old. It was a really cool way to get to Bygdøy and beautiful scenery along the way. It was a bit of a walk from the pier to the museum but not unpleasant. The museum is fairly small, but really packed with amazing artifacts. The ships themselves were worth the price of admission alone, but the multimedia show was great and all of the details were highly engrossing. I could have stayed for a few hours but the kids were probably only good for about an hour, including souvenir shopping so keep that in mind if traveling with young ones. Due to other time constraints we were not able to see anything else on Bygdøy, but the other sites added to the Viking Museum would have made a perfect day. Check opening times for all eating establishments if you plan on purchasing food while there. Everywhere we checked was closed on that particular day (Monday). Overall, highly recommended!

Norway,Ylenia A,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"If you are a fan of archeological discoveries, I think this is one for you. The burial ships (bearing in mind they are made of wood) are very well preserved and the items of everyday life, clothing and jewellery are amazingly well preserved if you count their age. The craftmanship of the vikings is stunning: the bed headstand, the shoes, the sledges, the pieces of old tapestry (I imagine) are beautiful. An hour is about right to go around and discover what the museum has to offer (which give you enough time to catch the next bus back into the city). Tip: get the ticket that includes the historical museum and do those in one day, but go early!

Norway,EmeraldDiva,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"Wow, what amazing ships and what a fabulous museum! It is wonderful to be so close to history, to be able to walk around and see these beauties up close. The little balconies are a great idea and allow you to also view the ships from above, so you can view both the exteriors and interiors. The little film runs every 15 mins and is projected on the walls and vaulted ceiling and is very good. At the back of the museum are displays of the many goods found in the burials, all beautifully displayed. There is a lot of information here, much to be learned. In February it was not very busy and it is very easy to get to by bus. A thoroughly brilliant experience!

In the museum you can see 3 oak Viking boats found in archaeological excavations (boat from Oseberg, boat from Gokstad and boat from Tune). All three were part of burials containing rich grave gifts. In addition to the boats themselves, two of which have been successfully reconstructed, the exhibition presents numerous artifacts from grave mounds, including artfully carved animal heads, sleighs, carts, armaments, fabric remnants.

Norway,Ray D,Viking Ship Museum,2.0,"Maybe I’m lucky (possibly even spoilt) being from the UK, having so many truly amazing museums to visit and most of the time being free to visit, but I found this museum to be quite dull. This was Oslo’s attempt at giving us an idea into life of the Vikings when in actual fact it’s just an exhibit of a few ships that were dug up.

There should be more info on the vikings as people and their way of life but I went away knowing very little as there’s just not enough information to find it stimulating.

It may seem like I’m being harsh but considering the price you pay to get in for something i was able to walk around and read every information card in 35 mins I felt a bit ripped-off. The projection they show is okay but I think it only shows to be a highlight on the backdrop of the rest being quite dull. Sorry!

Very well documented signage, short film, many displays,including artifacts. Originally found in 1000 fragments, it took years (40-50 years) to reconstruct it. We spent almost an hour there because we explored everything but a shorted visit would be adequate to view the ship. The small ferry from Oslo to Bygdoy is a 20 minute ride, fun. Buy your tickets at the nearby office. '

I wish that we had allowed a full day to explore all the museums. The folk village is amazing and its docents in vintage dress know their history well, including daily details of those who lived or worked in the buildings. We spent 2 hours in the village and knew that we should planned more time for it. . .

The history was fascinating and many detailed information boards - quite crowded on day we were there so sometimes reading information and seeing exhibits was restricted, particularly for children. Comparing it with similar museums elsewhere in the world, as a retired teacher, I could see ways to make the information (& museum in general) more engaging for younger children - many also fascinated by Viking history of course. From this museum we then walked onto the Folk Museum with a replica of old town so lots of walking around which was also pleasant on the sunny day we visited. The walk there & back to the ferry takes you through some interesting suburban streets (most quite affluent), so looking at the design of the local houses in this established area was worth a few detours if you have the time/similar interest in local housing/architecture?

Norway,HerbertEdgewood,Viking Ship Museum,3.0,"‘Ello chaps! Viking Ship Museum in Oslo is exactly that and all that. A Viking Ship museum, nothing more, nothing less. It’s known for the display of the Oseberg ship, excavated from the largest ship burial in the world. There is a small gift shop, and is accessibly by public bus, and a short walk from the near by Norwegian Folk Museum. I would not recommend venturing out of your way solely for the Viking Ship Museum, but it’s fine for a quick add on if you’ve got a tourist package deal and plan to visit the Norwegian Folk Museum anyway. It takes 30 minutes at most of your time. NOTE: Bags are NOT allowed inside the museum, however they do have FREE storage lockers outside for your convenience. There’s also a small outdoor coffee and ice cream stand. Overall I give the Viking Ship museum two stars out of five.

We booked the 4 hour tour which included Holmenkollen, Vigeland Installation, Viking museum and Fram museum with Kontiki.
It was so awesome we added on an extra hour.
A must —felt like we packed in so much and really saw a lot of city.
Incredible detail from guide re: history of skiing, history of German occupation of Norway in WWII, history of sculptor Vigeland and the incredible Fram museum/boat and all of the scientists and Norwegian voyagers to Arctic circle and Antarctica.

Norway,Kelsey S,Viking Ship Museum,4.0,"The one thing my mother and I wanted to make sure we experienced in Oslo was the Vikingskiphuset and we were not disappointed.

This was one of three attractions open normal hours during Christmas, which was greatly appreciated. Definitely a memorable Christmas for us both.

The ability to be so close to so much history was amazing! Most of the artifacts I have seen of similar age felt further away and less accessible.

This is a small museum, only four “wings” so it only takes an hour and a half to get through. It’s about a five minute walk from the folk museum, so if they are both open you can make a day of it!

I’m giving this 4/5 because there wasn’t a bathroom which was noticeable after my morning coffee.

Norway,TbT,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"This is one of my all-time favorite attractions, anywhere. I have been to it three times - twice last May & once this past June. My first visit last year was cut short since the Royals would be hosting an event there (my ticket was 50% off). And, unknown to me, our tour the next day stopped there for a more thorough visit. The musuem presents a short, mostly animated, free film that manages to communicate informtation on the building, use & finding of these ships with no words at all, in any language. It is small - barely big enough to display its three, stunningly preserved ships. The building has a charm of its own - it feels like an oldish, stuccoed church. Rumor has it, the museum is to be replaced or rennovated. Outside there was an interesting memorial to the Ingstads, the couple who finally & definitively proved the Norse were in North America more than 500 years before Columbus.

Norway,Klaudia_Karpinska,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"The Viking Ship Museum is a wonderful museum with extraordinary and impressive collections of well-known Viking Age finds. In nice interior are exhibited three ships discovered in different mounds, in turn Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune. Moreover, in one room are presented elaborated and richly decorated artefacts from these graves (e.g. beautiful sledges, cart, bronze mounts). What is interesting, in several places in this museum can be seen interesting films concerning research on Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune.

The Viking Ship Museum is in the beautiful neighbourhood on Bygdøy. It can be reached by buses or ferry.

In my opinion, this museum is definitely worth a visit!

Norway,Aussie135,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"I was on a cruise ship touring Norway and I wanted to see the ships museum. You pass the Viking ship museum on the way to the Fram and Kon-Tiki museums ( both highly recommended). This is a show and tell museum with little interactive material . however, it is an easy museum for a wheel chair to get around.

The museum is very plain and simple but it allows the beautifully preserved Osebergh ship to dominate. This ship was found practically intact in blue clay which preserved it without degradation. The ship was the ferrari of her day and it turned out she was owned by an immensely wealthy 70 year old Viking woman and it was used as her funeral ship.

When in use the ship would have had lambswool sails - the lanolin in the lambswool provided waterproofing for the sails. the ships were light and fast and could be carried across land when needed or taken out of the water and used for shelter. they were highly maneuverable.

The skeleton of the owner and her female companion are on show and the old lady died of cancer. Her grave goods include sleds, carts, silk and woollen clothes and kitchen and dining goods. Some of the woods are beautifully engraved .

there are two other ships on show but they are not in such a good state of preservation but still worth seeing. there is a little film show which is very entertaining and informative and well worth watching.

this museum gives a good insight into viking times and is most enjoyable for those that appreciate history, those without an interest in history might find it too dull for their tastes. Like many people I have viking ancestry so I was fascinated by all the artifacts and the way of life they showed. It is clear that my ancestors were ingenious and great traders.

There is a shop at the entrance . Highly recommended if you like history

The ships are amazing! Fully restored and much of them are original. The stories behind the ships and the recovery are so interesting.

After the Viking Ship Museum I would walk to the Fram Museum which is a short walk away.

It's small with just a few displays, but these are incredible ships and the place is well laid out with a good level of detail for those like me (do not like to read too much and keep a museam visit short and engaging). Plus it's a great little trip - hop on the ferry to Bygdoy, walk up to the museum and after follow to the other ferry stop and stop for a drink in the cafe before heading back!

We popped into the Historical Museum the following day (ticket provides access to both for 48 hours) which had some interesting displays - I wouldn't pay to just go here, but was fine for a stop off.

Norway,Lucy,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"I've been to the Vikinghsip museum a lot of times over the years.
This museum is an absolute 'must do' if you are visiting Oslo. It is in Bygdøy (so near a few other mseums at the moment) and there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world.
There are currently 3 ships in the museum along with a lot of other superb artefacts.
They sometimes do events in the evenings and I recommend going to one if you get the chance as they have some awesome things like videos projecting on the ceiling.
The museum has finally be granted permission and funding to modernise so it will be expanding and the new plans look incredible. At the moment the ships are housed in a building which was designed for them about 100 years ago so it's really interesting but doesn't have any of the interactive type things you find in newer museums now.

There is still a danger the ships will soon degrade beyond repair and collapse due to some of the original preservation techniques causing long term damage, so I would definitely prioritise seeing them if you are on the fence.

There are balconies dotted about so that you can see into the ship and displays of all the grave goods that were found on the ship. The quality of the goods, how well they've been preserved, is truly wonderful. This museum is a must see in Oslo; how can you visit Norway and not learn about the Vikings! The museum is located on the Bygdoy peninsula along with several other museums (I also recommend the Fram Museum and the Folk Museum) so if you plan to visit several be sure to buy the Oslo Pass as it works out to be very good value rather than paying separate entrance fees to each museum.

Norway,Myfanwy N,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"From the ferry ride across the deep blue waters to the museum itself, this was the most gratifying experience of my few days in Oslo.

It's just incredible to be so close to these massive and beautifully-carved boats, which look as if they could have been built and given a final polish just yesterday. As you walk further in to the small building, you also see many artefacts that were also discovered in the boats - from a dog collar to a pair of shoes. I came away feeling as if there was no distance between myself and our ancient ancestors. The museum is thoughtfully arranged, with viewing platforms to help you see into the boats. I understand there are plans to move to larger premises soon: I hope they don't lose the intimacy that made this visit so special. It's just the right size to avoid 'wow' fatigue.

One tip - read the signs to get a full understanding of what you're seeing and why it is so remarkable.

The three Viking ships on display will give you a good perspective on what it must have been like to cross the Atlantic in an open boat 1,000 years ago. Be prepared for crowds, since this is on the bus circuit. Not that easy to get to unless you are brave enough to take the bus, but the bus is easy if you get an Oslo pass. The pass will cover the bus, the museum, the ferry ride back to town, and several other museums. The pass is not really cost effective, but it does make things convenient, which is worth a lot. You will have to stash your pack in a free locker. The whole visit should not take more than 30 minutes.

The ships were grave ships excavated from mud. They are so impressive and their physical housing here allows visitors to view them from many angles.
But what stays in the memory, isn't the ships. It's the hoard of artefacts and treasures buried with the three women found on them. The skill and craftsmanship of the domestic items, chests, jewellery, metallwork and carved heads displayed here is simply staggering.
The film projection on the walls of a side hall is all the more effective for having no commentary.

Norway,Olivia,Viking Ship Museum,4.0,"I live in Oslo and have visited this museum in several ocasions. It is small but you get the feeling you are in a sort of holly place. The boats are impressive. You dive into history and your imagination go wild.

I have not done a guided tour here, but I would. Museums get much more interesting when someone tells you their stories. This museum is also very small. Nice if you just want to see the ships, are impatient or do not have a lot of time.

You can combine a trip here with a visit to next door’s Folkemuseum, Fram, Kontiki or with a walk around in the lovely peninsula. The latter you do by taking the bus 30 to its end station. From there you can walk down to the beach (Huk) and then all the way back to Skøyen, if you want to go for a longer and very Norwegian nature walk.

There are several lovely walk options from the bus stop. From Huk, take the parth to the right when you are facing the water. Multiple options from there. There is a bigger path in the woods closer to the water, one into the woods and smaller ones even closer to the water. It takes about an hour to walk to Skøyen or to one of the bus stops leading to the city.

Skøyen is slightly boring, but it is a good place to grab a coffe. Here you find a Starbucks, several other lovely cafés and a few food stores, all in one street. From here you can take the train, bus or tram to the city, or to several other places since it is a hub.

Norway,ToniN705,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"We took a ferry from the mainland of Oslo and went across the bay. About a 10-minute walk through a lovely neighborhood, we found this museum. First thing I noticed was everyone taking off their large backpacks and oversized bags and placing them in complimentary lockers out front. But, if you have a small purse or bag, you are able to bring it into the museum.

The first object you bump into upon entering the building is the largest, most intact Viking ship of the three (really, 2.5). The Gokstad Ship was built around 890AD and was astounding to behold. The museum has a lovely app that you can download on free wifi so you can listen to the descriptions of each ship, ranging from how it was built to who was buried with it.

There is a brief video that, without words, shows the life of the Vikings (minus the gore) and what they did with their ships when they were retired (usually became a burial object for prominent Vikings). The area where they show the video is in the hall with the less intact Viking ship. There are portable chairs that you can rest in while watching the movie, and it's kind of neat to sit and watch while in the presence of an actual ship (the Tune Ship, built in 910 AD and excavated in 1867).

I could have stayed and awed at the age of these beauties for much longer, but the museum closed at 5 pm. It was truly amazing to see these vessels and world history with my own eyes!

It is true that there are “only” three ships and one was badly damaged. But imagining the workmanship that went into creating these ships, by hand, and that they were seaworthy blew me away. Much like the Egyptians who buried people with all necessary items for afterlife, so did the Vikings. The ships were used as burial tombs and were full of tools, furniture, sleighs, sewing equipment etc. These objects are also on display and the craftsmanship was unbelievable. They were also not replicas of artifact but were the actual artifact which I really appreciated.

Signage was in both Norwegian and English. We easily spent two hours here. Bathrooms are in the museum basement, free lockers are provided for large bags, the number 30 bus drops you off at the museum and there is also a modest outdoor coffee stand.

The facility is still an extremely impressive museum. The only regret I have was losing a beautiful large Viking ship poster I had purchased. I left it on a train ride back to Germany.

Taking my wife to see the Viking museum was a treat. We took the ferry over from the Oslo harbor known as “Aker Brygge.” It is a short comfortable ride. We then walked up along this road to the unpretentious Viking museum. You will see plenty of tour busses outside.

Going inside and seeing these huge Viking ships is an awesome experience. The Oseberg ship, found in 1913, is the largest known burial ship in the world. The Oseberg ship was placed in a large hall in 1926. More halls were added later when other ships were found.

There is a second story platform you can take some outstanding photographs. Not even the Roskilde Viking museum can compare to this museum in Oslo.

There are two Viking ships that date back to the 9th and 10th century. Alongside are artifacts that have been found relating to these seafarers. An ornamental horse cart is truly impressive too. The film that is shown hourly could be updated.

Not far along the walking route is the famous “Kon-Tiki” museum. We knew about Thor Heyerdahl famous journey across the Pacific. We didn’t know that he made six other journeys in his life-time. Seeing the actual balsa made boat was indeed impressive.

It is amazing they used these ships to tour around the world exploring new territory! I would recommend spending an hour or so and watch the video display they do on the wall every 20 minutes or so.

Norway,irawine,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,My wife and I recently visited the Viking Ship Museum and absolutely loved it. Museum designers did a wonderful job in creating a physical space that enhances all of the history contained in the museum. Not only is there a collection of original viking ships but there is also a collection of various artifacts from the viking era. This is a very worthwhile experience and a must for travelers to Oslo.,Jul 2019
Norway,George T,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,The Viking Ship Museum has always been a remarkable experience - steeped in the near mythic Viking history. The museum is church-like in form and function. The best part is that it is not static. The exhibits continue to get better and better as the research and the technology to communicate it to the public evolve. The Museum is only a moderate walk from the From Museum and the Norwegian Maritime Museum - you can follow a good thousand years of seafaring culture in a day.,Sep 2019

There was a dramatic video clip demonstrating viking life- very well done! Other artifacts were on display but the ships were the highlight. Easy to get to this museum via ferry.

Norway,Doc_Cody,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"We visited this museum as part of a longer tour - spending about an hour. The highlights are the three Viking ships - two of which we very well preserved. There were also many artifacts on display - items found with the ships, which were used for burials. The Vikings, like ancient Egyptians, believed that the dead needed to bring things with them to use in the afterlife. So, there were clothes, tools, ornaments, and many other items. There were even portions of skeletons for three of the people who were buried with the ships. There was a short video projected on the walls and ceilings of one of the alcoves that housed a ship.

This was a nice trip and was pretty cheap in comparison to everywhere else. 750 krone return each. The crossing was nice and offered nice views. The museum is a short walk from where the boat drops you off. 100 krone each is the entry fee which again isn't too expensive, especially as this also gets you entry into the history museum back in Oslo. This means that it's technically 50 krone each for each museum!! Although the viking boat museum isn't massive, it's very impressive.",Sep 2019

There are steps on the corners of the cross shaped building where you can get a better view from above the boats to see the innards. The cart and sleds from the main ship are exquisitely carved. I particularly liked a piece that looked like wood with ""buttons"" carved onto it. One is a mouse. Such tiny details from around 1000 years ago - amazing!",Aug 2019

The museum also features several artifacts that were found with the ships that were included in the burial. Overall, we felt it was a bit overpriced for the time we spent there.

Do catch the video/movie (all be it diplomatically handles what the vikings actually did) its well put together and interesting - plus an experience in itself.

Give yourself time to wander the other relics part of this museum don't just do the ships - there are lots of interesting other times well worth checking out.

Very interesting 1000 year old burial ships.

I am guessing this is the only place you can see mostly intact, original Viking longboats. They were incredible. Some explanation of how they found the ships, and who were buried in them.

These were former sea going vessels which had been buried like a huge coffin with everything the deceased would need for the next life. That is why they were so intact.

This museum continues to amaze me. The cultural history of the ancient Vikings is extremely fascinating. I do believe a number of artifacts have been added since my first visit. Not only do they have three actual centuries old ships, they also have sleds, wagons, funeral structures, tapestry remnants, jewelry and much more. If you go, be sure to watch the video projected on the back wall above one of the ships. They have a great gift shop as well. Also, most people miss going upstairs to view more exhibits and an additional educational video. Well worth the small fee they charge to enter. The only drawback for us, was that there were three tour buses here filled with people. This caused quite a bit of crowding and a greater wait time to see some of the exhibits. Try to avoid visiting when tour buses are in the parking lot if possible. We arrived by rental car and there is a pay parking lot in back.

Norway,WeDreamOfTravel,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"If you like history, old ships, or the Vikings, you will enjoy this museum. Our hotel reception lady suggested this visit, and we're so glad she did.

There is a short ferry from Oslo's main harbor and it doesn't cost a great deal of money for the short ride across the harbor. Once on the other shore, you're close to the museum and going back in time about 1,000 years. It blew us away that the ships and artifacts were so beautifully preserved through the ages. The details, craftsmanship, and extraordinarily small size for their purpose were captivating.

Visits don't need to be long; we saw everything in a little over an hour without rushing. There is a short film about the Vikings, then you're off to explore the ships and artifacts at your leisure. Definitely worth the time and entrance fee, these ships are much better-preserved than the ones we had seen earlier on the vacation in a Viking Ship museum outside of Copenhagen.

At regular intervals an nice animation show is projected on the walls and the ceiling of the room where one of the ships in on display. Compared to the Vasa Museum in Stockholm we visited last year, this museum is far less informative, unorganised and rather dull. On the other side, it's not too expensive and good for spending some time when the weather is bad in Oslo. We understood that a major upgrade is going to take place the next few years, that would be great.

Norway,lobstaluva,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"This museum is not as spectacular as the one in Stockholm, but it is still worth a visit. Three burial ships found in the Norwegian fjords in the late 19th and early 20th centuries have been excavated and laboriously restored. They were seafaring ships before they became burial ships.

The “Tune” ship is from 900 AD and is of oak. We actually watched men working on one of the ships. There are also buckets, beds, sledges, a horse cart, and other beautifully carved wooden items, and some artifacts from the Viking era. An excellent film explains Viking life. There is a cafe and gift shop. Your ticket entitles you to visit the Historical Museum within 48 hours, so two for the price of one is a good deal!!

One could spend there less than an hour (including watching a very well made movie on the Vikings history) and leave the premises with quite a good understanding on what Vikings have done in the past.

Four open ships dating back as far as the 9th century on display; the largest and best preserved was a Queen's burial boat and is fascinating to see all that was in it. Well worth it.,Jun 2019
Norway,coljpsingh,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"Viking ship museum in Oslo is one of its kind, it houses some burial ships of Vikings era, these ships are real ocean going ships which were restored with lots of efforts over many years of hard work. These ships and other pieces of arts are very well presented.
This museum is open 7 days of the week. At the entrance of the museum there is a map depicting the journey of the Vikings to various parts of the world more than 1000 years ago. Vikings were from Sweden, Norway and Denmark, they were very adventurous and brave people, they set out to conquer half of the Northern part of the world in their sturdy Viking boats. They went as far as Canada and America across the Atlantic in these boats. Surprisingly even the Viking women went along with their men. Vikings raided places like Iceland, Russia, Turkey, Greenland etc and conquered these far off places.
A short movie on the journey and exploits of the Vikings is also screened at regular intervals inside the museum. It transports to you a bygone era and is very fascinating.
While in Oslo, a visit to this museum is highly recommended.

Surrounding areas had intricate objects such as ship's prow heads, with delicate wooden carving, in glass cases. Various halls off the main area held film shows and display cabinets of old remains of Viking life.
Outside there was a ubiquitous café with outdoor seating, plus tourist trinkets stall. The place was busy with many visitors mostly taking pictures, freely allowed inside the museum.
Large back packs had to be stowed in lockers out by the café. Entrance was by ticket machine using cards.

It is the only museum in Oslo that opens at 9 am and you can visit it for free with an Oslo Pass.

We reached the museum with the ferry from Radhusbrygge pier number 3 to the museum Island, first stop : Dronningen. This ferry is also for free with the Oslo Pass. From the Dronningen stop it is about 700 meter walking distance to the museum.
Or you can take bus 30 from downtown, which stops in front of the museum.

The museum contains 3 large Viking ships, and 2 smaller barges, that were found in 3 different burial mounds.
After their service as seagoing ships, the ships were hauled inland, and used as burial chambers for important chiefs or women together with their horses, dogs and in 1 instance a peacock.

The ships also contained a large array of burial goods such as sleds, wagons, sculpted animal heads used as bowsprits, weapons, jewelry, fabrics, etc.

The interesting explanations are in English, German and Norvegian.
There are viewing balconies so you can see the ships from another perspective, and there is a short film too. A small giftshop is situated near the entrance.

Depending on how thorough you want to read everything, you need about an hour or so to visit the museum.

Many in their reviews complained about summer crowds but we did not find the crowds unmanageable at all. We were able to take many excellent photos and thoroughly enjoyed this museum!

Norway,peggyhiuwai,Viking Ship Museum,2.0,"The museum itself is awesome. However, at the entrance I was stopped by the security guard at the entrance. He claimed that my backpack was too big and must be stored in the locker. I asked if I could place it in the front like when I visited the other museums but he rejected. It was an embarrassing moment for me as my husband was in the front in the crowd and I could not contact him (I am a tourist and I did not have a phone card which allowed me to instantly call someone). I requested to contact my husband first and put my bag in the locker but the security requested me to call even I explained to him. Luckily my husband came back to look for me or else I would not know how much time I had to spend on locating my husband.

This has been unpleasant to me. This severely reduced my visit time as I was on a packaged tour. Adding to it, I saw many tourists with a backpack even larger than mine, indeed my husband included who had been allowed to enter the museum before I was stopped. I have a feeling that I was treated unfairly. I have no objection on requesting big bags to be placed in lockers but I hope to see fair treatments to every single visitor.

Norway,pincheck,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"At first, the museum seemed quite tiny and I was concerned I might be disappointed, but the museum is cleverly laid out, with a lot more on offer than what immediately meets your eye as you enter. Two of the three ships on display are highly impressive restorations of Viking ocean-going vessels, over 1000 years old. The third one, though in a poorer state, is treated more like part of a 3D experience, while a wordless film is projected above it, depicting what it might have been like to live as a Viking.
Other than the three ships, there is a diverse collection of objects found on the ships during the excavation which had been partially preserved. It really was amazing to think how old these artefacts were and how incredible that any of them had survived at all.
On a practical note, you aren’t able to take in bags any larger than a handbag and you’re asked to place everything else in a locker free of charge outside the main entrance. The entry fee of 100NOK seemed quite reasonable for the ship museum itself, but this in fact also includes entry to the Historical Museum near the city centre within 48 hours of your visit. (If you’re into Viking history, like me, there’s a lovely new collection of artefacts at this second museum too, with an entire new Viking age museum due to open in 2020, I believe.)

Norway,InsideScooper,Viking Ship Museum,2.0,"I’m sorry but I have to rate our experience as Poor because the crowd when we were there was way beyond the capacity of the building. At least 6 tour buses were parked outside. We were there at 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon in July. Ventilation was also inadequate so that the air inside was very hot and almost unbreathable.

The Viking ships were interesting to look at and were surprisingly small considering the distance they traveled.

If you want to go, be sure to go during an off peak time.

For those buying tickets online, note that online sales close a day before the trip. If tickets are needed nonetheless, head down to the tourist office as they keep some tickets for counter sales. Price does not differ much.",Jun 2019

A lovely modern boat, purpose designed to make the most of this experience, lots of viewing deck space accompanied by warm enclosed cabins if the weather is inclement. The Pulpit Rock has its own story and is magnificent to see from below, I might just climb up there one day! Our cruise included a stop for waffles, sour cream and jam at one of the most inaccessible places on the fjord, great fun! The scenery is simply stunning, totally off the scale in any language. If you only have a short day in Stavanger and want to see the fjords then take this trip. Everything is weather dependent everywhere so be prepared for that, otherwise, just enjoy.

Norway,Norris A,Lysefjord,4.0,"Visiting beautiful Stavanger for a few hours via cruise ship and an excursion that appealed was a boat trip to Lysefjord. That sounded like and would prove to be a great photo opportunity and a chance to see a landscape that we don't see in Chicago (trust me I have looked).

It was drizzling softly as we walked from our 3,000 passenger ship along the harbor to board our much smaller sleek boat. Seating was downstairs in comfort and we managed to get a window seat. The rain made visibility poor however and not photo worthy.

There was a very informative Norwegian guide giving narration to what we were seeing as we sped from the harbor to the Fjord. I went up to the open deck to take the photos you will see. For a while a pause in the rain made this enjoyable but once in the fjord where we would go up very close to the chasms that break the rock wall the rain was back. Of course by now the deck I had to myself was full of people from below. I had to keep my spot by the railing so going inside to dry off was out of the question. Luckily I had a camera that is weather-sealed as it was getting soaked.

Pulpit rock seen through rain, neck craning skyward for a view, as rainwater ran from my hair (normally soft and manageable, now like a clinging shower curtain) into my eyes. Conditions worsened when we came to the massive waterfall soon after. The boat was just out of the waterfall's plunge to the sea but I took the spray in my face to get my shots. It was exhilarating to experience the force of the waterfall and to taste it and wash my hair with it. The camera kept on ticking!

Once away from the waterfall and on calmer water we headed for our only stop on the 3 hour cruise-a half hour break on land for coffee and Norwegian waffles. I only used the stop as a chance to smoke a cigarette by the still waters while admiring the view, holding a coffee in one hand and an umbrella in the other. To take pics I had to set the umbrella down on the beach. My partner didn't enjoy the waffles and jam-""soggy"" she said.

Back to the boat and next stop Stavanger.

Along the way were beautiful shoreside Norwegian homes sitting in fields of the greenest green this side of Ireland, massive rock outcroppings and impressive bridges leading from tunnels blasted in the rocks.

It was wet and not the best day to see the Fjord but so worthwhile to have seen what we did see. On a dry summer day it must be so much more enjoyable!

There were a few places to pull off and it looked like there were a few trail heads. We stopped at a 'beach' at Dorvika, which was also a camping spot. Bathroom available.

Norway,Leslie W,Lysefjord,5.0,This is not far from Stavenger so very doable. Even in the dead of winter it was beautiful. We would like to go back in the spring. Pulpit Rock was nothing to look at from down below but I'm sure from up above it is absolutely terrifying! We enjoyed this cruise and stopped at the one restaurant on the water. We had great waffles. Just beautiful.,Feb 2019

I was on the quay in Stavanger on my way to have a double espresso when I passed «Rygerdronningen» about to start its daily trip to Lysefjorden. I stepped on the boat deciding to have my coffee there. A lovely trip, nice, quiet boat, well trimmed staff and then the fjord landscape to the east of Stavanger. Amazing scenery. Much of the time I could spend on deck. The only thing I missed was my Nikon D600.",Nov 2018

Norway,RPG625,Lysefjord,5.0,"This, as many of the fjords I have seen, is simply breathtaking. The sheer beauty of the rock formations along the water’s edge coupled with the amazing colors of autumn will make this an experience that we won’t forget. We saw Lysefjord in the rain and again when the sun was shining. Each experience was terrific.I cannot imagine a trip to Stavanger without a visit to Lysefjord",Oct 2018
Norway,SusanThorn50,Lysefjord,5.0,"Booked this boat trip at tourist information which is a short walk from where the cruise ship docked. It was a cloudy day, but dry and warm. We explored the town first as we had a couple of hours to wait for the trip. The old town is worth a wander but the rest is like a modern town anywhere.
The boat trip was delightful. I was amazed that communities lived on the small islands in the fjord, loved their pretty, colourful, wooden houses. Stopped by a fish farm. Once again the views were beautiful. We stopped by the mandatory waterfall and also we stopped by Pulpit Rock. We didn't see anyone on the top!
We wanted to visit Pulpit Rock, but it was too far away from the town and then a long steep walk so we decided we didn't have enough time. The boat trip was an excellent compromise. Thoroughly recommend.

Norway,Lorna P,Lysefjord,5.0,We chose to see this fjord by boat and would highly recommend the experience. The small settlements and “cottages” that dot the hillsides are most attractive. Pulpit rock soaring above is one of those sights that no picture can do justice to. The same can we said for the roaring cascading of the “whiskey waterfall “.,Oct 2018
Norway,Rooindie,Lysefjord,4.0,"We hiked Pulpit Rock in the morning, and wanted to see it from the Fjord in the afternoon. At the end of September, we found a ""tourist"" cruise, which was relatively short and rather expensive. We also found a ""commuter"" ferry, which made stops, had no tourist info, and was much less expensive; we went for this option. The ferry was more than a half hour late, which made me worried about getting off and being able to catch the ferry back. Pulpit Rock looks completely different (and frankly, underwhelming) from the ferry - if we weren't watching our progress on our phone, we would have totally missed it. But the fjord itself is beautiful and I took a bunch of pictures. An audiobook/music/podcast helps.

Norway,Vantangran,Lysefjord,5.0,"We booked a boat trip down the fjord. It was beautiful. The scenery just built and built in both beauty and height. The fjord seemed determined to impress with its natural features and certainly succeeded. The ""wild"" mountain goats provided a laugh when they tried to get on the boat to steal food. Pulpit rock is visible by craning your neck high but it is the whisky falls that were our highlight.",Aug 2018
Norway,SAinPA,Lysefjord,5.0,"We booked the “pulpit rock cruise” through our cruise line.
The pick up point was literally at the end of our ship so it was easy to access the tour boat.

The boat was mostly fully enclosed with open decks above for viewing and picture taking. The boat has a small coffee stand and good clean restrooms too.

It was a rainy day and our cruise ship had arrived late, so our scheduled 3 hour tour had to be trimmed to 2 1/2 hours. That meant that we did not make a scheduled stop to feed the goats, nor did we stop at a shore restaurant to get waffles with sweet cream.
They adjusted by slowing the boat near the goats who came running to meet the boat anyhow. And they served us waffles, sweet cream and jams on the boat. The food was great.

The cruise boat zipped us under the new Lysefjord suspension bridge (pretty amazing engineering) that spans the fjord.

They nosed the boat into a narrow crevice that houses a cave and we had great views (from the upper deck, through the rain) of the pulpit rock and the beautiful water falls along the fjord.

The rain added lots of water falls cascading down the 2,000 feet from the plateau above down to the fjord.

I got lots of nice pictures because I was willing to stand in the heavy rain and take pictures.

When life gives you lemons, make a warm hotty-toddy and enjoy.

The trip was great and would have been even better if we had the full 3 hours and if it had not been raining. But those are things that we do not control.

A five star excursion.

Norway,molokovellocet9,Lysefjord,5.0,"We booked this as part of our cruise tours. The boat was modern, well equiped with the latest features (wifi being one) and had a English speaking guide on board for our 120 minute trip down the Lysefjord.

The weather was not so good on the day, however we chose to still brave the access outside and film the trip.

The views are spectacular - Pulpit Rock, the nature on route and the waterfalls are all amazing.

The end of the trip sees a stop off for a coffee and waffle (which are included in the fare) for 15 minutes break.

Overall we would recommend pre booking this, as depending on if any private charters are running on the day, there may only be 2 sailings a day at the time we went and was reading up prior to our trip that it can be difficult to get on board without either queuing or pre booking if peak season or a few cruise ships are in port the same time).

This is definately one for nature enthusiasts.

Norway,PhilthetravellerXI,Lysefjord,5.0,"This cruise extends over 3 hours leaving the wharf area at Stavanger and leisurely making its way around Norway’s beautiful Lysefjord with its small housing areas and fish farms, culminating in a visit to a pirate’s cave before approaching the Pulpit Rock which is quite obvious as you approach some 604 metres above you. Its clean-cut rectangular lines are unmistakable and with a good zoom lens you can see the large number of people up there. To actually visit the top of the rock one needs to walk-in from a point near the rock and do a mix of hiking and bus transfer, it all takes quite some time. Time poor tourists like us had to be content with looking up from the water whilst doing a fjord tour. The boat holds many people and you are best to book. Seating is available inside and outside with the former appealing to those averse to the weather, you still gets a good view and there are heaps of photo opportunities. The boat has a good cafe on board for light refreshments and the boat itself when we went appeared almost brand new and in excellent condition.

Norway,19lel68,Lysefjord,5.0,"We picked up a 3 hour boat trip along the Fjord to Pulpit Rock from Stavanger Harbour. The views throughout the cruise were stunning and it was interesting to see the fish farms and friendly goats along the way. The boat had an inside seating area and areas to stand outside. We were lucky that the boat was not full, so perhaps more comfortable than would otherwise have been the case. It was a drizzly, slightly windy, day so we moved between inside and outside, as did most other passengers. We were lucky that the weather cleared enough to see Pulpit Rock. As well as stopping to feed the goats, a stop was made for water from the waterfall and to view Vagabond's Cave. The three hours passed really quickly. We had added interest at Pulpit Rock as our son was trekking to the top at the same time, so we compared photos from different perspectives. Overall, a lovely cruise in a stunning place.

The weather was not on my side that day with rain and clouds. But the skies cleared as we went into the fjord and I enjoyed it thoroughly! Its absolutely beautiful.
Beautiful. If you like Fjords, you'll love this place. One star lost for the ridiculous pricing policy of kayaks on the ferrys. A couple of kayaks ends up being more than a van, despite taking up less space. I know this isn't Lysefjord's fault but life's tough like that sometimes.
Fjord belonging to Norway is located on the North Sea east of the city of Stavanger. Its name means ""Clear Fjord"" because of the light color of its granite rocks. The main attraction of Lysefjord is Preikestolen ""The pulpit"", a gigantic platform of rock suspended over the waters at 600 meters high and offering one of the most spectacular images of nature.

Norway,feyms,Lysefjord,5.0,"This is a thrilling speedboat adventure that departs from the tourist center area in Stavanger, Norway.

Although not inexpensive at about $90 USD ($900 NOK), it is for the adventurous and daring who wish to see the beautiful Lysef Fjord, and the Preikstolen Cliff from the water below. Beware, the ride is fast and quite bumpy. If you’re strong and in good shape, sit in the front of the speedboat. For a less bumpy ride, sit in the back of the boat.

It was quite windy when we left the inner harbor, but within minutes we were speeding along at 40-50 knots, and hitting waves that catapulted the boat 5-7 feet into the air. This lasted about 30 minutes until we reached cliff caves, a waterfall and a beautiful fjord.

The ride back was equally as exciting. Total time was about 2.5 hours, but it was packed full of fun. They provide a warm waterproof suit with hood, but remember to bring glasses or sunglasses for eye protection against strong winds

The cruise takes you up the beautiful Fjord, and stops at particular places of interest (Preikestolen, waterfall, goats! etc), and provides a commentary on what you are seeing. It was very blowy, and a bit rainy, during our trip, so take some warm, and waterproof, clothes. But it didn't stop our enjoyment at all, and I took many pictures of some awesome scenery and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.

Norway,Deborah C,Lysefjord,5.0,"Firstly, the cruise ship docks right next to the boats, a very short walk. It's much cheaper to book locally, not through Royal Caribbean.

There are a couple of comfortable boats available, but suggest you book straight away to avoid disappointment. Then we took a wander round Stavanger, beautiful little streets and shops, all on the doorstep.

We had my elderly mum with us, so we booked one of the leisurely boat trips and my kids (18 and 12) went on the rib. Our boat was lovely and comfortable, leather seats and you could go up on the top deck (at any time) and when we arrived at the waterfall we were allowed at the very front of the boat for stunning photos. Lovely scenery and very enjoyable for mid to mature person. We went in July and I needed my fleece/coat although it was a lovely sunny day. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip but I think my boys would have been bored!

We got a 30% discount on the adult price for my 12 year old on the rib (would have been full price through the cruise line!). They were given big, thick waterproof suits and goggles. The sat in pairs, astride their seats. Please note - If you like a thrill and a bit of excitement then this is for you! My kids and 40 yr old sister thought it was fabulous, the best part of the cruise. Not cheap at around £80 but well worth it to see their faces at the end! They went really fast and the rib jumped out of the sea on occasion. We were told my 70 yr old mum would be fine on it..... my sister said ""definitely not!"" . Wouldn't recommend if you have a bad back either.

At the end of the day, our family party split up and took two very different boat trips and both lots were extremely happy with the outcome. Definitely recommend

It is eerily calm in Lysefjord as you admire the power and majesty of this fjord. Best by private boat, but local tour operators and boating companies offer tours.

Norway,ImgeKS,Lysefjord,4.0,"Lysefjiord is very beautiful and you should not miss it if this is your only chance to visit one of the fjords. (However, if you are going to go to Flam and have a chance to visit Naeroyfjord, then i think you can skip this one; Naeroyfjord is magnificent and more scenic than Lysefjord.)

The boat trip is good and mostly both sides of the boat are ok to see around. Sitting outside is better, of course. But it was raining like cats and dogs on our trip so we had to spend some time inside the boat. Even if it does not rain, taking a raincoat and a water-resistant camera would be a good idea since the boat get close to waterfalls and drops from the falls rain over you. We also prepared a small bag to change our clothes in case we get wet, and it worked very well. If you check out from your hotel, you can still use their bathrooms to change.

During the trip, you have a chance to see Pulpit Rock from the sea level if it is called seeing it :) It is so high that you do not understand anything. So if you want to see it, you need to do trekking, boat tour, itself alone, is not a way to see it.

The landscape was too pretty to feel real, and our weather was perfection. The sun shone all day without a cloud in the sky, so we stood at the front of the boat for unobstructed views. The wind made it fairly chilly, but it was so worth it.

The guides are knowledgeable and can answer most any question you have that they don't cover in their spiel. Our boat stopped at the edge of the water to feed 3 friendly goats, which was such a cute treat. The captain also drove close enough to the rocks to feel the spray (I got almost soaked) of a gorgeous waterfall, and took us back into a few tight coves. It felt much more special than your everyday sightseeing cruise.

Cliffs over 5 million years old, pulpits, magnificent waterfalls, beautiful coves and goats, yes goats, how do they get to the water from such heights! A little stop off for a quick lunch of pancake waffles with yogurt and jam (their speciality) and it's delicious. This trip along the Lysefjord should definitely not be missed.

Norway,achoix,Lysefjord,5.0,"We came here with a Camper RV with two young children (11 and 8 years). We stayed one night in a local camping then headed to the pier to take use from Lysebotn to Forsand. It was a two and a half hour cruise along the Lysefjord. It was rainy, cloudy, misty.

We thought ""did we just blow 120 EUR?""

Short answer: no way!

The ferry is a medium sized ship that can fit about 20 cars. It has four decks including a small little cafe for snack foods. It comes with a sitting area with tables like a high school cafeteria. But you'll likely be spending most of your time outside, enjoying the amazing, breathtaking views of the mountain fjords!

The rain provided a misty, mystical effect making these beasts that much more special. Out on the water the rain stopped and we were able to spend most of the one out on deck, although it was pretty cold (10 C).

This short tour was a great way to see the fjords from an intimate perspective - right up close and personal. It sure beat a five hour car ride twisting up and down the mountain side.

Would highly recommend! Rain or shine!

The ship pulled up close to one of the large falls and a boat crew member collected the fresh water pouring off the cliffs. He then poured glasses of ice cold water for us to toast our journey. Snow capped mountains, water falls, hugh rock formation and seeing Pulpit rock from the water. I found myself saying WOW many times. This is a must see when travelling in Norway each turn the boats makes thru the fjord one area seems even more beautiful then the next.

That said, the cruise up the fjord was fabulous; mountains, waterfalls, quaint homes, fish farms, ferries and much more. The furthest the boat went was pulpit rock which is much larger than it looks from water level. On the trip back, we stopped at a cabin where we had delicious waffles. We also had our photo taken with the local viking. We were fortunate that the weather was perfect. There wasn't a lot of narration except for dome key sites which was OK.

The real attraction came later when we took a small boat up the Lysefjord, passing directly beneath Pulpit rock. Some cruise ships visit Lysefjord, but you don't get the up close view that a smaller boat offers. We pulled up to a waterfall and a boat crewman filled a bucket from the falls and filled cups with water for the passengers.

On the way back to Stavanger we stopped on a small island and had coffee and waffles with strawberry jam and sour cream. This was one of the best excursions we had on our three week cruise.

If you like guiding tours I recommend you to go by organized service; Rødne Fjordcruise.

On the way back, we stopped at a restaurant that set out a buffet of waffles, cream, berries, coffee and tea. Their waffles are slightly different, thinner and bigger, more like a crepe, very tasty.

Norway,Adrian T,Lysefjord,5.0,"In my opinion, the main reason to visit Lysefjord is to do the Pulpit Rock Hike. The rock itself looks entirely distant and unimpressive just from a boat in the fjord. You REALLY have to take the walk to the top. Fantastic walk, loads of incredible views (especially from the rock along the fjord). The walk is a bit difficult, up big steps and a very rocky path. Also maybe ice on the path near the top, so a bit slippery (late April we found this). It's easy to stay away from the edge, the path is reasonably wide at the top where it leads to the rock, so it's safe if you are careful - and WATCH the kids !!! It takes about 2 hours to walk up, and similar down -- we got the ferry to Tau from Stavanger and then the special bus from Tau; however there are special trips in the Summer season, we were just too early for these. Highly recommend the Pulpit Rock Walk !!!

We stayed down in the fjords and occasionally stopped for pictures but it's all pretty similar after a while. If we had realised we would have booked onto a tour that allowed us to hike up to Pulpit Rock. This is the main attraction at Lysefjord and it's pretty unimpressive from down below looking up. We were the youngest by far on the boat tour so they were definitely accommodating for the older generation, which is fair enough when they're your main customer. If you're like us and would like a bit more action/adventure/a better view and picture opportunities, then I would look for a tour that includes a guided hike or bus ride up to the Pulpit Rock.

Oh My how beautiful were the views breathtaking accompanied by the Morning Suite from Peer Gynt - Grieg playing softly . If you visit Stavanger it's a must do . On our return we went down below deck , lovely and warm and hot coffees and teas and light snacks were available for purchase . There were also a couple of toilets downstairs too . Would do it again .

Looking UP to the famous Pulpit Rock is amazing. Also observing the people on the plateau looking down on the boat 600 m below them...
Given the weather conditions the boat approach the mountain side under a waterfall to collect a bucket of fresh, crystal clear water to taste. Some times the boat stops at a small place called Helleren for waffles with sour cream and Strawberry jam. The only way to get to Helleren is by boat.
On licky daus one may observere smaller whales breathing, and seals on the banks.

In peak season, it was packed with people (quite rude people to be honest) pushing their way to the front of the line for the bus. The trail of the hike was a single file line and the rock itself was covered with people eating lunch and taking photos. Go past that and hike a little further up to get a quieter view and area to reflect on the scene in front of you.

Not perfect for dizzy people.
Be aware of Norwegian weather, clothng according to the wether and on a windy foggy rainy day: don't go, you may suffer from Hypotherma and exhaustion. As mentioned above, walking shoes is a must, high heels (yes it has happened) will not be ""high"" after some minutes.
Is it worth the trip? YES. Will I do it again? Probably not, it is an experience for life.
Do I recommend it? yes, if you have normal functions, but you will be tired afterwards.

Norway,Michael B,Lysefjord,5.0,One of the most spectacular and easy accessible fjord in Norway. Amazing views from all sides along this over 40km long creation of nature:) Most known attractions are Pulpit Rock and Kjeragbolten. The second is a dream take off point for base jumpers. There is a ferry trip from Stavanger to Lysebotn (the very end of the fjord) from where you can climb over 1100m to the Kjerag. Half way there is a restaurant and mountain lodge...amazing views.

Norway,Renato C,Lysefjord,4.0,"We visited the fjord through the Rodne Cruise service, the trip lasts about 2-3 hours and costs around 50€. It is actually a good value for money compared to the cost of eveerything in Norway.

The cruise was nice and it was a nice experience to see the fjords and how nature has carved the high walls surrounding the steady and blue stream of water. The day was very nice so we were lucky and we enjoyed it thoroughly. You can see a lot of distant houses and farms and it is easy to imagine how the vikings used to live, it probably hasn't changed much expect for the style and the number of houses (which is still very very low).

However it is not THAT big of a deal, I mean I was here for work so I spent 50 euros to see the fjords and it was ok. I wouldn't be happy if I had spent 3 thousand euors on a cruise around the fjords.

It is not nicer or better than a stroll around the Alps or seeing the costiera amalfitana cliffs. I'm sorry to put down such a nice place, but it wasn't as high as the expectations everyone seems to have for the fjords.

Nice? definitely yes!
Worth it for 50 euros? Yes!
Magnificent, unforgettable and a must for everyone (see before you die kind of stuff)? Not really

Norway,Julius v,Lysefjord,5.0,"The best way to view Lysefjord with its flora, fauna, and Pulpit rock, is by water. We used our sailing boat to view the expanse of the fjord, passing by many locals' holiday homes in the process. However as you pass by a very large suspension bridge you know that you have reached it.

The wildlife was rather interesting with trees clinging to the sides of the sheer rock faces. The resident seal population appear to be quite shy, apparently frightened off by motorboats. Therefore I recommend for people to leisurely explore the fjord by sailing boat. Albeit, the weather can turn quickly, but we were lucky to catch some summer sun.

If you do the cruise I recommend in the way up to take a chair and sit in the upper deck on the front.

Norway,Ted E,Lysefjord,5.0,"The first port-of-call for the Serenade of the Seas was Stavanger on August 8, 2016. It is an industrial-looking city upon approach although spotlessly neat and tidy. Any thoughts that you're just stuck in an oil town is soon vanquished if you take the boat tour of Lysefjord. It is the real deal. Even though it was raining cats and dogs, you could not miss the beauty and sheer mountainous nature of Norway. The fjord itself is as deep as the mountains are tall rendering us little humans as paltry little intruders. The water is very clean. The boat goes up the fjord occasionally getting up-close-and-personal to various things, a lone male goat, the outlaws hide-a-way cave complete with mailbox (yes, see my photo), absolute beauty on all sides. Pulpit Rock I could see above me in the clouds and rain but barely. This is an impressive excursion. We stopped at a little café place and were served waffles. It was just plain gorgeous. The boat takes about a half-hour or so to get back to Stavanger but since the rain let up some it is an interesting trip. If you're looking for the beauty of the Norwegian fjords, take this excursion. Go when the sun is out however if possible.

David was our tour guide on the ship. The pilot pulled the ship up close to waterfalls and some areas that had goats residing on them. Passed below Pulpit Rock. Plenty of amazing sights to see. Ultimately we ended up back at the dock in Stavanger, right next to our cruise ship. The ship has several restrooms and a snack shop, tables to sit at, very comfortable. The trip couldn't have been any better. The day we toured, the Norwegian King and his family were in the area, so we sailed right past the royal yacht moored in the harbor.

We then proceeded to a major waterfall, actually getting within a few feet of the falls. With less wind buffeting the boat we could have captured and enjoyed some of the glacier water.

It's possible to drive all the way but I wanted a break from driving and wanted to do a cruise through a fjord so this seemed perfect.

We boarded at Forsand which is only a 20 minute drive down from Preikestolen. We went onto the outside deck and stayed their for the whole duration of the trip. There is a written guide in english explaining all of the landmarks along the way. Some more interesting than others - it's really cool seeing Kjeragbolten from the water as you really appreciate how high up it is!

The audio commentary was difficult to hear as the speakers seemed very quiet and due to the breeze on the open air the sound didn't travel well. The onboard food/drink kiosk was poor. Lack of choice and quality and naturally way over-priced.

The tickets for the ferry were a little steep I felt but I'm still very happy that we took the ferry instead of driving. We did drive back from Lysebotn, however.

It is not operating for many years. No signs ""Do not pass"", ""Danger"". It's only 750 m but constantly up. It took me 1h 20 m. Every 500th step is marked with a sign, so no need to count them. Some parts of the stairs are steep, otherwise it's simply climbing stairs up. Views are amazing. From the top the way back is the same stairs down or down the mountain (there is a wooden sign ""Florli"" and ""...sti"", that ""...sti"" means ""road"") without any pass (bare stones, then stones covered with trees, then land covered with vegetation and water up to the ankle (I was in the end of August). Till the road (ground road). I took that way down the mountain. It was climbing, sliding on the 5th point, getting into muddy water... There are creeks everywhere, mud and spiny bush... But SO beautiful! Then it is about 500 m on that road to the right (towards the fjord), then there is a trail to the left (there is a sign ""Florli) till some black cabin with a green roof. From that cabin the trail turns to the right and leads down to Florli. Through the forest: it was stones, water, mud and roots of trees. There are no bears, nor wolves in Norway, by the way. The trail is marked with red signs. On my way there was a suspended bridge (short and very firm). When I finally got down to the fjord it was strange to walk on a horizontal surface covered with asphalt. The way down took me about 3 hours. Besides the longest stairs there are 4 or 5 houses in Florli, a hostel, where snacks and drinks can be bought, a WC is there inside, a museum about that former hydropower plant. The weather was very good that day, sunny, warm, no rain. All in all it was fun, which I could have missed had I taken the same stairs back. It was not ""Curiosity killed the cat"", but ""Blessed are the curious as they will have an adventure"".

Here, the waffles are thin and chewy. Spread on top sour cream and jam, and you have Norwegian waffles. Not really my thing, but just in case anyone wants to know. Another way to see Pulpit Rock is from above. One tour is a two hour walk in each direction to stand directly on top of the rock. I am sure the vantage point from the top is incredible, but after two hours of walking, I think I would not want to be at the edge as I do not believe there is fencing. Just a straight drop down. Also, doing this hike in the rain could be a real bummer. People on our cruise did exactly that hike in the rain.

Norway,Juliannehstone,Lysefjord,5.0,"This hike is very different than any other I've done. It's not really a ""trail"" but more massive boulders to climb. It definitely would have helped if I had been in better shape. I don't think I could walk for three days after. Haha. But so worth it. The view was amazing. Bring water and snacks and a walking stick if possible. It was hot when we went. Don't hesitate to do this. You'll regret it if you don't !",Jun 2016
Norway,APS_HH,Lysefjord,5.0,"Take a boat or a ferry to get there. It is a must if you are in Stavanger area

The best way is a fjord cruise the are helpful and the announcements are in several languages.

Don't miss the waterfall, the goat and most important the pulpit rock.

If you are in good condition you can walk up the rock. Be warned. There a hell of a lot stairs.",Aug 2016
Norway,Ivon P,Lysefjord,5.0,"This was the only activity that we planned to do in Stavanger on our way from Kristiansand to Bergen. It is well worth it. You can buy your tickets there at the harbor, on the spot, but you risk not getting a boat for the time or day you want. We booked our cruise last night for today, but we advise that you do it ahead of time because they seem to get full quickly. It is very easy to get your tickets through the internet. Ours was done through the site of Rodne Fjord cruise, 480 NOK a person (US$ 58), and you can pay for it with any credit card. It was a joint cruise to Lysefjord and Pulpit Rock (which you see from the boat). One must get there 20 minutes ahead of time and boarding is somewhat confusing. Several boats leave around the same time and people often are at the wrong place. No cueing to access, so people push each other to get in before the others and access the better seats on the top. There are no assigned seats. Sincerely, they could do better. Once you are on board, the trip is well organized, they explain the scenery and the main attractions in several languages, including English and Spanish. We were also very lucky, it was a gorgeous, sunny day, although a bit chilly for being Summer, so many pictures and videos as souvenirs.

Norway,Jakki2525,Lysefjord,1.0,"A really bad idea to do a fjord cruise in the rain, but our ticket was pre-booked for a specific time. We were dressed for bad weather, so were warm enough, but we couldn't see anything for rain, fog, mist. We were meant to go to a significantly large waterfall after seeing (a vague outline of) Pulpit Rock, but the tour guide decided it wasn't worth the effort/time, and returned to shore and took us to a cafe instead for ""traditional Norwegian waffles"", which I'm sure are actually Belgian. A waste of time & money, so don't pre-book a fjord trip, only do it on the day if the weather is good.",Aug 2016
Norway,Joey P,Lysefjord,4.0,"This area is one of Norway's most stunning fjords. We went on a local sightseeing boat and set off into the Stavanger archipelago.

Our guide pointed out many of the vacation homes on the small islets as we drew near to Lysefjord which means ""light fjord"". It is called this because of the light colored granite rocks.

We cruised right under the natural wonder ""Pulpit Rock"" which is surrounded by stunning rock formations. The story is told that a preacher named the rock because when he saw it he said ""this looks just like my pulpit"".

Our boat captain steered us to some stunning waterfalls. On the waterfront we stopped in Helleren for waffles with cream and sweet jam.

It was a memorable experience.

The fjords are beautiful and scenic. The boat had open decking upstairs and spacious seating downstairs.

Pulpit Rock was nice to see, but I'm guessing it would be far more breathtaking to the top. Plenty of waterfalls and the boat gets up close, practically sailing into the falling water. People crowd to the front to take their pictures.

Climb up to Kjeragbolten took 2 hours 15 minutes and descent took 1 hour 45 minutes. Rocks slippy after heavy rain, used the chains a lot. Not too many people, only about 10 on top at any time. Did it on a Friday.
Climb up to Preikestolen took 1 hour 30 minutes and descent took a lot less. Far too many people, including little children and old adults. Very difficult to pass slower groups. Several hundred on top. Did it on a Saturday. Best thing is to do it at 04.30 and watch the sun rise, then get down before the mad rush starts.
Both worth doing, fantastic views and good work outs.
Drove to both. Took ferry back from Lysebotn. Cruise back up the fjord in the car ferry definitely worth doing, great views of both tops on the way.

Norway,jaybeeFL,Lysefjord,5.0,"Booked a 3 hour cruise on Rodne Fjord cruises and was delighted we did. First , the price was substantially less than what the cruise line was charging for their excursions
(about $55 USD to the $159 for Cruise Line tour!!!). Same or similar boats, same itinerary, same sights---only difference over $100!!!
Second---the 42 mile fjord contains some spectacular scenery--sheer cliffs dropping 3-400 feet into the icey waters of the fjord; spectacular waterfalls one of which the captain places the boat next to and the staff collects the water to pass out to tourists who can taste the outflow from the snowmelt; Pulpit Rock a 40x40 flat surface that is over 800 feet directly above the fjord; snow capped mountains and beautiful farm meadows to mention just some of what you'll witness.
Third---the convenience. You disembark the ship and walk a short distance and board Rodne's modern twin engine catamaran with open air upper deck and lower deck with comfortable seating and wide windows for unobstructed viewing. Nice when weather doesn't cooperate.
Thoroughly enjoyed the tour, got some great photos and returned to port without incident and $100 still in my pocket ($200 because it was my wife and me!!!!).

Hike in about 2.5 miles on a rocky path that gains about 1000 feet and has lots of beautiful scenery along the way. But the breathtaking views of Lysefjord come once you reach Preikestolen (pulpit rock), a massive flat rock 604 meters above sea level overlooking the fjord. Need to plan on 5 - 7 hours round trip from Stavanger. A real Norway trip highlight.",May 2016

Norway,Travellenh,Lysefjord,5.0,"If you ever come to visit Stavanger, it is worth the effort to visit Lysefjorden, and see the amazing Pulpit rock and Fantahålå. If you want to stand on the pulpit rock, it is possible to do so, but for that you need aprox 7-8 hours in total from the city senter. The walk to the top takes aprox 2 hours, depending on the shape your in. A tip for the trip, Nike or mountain shoes.

If you want to take the boat into Lysefjorden, you can either:
1) Contact a company called Fjordevents, which will transport you in small groups in sea rafting boats( dressed in survilense suites). This trip are for people who likes some action, wind in their hair and a bit wawe jumping, if windy.
2) You can go by larger boats- Fjordcruise. Much crowdier, but still nice to travel with in case of rain and cold weather.

I am sure the trip to Lysefjorden will give you a bit of magic that day!

You get information on the boat every 10/15 min on various sites you're passing.

Norway,john12358,Lysefjord,2.0,"Went on a trip by boat, which takes in the Pulpit Rock (from below), the 'Vagabond's Cave', and a waterfall, as it seemed to be a 'must do'. The weather was wet and windy, which didn't help, but as the boat is quite high speed, I suspect it would still be too cold to stay on deck, even in good weather. When we got there, the Pulpit Rock was completely underwhelming (I'm sure it would have been magnificent though, had we climbed up and stood on it from above). The cave was basically a hole in the rock, and the waterfall was way smaller than many others I've seen. Also the trip was overpriced. OK if it's a lovely day then it might be a nice thing to do, but otherwise don't bother.

I have seen all sorts of tourists and can say this: if you want to enjoy your stay and really see the nature - pack good shoes (no, not your good high heels) and warm clothes! It is a shame to see that so many have not been prepared for what norwegian nature needs for you to see it as it is! And no; there is not a lift or stairs taking you up to The pulpit Rock - if you are in bad shape, you will need at least 3 hours just on the way up, and you will have to walk the same way back down! But to have been up there; it is SOOOO fantastic!!

Norway,Chris L,Lysefjord,5.0,It was amazing and no picture can do it justice. Out of season is a little tricky but easy to do. If you go from Stavanger port to Tau on a Kolumbus ferry and then a bus to the start of the hike which takes 2.5 hours roughly. The buses are available on the side as soon as you depart the ferry. They were using a taxi though for me as it's easter as well so its very quiet. The hike was well labelled and quite easy with a few tricky spots so walking shoes make things a lot more comfortable. I took food up there and enjoyed the view which was possibly one of the best lunches I've ever had. Go.,Mar 2016
Norway,bko2105,Lysefjord,5.0,"Lysefjroden and Prekestolen (the Pulpit) is ""a must see"" in the Stavanger area. Depending on the crowd and your shape, the trip to Prekestolen is a treat which takes you 4 hours round trip. Use hiking or jogging shoes and food and water for your trip. Not recommended if you do not like hights.

If you do not like hights - take the ferry from Stavanger to the end of Lysefjord (Lysebotn) and enjoy the whole fjord - including a view of Prekestolen from the fjord. If you bring your car - the drive from Lysebotn to the top and through Sirdal back to Stavanger gives you some great views and nature experiences. Stop for lunch at the restaurant at Ørneredet on your way up from Lysebotn - great view! You can also stop at Byrkjedalstunet (on the way from Sirdal) for some great traditional Norwegian homemade food.
If I have visitors from abroad I ""always"" do this trip - and they are never disappointed. Make this a full day adventure!

Norway,arundhati b,Lysefjord,5.0,"The 42-km long fjord has only two villages along its length, Forsand and Lysebotn, both of which are lightly populated. We had to get onto one of them, Forsand, for our trek, from the village of Tau.

The bomber jacket I had carried with me was one of the most sensible things I have ever done in my life. My teeth chattered away and my hair stood straight up in the wind as we stood on the sundeck while the boat made its way through the steep, light coloured granite cliffs. These cliffs stand dramatically along the sides of Lysefjord and gives the fjord its name. Lyse means ‘light'.

We had taken the Rodne Fjord Cruise for Lysefjord. My husband was a bit disappointed because he felt the boat could have taken us further into the length of the fjord. We were dropped off at Tau to make our way up to the Pulpit Rock.

But it was my first fjord experience and it was just as I had imagined it to be. The waters appeared to be mysterious and moody, with the occasional tiny lighthouse and wooden houses popping up along the way.

Coming from Australia walking on rocks was a bit unusual for me, I am used to following rain-forest or bush paths but most of this climb was on rocks. I recommend wearing good footwear. I just wore a pair of runners and they did the job but I think they were very worn by the end. I was there in October and the weather was stunning so the shoes were fine, any later in the year and I would have wanted hiking shoes. Having said all of that I am no spring chicken and so someone younger and more agile may not need sturdier shoes! The view at the pulpit is so worth the climb, really breath taking and I would definitely do it again!

Norway,Inge B,Lysefjord,5.0,"We stayed a few days in the area of the Lysefjord, exploring it in different ways. Hiking of course, takes the top spot with walks to the Preikestolen and the more challenging walk to Kjerag, even if you don't have your photo taken standing right at the edge of the Preikestolen or on top of the Kjerag boulder, are absolutely worth doing for the breath taking views down the 1000 meter vertical drop into the Lysefjord below, If not alone for the spectacular mountain scenery along the way and around you, particularly at the walk to Kjerag. Another aspect of the Fjord we got as we drove down the small road to Songesand, along amazing landscape of rocks and ponds and near to the Fjord the sound bells, dangling of sheep necks. we found total peace there shared with just a couple of fisherman quietly trying for a successful catch.
Lastly, we cruised the fjord by means of the car ferry along the Lysefjord to Lysebotn as we left the area to carry on our way East. Revisiting the sights we had stood the days before, now looking up at water level from the deck of the ferry. The Fjord showed itself this time in the moody shades of grey as the weather changed to rain, No matter the weather, and in even in the grey, we were awestruck on several occasions and will certainly revisit the Lysefjord to explore some more

The views from topside must be amazing but was not able to do hike (it being a full day activity). Did get to see the Pulpit Rock from below, not much to it from the downside (see picture)

Our boat was well equipped, having comfortable sitting inside and viewing platform on top, with speakers in both places, although with the wind noise you can’t hear much of what is said when outside. The boat had clean toilets and complimentary coffee. The crew/guide were excellent, they took us near a waterfall were they filled bucket with natural spring water for us. These small quirks along with the excellent explanation of the history, culture and jokes about Norwegians made for a good trip.

We were on Disney Cruise and booked via there Port Adventures excursion, the boat cruise on site were cheaper by half. Still didn’t feel so bad when I saw the other boats being jammed packed whereas we got a boat with limited crowd and had lot of space to move around.

Norway,ArcticRoll,Lysefjord,5.0,"I didn't opt for the 3 hour cruise because I felt it was a bit on the expensive side at 450Kr, especially since the hike up to Priekestolen gives you all the views you could want.

A number of people told us that this was an easy ""walk"", but it's actually a fairly tough hike up to the top. You don't need hiking boots, clothes or equipment. Do have a couple of bottles of water, and some snacks though. Shoes with thick soles like running shoes will do just fine.

The hike to the top takes around 2-3 hours, depending on how many breaks you takes and your speed. It's a good 6km each way. The walk down can be much trickier.

I booked a return bus + ferry using TideReiser for NOK 500. However, if you turn up and take the ferry and wait for a bus and pay there, it will work out a lot cheaper. The bus gets very busy during the early morning.

Views along the hike and at the top are breathtaking. Its certainly worth the effort, you won't see this anywhere else.

Norway,pipcarobeth,Lysefjord,5.0,"As we couldnt handle the 8 hour trip to actually hike to Pulpit rock, we took this cruise instead so we could see it from the Fjord. The entire round trip takes 3 hours but the time flies by. The boat itself is very smooth and we rarely felt movement, even when it was opened up to full speed. Start on the sun deck to get some stunning photos. After about 30 minutes a small coffee bar opens which offers tea, coffee or hot chocolate along with a small selection of food. When the bar isn't open, there is a small coffee machine so you can get coffee anytime throughout the trip.
The captain was fantastic and rather than pointing out interesting points along the trip, he gets you very very close. When you reach the Vagabonds Cave, he actually takes the boat into the cave and turns it around a full circle so no matter where you are on the boat, you see everything.
The only negative is that we saw pictures of people actually being able to drink the water from the waterfall. We were not able to do this and when we asked the lady on the boat why, she said due to the rain, the water in the waterfall was 'dirty' I would have through all of the waterfall water was rain at one point or another!!
Not cheap but you do get to see some stunning views you would not see from your cruise ship.

Norway,Vijay B,Lysefjord,5.0,"Its a must see place in lifetime. We took a boat trip (450 NOK per adult) around 2 to hours on the boat. We enjoyed Pulpit rock view from the boat. And the best part is that the Boat is stopped in front of mountain waterfalls and all the passengers are served with that pure mountain water to taste. ""Highly recommanded""",Jun 2015
Norway,Toosie B,Lysefjord,5.0,definitely worth seeing! But I would suggest booking a guided tour as you can fit more in without the worry of logistics.,Aug 2015

Scenery is breathtaking, absolutely beautiful.
It can be a little chilly on the top deck so take a wind proof jacket.",Aug 2015
Norway,Hari B,Lysefjord,5.0,"Wonderful experience. You can reach this using the ferry service in the harbour. Would definately recommend booking this in advance as it was very busy during our trip.As well as cruising around the fjord, the ferry drops passengers off where they can make a 2 hour hike to Pulpit Rock.",Aug 2015
Norway,D H,Lysefjord,5.0,"I did hiking on the first day and stunning views as many people have said so.

I did another cruise (2.5hours) from Lauvvik to Lysebotn with a car and then drove up 27 hairpins to the eagle nest restaurant, then drove back to Stavanger city via Gjestal, Gloppendalen and Three Swords.

This drive route is superbly nice with lots of scenery. The ice is not yet melted all and it's beautifully scattered at the plateau!!!! My picture couldn't reflect good enough. If u love to drive, I strongly recommend u to take my second day route.

Norway,AFamilyOfFive,Lysefjord,4.0,"The view doesn't get better anywhere in the world. I rated this hike 4 stars rather than 5 because of the crowds - wow is it crowded! Here's my tip for your visit, go in the late afternoon. If you're lucky enough to be there in the summer time like we were, you'll have plenty of light. Giant buses of tourists swamp the place until about 3-4pm when they clear out. As we were hiking in, hundreds were hiking out. We found some peace and quiet at Pulpit Rock and then continued up to the very top. That latter hike is strictly optional and is not clearly marked - you'll have to find your way!",Aug 2015

You see pictures of fjords, but until you are inside of one, you really don't have the right perspective. Plan to go on a sunny day, for greater depth, color & dimension. Pictures just don't do it justice. I recommend bringing an SLR with a wide 28mm, medium zoom 35-70mm, 200mm lens and a fisheye or panaramic lenses. Even if you don't have those, bring a wrist strap for your camera. Your jaw will be open, and you just might loose your camera! Enjoy.",Aug 2015
Norway,cindycoco,Lysefjord,5.0,"A tame and rather easy hike up to pulpit rock. Bring lunch and enjoy the sun at the top. To get there you need to take the ferry, and in our case we just followed the tour bus to the destination. So many lakes I wish we could have swam in and just soaked up the scenery. Absolutely picturesque. Also did the flying fox down, a great finishing touch to our little trip to Norway everyone enjoyed.",Jul 2015

It took about 3 hours to hike up and a little less than 2 hours down. The hike path is all stone, so with every step pick a stone to walk on.

The narration was well done, the boat stopped to enable us to see interesting fjord geology and waterfalls up close, and one of the crew even stepped off the ship to feed the goats. They fetch fjord water for passengers to drink. The tour operator is located near the cruise ships.",Jun 2015
Norway,CutTheBullsht,Lysefjord,5.0,"I decided to take the hike to Preikestolen after two weeks walking in a National Park. I would recommend it to everybody who is able.
The climb isn't difficult, is well marked, and should be climbed by almost everybody in 2 hours. If you're fitter it will only take an hour.
As with most attractions, it's worthwhile getting there early to avoid the crowds. For those keen enough there are plenty of camping spots en route too.
Preikestolen itself of wonderful, but it's worthwhile venturing further up the side of the mountain for views over both the fjord and cliff.

Cost: 250NOK for a bus/ferry round trip.

Conclusion: If you're in Stavanger, this is a must do.

Norway,Gunnel,Lysefjord,5.0,"We were considering going this trip by a ferry (cheaper), but we are happy we chose this one - worth all the money: The tour was operated by www.rodne.no. It cost 450 NOK per person and took three hours.

There were many people on the boat but we arrives early and managed to get seats outside on the sun deck. The boat went at 10 sharp. It past the Norwegian Petroleum Museum and under a bridge to a nearby island. We saw many beautiful islands, bays, beaches and summer houses. Such a beautiful archipelago!

At the entrance to the Lysefjord (a fjord is a long, narrow, deep inlet of the sea between high cliffs) we saw the recently built bridge across the fjord which had been considered "" one of Norway's most beautiful bridges"".

We went into the fjord where the mountains on the north side steepened. The ship stopped at a waterfall where water fell straight down into the fjord and you could pick up a bucket of fresh mountain water.

The highlight was when we were just under the cliff named Pulpit. It is more than 600 meters above the water. Really majestic!

The ski was - thank you Lord - clear and totally blue this day.

The tour was for 3 hours and operated by www.rodne.no. It costs 450 NOK/person (children up to 3 years is free). After completing the trip I found there are cheaper option you can find in the Stavanger port and students can get extra discount. But rodne does not provide any student discount.
You will enjoy each and every moment of your three hours cruise. The views to the mountain, fjord where breathtaking. The mountains were tall and full of rock. You can see the pulpit rock from the bottom. Also you will be very close to the a beautiful waterfall. As I was with little baby I did not hike up to the pulpit rock. So I just took the sight seeing package. Otherwise, you must plan to hike and from the top obviously the view will be awesome.

The views will absolutely take your breathe away. One of the most surreal and peaceful places on earth. Be sure to stop at the mountain top lakes on the way back for a swim. I hiked with locals from Stavanger who shared the secret to muscle soreness and fast recovery lie in a quick dip in the lakes. It was well worth the near hypothermia as it was refreshing and made the trip back down even better. There are not a lot of suitable places to stop and rest along the way so get rest when you find a place as to not block other climbers.

Everything was well organized, and information in different languages on the speaker.
The trip ant by the famous Pulpit rock, but of course when you are on the fjord it is very far up.

We went by a waterfall, and were offered samplings of the water to drink. Nothing fresher than this!

They sold some snack on board. This trip is best taken on a day with great weather, but even if not so, you should go. The high steep mountains surrounding the fjord is very impressive!

Lots of stops to take photos and admire the quiet of the Fjords. The company can supply you with warm boots, which I recommend if the snow is high (which it was) and thermal suits if you need them. Hot drinks and fresh baguette rolls were included in the deal. Times were pick-up around 9am and return around 3pm. Highly recommended

Norway,ccdaniello,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"It is our first time to Tromsø, Norway. Together with 2 other families from UK n Saudi Arabia, we were treated to a splendid display of aurora lights that seems to cross the sky ahead of us. Even our naked eyes were able to see the colours of green n red with many dancing lights. It was truly an awesome display of terrestrial lights. Many screamed n we were all dazzled, totally forgetting the minus 11 degree cold surrounding.
For this wonderful treat, we are very thankful to our guide, Mick, from Chasing Lights in Tromsø. In his quiet confidence, he wanted us to have this beautiful experience. He knew exactly the spot to feast our eyes. Throughout the trip, Mick is always very thoughtful about our needs - are we adequately clothed n even carrying a paraplegic woman several times up n down the coach n ensuring that she enjoys fully like everyone else. In our view, Mick is the guide of choice if you want to chase the Northern Lights. Thus, this is our way of appreciating his dedication n commitment to giving the best. Cheers!

As the ship dodged its way between the islands and ducked into the fjords, we saw the most amazing scenery. And also we took advantage of the various port calls to have a wander around villages and towns. On board life was also fantastic where the amazing food, with the all-you-can-eat breakfast and lunch buffets along with the scrummy set evening meals (Norwegian cuisine),kept us well fed. The daily gatherings to go over the photos from the excursions of that day and to go over the details for tomorrow were good fun (we also had a go at learning norwegian!) as were the daily lectures where we learnt about norwegian explorers, fairy tales, history of the country amongst other things. But the best part was the incredible staff, in particular the excursion staff of 'Oncle' Heinz, Jan Helge and Oyvind. They made us feel like family. Yep, we'll definitely be going back.

We however turned up in tromso to see it in tis full natural summer glory. The city itself has a lot of small quaint tourist dedicated sight seeing spots but the best part is driving out !

We were there for 3 whole days with our kids aged 7 and 14 and the kids loved visiting the dog farm ( viewing the dogs and petting was free)

The drive around the tromso region was gorgeous with a hide and seek of sun and rain and temperatures ranging from 7 degrees to 12 degrees. The region is filled with one way bridges crossing over the fjords or tunnels with 4 directional roundabouts running through the mountains and stopovers offering amazing views of the fjords or the Artic!

Norway,Bob M,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Tromso
A city of two halves, with a harbour and fiord in between. Lovely, mostly well kept wooden houses and a wooden Catholic Church. Lots of places to eat and drink but pricey, £18.40 for two beers! Interesting to wander round the harbour or walk over the big bridge over the start of the harbour and go to the modern Cathedral ( closed to visitors on a Sunday I believe).
If you come in on a cruise you’ll be offered a shuttle bus in to the town ($16 in my case). I considered not taking it but I’m glad I did as it is a tortuous route just getting out of the dock area and then it’s through a long vehicle tunnel. I saw people walking back but I’d guess at 40 to 60 minutes of a walk.
It is well set up with museums and visitor type shops, sorry I didn’t check out the Cathedral side of the town, and it is very pleasant just wandering around. Look out for the old wooden bandstand and, behind it, the townhouse. Look at the ridge of the roof and spot the Daschund.

Norway,ElisThomasGrandad,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Note: we are both 60 & well travelled.
This was our 4th attempt at seeing the Northern Lights, Reykjavik, Russia & Lapland previously (with no success)
We booked for 4 nights 13 - 17 March 2018. We got there late Tues evening & picked up our hire car & drove to our accommodation. We were staying on Tromso island overlooking the water towards the mainland & woke on Wed morning with wall to wall sunshine & an outstanding view of the mountains. We drove over to the cable car & went up the mountain (recommended). Beautiful views on a beautiful day. We then drove around getting our bearings & getting to know the place. We have travelled all over Europe doing city breaks (which are always expensive) but this has been by far the most expensive. We went there purely to see the ‘lights’ & we had beautiful displays Wed & particularly Thursday.........’dancing’ for ages & ages, the fjords were a great bonus & the cable car trip was a treat
Eating out: We were pointed to a few restaurants - could not find one & the other was expensive. We found Kaia (right on the harbour - overlooking the water) we even saw the aurora as we were eating. We had fish & chips 185 NOK - £17 & a dried cod meal 100 NOK more expensive. I cannot find receipt but remember the fish & chip cost. It was a lovely meal & on comparison to other restaurants - VFM (we also ate there the following night).
On Thursday it was again beautiful blue skies & we went on a fjord cruise (another ‘must do’ - 1200 NOK - £110pp) beautiful scenery. Friday again beautiful blue skies & we drove around Kvaloya (along costal road ‘clockwise’ to Sommarøy (gorgeous) then further up to Ersfjordbotn- nothing much there ........ but the view - gorgeous! We drove around in a circle & got back to Tromso. A day out to remember.
Sat: When we woke up there were no blue skies & it was cloudy - what a contrast in weather & experience - we could have been anywhere ‘cold’ The magic had disappeared. We were flying home in the evening and
mid morning the snow came. I drove the hire car back to the airport by 4pm & it was snowing heavily. As it turned out the inbound flight was late & then they could not land because of the snow. We were put in a hotel & eventually flew home the following evening
What we would like to say is: the weather made it ‘magical’ See our photos - they say it all. We achieved all we set out to do -if it was 5 days of cloud it would have been such a different story. The car gave us the freedom (seeing people out walking, waiting for buses in the cold & snow -and it was cutting cold & we were getting around in the warm). Glad we had it although it was expensive (but ‘aurora trips’ were expensive too). Not the place for walking around though - because of the snow & cold (average -7 by day)
Note: if you do hire a car - use the underground car parks as parking tickets are handed out regularly (I was told) & expensive & really - you don’t know what is what when parking - so take the safe option. Driving is a little tricky because of the snow etc., but don’t be put off because everyone drives slow & someone always ‘gives way’ if you don’t know whose right of way it is)
Best city break we have ever done - because of the weather - expensive yes but worth it............BUT we had perfect weather (we’ll nearly)

Norway,nikkiswfc,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"We have just returned from a trip to tromso, what a beautiful place. We stayed at the clarion collection with hotel on the harbour. A very central location, all the hotels are a short 15min transfer from the airport. There is so much to do, we did dog sledding, reindeer hearding, we did a night trip doing a northern lights chase.
There are lots of places to book these activities but be aware that we were told to be careful where we book as alot are false and don't take you to the places they promise and then charge you half price to go again the following evening to do a second chase. We looked at previous success rates of chases and decided from there which company to use.
Tronso isn't a cheap place we were paying on average 196nok for two beers, that's equivalent to £19.60. Alot of the hotel bars are cash free bars and only accept debit and credit cards. Alot of the shops and bars also prefer you to pay with your card too.
The dog sledding is a must do, the expierence was everything we expected and more again it's pricey as is everything in Norway, there are plenty of restaurants and places to eat and the bars are open till late/early morning.
Tromso is a very relaxed and friendly place the locals are very welcoming and speak very good English. I would recommend a trip to tromso if your wanting to see the northern lights, they call it the capital of the northern lights, with lots of places and recommendations of places to get the best displays

Tromso was once the capital city of Norway but only for 38 days!! This town boasts of the worlds northernmost university and hence a lively nightlife. It is also the most expensive city in Norway.

The centuries old wooden houses, the Artic Cathedral with its peaked roof, the Polaria Aquarium, Polar Museum, the cable car and the long summer days are some of the attractions of this northern town.

We took a flight from Oslo to Tromso which was a good choice. The city has plethora of hotel options for every budget.

The Rib Boat Tour by night from 11pm to 1:30am is the best way to see the glory of the Midnight Sun in this part of the world - an unforgettable experience.

take a trip up the cable car for the best views (weather permitting) allow plantry of time to take some of the walks on the top of the hills. A pass for all attractions is little more than the cost of the cable car so worth buying

The surrounding fjords were simply stunning; so beautiful it made my eyes hurt. We were very lucky to be able to go further North with GreenGold safari and we saw the breath-takingly beautiful aurora. It wasn't the light show of the tourist brochures due to some cloud cover, but a window opened and there she was in all her sparkling glory. I cried because it was something I have always wanted to see and I didn't care that it wasn't the full show, I just felt incredibly lucky to see it at all.

We went whale-watching with North Sailing on their electric schooner, The Opal, and I cried again. At one point we were surrounded by Orca and Humpback whales, even an Orca youngster with its mum and dad. And let's not forget the eagles.... White-Tailed Sea Eagles, not one.... five!

I didn't go to Norway to shed a bucket-load of tears, but I did. The place is magical and it has had a profound effect on me. Do yourself a huge favour and just go. You won't regret it and it may just change your life.

Our guide, Leonardo, came to pick us up at the hotel on time and welcomed us in the new adventure. He was really kind and made the trip really interesting with his stories about the artic natures and the local legends.
We travelled with a minivan for 8 guests and it was cozy and comfortable. We saw a lot of wildlife, like elks, reindeers and whales.
What I really loved was the stop on beach at Sommaroya Island: it was so fantastic to walk on the black sand and to look at the white sea that get lost and mixed with the white mountains dominating the coast.
We even made a picnic on the beach, the weather was a bit adverse but it was anyway fun and exciting.
An unforgettable trip!

Since it was December she really took pains to ensure we saw all that we could see in the limited daylight hours. We went to Sommeroy and stopped at scenic fishing villages on the way. We even got to try sledding! The fish soup was delicious and filling. But leave some room for the fluffy waffles for afternoon tea. She even stopped at a supermarket and advised us the best products to buy for souvenirs. Weather wasn't the best but with Edel, she ensured we got the best value out of the day.",Dec 2016
Norway,Andy W,Tromso Fjords,5.0,Before I flew out to Tromsø I had already booked one daytime fjord trip and after it had finished I swiftly booked another. The mountains and fjords around Tromsø (like a lot of Norway) are simply stunning and that's before you get to seeing whales off the island of Kvaløya and the tropical looking beaches of Sommarøya. I'd consider a fjord trip a must for anyone visiting Tromsø - I can't wait to come back in the summer and do some more exploring in the midnight sun.,Dec 2016

Norway,Vidya,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Took a 5 hour trip with Delphin of Wandering Owl and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We were a family of 4 adults and a young 4 year old. Delphin drove us around some stunning spots, patiently waited until we took photographs at every stunning turn. We drove to a small quaint fishing village with its own small harbour and then onto the fjords. We trekked up a small mountain and it was a fantastic view of 2 fjords on either side of the land mass. Delphin is a great guide to travel with - he has loads of info and what is most heart warming - he baked us all fresh oatmeal cookies and a thermos of piping hot chocolate to drink. The hot chocolate was to die for - creamy and delicious. For lunch he got us sandwiches and made hummus specially for the one vegetarian in our group! Though we were to return at 3, Delphin didn't mind all the delays because we were making photo stops everywhere! We got back only at 4pm. We had a wonderful and a very memorable trip with Delphin to the Kvaloya Fjords. Would definitely recommended to all.

Regardless of how you visit these fjords, or others in Norway, they are spectacular - breathtaking - a MUST see in your lifetime if you can. It is rare that one can sit back and just take everything in and not be bored this is the case with these fjords.

Norway,AngelsMtWilson,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"We traveled for 4 nights from Bergen to Tromso on the MS Kong Herald, by Hurtigruten, we had no idea on what to expect as we had never been on a ship before, we chose MS Kong Herald, Hurtigruten as it had been completely refirbed this, year only a few months ago, plus as it is quite a bit smaller than the rest of the fleet we thought it might be a better experience. We are so glad we made this decision as this is a beautiful ship, the lounge areas are very tastefully done and the beds were more comfortable than we had had in any hotel room for a while! We could only get two single beds in an outside Polar room on floor 3 with our own bathroom, this type of room had the larger big square window which is much better and less claustrophobic than an inside Polar with no Window or a tiny porthole! We knew the rooms would be small, but honestly for a ship these were very nicely appointed rooms and very comfortable.
The fiords were absolutely breathtaking and actually the whole voyage, I felt like I had to pinch myself, it was hard to believe I was there witnessing it all in its absolute splendour! Norway is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world, and for us this was a must see and we cannot recommend this trip more highly.
We can not speak highly enough about the staff they were all so lovely and helpful, the bar man Ludwig was especially fantastic, he is such a lovely soul, extremely kind and giving with a great sense of humour, he added that special thing to our voyage that made our experience even better and we thank him for that very much. We also have to give Martin a big mention as he was so terrific and helpful. We paid for the breakfast and the buffet dinners, not lunch as we thought this would be enough, and it was, if you needed anything else in the middle of the day you can buy it from the two coffee shops on floors 4 or 7. The food was all exeptional in every way, beautifully plated and served, the wait staff work so hard and do everything with a smile and a great heart.
The only complaint I would have about this boat was that it is also used as a ferry service- which I believe they are talking about changing, so only once thank God the ship was way over crowded and the heavily paying passengers couldn't get a seat anywhere, I was a bit upset about this as I didn't like seeing my 80yr old friends stuck in the hallways between the lounge rooms sitting on ledges, we just went to bed for an afternoon sleep to avoid the crush! If the boat was like this the whole time it would have been a complete nightmare! Hopefully change is coming for this?
Again this being said it is a truly gorgeous ship and is run like absolute clockwork very professionally, we could not recommend this voyage more highly, for us the 4 nights was the perfect amount, although we could have done more we may have ended up rolling off the boat as we were not getting enough exercise and the food was so fantastic!

With snow still lying on the mountains and all around a lush green, the contrast is amazing. Rivers and waterfalls are in full flow and give a wonderful vibrancy to the whole environment. Even on cloudy days it has an 'ethereal' air about it. The clean, clear, fresh air makes photography with the most basic camera, or phone easy, producing excellent sharp images.

They even give you a printed timetable with the buses and the changes you have to make to catch the next bus.
We went to the fjords on a windy snowy day but we still got a good image of them. The sky was clear sometimes, as the weather around Tromso changes quickly.
The bus trip cost around 250 NOK for two persons. The view from the bus is also beautiful because the bus is going through the fjords.

We actually saw many tour vans around and they were basically stopping in the same spots than us. The good thing on not being in a tour is you can stop in as many places as you want and as many times as you want. We even saw some reindeers.

It was worth the effort (and the brisk morning air).

She picked us up from where we stayed, and explained the history of the town, showed us all the different attractions along the drive. She is very caring and motherly. Every time when we get up and down from the minivan, she always asked if we are ok, if we are cold, if everything is fine... She even helped my friend to clear the snow from her shoe and her socks! She was worried if we got cold..

We enjoyed the trip very much! We strongly encouraged everyone who visits Tromso to take a fjord tour with her!

You wouldn't think that there would be much different to see between one Fjord and the next, but when you take the time to do a tour, you will find that each one offers a something little different.

Norway,Rashid Y,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Once you are in Tromsoya, you can easily see the fjords. If you are game to drive out to the 'whale island' Kvaloya, you may be rewarded with a spectacle of orcas and humpbacks. We had the opportunity to go whale-watching with a tour group that took us on a rescue boat out in the waters early in the morning. We were properly dressed with expert advise on what and how to wear the cold weather suits and the appropriate goggles and boots. That morning, it snowed and the waters were choppy and it also rained all at once in one sitting. Depending on how you treat life's experiences, it was one I would certainly do again. I have motion sickness and all I needed to do was to avoid looking at things in the boat when the boat is moving counter to what I see (that is usually what triggers many instances of motion sickness). Sometimes it helps to close the eyes too but that is not what you want to do during whale-watching! Hah! I was taking videos of the orcas and there was a point where we saw three 'fins' lurking above the waters together in unison and we presumed that this was a family of two adults with a calf. With the fjords on either sides, we kept feeling that we were nicely nestled in a bay although we knew that this was not the case. Nonetheless, it was safe and an experience of a life time!

A day later, we took an excursion to the fjords with a tour group, called Chasing Lights which also conducts very good activities for viewing the awe-inspiring aurora borealis, and went to Kvaloya and then to Ersfjord, Kaldfjord and Grøtfjord. We had a few stops at the 'Large Lake' and the 'Little Lake' which were both frozen. We managed to get to the 'little lake' to walk on. There were many photo opportunities and the scenic view of the vast vista of the fjords meeting the open seas nearby, was staggering! While it would be ideal to come here in good weather to catch a glimpse of whales and getting great scenic photos, it can be quite a challenge during snowy weathers. In heavy snow, your vision can be as little as one meter ahead of you. We were blessed with fleeting moments of patchy clear skies and the snowing stopped for us to admire the fjords in their full glory. Should you do it? Why, yes of course! Why else would you brave the Arctic Circle if not to take this leap of faith and experience the charm of the polar terrain and life? Tips: Keep a lookout for reindeer and the ever-shy moose as you drive along the fjords. Have spiked footwear for better traction while walking or risk slipping like I did... many times.

Definitely you have to see:
Sørfjorden (Kattfjord) ... it is little bit far from Tromso, but worth to see. At the end, there is a Summer island - Sommarøy, connected by bridge. On this island, Tromso companies are organising parties, to be outside the city and they can have fun without to be seen by neighbors.
Ersfjord ... most beautiful one. Don't miss it, it is very close to the citz, like 20 minutes driving in winter on snow.Speechless views.

Norway,Louise D,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"I caught an afternoon coastal ferry from Tromso to Skervjoy. This took 2 hours and fifteen minutes through the Lyngen Alps area of Troms province. This is a stunning part of the Norwegian coastline, and even though the coastal ferry was a catamaran and therefore a bit bumpy this did not diminish in any way from the view of endless mountains rising from the sea, although at points in the journey it made taking photos a bit tricky: - I now have a couple of photos of my thumb for instance!! Arrival at Skervjoy allowed for a quick meal and drink in the Maritime Hotell and then the Hurtigrutern steamer arrived, sounded its whistle and the passengers queued up to board this piece of Norwegian maritime history and a lifeline for the outlying communities. The cruise back to Tromso took 4 hours and passed through the Lyngen alps once more, albeit at a later time so it was possible to see the sun setting or at least getting very close to it as this was still the season for the midnight sun. Watching the evening light playing on the mountains, waterfalls and sea as we sailed past was gorgeous. The ship was comfortable and it would have been possible to have eaten in the restaurant or the cafe if required. Otherwise you could sit on the promenade deck and watch the world go by without a coat, or stay on deck wrapped up and in the air - This is the arctic after all! Bear in mind if you are taking photographs not to jump when around 21.15 the northbound Hurtigruten vessel passes on its journey. Both vessels of the fleet ""render passing honours"" to each other by blowing 5 times on their whistles. This is loud and if you don't know it's about to happen can make you jump and this is not the voyage where you want to throw your camera over the side!! This is one of the best parts of the Hurtigruten voyage and you don't need to pay for the whole cruise to experience it. You arrive in Tromso at 23.45.

Sadly, again, we arrived on a Sunday, so all the shops were closed and even some of the cafes didn't open until the afternoon. This meant that the only cafe that was open was full and difficult to get in - in fact, we didn't and just went back to the ship which was a shame.

However, we enjoyed a walk around the town and the old church in town was lovely. We also visited the Polar museum which was on the small side, but worth a visit.

Don't think we saw Tromso at its best, but,nevertheless, enjoyed the visit.

Norway,madeleinei2015,Tromso Fjords,4.0,"I joined a Northern lights tour (2Days). I was really lucky to have Aurore as my group leader on the first day of northern lights chasing. The weather conditions were not good, her persistence and enthusiasm of her job made my light chasing successful and memorable. The light chasing was a long one (longer than everyone had expected), everyone was so tired on the way back to Tromso, so was Aurore. She is a professional guide who was driving us back to our hotels. It was a long and tiresome drive as we traveled farther than we had planned. I was really impressed not just the lights but also her attitudes and the services she gave us.
I also joined a day trip (Fjord excursion)with a guide called Jannika. It was just a trip of me and the guide. I felt a bit uneasy as I was the only person in the tour. I thought there would be problems in our communication, not because of the language but our cultural differences. My worries were soon gone as the guide was really nice. When we were chatting, I learned a lot of from her and her culture too. When the trip nearly came to an end, she also took me to one more place as we still had time. At that moment, I felt like I was having a trip with my friend. Unfortunately I didn't take a photo with her.
The trips were a bit expensive (for overseas student like me) but I think it worth the money. The service, the quality of the trips and also the warranty (I remember one of the light chasing trips was unsuccessful. Even we set off and traveled to some distances. We still got most of our money back for the trip.)

Norway,Thomas L,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Travelled with about 40 friends from Lofoten to Kirkenes aboard MS Midnatsol. We could not have been happier with the energetic and skilful attentions of the staff and - the crowded breakfast buffet aside - with the food and drink arranged for our party. It seems that the Hurtigruten line is introducing commercial management to look after customers and to leave the captain and his team alone to drive the ship. This vessel was quite new and, to us, sat comfortably between a luxury vessel and (as historically it was) a cargo and passenger ferry service. It also seems that the line is looking towards introducing a permanent ""business class"" or ""executive floor"" section, with better food and drink options and segregated areas, and to expanding its routes to (inter alia) South America and the Antarctic. I know we will be looking out for this in the future. Oh yes it was delightful to look out on the fjords, the small towns and, ultimately, over the Barents Sea before pulling into Kirkenes. Nordkapp cold and stark but well worth an excursion. Tromso also worth a look.

Norway,Janet N,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"What is amazing about the Norwegian Fijords and more specifically the ones seen in Tromso is the fact that they seem alive with the ever changing light shaping and coloring them in rich earthy tones.

I had the privilege to be on a holiday in a luxury beach house (available for rent) , 2 meters from the ocean, overlooking a gorgeous landscape which you can frequently see in postcards and magazines- majestic fiords, attraction to nature lovers and also those who are into extreme sports, mountain hiking or simply want to walk around and pick some berries.

I could not stop taking pictures of the amazing nature in front of me every 15 min or so - the view kept changing for the better and I could not have enough of it. The sun in the summer never sets and keeps coloring the sky and the fiords in vivid striking tones and shades. Not to mention in the winter the Northern lights create unimaginable colors in the sky that you can only stay in owe and admire, wondering if this is the same world as we know it.

Norway,Allan J,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Having been unable to see the northern lights in 2013 in Iceland we decided to embark on another Arctic Adventure in Feb/March 2015.
Flew from London Gatwick with Norwegian air and stayed 5 days in Tromso at the Radisson Blu and then headed south on the Hurtigrutten ship,MS MIDNATSOL
What a fantastic trip...although we still never managed the northern lights because of cloud cover!
5 days in Tromso was great...managed 2 trips with Wandering Owl...northern light and trekking over the snow with snow shoes at a remote location. Both great experiences.
We also went to various museums; to the Arctic cathedral and up the mountain in the cable car and the only really sunny day. It was a lot warmer than we planned and we brought far to much gear with us. Tromso was +4 to -2..not the -10 to 17 that I was expecting. The ice in the streets was melting although shoe grips were helpful.
Tromso is a great city worth 3 or 4 days. We chose the Radisson Blu for it's location..about 200 meters from the docking place of the Hurtigrutten and other cruise ships. 300 meters from the tourist office. I chose the southern journey to Bergen because I'd heard that the trip up to Kirkness could be a bit rough. We were a bit worried that as we had a lot of bags that our cabin on the Midnatsol may be too small..we had booked an unspecified outside cabin. On the day we were due to sail, having never been on a Hurtigruten ship... we visited the MS Finnmarken before she left..to see the layout and compare. The staff on board both ships were superbly helpful. Whilst on her they called the Midnatsol to see if there were any suites available, We managed to upgrade to an MG suite...at 1500 NOK a day extra. Most of them on the journey south were empty and the extra £120 a night was well spent..comparison from a small cabin to an apartment with a scenic bay window..dressing room, bath, lounge and a big double bed! plus you get the coffee deal thrown in and your own coffee/ tea facilities...(The coffee deal is worth £79 for 2)
Having a suite to retreat to made the trip absolutely awesome. The journey south was one we will remember for a long time..fantastic scenery, small communities. We were never bored.
The Midnatsol is a good ship although in summer the addition of the swimming pool on the Finnmarken would be an asset. We traveled half board. Great breakfast and a sit down evening meal with 3 courses. Lunch we had in the 24 hour cafe which was good.
We stayed in Bergen overnight and flew to London the next day.
Overall a fantastic journey

Norway,grapow,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Anyone using this ""cruise line"" should be aware that it is an essential transport service for the people of Norway first and a cruise line second. This is not meant to indicate any dissatisfaction at all but the general facilities on board fall way below even the most basic of cruise ships around the world. Because this trip was arranged to celebrate my wife's special birthday, we paid the extra to have a suite which was fantastic! Although we understand there are only two of this quality and a couple (?) of junior suites also. The food was good generally although not surprisingly since we were in Norway masses of cod & salmon on every meal.
One word of advice for anyone doing as we did in ending the cruise in Kirkenes at the Snow Hotel, we strongly suggest you take some other day time excursions as there isn't much to do after you have enjoyed a dog sleigh ride, until dinner in the evening.
However, a wonderful holiday, the staff were amazing and the Northern Lights even helped out by making 4 consecutive appearances!

Norway,Ian B,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"Tromsø, a small and beautiful Norwegian town which in winter overlooks a freezing cold Fjord, the beautifully lit Arctic Cathedral and majestic snow covered mountains, accessible by cable car. Oh, and there's the aurora borealis nearby, possibly, too.

After digging around where best to see the aurora I chose Norway. I booked a relatively cheap flight from London via Oslo to Tromsø and here's how to do things as cheaply as possible, like the rest of Scandinavia, Norway is terribly expensive.....

- I've ""seen the light""s on each of my three visits (December/February and March)
- Pre-book a hire car at the airport, they are all fitted with snow tyres which work - unlike a brief spell of snow in the UK which stops the entire country.....
- A hire car saves you expensive taxi transfers to/from the airport
- The tour buses take the same roads (there aren't too many to choose from) @ 80-100GBP per person
- A suggested route with your hire car, the main road to Finland is the E8, take a right hand turn at Skibotn. This road is AKA the Northern Light Trail......
- You may have to take the same lengthy trip each night for your stay. Night 1 - no luck. Night 2 at the border with Finland (E8 road) there were two coach loads of hi-vis clad tripod photographers all stood in the snow waiting.....no show. Night 3 at the same place, the Northern lights were shimmering and curtaining from a small glow on the horizon to a fiery finale.
- Wrap up. Wrap up more and keep a full tank of diesel - it hit -25 Celsius the night we saw the amazing lights.
- Sneakily make sandwiches at the breakfast buffet bar and top up a flask - There aren't many (if any) places to eat en-route. If you want to eat at the Statoil service station, hot dog and fries will cost the price of a 3 course meal in Blighty.
- Be prepared to wait......that small glow in the sky will transform into something spectacularly amazing!
- Take a camera with a Bulb mode, (or a timer of at least 30 seconds), a remote lead or use the camera timer. If you don't want to take a huge Manfrotto tripod, take a smaller £15 from the airport or Jessops one you can put on the roof of your car - you can't hold the camera with your hands.
- You'll have to experiment but a camera with bulb/30 second shutter with a small tripod and timer will take the photo's to amaze your friends and family

Hope this helps!

If arriving on one of the cruise ships take a short walk over the bridge and admire the new cathedral then a further 10 minutes walk will take to the cable car base.

Our visit in November was wonderful the trip in the car up the side of the snowy Mount Storsteinen brought us to a winter wonderland at the top we enjoyed the dramatic and breath-taking views while walking in sometimes knee high snow. You can walk to the top (or down) if you just want to take the cable car one way. If weather is not very good check that the cable car is running. The café at the top offers good food and drink (hot or cold) and free Wi-Fi to send your pictures to everyone.

The town is interesting with the usual bars, cafes and retail shops. Lots of trips available in the area but the hours we spent enjoying ourselves in the area we didn't need to travel far.

Norway,aquaporin,Tromso Fjords,5.0,The Fjords are simply stunning. If you have traveled to northern Norway then you must go and see them. There is a boat by the tourist information desk that takes an hour to get to Finnese and the scenery is beautiful. You don't need to book this in advance so go when the sky is clear. Visibility is severely reduced in any form of bad weather.,Oct 2014
Norway,Rohit S,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"If you have planned a visit to Norway, you should surely plan to visit the Fjords. Search for any photos in Google and you can see the awe inspiring nature's creations.

You can take a speed boat which starts at around 2.45 PM near the Information center in Tromso . The speed boat will take you to Skjervøy and take around 2.00 Hrs. Enroute you will see the enchanting, beautiful and unbelievable Fjords. The scenery is so peaceful, The cold air takes all the things out of your mind and make you really enjoy the mother nature.

During the time we had in Skjervøy we spent our time in moving around the city and near the dock there is a cute little cafe. We had our dinner inside the cafe.

Took the Hurtigruten cruise back to Tromso at 7.45 PM. The cruise was huge, atleast the largest I have ever seen. This will take 4 hrs to reach Tromso. Since it was a clear sky we saw the lovely and magical northern lights.

You should take this trip if you are in Tromso.

Norway,Digidiverdeb,Tromso Fjords,4.0,"We wanted to experience the Norwegian Fjords so we took the advise of the tourist information desk and took the fast ferry from Tromso to Finnsnes at a cost of approx £25 each one way, this trip took around 1.5 hours and when you arrive at Finnsnes you disembark and immediately join the Hurtigruten cruise ship to make the return journey to Tromso which takes about 3 hours. Unfortunately when we went to buy our ticket we were asked for photo ID and my husband had left his wallet in the hotel, for a minute we thought I would be making the trip back on my own but in the end they accepted his passport number, so if you take this trip ensure you have some form of ID with you! The return trip cost about the same so for around £100 for the two of us it was quite an expensive afternoon and sadly the weather was not good so didn't show the Fjords off to their best but it was worth the experience!

One even told us to stay on the bus as it's a better view on the other side.

It takes about 45 mind to get there by bus, but you drive through some lovely scenery. The fjord at the end was beautiful. We went in early autumn and there was snow on the peaks of the mountains leading into the fjord.

Norway,CKD62,Tromso Fjords,5.0,What a beautiful scene and so peaceful. Lovely to sit beside and have a drink. We had a meal at a little restaurant which also had a gift shop overlooking the fjords. This was situated in a residential area so very quiet and tranquil.,Oct 2013
Norway,waterfall2010,Tromso Fjords,4.0,"Our drive and ferry rides through the Lyngen fjords and mountains was hindered by the rain and clouds but it would've been absolutely beautiful if good weather.

Norway,MUNIMJI,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"We took the Tromso fjord cruise that started at 2 pm and returning by 1145 pm. The trip was combination the public bus taking us for a 4 hour ride to Skarvjoy, that not only drives one through the scenic roads, most of them alongside the sea but also travelling with the bus in 2 ferry crossings. We were advised to take the 2 pm trip instead of 4 pm trip that ends at Skarvjoy, so that we could spend about 90 minutes in the town before starting the nearly 5 hours trip in Hurtigruten ship to Tromso. However when we reached the town, realised that most of the shops/restaurants have closed except for the odd COOP shop. The town itself was close to 9 degree C in the evening. But the cruise ( do not know whether I should call it a ferry ride), was a memorable one. For the first time in my life, have seen the sun setting around 1030 pm and the one hour from 10 pm to 11 pm, the sky was painted with the ever changing colours of black, blue, crimson red, orange, light blue and peach green. The cooler climate (luckily I stayed closer to the engine room to get the warmth) while surveying the beautiful sky. Half-heartedly, had to get off the ferry at 1145 pm at Tromso but carried along the memory of one of the fabulous trips for time to come.

But then my wife and I explored the fjords west of Tromso. It is now my favorite place in the entire world!!!
If you never venture outside of Tromso island, you've missed the greatest part. If you've come this far to the top of the world, you may as well rent a car or hire a private guide to take you along the road from Tromso to Sommaroy. You will see water as clear and as blue as Fiji with mountains as stunning as Alaska and Antarctica.

Norway,wldtravels,Tromso Fjords,3.0,"Our cruise ship docked across the harbor from downtown, which was about 4km (2.5mile) from the Arctic Cathedral across the bridge. Town was another 2km from the Arctic Cathedral, and the cable car was the same distance in a slightly different direction. Shuttles to town center were available for a small charge. The path out of the port and toward town was clearly marked for the first mile...then the bridge was visible enough to guide us the rest of the way. Unfortunately the weather was drizzly all day and the temp never got above 40 deg (F) or 4 deg (C). If there was a dock closer to town, it was not obvious.

We walked to Arctic Cathedral, town, and to the cable car. We wanted to try the brew pub in town, and regret that we opted to head back to the ship to avoid possible weather closing in instead. Tromso is the largest town in the Arctic Circle and the cable car and cathedral were the highlights. There is a fee to go into the cathedral (since we didn't try the brews). We would have seen a lot more and spent more time there if the weather had been better.

There was a botanical garden a few blocks from the port where the ship was docked. It looked nice but the weather prevented us from walking into it. In all, there was enough to do, but the weather didn't do the town justice while we were there.

We got a taxi for 6 to the cable car, nearly the first to the top, fantastic views, a lovely restaurant there, we didn't use as to early. After a walk round, need sturdy shoes, we descended just as cruise groups arriving crammed in the cars! Then we did a pleasant downhill walk to the cathedral, cost £4 to go in, so only a couple went in, very plain but lovely window. We then walked over the bridge, and were glad to find a Burger King in the high street! For the free wifi, which worked, had a cold drink. And then looked round the shops. We got the shuttle bus back to the ship, quite happy with our day, took our time , and much cheaper than the ships groups

Norway,IanSouthern,Tromso Fjords,5.0,Don't bother spending an arm and a leg to see the fjords - a three hour guided trip will set you back about 200USD per person and take you up and down one fjord (about 30km). Take a cheaper option of a ferry - we took the hurtigruten ferry from Tromso to Skervoy and back - five hour sightseeing covering more than 100km of fjords costing about 60USD per person. Also hire a bicycle for the day and cycle to ersfjordbotn for the most beautiful and unspoilt fjord in all of Norway,Jun 2014
Norway,ilovecorndogs,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"We took the ferry to Nord Langenen - we had to pay them extra to stop there on the way to Skjervoy!

They promised they would come back for us 3 hours later - which they did.

It was so beautiful to just walk up the coast of this tiny town. Beautiful seabirds, crustaceans, snow on the top of the mountains.

Incredibly peaceful - what a beautiful place

Norway,fur312,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"We took a cabin in Esfjordbotn (http://www.ersfjordbotn.no/index-eng.html) which presented a better alternative to the rather expensive Hotels in Tromso.
I also offeres the big advantage of being already ""outthere"" where the actions is happening and having the control over what to do and when.
Yes you can pick a hotel in the city, and arrange for a Aurora hunting trip....and pay dearly for it, and with luck you see somethin...or not!
Or you get there by yourself, get a glass of wine out of the fridge, and sit outside your cabin and enjoy the lights as they pass above your head!
The timing we chose was in the middle of the winter to enjoy the experience of the sun...that is not there, cause it doesnt come out!!!
Rent a car to get there and to make your trip really worth it. Pack a picknick bag and just go out a ride along the complete island! On your trip you will not only see breathtaking fjords and landscapes....be aware that those fjords are full of Wales, yes and you also dont have to book a wale hunting trip in a hotel to see them....get the car; get going, take your binoculars and off you go!!! Talk to the friendly people you meet on the road, they will surely give you hints of where to look for what.
AND the best of it...even though you are about 300km into the polar circle, you know the teperature remains fairly warm, with the lowest ever at -25! In our case, it was colder in Frankfurt during all that time than in Tromso!!!!
This is something you will never forget...providing you are the right person for this kind of experience.

Norway,traveladdictibz,Tromso Fjords,5.0,"We spent a few days in Tromsø in the beginning of March, of course for the Northern Lights, which we did see twice in all their magnificence that eludes and mocks all attempts of description.
But we wanted to explore the countryside as well, and we did not want to rent a car - at the time of our stay, the weather was unnaturally mild, the roads melted and then froze over again every night. Getting around by public transport means time-consuming, clumsy connections. (The legendary roundtrip ""Bus to Skjervøy - Hurtigruten ferry back"" only works on Fridays.)
That's why one morning we opted for seeing the landscape from the water. Several short daytime trips are offered, starting in center city from the Floating jetty at Stortorget. We chose the ""Arctic Sea Cruise"" trip from 10:00 to 13:00, and the ride was an unforgettable experience, worth every penny even though not cheap. Equipped with water- and windproof Fisherman's suits (included in the price), we did not go inside one single time, so fascinated were we by the awe-inspiring snowy mountains slowly gliding past in complete silence. We stopped near the end of a small fjord, at the edge of the Ice, and on the way back the boat crunched through a thin skin of ice just forming - almost eerie. Even a whale accompanied us for a few minutes.
Combine this with a cablecar trip to Fjellheisen to see the mountains from an elevated point,
and there's an easy way, especially if you don't have much time, to get a glimpse of what this gigantic, silent landscape is like.

The time went fast as we crossed the museum between the houses. Some was open and you could see the old age and how people used to live in Norway. But plenty was closed and only look into throug the windows.

The powerful view was the Stavkirke, the old wooden church and also the house of early 1900s. Where you could see the kitchen and living room. These places was amazing.

You could also see old farming building from various of places of Norway. You could pass by even a piece of historical Oslo. With a old Kolonial (shop) and gas-station too. You got the feeling of the old Oslo by going there. Like going into a time capsul. Just for a brief moment, as you could even buy candies made for the age and time.

If you have a few hours and want to walk in history. Especially on a sunny day or a day without rain. This is a place to visit. To see the houses of old and also the old ways of Norwegians. Its worth it, it really is. We spent two hours inside there and we didn't think about it.

As you are riding past you realise this is a museum that will take a while to explore, all in the open air, examples of Norwegian living from nearly a 1000 years ago to almost present day. The Stave Church is impressive, I am not religious but can appreciate this building inside and out. To me the most interesting part is the 50's-70's apartment building as it brings back memories even to someone from the UK (the 70's anyway . . . i'm not that old!) Everything written is in English as well as Norwegian. Some of the buildings have so much craft put into them, ok some are a bit repetitive but I think this place wants to preserve as much as possible.

Entrance fee is KR160 for adults. But it’s free for OsloPass holder.

The concept of an open air museum in the middle of the forest works like magic. Has buildings and farm houses from different eras and regions of Norway. We walked in and out of the buildings and enjoyed every minute of its. The museum staff, young men and women in traditional clothes were friendly and helpful. There is a lot to see and learn about Norway and Norwegians, all in beautiful surrounding and as part of a process of a walk and discovery. Nice indoor exhibits as well.
Has a cafe, it offers soft ice, light meals, baked goods and refreshments.

Norway,mdh2040,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"The moment I saw the wooden church, I knew I saw what I expected of historic Norway. Norway has only 28 of these wooden churches left to only 1 in Sweden. Wow. The church was small with a porch wrapping around 3 sides. The inside was small with beautiful carvings around the altar. The roof was just beautiful and majestic. The homes of the different classes was quite interesting too. Most homes had a central room and perhaps a bedroom or two off the main one. One or two homes had an upstairs. In one home, the guide in appropriate costume, sang a folk song. In another home, the guide in costume read a fairytale (The 3 Billy Goats Gruff) in both Norwegian for the small child there and in English for the students taking English and for us, the American tourists. The barns were fairly large and up on higher ground with a sloping entrance for the animals to climb in. There was a lot to see and even with almost 3 hours there, we did not get to see it all well. Do see this museum. It is delightful for all ages.

It was a pleasant trip over and the day only got better once we arrived at the museum. (FYI...it is a hike from the ferry to the museum, so be prepared to walk!) The property is lovely. It is spread out over several acres and it was a beautiful walk up to the Stavkirke from Gol. It is well worth the visit just to see the old Stave Church! I recommend going early in the day as later it becomes very busy. We stayed just ahead of the big crowds and were able to see Norwegian folk dancers, others dressed in bunads and traditional dress who gave us information about life in the time period they represented, a woman with a very old Bible in old Norwegian, and workers dressed to farm. It was a wonderful experience!

They include quality displays of the sort you expect in a museum, but also include a lot of nice surprises. There are dwellings that represent many hundreds of years of progress from profoundly simple places to current times with immigrants bringing new cultural influences. There are also many small touches that she’s real light on cultural changes. For example, there is a lovely piece of storage furniture, that at one time signaled that a family had moved into the middle class. It was the first thing in the house that you did not sit on, eat off or sleep on - sort of cultural milestone.

In the summer season (1 May till 14 September) actors in traditional costumes welcome the public in these houses every day, and there are carriage-rides and traditional baking demonstrations during the weekends.

In the winter season (15 September till 30 April) the focus lies on the indoor exhibitions but you can still walk around the outdoor park as well, only there are no hosts in traditional costumes.

My husband and I visited on a weekend at the end of May 2019 and we enjoyed our visit immensely !
You can easily spend 2 to 4 hours or even a whole day here.

You can reach the museum by ferry from Radhusbrygge pier 3, first stop: Dronningen + 650 meter walking distance.
Or you can take the bus 30 from downtown Oslo: it stops in front of the museum.

Walking distance between the Norsk Folkemuseum and the Viking Ship Museum is 400 meter.
If you want to continue to the Fram Museum, Maritime Museum and/or Kontiki museum, you could walk (+/-1,5km) or take the bus 30 for 5 stops/5minutes to those museums.

The ferry, bus and entrance to the museum are free if you have an Oslo Pass.
There are 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour Oslo Passes.
It depends on what kind of tourist you are whether or not you can benefit from buying an Oslo Pass.
If you don't intend to visit many museums in one day, it can be cheaper to pay the normal price at te entrance of the one museum that you do want to visit.

At the entrance of the Folkemuseum there is a Cafe Arkadia where you can have lunch, but we bought freshly baked cinnamon rolls from a stand in the museum park, which were delicious.
We also spotted a BBQ at the festival grounds at the far end of the park, but both the cinnamon bakery and the BBQ might have been pop-ups, because there was a fair about traditional building techniques going on in the museum park at the time of our visit.

We highly recommend a visit to this museum !

Norway,UsaJules,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It is an outdoor museum to view life through the ages in Norway. Many different types of architecture are represented here along with demonstrations and people in historic dress. We especially enjoyed the dancing and music playing by the young people in historic dress. Very colorful photography and interesting to learn about the lifestyle in Norway.
They have a nice cafe. You could easily spend hours here walking around and seeing all that they have to offer. We consider this a must see in Oslo.",Jul 2019
Norway,TWal1,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"The National Folk Museum is worth a visit. It has an excellent collection of buildings and artefacts from different places in Norway. We timed our visit, by chance, with a free guided tour which lasted for about 45 minutes. This tour guide explained life for families who were farming, and the features of their buildings. The tour concluded with an excellent explanation of the Stave Church. This tour gave us sufficient information to appreciate the remainder of the Museum and added to our enjoyment of the day. There is much to see here so allow up to half a day.
Thanks for your vote.",Jul 2019
Norway,Bobh47167,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,I had visited the Skansen Museum in Stockholm a few years ago. These are akin but the Folkemuseum is much more extensive.

There are docents in period dress at the buildings describing or reenacting activities from the past. There is a cafe where you can get light snacks and drinks. The museum is easily accessible by a 20 minutes city bus ride. The area around this museum has several other museum. Definitely a place to go to get immersed into Norwegian culture.

Norway,Celsa G,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"While is Oslo we visited the Norsk Folkemuseum. It was a blast. Sounds odd to say that but it's not a museum where you walk inside a building and see things. This is a total different experience. You walk around a village and see the houses, barns, farm animals, and so much more. There are people who work there showing how daily life was lived. They are happy to answer your questions about how life for Norwegians was hundreds of years ago. We also spoke to a camp counselor. They have a day camp for children. The children learn about their culture and live life as a Norwegian child back in the day. They eat breakfast made in a cauldron and dress in traditional clothes. It was fascinating to hear this bit of information because we were there as your typical tourist and didn't know it's also a day camp for local children. Traditional dances were performed as well as singing. It was a wonderful experience. If you go to Oslo, don't miss it. Take a ferry ride over and enjoy the day.

There are many, many buildings that have been taken down from their original location all over Norway and placed in this one site as a living museum. The buildings range from 1200 to the 1930s and there are exhibits from Viking times to the 1970s.

There are many museum staff dressed in the costume of the period who are well informed and entertaining from a storyteller to country dancers.

A wonderful, wonderful day out and certainly NOT to be missed!

Norway,Asta365,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"The Norwegian folklore museum is well worth a visit for the structures that are relocated to the site, for the guides who lead tours, for the dancers and musicians who provide short programs, and for the museum that contains a good overview of artifacts and items of decorative art.

A wide array of habitations, barns, business structures, school houses, and other structures have been relocated tot he site over the the last century. Included in the collection is a maugnificent stave church which is really worth seeing. A remarkable effort has been made throughout this museum to capture the daily lives of the inhabitants. I was especially taken with an entire multi-story, multi-family ahpartment building relocated from downtown Oslo. representative apartments from the late 1800s, early 1920s/1930s, and the 1970s really help to explain the major currents in Norwegian city life. A new structure addresses the major effort spent on the rebuilding of homes in the far North of the country destroyed after a “scorched earth” order was issued by the Nazi occupiers in the waning days of WWII.

Our guide for an hour tour was a young man who was witty and insightful at the same time. Dressed in a simple costume, he really injected an appreciation of the lives of the people who occupied two farmsteads. He also really explained the stave church’s history and construction to our group. The dancers and musician expertly executed multiple native dances in a smaller square.

Finally, I was really impressed with the breadth of coverage of clothing, decorative arts, church art, and furnishings in the museum. Two exhibits are worth mentioning: an explanation of the key role family cabins play in Norwegian life and an exploration of the reemergence of traditional sweaters and knitting over the last half of the 1900s, specifically the Dale sweaters.

Four hours went by quickly for me and I could have spent another hour easily at this superb museum and center.

Norway,radx4,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"If you're in Oslo, you're probably going to visit the Norsk Folkemuseum. Do it. It's actually quite large and is a fun way to experience Norway's heritage.

One of the biggest attractions is the stave church. That was definitely a major highlight of our visit. Although all the stave churches in Norway are recreations, this one is fairly old dating back to the 19th century. The structure is highly detailed and looks incredible. The smell inside the church was fantastic -- like an insanely strong pine scent. You simply have to experience it.

The buildings by the entrance have some nice exhibits with artwork and cultural artifacts. These are a bit more like a traditional museum.

The rest of the museum has a variety of buildings dating back hundreds of years. They were fun to explore, but once you've seen a dozen old farmhouses it does tend to get a bit redundant.

If you are in Olso you simply have to visit the Norsk Folkemuseum. You will not regret it.

Norway,Conor & Patrick,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This was by far one of the best museum experiences we’ve experienced. For one, the museum is, for the most part, open air, and provides visitors with the ability to walk through the history of Norway and even to learn more about what different areas of the country look like, and why buildings look a particular way. As much as we might have wanted to explore the entire country, time and finances (silly things) kept us from visiting more than 3 different areas of Norway. The Norse Folkemuseum provided us with a great perspective of what history (and the current age) may have looked like all around the country of Norway.

How we got there: My husband and I used the Batservice Ferry company which runs a ferry from Oslo port to the major museum locations on Bygdoy. The ferries run about every 25 minutes out of Oslo port and tickets can be purchased with credit card or cash on board or at the stand at the port. The ferries are ferries with some seating on the outside to take pictures, but the trip is not very long. It’s about a 10 minute trip to the boat’s first stop at Dronningen, which is where we disembarked for the Norsk Folkemuseum. It did not seem that restrooms were available on the ferry.

From the stop at Dronningen, it’s about a 10-minute walk through the little town to the museum (my husband and I both have long legs so that time may fluctuate).

The museum was great; we did a self-guided tour of the location and were provided with a map. If we had used it, we may have been able to go as the museum would want us to, to take in the history of the country in chronological order, but it was more impressive to seek and discover the intent of the museum on our own. Many of the exhibits could be explored and all exhibits had descriptions in Norwegian and English. There are restrooms located at the beginning of the open air section.

One of the most exciting sites was the Stave Church, with architecture straight out of Disney’s Frozen. It was wonderful to explore the authentic location and is a must-see in Oslo!

The museum does have some drawbacks in that the open air experience may limit individual with disabilities from fully exploring the grounds. Most of the pathways were well-kept, but many of them were grass or gravel, which could make wheelchair access difficult.

I spent 8 hours and still felt like I didn't see everything. The museum exhibitions on folk art and Sami Culture are especially good. There is a small exhibit on hytte on the second floor of the main exhibit building that you shouldn't miss. Be aware that the urban area behind the exhibition building has many furnished interiors. I didn't realize that and ran out of time. Also, the visitor center and gift shop open early and stay open late. The hours posted on TripAdvisor are incorrect. In late May the Visitor center opens at 9am and closes at 6pm, while the exhibition buildings are open from 10 to 5. You can walk around the park after the buildings are closed if you only want to see the exteriors.

Norway,David O,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,On a rainy day to go round museums our group of four started here and what we thought would be an interesting hour in the building in urned into an excellent 2 hours when walking around the old properties which were very interesting. We could have spent longer there but needed a drink and piece of cake in the very good cafe and then on to the other museums which are in walking distance. Well worth a visit.,May 2019
Norway,martinl57,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"We always like to visit this type of ‘living museum’ and this one is excellent. We spent over four hours exploring and could of stayed longer but time was running out. Lovely cafe too, prices not bad either. Take the ferry from Oslo and a short walk to the museum. The only downside was the weather not being the best for us.",May 2019
Norway,Manfromdublin12,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,Fantastic museum and well worth a visit. Well laid out and can take a couple of hours minimum. Beautiful stave church and superb original Norwegian houses laid out in a farm setting.,May 2019
Norway,David S,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"The majority of the museum is a huge open air landscape, including hillside pathways, but first of all you come across old houses and streets from the 19th & 20th century. These are interesting but very similar to other Western/Northern European cities from that time.

The really interesting parts of the museum are when you wonder around the back and discover dozens and dozens of the old wooden houses, many with green roofs, along with examples of farmland buildings. There is also a magnificent church, The Stave Church, at the top of a slight hillside walk. A beautiful old building, partly built in the Middle Ages.

You can spend a good 2/3 hours here, especially if the weather is good. It's also free entrance if you have an Oslo Pass.

Norway,Kathryn P,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"The highlight for me of this museum was an outdoor permanent exhibition of historic Norwegian buildings that have all been preserved. I saw a Stave wooden Norwegian church. It was a massive, dark building. There were also helpful costumed staff who were only too happy to share insights about the buildings. For example, I learned that circular engravings on a door were intended to keep away evil spirits who would get lost trying to follow the endless circles. This would be a good place to take kids who are sick of museums or if you want an excuse to be in nature if the weather is nice.",May 2019
Norway,Harroljac,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,Lots to see and do especially if the weather is warm. Great for children as they have space to walk about freely and things to see touch and do. Spent four hours going back in time and to glean some thing of the Norwegian social history.,Apr 2019

Lots of different Norwegian buildings from a variety of different ages and areas of Norway. Particularly enjoyed the apartment block with all the exhibitions inside, and apartments from the 1800s to the 1970s recreated inside. So much to see and lots of information available in English. Wish we'd had more time to see the whole place properly!",May 2019
Norway,Georgia068,Norsk Folkemuseum,2.0,"Yes the buildings are restored authentically but the layout of the whole place is a mess. No chronology to help you understand each building’s place in history or in relation to each other. You wander blindly forward and back in time as you go from one to the other looking for tiny bits of English on plaques. The interiors of most are dim and closed off so apart from only one with a display, it was hard to know what you were looking at. No one seems to have thought about the poor visitor trying to make sense of it all. To make our experience worse, workers were everywhere clearly racing to get buildings roads and gardens ready for ‘the season’. Which meant we had to imagine early Norwegian life whilst walking past mini diggers and cars, tripping over cables and hoses, and with workers digging and construction. I know maintenance has to be done but why not close for a period or reduce the entry fee? I love social history and this was such a disappointment and waste of time.

Norsk folkemuseum, which is the museum of Norwegian folk culture, is located in Bygdøy. You can arrive here by ferry or by bus. The ferry seems to be a popular choice. This open-air museum has 160 historic buildings from all over Norway, mostly replicas from the 17th and 18th centuries. Arguably, the most popular attraction is the stave church.The museum also has indoor exhibits featuring handcraft items, folk costumes, Sami culture, toys, tools, and a lot more Norwegian items. There is so much to see and it's not far from the centre of Oslo.Great place for a day out . Everyone is so friendly and very knowledgeable. It’s a lovely place to take a walk as well.

It's fascinating, like being able to poke round people's houses while they are out, or have left it exactly as it was hundreds of years ago.
We went round on a sunny day and loved it. Good cafe on site too.",Apr 2019

It was fascinating to see it all.
We also had a quick peek at the displays inside the museum. This is a must see for anyone interested in Norwegian/Viking culture. We had limited time available and I would definitely go back to spend more time at this museum as well as visit the others throughout Oslo.

Norway,JRachel95,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,I highly recommend visiting this museum. I was shocked at how large it is with so many different buildings dating back to the vikings. The museum walks you through various buildings in Norway. This was a great stop for me since I am interesting in cultures and they even have a museum dedicated to learning more about life in Norway. This was a huge part of my trip and I loved getting to see the Stave Church and the Old Town.,Feb 2019

The Stave Church was the highlight - gorgeous and very different in appearance with elements of Viking architecture. We like the 1950s apartment building exhibit, the church artifacts, and the Sami culture exhibit as well. Good English signage. Short public bus ride from Oslo City Center. Well worth the visit, and would be lovely in good weather as much of the walking is out of doors.",Mar 2019

Some of the paths were hard to walk on and others blocked off.

Some building were open but others were not as though closed for winter.

There was a lot to see but I think you would need to be very keen to appreciate all the many examples of quite similar wooden buildings.

Given the high entrance charge this was a disappointment. Probably should have a reduced winter entrance fee. Much better experience at the excellent Viking Museum next door.

Norway,holidaymaddd,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"I really enjoyed this museum, probably the best museum I saw in Oslo. It is mostly outdoors, which can be a challenge in cold weather. I therefore asked the receptionist to see the must-do parts of the museum, and based on her recommendation I saw the Gamlebyen (old town), Setesdal (old farm buildings) and the Stave Church. All were outstanding, possibly Setesdal being the highlight. Make sure you get a map. Spent about 1.5hrs here. Be aware that with snow melting the path can be a little muddy.

The bus 30 from downtown to Bygdøy (stop just outside the museum), and entrance is free with the Oslo card. According to tourist information, there will be a ferry route from March onwards to Bygdøy (closed in winter).

To note, you can’t buy the Oslo card in the airport (I asked). There is a very helpful tourist information centre in the Oslo station which sells the Oslo tourist card. I have heard that you can purchase through an app, so worthwhile looking into this. Finally, when travelling to and from the airport, there is no need to take the airport express train (195 kroner one way, leaves every 10 mins), as the regular trains are almost just as quick (105 kroner each way, leaves 3 times an hour). Finally, the normal train is cheaper with the Oslo tourist card, as you only need to purchase a ticket for zones 3 and 4, as zones 1 and 2 are already covered with the Oslo card.

Staff dressed up in period clothes are in some buildings, giving you the opportunity to find out more of the social history. Some make bread in an old farmhouse, another makes cabbage broth in a poor urban cottage and there are recreatded urban tenements too (and so much more...).

Norway,Christine Patina,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"I walked to the museum from the city centre, something I wouldn't necessarily reccommend doing in winter. It takes an hour and about 20 minutes to get there by foot, however you can also take the bus from the city centre which stops in front of the Museum Café. Tickets are around 10 euros, and they have lockers available for storage.

It was impressive to see how well-maintained the buildings are, this way you get a great picture of how life was in Norway in any period in time, from the year 1200 until now. They recreated houses, churches, schools, shops, banks, anything you could imagine, and made it seem like you went back in time. Plenty of information is given both in Norwegian and English.

I visited in winter, when there was lots of snow which made it almost a magical experience. I could imagine myself living in a wooden cabin, sitting beside a fire to keep me nice and toasty. When you've finsished exploring outside they also have an exposition inside with Norwegian clothes, furniture and toys on display. At the end of the day you have the opportunity to grab a bite or a hot chocolate in the Museum Café.

Norway,UkGMan,Norsk Folkemuseum,3.0,"We went on the first weekend of the Christmas market being on, but also the first day snow had settled in Oslo this winter. The grounds looked magical, blanketed in white. There is a shuttle bus that takes you too and from the free parking, which was about 15 mins away. Fine going (all roads lead too...) but several on the bus had doubts we were actually going back to the car park, such a convoluted route did it take!
Not the best day to see the exhibits, given how cold and slippy it was, and probably more interesting to locals than visitors - some of the subtleties and the importance between how one region's building varied from another's were undoubtedly lost. OH always enjoys visiting, and I imagine in the summer, with a guide and/or demonstrations it would be better. The majority of signs were in English. The church to me was the most impressive.
The market was good, but not necessarily interesting. Worth visiting as it was there, but not enough to come again if there was a different one to try.

Didn’t expect much except that I knew it was mostly an open air museum after reading older reviews on TripAdvisor. The open air museum would be much nicer to visit during warmer months where there’s probably more activity resembling past village life (am assuming from what I noticed, I am not so sure). However the scenery was pretty nice and quite where everything was covered in snow. The indoor exhibitions were informative and well maintained but I didn’t have much time to appreciate everything as I was rushing for time. A nice touch was that there were free hot drinks and gingerbread cookies in the museum lobby. If I was in Oslo in the future during summer I would visit again, but not in winter. The ticket would be more worth the price then.

There are various super out door areas: traditional farming [very extensive number of houses and buildings, many with displays and docents in period grab to answer questions]; 1920-1959 farming; old town [again displays throughout buildings, a pharmacy museum, traditional gardens and medicinal gardens]. You could easily spend a day here. You will need at least half a day to power though the highlights and a few of your favorite interests [be that children toys through the ages, folk decorative arts, the Sami (indigenous people in Norway), etc.]

Norway,VrolijkeFluiter,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This amazing place took us back in time. We experienced the different era´s of folk. The buildings gave us an insight in the way of life, with indepth information in Norwegian and English. Almost all buildings were really used, no reconstructions.

Even though the high season was not over there were some reenactors. One was on multiple places selling candies and giving us free potato soup. She and the staff were very friendly.

The establisments were really well done. The highlight was the old Church which was built in 1330 and renovated around 1850.

Furthermore we ended our tour with a visit to the exhibition. Wich was a lovely show and read about the art & farmlife (with army & hunter life included).

It was a marvellous tour and we spent over 4,5 hours in it (we left because it was closing times).

We recommend this museum for youngsters (playground available) and old. It is accesible for everybody and during the walk you might enjoy nature.

It was beautifull during spring, definitely worthwhile.

The museum took great care to reconstruct the buildings and sets. It was easy to get here on the bus (the stop is very close) so there is no reason to skip this museum!

Otherwise I Would have demanded to get my money back. The sceanery is really nice with all the old houses and has a lot of potential. Apparently there are actors/craftsmen around in the summer. While we visited, no one was around. And worse: 95% of the houses were locked, so you couldnt even see Inside. Also, there was next to no Information available on anything. While others loved the candy shop next to the entrance, we would have also loved to buy some candy. Unfortunately, it seems like the shop is, one of the last places in norway where you can only, pay via cash. Since everybody told us that we dont need cash anywhere (which we didnt), that meant no candy for us. TL/DR: folkemuseum might be fun in the summer, avoid at all cost in off-season (like late september)

Lots to see in this museum - I especially like the open air exhibitions - take you back to the days to see how people loved - there’s also staff dressed in traditional clothes and one even offered me something to eat! Be prepared for lots of walking as there’s lots to see. The houses had low ceilings and some built on top of another structure. The old town area is interesting as well but not as impressive as the open air houses. The indoor exhibitions were great (except I am not a big fan of all the mittens- except that I like the knitting patterns). There’s also the church and clergy stuff but it didn’t keep my attention. The stave church is smaller than I thought but it’s still spectacular. Again - be prepared for lots of walking

Building design & construction varied with villages primarily because of the isolation that existed because of the mountains & fjords. Be certain to obtain a map of the Folk Museum which will guide you around. There are food vendors and bathrooms on the grounds.

There are demonstrations at this Museum. We really enjoyed the ""Thick Lefsa"" demonstration. This was an ancient method which used ingredients available prior to potatoes being introduced to Norway. The""Thick Lefsa"" is rolled out and fried over an ""Open Fire"". This Lefsa is also available to purchase and you can add butter & sugar as desired.

Norway,Dmarkwind,Norsk Folkemuseum,3.0,"When we were planning our Norway trip, this is probably the attraction I was most looking forward to seeing, and several members my family said the same thing. Afterall, I really enjoyed Colonial Williamsburg and Greenfield Village in the states and the Fortress of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia. But this place was kind of disappointing. We were here during the hot spell in July when it probably got to at least 32C, which I understand is outside the museum’s control, but it seemed like we did a lot of walking in the heat without much payoff, and those costumed reenactors were largely a no-show. We spent about five hours here and I think we saw seven people in costume, and four of them were at a distance in one building. This place definitely needs more benches and water fountains (the bottle-friendly kind, please)! Maybe I should have checked the schedule and made a better effort to see a presentation or dance demonstration, but I had never been here before and thought we’d run into more reenactors as we explored the place from one end to the other, like we did at those other living history sites I mentioned. The stave church was something I was particularly interested in, since I’ve seen two of them in the states. But this one was just dark inside, I think because some upper windows were closed on a very sunny day. I liked the craft exhibit building and looking at all the handcrafted items. We especially liked the glove and mitten exhibit on the upper floor. The lockers in that building also came in handy. If I had it to do over, I probably could have skipped this place, but I was glad it was part of the Oslo pass and we didn’t have to pay full separate admission.

Norway,TraveL1ght,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"If you’ve been to Greenfield Village in Michigan or Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, this place is a similar concept but for Norwegian folk history. You can immerse yourself in historic Norwegian culture with costumed guides and relocated or recreated buildings to explore, arranged in villages and spanning different time periods back to the 1300s. Definitely try to catch one of the English guided tours. Our guide was excellent and explained so much about the time period and traditional lifestyle and dwellings. We also caught a demonstration of traditional music and dancing. The cafe was good for lunch.
Admission as well as the ferry or bus to get there is included with the Oslo Pass (a great value).
It is a lot of walking outside so wear your most comfortable shoes, try to pick a day with a decent forecast if you can, and wear layers and bring a rain jacket just in case.
This would be a good place to bring the kids, but partner and I enjoyed it on our vacation without them.

I was there on a very hot day and had injured my knee so I knew I would only have a short visit and so did not join a guided tour.

I had planned to go straight to the Stave Church. But along the way I encountered some of the staff dressed in traditional costume, who were very knowledgeable and more than happy to answer my many questions. Great photo opportunities, lovely to be out in the fresh air (take hat and sunscreen and water in summer!)

I wish my flash had been working for interior photos of the Stave Church (this was allowed) - I was waiting for the last person to leave when I realised it was a staff member. He was really helpful and entertaining. Good cafe, gift shop and bathrooms in the complex near the entrance that can be accessed before you use your ticket on the automated turnstile.

Norway,Ronald D,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"First off: This place is huge! So be sure to wear comfortable shoes.

Entering you find yourself in a courtyard surrounded by buildings. On one side there is a large exhibition hall. When I was there, there were craft folk demonstrating tatting, spinning and wood carving, then a large section devoted to Norwegian Folk Art. Upstairs was a fascinating display of Norwegian mittens in all their wonderful colors and designs, and beyond that a display of Norwegian Folk Dress.

After the exhibition hall you can stroll to various ""villages"" with farm houses, barns, cow sheds, grain storage, baking cottages, summer houses, stables and more, all brought in from various regions of Norway and dating from the 1600s to 1800s. There is one mansion, a (quite wealthy) clergyman's parsonage, a school house and even a Stave Church from the 13th century.

Entering into those village area, under the archway, be sure not to miss the excellent display of children's toys, and beyond it, a great exhibition on the Sami.

After visiting the older villages, you can then head to the section devoted to 20th Century Norway, with an old gas station, bank, pottery, painter's shop, candy store, etc.

I was there on a weekend, so there were also costumed folks doing dances, gardening, cooking, and a militia gathering.

Self-paced, you can take everything in at your leisure, with plenty of places to stop and rest and take it all in.

A fabulous place for anyone interested in history and life in earlier times.

Norway,Megan O,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This place was great for my husband and I to connect to our Norwegian heritage. As Minnesota Norwegians we have an idea and connection to our ancestors, but to see it in person brings more meaning. Our families lost and left behind our people, but being here made me feel very connected.

I feel this is a place that every ethnicity to come to learn about Norwegian culture. I was surprised to see some connection with how the Sami people lived was the same as the Minnesota Indians. The housing structure and materials were the same. Seeing the old buildings are great. They are building onto the property so it will only get better.

This is a must see for all families and people of all ages. They have farm animals. The best part was the horse carting around people. I didn't get to experience this, but I am envious of those who did.

Bring something to drink and snack on as well as some hiking shoes.

For dressing I would follow the modest rule (shoes, shirt, etc), but as a nursing mother I think you would be okay. Norway is very welcoming to nursing mothers. People do not appear to judge.

Norway,JKD,Norsk Folkemuseum,3.0,"if you're short on time and need an immersion into Norwegian history, you might be better off visiting the other major museums ...

but we had an extra day to devote to hiking out to the Bygdoy peninsula and visiting a couple of museums ... so it was worthwhile and delightful for us ... and it kept us fascinated for a couple of hours :-) we poked into the old buildings, watched demonstrations including feeding of the animals, and folk music and dancing.

Old buildings from all over the country were transported and reassembled in the Folk Museum and when possible, decorated with period furniture to give a feeling for Norwegian life through recent history. The buildings were clustered when possible, usually by region. In some places, there were characters in costume and role and it was interesting to interact to get a better feel for the issues of the time.

Note: there will be a lot of walking around visiting all of the buildings and poking around in them, so wear comfortable shoes; those needing walking assistance may find it tiring as there are some slightly hilly parts as well as some stairs in the buildings themselves.

There is also a stave church, which was good for us since we somehow managed to miss all of the “must see” churches in our two weeks of travelling throughout Norway !

So, if you have extra time, go. Otherwise, I wouldn't make it a priority unless you're out on the peninsula anyways to visit the other museums.

We were very glad we did not make that mistake! This is a wonderful outdoor museum. It has extensive exhibits on buildings used in various regions in Norway for farming, and live exhibitions (we saw live folk dancing), but the real highlight are the old buildings set up in a town-like structure. These buildings--which include homes, pharmacies, stores, and banks--can be toured, and, in some places, actors are present to portray characters from the particular time period of the building. Most interesting were a set of eight apartments, each set in a different time period with decor and effects appropriate to the time and occupant. All told, this outdoor museum provides a keen insight into Norwegian life across hundreds of years, and should not be missed.

This is a great open-air museum that started collecting buildings as old as 1200 (the Stave Church) back in the 1880s. It is spread over a large area and it gives you a feeling of villages/towns and farms across 800+ years of Norwegian history. There are a handful of actors/historical interpreters around who can give you information about life in different time periods. You may also stumble upon demonstrations of dancing, cooking, music, or news. There is a very cool apartment building with different rooms furnished from different time periods. This exhibit is probably the best signed/explained in the museum. You can also explore the grounds by horse drawn cart for a bargain price of 30 NOK, and/or you can break up your visit by stopping at the cafe for coffee and cake (highly recommended).

My destination, as I wandered through hundreds of years of architecture was the Stave church. Unfortunately, it was closed & I never found out why; maybe it was too late in the day. But the side journey through these paths was worth the time & effort. Next time I go to Norway I'll try to go to one of the villages where this church style is still in use.

Norway,TPAT75,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,This place is like a time machine that takes you to different eras. Sometimes those are only a few steps apart. You need to be fit and take at least half a day to explore this museum completely as it’s quite big and requires a lot of walking.,Jul 2018
Norway,B L,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,A superb outdoor park where you can see and enter an old wooden church. You will walk between old and authentic houses and various buildings from various places in Norway that were relocated in this park. The church is a must see. Beware that there are a fiew hills in the park. Nothing too difficult. There are actors in a few houses that will give you information about live in old Norway.,Jun 2018
Norway,KarenJim76,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"The vast variety of homes, farm buildings, shops, churches and other structures in phenomenal condition provided an entry into another world and culture. The costumed interpreters scattered throughout the site were exceptionally knowledgeable, friendly and eager to pass on their knowledge, particularly if you showed any interest. One standout example, Levina Storakern, who portrayed a farmer's wife, not only described her ""life"" as a housewife but also demonstrated her talent as a musician. When the subject of music arose, she offered to play a cow horn, which was then followed by a mini-concert on a folk fiddle and Hardanger fiddle. Her explanation of various musical styles was very informative and enhanced our experience. There are thorough explanations in English throughout the site and all of the costumed interpreters speak English. The Gol Stave Church (one of only 29 remaining) was exceptionally well preserved. The ""apartments"" tucked away in a separate building cover a period from 1879-2002 and illustrated the interesting development of urban life. Of the 3 Open Air museums we visited in Norway and Sweden, this was our favorite. It is well worth a visit.

Norway,born2travelDenver,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"We wanted to visit this museum to see the church in case we didn't get to visit any in the fjord lands. This was moved to the site, as is everything else, but it is original and renovated back to the 12th century. There was a good docent on site who showed us a lot of things that weren't evident - like the runes inscribed in the columns. The outdoor museum is quite unique and gives you a great idea of the type of houses people lived in and how they lived. The setting is lovely. It's a short walk from there to the Viking Museum. We went there on the tram from Oslo but you can take the boat from the quay.",Jun 2018

Norway,DownhillSkier67,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"The Cultural History Museum is a marvelous, and large, outdoor museum depicting Norwegian life and buildings at various times over the last 800 years. Particularly outstanding is the elaborate stave church. Some re-enactors are usually present but many more are there on the weekends. The Cultural History/Folk Museum is an easy five minute walk from the Viking Museum, both of which are stops on the bus route.",Jun 2018

Norway,Pete S,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"While visiting Norway, I wanted to see some of the stave churches. This museum has an excellent example of a stave church, in an open setting among other historic buildings. We had a beautiful, blue-sky day for our visit and came away with some great photos. The other historic buildings are interesting as well, and you can spend quite a bit of time at this museum. We walked to the museum from the ferry landing, and also visited the Viking Ship Museum, Kon-Tiki Museum and Fram Museum on the same day, walking from museum to museum.",Jun 2018

The buildings are simply stunning. If you are interested in social history, architecture or are just nosey about how people lived in the past, this is the place for you.
Brilliant for children and families.
Summer special events take place - check the website.
We had the Oslo Pass so we saved money.
Nearby to Viking Ship Museum etc.
Lots of toilets, some paths a bit tricky (and I’m able bodied and middle aged!)
Take a picnic!

Norway,Ewelina-EW,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"It is a huge mostly open air museum. It has an exhibitions part with interesting historical furniture, artefacts and Sami section.

The number 30 bus will get you there, and then on to the Viking Ship Museum.",May 2018
Norway,Mira V,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This museum is quite different from usual museums - it is very similar to the Skansen museum in Stockholm. This means that it is an open-air museum with lots and lots of traditional Norwegian wooden houses. The most interesting feature are the roofs, covered with earth and grass. The houses are in various styles, there are notice boards on each of them, explaining how the building was used. The people working in this museum wear colourful traditional clothes which is also interesting to see.
The most beautiful building is the stave church located on a hill. It is very well preserved - like most of the houses as well.
Be sure to plan enough time for this museum and be prepared to take quite a long walk if you want to see everything or most of the exhibits. One hour may not suffice. Parts of the museum are not accessible to people on wheelchairs.

Norway,Maps27,Norsk Folkemuseum,2.0,"Not worth it for the price. The Stave Church was interesting to see but you can't enter most of the other buildings on the property. There is no where you can buy bus tickets in the area, so make sure you buy them ahead of time or prepare cash to pay on the bus.",Jun 2018
Norway,Jonathan,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"If you are familiar with Beamish Museum in the UK, this is similar - reconstructed buildings and a stave church too. It was early in the year and the preparations/repairs were still going on so there were some restrictions sadly.
Close to Viking ship museum and 10 mins from Fram, Kon-Tiki and Maritime museums.
Free entry and free waterbus ride to it with a city card. Buy one, we re-couped our outlay on a 72 hour card in one day!",Jun 2018
Norway,Jim B,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This large museum has something for everyone - urban and rural lifestyles, fashion history, live craftsman displays, costumed reenactments, live music, period dancing, a rebuilt stave church, and artifacts from several centuries. We spent about 3 hours at the museum and probably visited half of the exhibits and only one performance. Everyone on the staff was very pleasant and eager to share their knowledge. I highly recommend a visit to this museum.",Jun 2018
Norway,lkpm3,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"Get the museum pass. Take the ferry across. This museum is a must see. Probably my favorite. Of course you must see the old buildings and church but I really enjoyed the apartment building that had an apt from each decade. Really fun. It's in the ""new city"" section. This museum is a lot of walking but have a snack at the cafe. We enjoyed our nutty choc cake. Then take in some of the other small museums in the area.",Jun 2018
Norway,Sarah S,Norsk Folkemuseum,2.0,"The Stave church is amazing and well worth seeing - however on a weekday very few interiors are open, so you have to peer through windows.

The only guides around were at the Stave church but they didn't seem to think their job included talking to visitors, we seemed to be an inconvenience.

Other than that it's mainly a collection of what appear to be quite similar rural buildings. We got a bit bored.

One thing we loved, but it's really hidden is a display on Sami culture - seemed ironic that we found it by chance, given that the display talked about bigoted attitudes to Sami culture in the past. It could do with much better signage to help people find it. Well worth trying to find.

Norway,Indra110,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"My husband and I walked everywhere in a relaxed way and we spent about 1.5 hours there.
It is very nice and interesting to see but it could be even better if more people actually “worked” there, aka seeing people work in the fields, have people doing crafts like pottery, sell bakery goods or just stroll the streets in costumes.
It would make the place seem more alive. We saw three people “working” there, that was it.",May 2018
Norway,247sally,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"Interesting snap shot of Norway. We particularly enjoyed the tenement apartments on the old town furnished in mid-century style.

In the summer time there are also some farm animals.
It is an amazing museum that brings you back in the past.
You may also see people in traditional costumes making lefse that you can taste.
During the winter time there are less people but I do find it very charming with snow *of course it is more difficult to go around).

Really enjoyed my visit to this museum, it had original Norwegian buildings which were relocated here. So it was a great way to see how old Norwegian buildings were constructed with different variations depending on what part of the country there were from. I spent about 2 1/2 hours and could have spent longer, but only had a day to spend in Oslo. As well as the historic buildings, the exhibition part had displays of Norwegian clothing, original furniture etc.

The museum grounds were well maintained with a lot of buildings and historical edifices that were moved to the grounds

The buildings contained items and relics from throughout Norwegian history including religious artifacts, as well as traditional clothing, furniture, and toys.

There is a lot to see here which could easily take several hours. The museum contained descriptions in Norwegian as well as English.

Norway,Chris M,Norsk Folkemuseum,3.0,"We had read a lot of rave reviews but sadly a tad disappointed.
Good bits:
The museum has taken buildings from around Norway and sympathetically relocated them as they would have been in that time and region.
There are lots of buildings and informative displays in both Norwegian and English.

Bad points:
It is not a 'living museum'. So whilst in a few houses there were staff in period costume this very much was the exception. The majority of the museum was filled with relocated 'store houses'. Turns out these winter climates like a good store house.

So glad we didn’t as this was one of the most interesting places we visited.
The inside exhibition space housed examples of cultural interest as well as a great shop. (Top tip - if you are looking for good quality Norwegian souvenirs buy at the many museum shops and give the tacky city centre souvenir shops a miss).
The outside space was huge with a vast array of historical buildings to visit. In fact we only saw a fraction and could have spent longer on the site if we had had time.

Norway,khw88,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"The museum is a predominately outdoor collection of old Norwegian buildings initiated by King Oscar II in the 1800s.

There is an enormous range of types of buildings but the highlight has to be the wooden Stave Church from the 1300s.

Unfortunately some of the buildings were not open to view.
Whilst there is a comprehensive description of many of the buildings others lack any description as to purpose or what is being displayed.

Nevertheless it is a must if you want to get a feel for how Norwegians lived.

We were very short on time, only had 3 days in Oslo but this was on ""my list"" and I'm so glad we went.

What a beautiful way to educate visitors about a more recent addition to Norwegian culture!",Jan 2018
Norway,Liv,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This is one of the things I recommend doing when you're in Oslo. The folk museum is such a beautiful open-air museum that takes you through some of the history of Norway. Country side location in a city! Spend at least a couple of hours there, if not a day:) Lots of different activities, just look at their page.

Norway,Anouk L,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"We were here in January which is of course quite a cold period. There was a lot of snow and limited opening hours, of course. Therefore we did not see it with the ‘entertainment’ we know they provide on weekends and for sure in spring/summer time. However we had a great time. This is a very interesting place with beautiful buildings! The inside exhibitions teach you more about history and the outside is just stunning. We were quite late, so we didn’t see all of the inside exhibitions to be honest. But walking around you feel like you’ve gone back in time. Especially the church was amazing!",Jan 2018
Norway,Chris B,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,Caught the bus to the Viking Museum only to find the Folk Museum next door. Free entry with the Oslo pass. We were staggered by how good it was.

Norway,Julian D,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"This folk museum has a large number of fine, old wooden buildings from villages around Norway, including a mainly original wooden stave church. There are farm settlements with houses, barns and other outbuildings, and a new display from Finnmark in the far north of Norway is now being installed.
But there is also an Old Town section, which contains a series of urban buildings from Oslo, with displays about the history of commerce, banking, transport and other aspects of life in the city.
As well as these mainly outdoor exhibits, there is a traditional museum with temporary displays about Norwegian culture and folk art.
It's all very well worth seeing, especially if you don't have time to travel outside the capital to the rest of the country.
To see everything properly, you should allow at least two hours.

Norway,Aussie135,Old Stavanger,4.0,"I was on a cruise ship touring Norway and I visited Old Stavanger. Old Stavanger is made up of old wooden houses which are painted white. they were saved from demolition after the second world war by some dedicated locals who wished to preserve Stavanger's history.

When they were built the rich lived in them and everyone knew they were rich because white paint was the most expensive paint to have! If you look carefully you can see hints of the past in the water troughs for the ponies that pulled the carts. The houses which have strangely cut off corners so that the carts can pass through easily or the different types of cobbles that helped the horses to grip as they went downhill to the harbor..

Some of the houses still have the two way mirrors on the upper floors that allowed a householder to look up and down the street from the comfort of their chairs without appearing nosey!

the old bakery is now a cafe and you can guess its history from the large chimney behind it . You will also see an old herring cannery. The cobbles are hard on the feet and people with mobility issues would need to take care. Well worth visiting but remember these are now private houses so be respectful and don't peer in people's windows!.

We picked up a local map which was free and found a small walk to the ""old"" town which was exactly what I had expected. Beautiful houses built for tiny people painted in all colours and very much the tourist picture pallet. A visit to the local museum was worth it too. Seemed a bit pricey but then realised it gives you access to all the other museums there too so worth it. The museum was most enjoyable and a 10 min walk from the port. Be very wise with eating out as it is VERY expensive. A lovely coffee shop and a cake and drink each for 3 of us and it came to £29. That was the same in any coffee shop so obviously the norm.

There were old photographs around and a leaflet telling you about the families that lived there.g
The house was two storied and the bedrooms were also furnished.
It was extremely interesting and there was no charge!!
There were two young girls making coffees and tea which you could enjoy inside or out in the garden at the back. I would imagine that there would be a charge for refreshments.
There was also a clean toilet for public use.

I have mobility problems and use a walking stick so I took it slow and easy, stopping for a minute or two to look around at the beauty of the buildings. In doing this I could enjoy this small area of Stavanger . These houses are lived in and you need to show respect for the people who live there.

Norway,Peder Rasmussen,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Any one visiting Stavanger, must visit the Old Stavanger, the romantic old wooden buildings in various colours. Shops, restaurants, cafés, meeting places, squares, its all there and you can really combine the trip with good bargains. Many of the restaurants offers great dinners at reasonable prices, so give it a chance for a good lunch or dinner, enjoy walking the streets, do some shopping (always good sales) and sit down at the small cafés with a cup of coffee, beer or wine.",Jul 2019
Norway,Maj B.,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Old Stavanger is a must visit if you are visiting Stavanger. On a sunny summer day, it is absolutely beautiful to walk through. The residence make it so cozy with colourful flowers and decorations. The Stavanger Canning Museum is located here, along with a cozy tiny cafe. During Christmas time, they have a Christmas market (not all December, but one Sunday I believe - also worth a visit). There are some small parks with playgrounds for the smaller kids, and tables/benches. The `Main Street`is from the concert house, and straight thru, with a lot of small streets going downwards to the harbour. The houses are really cozy. But respect the residence and their privacy - try to keep from peaking in through their windows - the gardens are private property.

Norway,Corihi,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Gamle Stavanger (Old Stavanger) is a historic area of Stavanger with well-preserved small white cottages built in the 18th - early 20th centuries that are still in use today. The area is basically a residential area with a few galleries and a canning museum. The homes are well-maintained with colorful hanging baskets, potted plants and a few gardens. I like the fact that people actually live in these restored homes instead of homes being turned into museums. It’s a very picturesque and charming area. We like walking around the smaller Old Towns and this was definitely one of our favorites. You will be walking uphill on cobblestones, so this might not be a good activity for people with mobility issues.

Walking over to the old town was certainly the highlight of the day. Such immaculately kept houses with amazing flower beds as you walk through.
Great to see the Norwegian flags hung up too.

As you walk through there are a few statues to pose and take a picture with.

For our little one there was also a couple of play parks with swings and slides etc.

The street is cobbled through so something to bear in mind when you walk through.

It was so surreal to still see the cruise ship towering above the houses.

There is also a museum of sorts to visit and a nice coffee shop in some of the old buildings.

A great visit for sure.

It was very cold when we arrived so we did a short walk along the harbour and decided to get a bus tour of the city, which showed us just how lovely this town is. The main harbour area seems to have something for everyone and despite its charm also has a nightlife scene with bars and clubs.
There's a very pretty lake which we went past twice and I expect is stunning when it's warmer and is walking distance from where the cruise ships dock.

Best place to start - from the Tourist Information office head north a bit, then turn left towards the beginning of the main cobbled road. Towards the end is the Worker's Cottage and also the Canning Museum , good way to end the tour.

The buildings had lovely small gardens along narrow cobblestone streets. Some of the houses had small craft shops including at least a couple of small glass blowing crafts people making unique glass ornaments, sun catchers and jewelry. There were several nice statues tucked away in small neighborhood parks.
The “established” stores near the old town maintain the ambience of the old town. There were many small shops that specialized in local foods, and local themed souvenirs. We loved the shops that had oversized trolls at the entrances.
What a cold legend to have - trolls!

A quaint small town and wish we had more time to enjoy it.

A museum, cafe and craft shop were located in the buildings but the highlight was seeing the buildings still being lived in. Some are being repainted, some a bit tired, others are pristine.

The oldish buildings are kept in top notch condition which must be quite a feat with the cold and seaside (salty) conditions. Most residences have some form of garden if not then an array of potted plants in summer. Here too is the entrance to the old canning factory and a cottage selling refreshments which has been furnished in 1960s style downstairs and 1900s style upstairs. It even has an outside loo! There is no strength on you to buy refreshments so do have a look.,Jul 2018

Norway,Bob M,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Stavanger. Old town. Lovely white wooden houses, narrow streets and loads of flowers, especially roses. Town centre has a large lake with a fountain which is pleasant to walk round.
The cruise ship terminal is right by the old town and 5 minutes from the cathedral and the lake. The bus and train station are across the road from the lake as you walk from the cathedral and the square.
The lookout tower is interesting but not worth the entrance cost as there is little to see and you are chased round and out of the tower again.
The cathedral looks unusually long and lower than most would be but again there is a charge of 50 Kr to get in, why, it’s a church and should be free to all.
The supermarket prices are interesting, some items are much the same as the UK while others are at least double if not more.

I won't post any photos as the weather was terrible during our week in Norway. Hidden among the buildings are small shops, cafes and the canning museum.

At times I did feel sorry for the residents of this ""village"" who must get rather fed up of being invaded by hundreds of cruise ship passengers on a regular basis as well as being overlooked by the ships docked just metres away.

Norway,aanda77,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Stavanger was the first port we called at on our cruise of the Norwegian fjords. We were travelling on the P&O Arcadia and booked booka walking tour which cost £30 each but in hind site we didn’t need to this. You dock immediately adjacent to the old town so you can just walk off the ship and take a leisurely walk and take in all the sites. Within a few yards you are amongst the traditional wooden houses and cobbled streets that were built to house the workers who came to fish and work in the Herring factories. There is a museum to visit that tells you all about the history. You can walk around the harbour passing market stalls selling local products and up to the church which has a wonderful view over the whole area and continue round up to the tower which was built as a look out for fire, very important with all the wooden houses and down through the colour street where all the cafes bars and shops are painted in bright colours and back down to the Harbour. There is an old ship moored there which was repainted white with a Red Cross and used in the film Dunkirk a few years ago. It’s been returned to its original colours and it is a great contrast to the huge cruise liners moored next to it. Wear comfy shoes to walk on the cobbles and be aware it is quite hilly but you can take it slowly and still be back on board for lunch.
There are other trips available when you stop here of course and this includes the trip to the famous Pulpit rock that you see in all the brochures and fellow passengers also took a helicopter ride over the area which they loved. There were trips available from the harbour but you have to be aware that if your on a private trip and not one organised by the cruise there is a chance you could miss the boat if your late getting back.

Norway,Rightbundle,Old Stavanger,4.0,"Stavanger is quaint and beautiful southern Norwegian port lined with gorgeous wooden houses and buildings. These were nearly demolished in the 1950s but they were smart enough to preserve them as they are one of a kind.

They are currently in the midst of an oil boom and hence cost of living is high here compared to other places so I suggest you buy generic Norwegian souvenirs elsewhere like in Bergen or Oslo.

There is also an oil museum that is a tourist attraction/trap with an entrance fee. I would rather walk the cobbled streets of Gamle Stavanger and spend the krone on a beer at one of the bars lining the port, however.

Most of the houses were build in the end of the 1700 and the last ones in the end of 1800. Locally called ""straen"" ( aka the beach). Old Stavanger was designated by UNESCO in 1975 as one of the conservative cities in Norway together with, among others, Røros. Stavanger Municipality has received more prizes for the conservation of Old Stavanger. The houses are partly in private and partly in municipal ownership.

Narrow streets which can be hard to walk on if you have a walking issue since they have used stones which can be slippery on a rainy day.

The area itself is not large, though it's on a hill, so it requires some agility & comfortable shoes to get around; you can do it in half an hour, or an hour if you want to be leisurely. The tourist info. bureau is on the pier just at the bottom of the hill on which Old Stavanger rests & you can go down there to get more info. about Stavanger & Rogaland either before or after exploring Old Stavanger.

Apart from that you will see pretty white or very colourfull homes at the few little streets winding around one hill (the area is not big). Plus one very old church (you pay for admission and is not symlic) and one old tower at the top of that hill. And that is about it.

We booked a half day tour of Stavanger and the surrounding areas which was interesting and we're glad we saw the locality.

When our tour finished, instead of the coach dropping us at the port, it dropped us in the town so we were able to meander; find something to eat and have a coffee.

We came across the white painted wooden houses, each adorned with several containers of pretty colourful flowers. The cobbled streets were not difficult to navigate. The excursion team on board had urged passengers not to look in the windows of the 173 wooden houses that are 200yo, so we behaved and did not. Every house has people living in it. We are glad we were able to see these pretty houses in Stavanger.

Norway,DanlRb,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Having viewed the nearby fjords, a visit to Old Stavanger truly topped off the visit. It is great for photos as it has a real personality - with the white houses and sloping cobbled streets. Despite being rather busy with tourists, it was still possible to experience the sense of culture that it gave, so I definitely recommend a visit. Whilst visiting, it rained heavily so extra care had to be taken on the cobbles - so it may not be suitable for some visitors. There are statues all around this area which are also interesting and great for photo stops. It doen't take long to go around and it is very close to the port - a cruise ship often provides a contrasting modern backdrop to the quaint houses - so it is ideal to for cruise passengers to visit just before re-embarking. It may not be as spectacular as the surrounding fjords but this was easily the best place I have visited in Norway to get a sense of culture. It is a beautiful place with stunning scenery. Without visiting here, my trip certainly would have felt incomplete. This gives an impression of the very essence of Norway and its history wo if you want to experience Norway properly then a visit here is essential.

Norway,Debbie G,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Stavanger is a beautiful place. We visited on a very very wet Monday in August. The people are the friendliest you will find anywhere.
Quaint shops selling everything from homemade goods to souvenirs. Our first purchases was for two rain coats at a cost of 200k each, that's about £20 each, and they were the cheapest. So my advice if you are planning a trip is bring waterproof shoes, socks and a waterproof coat as you'll possibly need it.
That said even in the rain we had the most amazing time, food and drink is expensive, but that is the economy in Norway.

The old town has some interesting buildings but they were overshadowed this day by the crowds of Norwegians turned out in their traditional dress. A great day for people watching. There are impromptu parades that seemed to pop up spontaneously. Some with marching bands, costumes, Norwegian flags. We spent several hours watching the festivities.

To transform what would have been a desolate rocky island into some of the most beautiful gardens I have seen is nothing short of magic as far as I am concerned. To make our trip even more memorable, the family members and staff we met were all so friendly, informative and welcoming and the delicious food topped off one of the most enjoyable day trips I have made. Glad i had charged the camera's battery, there were so many great photo opportunities I could have spent another day just clicking away.

The total experience is unforgettable; The boat ride to the island, an interesting tour of the garden where you learn the history behind it, delicious three course dinner in a restaurant overlooking the sea and colorful flowers and then ample time to wander around on your own before taking the boat back to Stavanger. There are so many photo opportunities; Flowers obviously, waterfalls, beaches, fish, birds, rocks, and romantic bridges and walkways.
We were there on a rainy day, and were mesmerized. i can only imagine what it would be like with sun and blue sky... There are many chairs and benches where we would have liked to sit and only take in the atmosphere and beauty if they weren't soaking wet.
Unfortunately, rain is more common than sun in this area, but I think I'll give it another go next year. They change most of the flowers and the color scheme every year, so even if the weather is equally bad, I know it will be worth a visit.

Norway,Juliana,Flor og Fjære,5.0,It's a beautiful island with an incredible variety of flowers. There's also lunch and dinner at the local restaurant. It's run by a family who has built it from scratch. The guides tell us the whole romantic story.,Aug 2019
Norway,Monica M,Flor og Fjære,3.0,lovely surroundings but the food at the restaurant is over-rated and way too expensive. They obviously cater to the business crowd and don't care about the locals,Oct 2019
Norway,Nikolai S,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"A beautiful place and garden. Impressive setup that requires a lot of work each season. We where told that they plant 50000 summer flowers each year in the summer garden. Done by 5 persons over 3 months.

They have put up a lot of different theme areas. Impressive that they manage a dessert theme in the wet cold west coast of Norway.

We was in a group where one of the grandsons of the founder did the show and tell. He was unfortunately a bit arrogant. Probably tired of telling and answering the same questions over and over again.

We come with kids and a dog. I would highly recommend not bringing dogs or kids to this place. What kids are interested in fauna and flowers? Take it rather as a couple trip.

The restaurant had a cool head from the Netherlands. He was very entertaining. Unluckily the food was not close to being good or balanced.

We got served a very good fish soup with four different fish’s in it. With cod and salmon among them. That was the best part of the meal.

The main dish had a baked broccoli mouse, that was way too tasteless. The Chicken was over cooked and then had a tasteless skin. The ham was the best part. It tasted ok, but the sauce was not a good fit (some sour kind).

The service in the restaurant was bad. I needed to ask three times to order drinks. Maybe we where a bit unlucky placed behind a big table with a birthday party taking all the servants attention.

We even got served a kids menu without ordering it (they changed it fast luckily). We observed a kid on the 50 years party that probably should have had it …

With our dog I would have preferred to be placed close to the door, not in the end of the room.

The boat trip back and forth was very pleasant.

All in all I would recommend this place to people interested in gardening and that enjoys beautiful gardens. Don’t get here for the food.

Norway,1Norwegian,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"Since 1965 this Stavanger has been working this little windblown island a twenyt mins botaride out of town. Today it has become a very un-Norwegian feature ranking among the prime garden facilities in the world. We skal never forget the enthusastic owner who met us and took us on our first round of the complex, wittifully commenting as we proceeded along. We were lucky to arrive in a rather small group, as I've heard from people some crowds are too big.
Next a charming introduction form the chef before entering the hall for our buffet, another top experience! The rest of the time was spent on our own, and return boatride was optional as you could choose to stay until the last ferry, or leave on the first that suited you.
Well worth the price we paid, and highly recommendable! Only try to go before it gets dark. They close end of September. We went on the last round (they do various departure times from Stavanger) in August, and wished we'd been on an earlier boat as it started getting dark after supper.

Information provided by the reservations team was accurate. On arrival at the island your mind is blown away with an array of very colourful flowers and this is from the time you step off the boat. At the gathering spot you feel like you are in a tropical garden in the middle of somewhere tropic. Guide was extremely knowledgable and provide info with ease.

The tour was offered in English and Norwegian. The garden is breathtaking and was created from nothing by the present owners parents. The meal was delicious and then there was time to wander around the gardens until the ferry back. It is expensive but was well worth the money, especially if you love trees, shrubs and flowers. They plan each year to have a new area and different colour schemes. The beach area is also beautiful and views out over the fjords. A magnificent trip.",Aug 2019
Norway,Jaime P,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"We booked a dinner visit to Flor og Fjaere while in Stavanger on business. It was the best part of our trip! First you get a on a nice boat that is comfortable and enclosed, although you can ride outside to take photos. There is a film playing with English subtitles, telling you about the island and how it become what it is today. When you arrive, you immediately see the stunningly beautiful flowers and trees everywhere. Passengers were divided into two groups; English and Norsk. There were only 6 in our group and the tour was led by the original couple's daughter-in-law. She told us the history of Flor og Fjaere and showed us the different parts of the gardens. We were then taken to the waterside restaurant, where Chef Andre met us and told us what he had prepared for dinner. We were taken inside, seated by the windows, overlooking the garden and water. We started with a delicious fish soup. Next we were invited to the buffett line, where we were able to choose and or all of the entrees, including hake, halibut, Morrocan chicken (my favorite), lamb and a quinoa/califlower side dish. It was all delicious! Afterward, our waiter asked if we wanted dessert and we said we did. He brought out a special plate for our anniversary which had carrot cake, ice cream, chocolate panna cotta and fruit. It also had a heart drawn with chocolate and filled with raspberry coulis. It was amazing. After dessert and coffee we were able to tour the garden on our own and watch the sunset from the beach. Then we boarded the boat and headed back to town. It was our best anniversary ever! Thank you Flor og Fjaere!

People would like to see this garden and it is worth a visit, the gardener has done a great job.
The food is good, my tip; just take some soup so you can taste the buffe and dessert afterwards.
The place is very popular, everyone in Norway has seen the queen celebrate her birthday here, they want to see for themselves - and yes it is a joy to see. But the groups are too big, you feel at the assembly line, and everyone must eat the dinner included, so the trip is expensive. Drinks/wather are not included.
The boat goes to and fro in a throbbing run, peopel all over - sad for this could have been an even greater pleasure, now it is mass tourism, with flowers.

Takes them a while to serve everyone, but the process was actually well organized. All drinks (even water!) cost extra and the prices felt quite high. The garden never felt crowded despite two ferrys worth of people there as they were all spread out and the place is really big. Boat ride was well organized and comfortable.

Norway,Cat,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"This is my second time visiting Flor og Fjære and it is indeed beautiful. Stunning views across the fjords from the island edge, surrounded by intricate planting and pure bursts of colour. It's a real treat for the senses.

My only criticism is that, especially for the limited time you have on the island (and the price you pay) on both occasions the restaurant service has been incredibly slow. This time we sat for 1 hr before being able to eat our starter. And then another long wait for the next round etc. Trying to get a drink was also difficult. Don't get me wrong, the staff are wonderfully friendly and attentive, just maybe not enough for a clockwork operation. In the end we left the restaurant without dessert or coffee as there was only 1hr 15 left to our ferry home and we wanted to enjoy the island as much as possible. It's a shame to be in such a beautiful place and be stuck indoors waiting.

But the chef, he's an absolute blast, I'd listen to him do stand up comedy any night!

We then met the chef who described the foods prepared for that day, and were led into a lovely dining area for lunch. The food was extraordinary, a feat in and of itself considering that most was smorgasbord style. The dining staff were very attentive and pleasant. After lunch, we were allowed plenty of time to freely explore the gardens unaccompanied. Although I went solo, this would be an ideal place for couples, friends or families. Although a bit expensive, I came away feeling that it was well worth it.

First of all, it was sunny but really cold wind the day I visited Flor&Fjære (the cold wind is pretty normal in the west coast of Norway, Stavanger) but even so we couldn’t feel any of the wind middle of this island. We got a quick trip around the place before we got about an hour to walk around and take picture. There is a lot of wind on the other side so would recommend you to bring a sweather/jacket if you want to walk along the sea side. I also have to mention that the guide was really good at telling stories about how this place was built. The guides are all part of making this tropical place so beautiful and they are all related to the founder of this place. It was amazing to hear the story about it and how much work they put into keeping all this plants and flowers alive and how they each year made something new on this place to make it more interesting.
We also got a great buffet with a hilarious chef telling us funny stories about what would be on the menu that day.
This place is so beautiful and you really feel like you travel to an other country and I find it so amazing how it’s possible to have so many beautiful plants and flowers in that cold and windy climate that we mostly have in Stavanger. The service was also great as well as the rest!

Norway,ExpoNationals,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"WOW! WOW!! WOW!!! Did not expect to see what we saw. Flor & Fjære is AMAZING!!!! Be forewarned, they are not open year long. They are open (approximately) from May to September every year.

Take their colorful ferry from the port in Stavanger, Norway. It is about a 20 minute ferry ride on the fjord before arriving at the beautiful island. Even before we set foot on the island, we were totally blown away with what we saw. We peered out the windows, and we were greeted by gorgeous colorful flowers. I did not expect to see such lush breathtaking gardens! Flor & Fjære truly is an island paradise in Norway!!

We took a short guided tour first which gave us a glimpse and history of the place. We did our own self guided tour (and took a bunch of pictures) after partaking of their delicious lunch buffet. Most of our meal was made from organic ingredients only found on the island. Everything from the chicken to the lamb to the dessert and everything in between was yummy! Of course, I had my favorites. I especially enjoyed the scrumptious Hidlefjord Fish soup and delectably divine dessert! Definitely, a 5 star lunch buffet experience!

I highly recommend a trip to Flor & Fjære if you have time to spare in Stavanger. Well worth the price of admission to see these spectacular magnificent gardens!!! You have to book your tickets in advance, though. Personally, I enjoyed them more than Butchart Gardens in Canada. Simply STUNNING!!!!!

Norway,Tore L,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"It's been a long wait for my mother to go there, so finally we decided that we take her there as a birthday gift.

We got the lunch trip, getting on the boat in Stavanger (not difficult to find!) and after a short trip in the archipelago we arrived at Flor og Fjære. And what a place. A warm welcome by the chef and crew, before we we're split into different groups for a guided tour.

An amazing garden, with tropical plants you wouldn't believe would survive in Norway (they do some cheating in the winter, move some of the plants onshore to their greenhouse). The guide was very knowledgeable (3rd generation of the family who built the entire garden) and we learned a lot as we walked around.

Then we were served lunch, not in the big restaurant, but a smaller building next to it, with no/less view of the surroundings. But it was the same food (you have to order food (lunch/dinner) to visit the island) as in the restaurant, as thoroughly explained by the Dutch chef before we went for lunch. Very funny and entertaining person! A lot of laughs!

The lunch started with their famous fish soup (they make 16.000 liters of it each season). The soup was a bit blend, would've expected a bit more flavors. Then we had a buffet with a nice variation of food, which was pretty good!

For dessert, our mother got a special dessert plate, as we've noted in the booking that we were celebrating her birthday. She was surprised and happy.

After the lunch we had almost 2 hours to walk around in the garden to enjoy the scenery and take a lot of pictures - which can't give proper credit of how beautiful it was there - you have to visit on your own!

His father so called ‘chef’ is prepare food for guests in his restaurant. He did good marketing & mouth watering discription of food before you entered in restaurant but believe me food wasn’t that tasty. Not at all.
“Aloo-methi” is an Indian dish(sabji). Aloo means potato & methi means fenugreek now here you neither find aloo nor fenugreek but cauliflower only.....!!!!!
And he said he served in curry but there was no curry just melted cheese...
I insist so called “chef” to check “Indian aloo-methi sabji” recipe before serving wrong food & wrong cuisine to clients.

Norway,Asbjoern S,Flor og Fjære,5.0,Who would ever believe that a garden like this could exist at a place like this? Norwegian climate but it looks like a place much nearer equator. And the kitchen is very good too. Recommend a tour including dinner!,Jul 2017
Norway,Brit G,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"The garden is beautiful and more flowers than ever, beautiful waterfalls and birdlife in the ponds. But I was disappointed anyway because it had become so commercial. Everything was about what we guests could buy extra. How to make epletre hedge, you can read about it in our book - for sale in our store.
Even though we had bought expensive tickets for guided tours and dinner, we were charged for the cost of the water we drank for dinner.
Have been here 4 times and this year I was disappointed, everything was assembly line, everyone had to provide in big groups with a guide.
No time for small talk along the way and dinner was a common dining with about 150 pieces. Hard to hear what people said and a lot of waiting for the toilet.
Very few waiters, so long time waiting for them to clear the table.
Did not get a stroll in the garden because when the meal over the boat (as the place transports all its guests) went back.
The garden is beautiful, the island is beautiful - but I suggest owners put their fingers in the ground - what's up now, garden enjoyment or make money enjoyment?
For those who want to go in a great group in a nice garden, afterwards eat dinner in the crowded dining room - well do it.
The food this year was very good, as a starter everyone got a big bowl of fish soup - my suggestion is to save room until the buff come, it was tasty.
And to the Place, nothing grows into the sky, maybe the time to not receive more guests than the garden can accommodate in a good way?

Norway,Blvndrmz,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"Yes, the grounds are truly beautiful. It’s like being inside a vibrant and colorful painting. Absolutely surreal! Gorgeous!

Note to self and future visitors: Sort out where you are going to sit in the restaurant for your lunch or dinner. The tables are PRE-ASSIGNED by name and we, along with other foreigners, were all seated in the absolute worst location of the restaurant, in the screaming children section, and away from the view. When I asked for a better table, I got the pat answer that the seating is assigned in order of booking placement. No mollification or assistance whatsoever. No effort to help disappointed guests. Interestingly, only the locals had the good tables with the great view, better service, and were served first at the buffet opening. Hmmmm.....

Admittedly, one does not go to this place for the restaurant, but it is a big part of the visit. Do yourself a favor, and enquire as to where you will be seated. Get confirmation of a good table if this is important to you.

This part of the experience unfortunately took a lot away from the visit. But it still is gorgeous!

Norway,MrBuddyBoy,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"I visited this island with some work colleagues / friends. The boat journey is about 20 minutes from Stavanger quay. Great tour, by the family that lives there. Then off to dinner about 45 minutes later. The food was absolutely excellent and was a nice selection of Norwegian cuisine, from fish to lamb and veg. My only criticism and this is really more a preference is the gardens are mainly annual flowers and not perennials. Since I mainly plant perennials I would have preferred to see more.",Jun 2018
Norway,Kathy H,Flor og Fjære,5.0,We visited this garden during our stay in Norway. It was absolutely beautiful! Our tour guide was very enjoyable and spoke beautiful English. The chef prepared a great meal and dessert after spending a little more time wandering around the gardens taking pictures. Enjoyable boat ride to the island. Would definitely recommend!,Jun 2018
Norway,cklingseisen,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"I wasn't really sure if I was going to like this experience or not since I am not really a plant person. But, the reviews were nice and I had some time to kill so off I went with a friend. It was quite pricey but did include the food, so I paid in advance to secure a spot.

The ferry was exactly on time so don't be a minute late. It doesn't even sit there long, people walk on, it promptly leaves! The ferry ride wasn't long - maybe 20 mins tops. When we arrived we were separated into English speakers and Norwegian speakers. Our assigned guide spoke perfect english. He walked us from spot to spot and gave a bit of history and explained the focus of each area. There wasn't a lot of explanation about the plants names themselves, more how it all came about - which was fine by me. We moved along at a brisk pace to stay away from the group behind us.

At the end of the walk around, we were introduced to the chef who told us what all we would be served. We then were seated. The handling of the food was very professional and we were told when to go to the buffet line so we never had to wait or fight for a place. The food was good but difficult for me as everything had cheese or dairy and I'm dairy intolerant (and yes I told them that in advance when I booked). But what I tasted was good. The drinks were extra, even the water, I mean you are on an island soooo.

After lunch we had about an hour to wander back around to take more photos. I actually took 300 photos on that tour and came home to cull it down to my favorite 30. It is hard to get it lower than that! I thought the experience was outstanding. I've not been to a place a like that before. Someone has some serious creative gardening talent and found a way to brighten the world in the process. I'm the beneficiary of the work. Loved it. Bought a t-shirt.

It is a large park, full of interesting plants, trees and flowers, and the restaurant serves good food. It is the most beautiful place in the county of Rogaland, well worth visiting if you have time during your stay in the region.

I have been here a few times, and the park grows bigger every year it seems adding new ponds, flower beds and so forth every time I have been here.

Thumbs up, the owners do an outstanding job, I absolutely recommend a visit!

Norway,Laura R,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"It's basically a massive, well-groomed garden on an island, featuring many plant species that you might not expect to find in Norway (palm trees, a Japanese garden, countless species of flowers, etc). I'd heard about this place for a while, but finally decided to go last year. After a quick boat trip from Stavanger (the trip itself is a fun activity with nice views of the small islands surrounding the city) we docked in front of a large wooden restaurant/conference centre/event locale. The building was modern, but cozy (gotta have that 'kos'!). We took a guided tour in English, with a wonderful, kind, informative tour guide. The story of the garden is very interesting, if you're a person who likes to know how things came to be the way they are. We're not people who are deeply into gardening or horticulture, but the place is so beautiful and well-laid-out that we had fun just exploring.

Dinner was served buffet style, and featured various soups, salads and mains. The fish soup was fantastic. Dessert and coffee followed. Good service.

My father was in a wheelchair, and was able to access everything, with a little help on the small uphill sections. There were kids of all ages and some people also brought their dogs. If you do bring kids (or teenagers, especially) remember that leaving the island requires you to wait for a scheduled boat. If they get bored or cranky, you'll be stuck with a surly teen on an island...kind of like Lord of the Flies!

Anyway, joking aside, it was a lovely place. Beautiful gardens, lots to discover, lovely sea air and a good meal.

Norway,1Barkinghill,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"An oasis created by a family of gardeners/nusery owners was one of my favorite activities during a recent trip to Norway. A ferry takes you from Stavanger to a nearby island. We were greeted by the daughter-in-law of the original owner and the visionary of this garden and given a tour. Her husband and son continue the family legacy. We had a lovely meal and time to explore the different parts of the garden each with its own theme - Italian-inspired, Japanese-inspired. We started off our visit in the rain but the sun did come out. While I think the experience is best in nice weather, the rain didn't dampen our enthusiasm for this unique place.

She tells the story since way back when this was an island with no vegetation. It is easy to say that this place was funded by the oil boom in the area, where guests and workers with $ wanted something new and exciting.
The guided tour is well done and even I'm not a gardener this was magnificent and totally stunning. After the tour you will get the presentation by the chef that has been there for 20years- cool guy with lots of humor.
The food is delicious, even though the trip is on the pricy end of the scale it's offer value for money and is recommended.
Have fun bring camera and swimming suit for the nice beach short, however keep in mind the water here will not make you wanna swim for a long time :-) it is normally quite cold.
Several people have asked if you have to dine in the restaurant and the answer is yes- this is a package: boat trip + guided tour and dinner at NOK1090.- pp.

Norway,TonyRomsey,Flor og Fjære,5.0,We must have been on the same trip from the same P&O cruise as the previous reviewer.

I an not a particularly great fan of gardens and hate gardening but this garden took my breath away. It must be one of the best in the world. Many congratulations to the owners who maintain it with a staff of just six. An incredibly amazing place to visit.,Jul 2017
Norway,TwigsOxford,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"We booked this trip through P & O while on a cruise around the Fjords. It was raining while we were waiting for the boat so it didn't appear to be the ideal day. The boat arrived and was painted with flowers. It was very comfortable inside and there was also seating up on the open deck. It was a fast boat and we arrived at the island in 20 minutes. We were greeted by Olav and Siri who are the owners and son and daughter in law of the original creator. Siri gave us a general overview and we then split into two groups one with her and the other with Olav. The rain did stop and we had a little sunshine.

We were totally amazed by what they had created in such a cold climate. Olav explained that his father (who owned a nursery) and he and his brother as small children first planted trees to make the place less windy and then developed the garden. At first they just brought customers over to see the plants but then bought extra land and expanded the garden gradually to what it is today. It is huge and is divided into many different gardens. They have a palm tree garden, a jungle, cactus mound, bamboo garden, bonsai, rose garden etc, etc. They have even created a beach. There is a lot of water in the garden and it feels very restful.

After we had spent time in the garden we had coffee in the restaurant which was included in our tour. I understand that if you book the tour independently it can include lunch and in fact people arrived on the boat as we left to do just that.

It was a great trip and something completely different. I would certainly recommend it.

Norway,Barheat,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"Flor et Fjaere bills itself as the world’s northernmost tropical garden. Our visit was the highlight of our Norwegian cruise. We booked the tour directly instead of with the ship as it included lunch for the same price. Located on an island, it is a 20 minute ride by fast ferry from Stavanger harbor. The MS Rygerfjord is chartered for the trip and brightly painted with garden scenes.

Upon arrival at the island the passengers are divided into groups based on language for a 45 minute guided tour. As there were only five English speaking guests we received a private tour from Siri, an American who is the daughter in law of the garden’s creator and married to one of the brothers that run the gardens. Siri provided a history of the gardens and its expansion to the current 20 acres. The gardens are maintained by only five people! The Bermuda grass is cut by automated lawn mowers (giant roombas). Each year 50,000 annuals (lots of tuberous begonias) are planted. The flowers quickly grow in the long daylight hours to create a carpet of colour, blocking out any weeds.

The gardens are more than just flowers. There is the Palm Tree Garden, The Jungle, Cactus Mound, Bamboo Garden, Bonsai Garden, Wilderness, Perennial Garden, Rose Garden, Cypress Garden, Koi Pond, Beach and more. They have built ponds to store fresh water and pump it around to create streams and waterfalls.

After the tour we were served a wonderful Norwegian buffet meal. A four fish soup was the perfect starter. The buffet included fish carpaccio, salad, trout, chicken, lamb, homemade pasta with pecorino cheese, rice and more. The meal was completed with a delicious chocolate panna cotta, coffee or tea. Note: There is no municipal water service to the island so if you want a glass of water, you have to purchase it and then ice will be provided.

After your meal there is 1.5 hours free time to explore all the paths and areas of the gardens. Our return boat was a little late and we were a bit concerned. Upon returning to Stavanger it started to rain heavily and the passengers were being let off across the harbor from our ship. We talked to the crew and they graciously took the boat to the bow of the ship for just three of us!

We picked the venue for our fourth wedding anniversary during a four-week road trip of Norway and northern Europe, and it was truly one of the highlights of our month away - despite the wet weather and near-flood conditions in the garden.

The gardens are beautiful - even the lovely pictures here on the TripAdvisor profile don't do them justice! The food couldn't have been better - we started our meal with a delicious, creamy fish soup, which was followed by a buffet-style main which offered fish, chicken, meat and an assortment of interesting and varied sides. Our meal finished with a lovely panacotta-type dessert.

Given the dreary weather, we had a little too much time to explore the garden after the meal, but on a warm, sunny evening it would have been perfect - and when the sun came out just before we boarded the boat back to the mainland, the sunlight shining through rain-soaked vegetation made for a beautiful sight to end our evening.

Norway,mklars,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"Flor og Fjaere with it's fabulous garden is a must to visit when i Stavanger. If not for the food then for the fantastic ""exotic"" garden on the small island. It is nothing like this in Norway (or Scandinavia).
The food that comes along with the journey and guided tour in the gardens, is good and is a nice way to end the visit to the island. Be prepared to wait a while for the food, it may be many people to serve in a short time at the end of the visit.",Jun 2016
Norway,Kabingha,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful our visit was to Flor og Fjaere. For about $250 (for two) we took a boat from the harbor to the island covered in trees and flowers. Included was a guided tour, a buffet lunch, and time to explore the island. The overall trip is about 5 hours. The tour was short and sweet and to the point as you have time to explore more later. Two tours were going on at the same time, one for English speaking and the other for Norwegian. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. After the tour we went to the dining room. It was beautiful and everyone had assigned seating. We were right by the window and had an amazing view. We started off with bread and fish soup and a glass of wine. Wine was extra. The chef came out to talk about the food, unfortunately it was only in Norwegian so we had no idea what he was saying. Tables were called up to get there food so there would be no long line. The food was great and dessert and coffee was serve to each table. The bathroom was very clean and smelled like flowers. After eating we went outside and took a million pictures. I have never seen so many flowers in one place before and we live in Florida. We highly recommend it to everyone. There is a small shop that opens up a half an hour before the boat leaves that has t-shirts, mugs, calendars, books, etc.

After a tour of the garden you'll be offered a good meal from a buffet - self serve - with drinks of your choice.

Norway,BaldEagle100,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"This was an excursion from a Cruise Ship and the best we have experienced except for the time limitation (We could easily have spent more time here).

We were able to get our mobility scooter on the ""Ferry"" from Stavanger and the trip on the fjord was about 20 minutes.

There was a ramp on and off of the Ferry and the Gardens were mobility friendly even the sloping sections.

The weather was poor but we still managed to really enjoy one of the best gardens we have ever seen in the world. Tranquil, not small but perfectly formed, 10 gardens over 20 acres. Annuals planted every year, trees, and magnificent water fall/small link lake features.

The history of this family formed island garden, opened in 1995 from nothing, should not be missed; the Grand Daughter of the founder told it very professionally and answered every question.

You can book the ferry/garden online. (Or use your own boat if booked in advance)

There is a restaurant, toilets & Free Wi-Fi. Open summer only.

Norway,Pudgepaws,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"I'm not a gardening fan by any means but you can't help but be blown away by the beauty of these gardens. And very impressed at how they have managed to grow such a wide variety, including palm trees and cacti, when so far from their typical warmer climate.

The tour was pretty quick and kept moving on when i would have spent a little longer in each garden - again i'm not even a huge fan of flowers but still found it rushed.

We found ourselves heading for dinner before i'd really had much of a look around. Alrhough we were free to look again after dinner, on such an overcast and cloudy night, the light was all but gone by then.

The food was good and the buffet certainly filled me. The drinks were pretty expensive though - about £9 for a small bottle of beer.

I'm really pleased I went despite the price. Well worth a vist especially if you enjoy gardens. The lunch trip may be the better option come September to get the best of the light.

Norway,Natalie Ø,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"We were lucky with the weather and managed to take a trip to Flor & Fjære on a sunny day. The gardens are truly spectacular and the guide was very entertaining. We started with a guided tour of the island and proceeded to the restaurant for dinner. Our starter was their famous fish soup, which was really delicious! Probably the best fish soup I have had. This was followed by a buffet and dessert which was only ok. There were two salads and two types of fish, potatoes, pasta, some chicken and pork. They also had cheesy pasta and hot dogs for the kids menu. Everything tasted ok, but it wasn't spectacular and didn't make an impression. Drinks were also rather expensive, 49kr for a small glass bottle of water/soda.
I don't think the price matches the food but it was fun to have experienced this island.

Norway,karin368,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"A short 20 minute boat ride from Stavanger quay takes you to Hidle Island, the location of one of the finest garden developments in the northern hemisphere, if not the world.
Created from virtually nothing, it just shows what can be done with some expertise, vision and hard work.

We first visited here some 8 years earlier and it was a complete surprise to us then, but we were not prepared for the changes that had been added in the meantime. Absolutely glorious!

Upon arrival you are given a guided tour, relating the history of the place and some gardening tips along the way. Unlike another reviewer, I found this extremely interesting.

This is followed by a 3 course meal with wine, if desired. On our first visit 8 years ago, we would have given this part of the tour a mighty thumbs up, being a great meal. This time around, it was disappointing. They do need to get their act together in this regard, as it is expensive and you should expect something of slightly better value for the money. As a plus, their wine selction and quality is great.

After the meal, you are allowed an hour or so, before the boat leaves for the journey back to Stavanger.

I can't praise the work done here and these gardens highly enough. If you can organize some sunshine it will triple the pleasure to be had :)

Norway,DavidNor,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"Just a 20 minute boat trip from the centre of Stavanger ( included in the package) we land at the northern tip of the island of South Hidla to an overwhelming array of flower beds and trees in vibrant colours that contrast with the surrounding southwest Norwegian stark nature! A well-informed guide then takes us on a tour through the various thematic elements of the park, each more elegant and unexpected than the last, beautifully manicured and weed-free, although somewhat depressing for this amateur gardener. We were lucky to enjoy this sightseeing in lovely summer weather, with clear sun from a blue sky - a good idea to check the weather forecast before you book online.
The tour was followed by a 3-course meal - a very satisfying late lunch in our case, starting with one of the best fish (and vegetable) soups I've ever enjoyed... After the food we had over an hour free to revisit any parts of the park we wanted to see more of, soaking up the beauty and calm of this island paradise, before the boat's return to everyday reality.
An expensive escape from everyday life, but well worth the price!

As soon as we arrived on spot, we were welcomes by 2 separate guides (English & Norwegian). Then we went with the English speaking guide who gave a very nice tour of the entire island first, giving details of each plant that were brought from different parts of the world, and finally took us to the restaurant area. Basically the entire island has been developed by a family who was enthusiastic about collecting plants from different parts of the world and try to grow them on this little island, so they have created a whole different vegetation on this island which you never find in any other part of the Stavanger. The buffet had a wide variety of dishes, fish was exceptional compared to other dishes. Btw they also cooked delicious pasta and some salad for our vegetarian friend. In total this was a awesome experience that i will remember always!

Norway,salsaaudi,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"This Island is in Hidle about 30 minutes boat ride from Stavanger. Often the trip to this Island is fully booked and it is therefore wise to book in advance. You will be picked up by the boat in Stavanger and will be taken to this Island by boat. There are several trips at different times from Stavanger during summer.

At the Island you will be greeted by the owners and guide by the entrance. By the boat terminal there is a nice restaurant. Even if you come by your own boat you have to reserve a place advance.

Once you enter the Island you will really be surprised to see a very beautifull garden with lots and lots of summer flowers of different variety and colors. You will also see some tropical fruit trees that is not typical Norwegian. The guide will give you a good introduction in the history of this garden and about the different themes in the garden. Each year the garden in this Island is expanding and each year they have different themes of flower combinations in the garden. The ponds are the new developments egen I visited a this place and it is necessary as the flowers in the garden need lot of fresh water. This garden is really a sight.

After the guided tour there will be 3course dinner at the restaurant. The main course is served like buffet style. The food here is really good. I have been here several times but this year the water is no longer free but you have to pay for it! That is bad!

After the food serving you are free to move around and enjoy the garden for about an hour and then you will be taken back to Stavanger by boat.

This tour including boat trip, guided tour at the garden and 3 course meals excluding drinks will cost around 140 euros. It is expensive even though this Island is well worth a visit! I have been here several time but this year i felt like the concept has become commercialized.

Norway,Nico D,Flor og Fjære,2.0,"Very bad hospitality.
Gardens are nice. Service in restaurant bad.
At the buffet I took a piece of meat from the childrens menu for my little niece who was standing at the opposite of the table and couldnt reach it. The tiny piece of meat was not even at my fork till the food ""gestapo^ approached me immidiatly that it was for children. I took the piece anyway for my niece. Later in the evening when the restaurant was practically empty my best friend ( who I brought to that place) didn't like the dessert so he asked if he could get a normal icecream which they gave to children. The waiter sad yes but she came back and told me her supervisor said no.
Right. This is what they call hospitality?
I pay an extraordinairy price for ordinairy food ( buffet) and a simple factory icecream on a wooden stick was not possible. I could buy one in the souvenirshop was the answer ( which was closed). Sad!

My best Norwegian friend mister Hoftun brought me to this place last year and the owner ( forgot her name) knows him and she talked at our table about the gardens etc. She was a very friendly woman and I told here I like to bring friends etc.

I regret that I brought my friends from The Nethetlands to this place. I left at the end of the evening and thought : ""this is what we call bad mentality. No knowledge about hospitality and never again to this place"".

Norway,rachadoodle,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"As someone who isn't really interested in gardening and as someone who thought it was going to be overpriced/not really worth the money I was pleasantly surprised!

We managed to choose the worst day in history to visit because it was raining so heavily we were soaked before we'd even stepped on the ferry. Despite the rain we waited for the ferry in Stavanger and enjoyed the view but didn't see much as it was so foggy and wet.

As soon as we arrived we were welcomed and split into Norwegian and English tours, it was nice because we had the choice (our English tour was small but the Norwegian one was quite big so you could go with the smaller group if you spoke English and wanted to). We had a short tour and the lady explained all about the island and how it came to be, this originally seemed quite rushed, we wanted pictures! But she explained that we'd have time later for free roaming and pictures.

She took us to the restaurant which was SO COZY! I would rate this as one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. We were served drinks (which aren't included in the price) and had our starter, fish soup, which was amazing. They were also happy to bring us more bread when we requested it. The main meal was buffet style (which didn't give me much hope) but it was actually very good. There was a choice between fishes, meats, veggie stuff, salad and you could take as much as you liked, I had a few things but the white fish was my favourite. We were served chocolate tart for pudding which was amazing (and I saw they served the kids ice cream which I thought was cute).

After the meal you were free to roam the gardens and the gift shop (they also had free umbrellas to loan, which was good because we definitely needed them). The gardens are GORGEOUS! There's so much variety and so much to look at.

I can't recommend this place enough. The staff were so lovely and welcoming, the food was amazing and the flowers were beautiful and on a nice day (or when the fog lifted) you could see over the water to other islands. I can't wait for another reason to go back here!

And the water features are stunning, they add so much to this island paradise. There were only 4 of us on the English tour so it was like a private tour, given by the granddaughter of the garden's creator. It is fabulous that this is still family owned and operated! We enjoyed the tour which gallus a taste of the gardens before we sat down for lunch. The fish soup was absolutely divine, and we're not even seafood fans! And the rest of the buffet and dessert...wow. Beautifully presented, huge variety and all truly delicious. Then back out to the gardens for 2 hours of wandering, taking photos and relaxing on the ""beach"" in the chaise lounges...perfect in the sun!!

Either way it was a shock to the eyes, even though you kind of have an expectation, it's still a surprise to come and see what they have done and to here the guide tell you about the history and the efforts they expend every year to hold the garden in operation.
It's not cheap, but where is in Norway. NOK 990 for the return boat trip, guided tour of the gardens, lunch and an hour or so to explore the garden on ones own.
Lunch was okay, enough food and they took good care of my 10 year-old son who is hyper-allegic to all milk products.
A must visit but preferably, I would assume, in good weather, as the boat rides takes 20-25 minutes and it can get very choppy in the fjord, also good weather helps you to appreciate the garden better.

Nowadays they plant about 50,000 annuals each year and plant them closely together so that they grow into a colourful (perhaps too colourful for my taste) tapestry. There is also a Japanese-inspired garden, artificial ponds and waterfalls, views of the fjord and the sea, a beach and various well-positioned benches and tables with chairs for guests to relax, picnic, bbq etc. The food they served for dinner was excellent and we had a very nice Rose for aperitif.

Norway,Jennee J,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"After we had to cancel two of our hikes around Stavanger due to rain, we chose Flor og Fjaere as our Plan B.

We woke up about 35 minutes before we needed to be at the harbor to meet the boat to take us to the island. We hustled and got ready and ran to the harbor. There didn't seem to be a sign of where we were to meet the boat and there was a HUGE cruise ship blocking the view of the opposite side of the harbor. After running back and forth multiple times in the rain, we finally saw our boat pull up. It pulls up next to the pulpit rock boat sign and has a floral design on one side.

The ride there takes around 20 min. Although it rained the entire time we were there, the garden was still beautiful.

The tour was extremely short and not really explicative; it only goes over how the garden was founded rather than explaining the types of plants.

The food was pretty good. My friend loved all the fish. I am vegan and they brought me my own entire meal. I did have to wait about 15 min after everyone got their soup to get my salad, which was pretty frustrating considering the price we paid for the trip. I was surprised that they had a vegan plate, which was a nice bonus.

The buffet included 3 types of fish I think, a chicken tortilla pasta, roasted potatoes, quinoa, salad, olives, and one other meat I believe. Water is not included nor are any other beverages.

In all, the garden was pretty but $120USD is really expensive in my opinion even with the boat ride and buffet. The food was good, but not that good. I wish they would give a cheaper option if you wanted to skip the buffet.

Norway,Ane S,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"Lovely island. Really enjoyed the boat trip, tour of the gardens and being able to find romantic spots to take pictures and enjoy the view after dinner.

The food, service and wine however were mediocre.
Personally not a fan of buffets so this probably means I am not the target customer.
The fish soup was nice.
I was very surprised by the lack of attentiveness by the staff. They really missed out on a lot of alcohol sales as both our table of 8 and the table next to us which was a large party would have bought several bottles more of wine if they'd been paying more attention and hadn't vanished from the front desk. We had to go over there to order more when there was someone there.

However I would think this would be the perfect place to book for a special occasion such as a wedding or a large celebration. There seems to be several options for places around the island where you can host private events.
The island is absolutely stunning, the gardeners do an amazing job!
And I'm sure for a private event you would have more of a say in terms of menu and wine served.

Norway,Odd Jarle J,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"Flor og Fjære offers some beautiful gardens that stand in direct contrast of whay you might expect this far north in the world.
From the typical selection you might find in a Norwegian garden to the more exotic and a magnificent japanese inspired section.
Getting to this island is possible by roads, but a regular ferry service (which I believe is seasonal) will get you there from the middle of Stavanger harbour.

In addition to the great gardens on the island they have a great selection available from their restaurants. Offering dishes made from local produce of Rogaland and the surrpunding areas.

Norway,cpmchan,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"This was one of the first things I did in Norway and boy did it set a high standard for everything else to follow. Your time on the island runs for about four hours and it's four hours of enchantment from the time you step off the ferry. You are taken on a short tour around the gardens, with highlights and history given to you by a guide who is also a member of the family who owns and runs it. After gaping open-mouthed at vistas of astonishing beauty, you go to the lovely light-filled restaurant, and enjoy a meal, dessert and coffee, before being left to your own devices to wander around the garden at will - discovering new nooks and crannies and lingering in the spots that captivate you the most. The varsity of flora and fauna is striking, there's an area that boasts succulents and desert like plants, surprising palms and banana trees, a Meditteranean garden, a lush rose garden, beaches and bamboo and lavender all crammed into a wonderful kaleidoscope of scent, colour and composition, everywhere you turn is a picture perfect vista - with elements so diverse that they shouldn't work together yet they do. The rolling lawns are so green and velvety you want to just roll on the grass, the roses so fragrant you spend time with the petals right up against your nose, the surprising seascapes, the clear water in the bay, the powder white sand... One of the best attractions in the area and worth every penny paid.

Norway,Jennynny,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"I visited Flog & Fjaere with my family today and I felt compelled to write a review immediately! I made our reservation online for a 12pm visit and the whole experience has been phenomenal.

We boarded the 20min ferry ride from Stavanger and docked at a stunning pier with flowers and swans. We were greeted by the chef before we were split into Norwegian speaking and English speaking groups for the guided tour. There were only 6 of us in the English speaking group so it was almost like getting a private tour around the gardens.

The tour was short and sweet. Our guide gave us some very interesting information about the history of the gardens and I was pleasantly surprised that these amazing gardens are a family run business. Each garden had a different theme and they contained plants and flowers from all over the world and different climates, which made it all the more interesting. All the flowers were so vibrant and carefully plotted. My parents are horticulture enthusiasts and have been to many botanical gardens across the globe and by the end of the short tour, they were convinced that this was the best one they'd been to yet! It was especially touching to me that the place is still run and operated by the immediate family and you can tell how much love and care they have put into the place over the years and across the generations.

We proceeded to the restaurant after the tour and were treated to the most delicious lunch by chef Andre. He introduced the meal to our group before we sat down which was very much appreciated. I wished I'd paid more attention to the description of the dishes after I'd tasted them as it was very delicious. I personally felt it was our best meal yet in Norway (the flounder and the polenta was amazing by the way)! Amidst the beautiful flora on this island, perhaps the unsung hero is really the food! It was served buffet style (in a very orderly fashion I might add) and we had the option of finishing our dessert and coffee after walking around the gardens again by ourselves, which was greatly appreciated because we couldn't wait to get back out there to take pictures and wander around the grounds. A shoutout to our server, a Norwegian born Chinese guy (sorry we didn't catch your name!) who did a great job walking us through the meal and introducing us to the most delicious eple and risjuice drink ever.

We had about 1.5 hours left to roam around the different gardens by ourselves but if we had it our way I think we might've ended up staying for much longer!

I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who is visiting Stavanger as THE place to visit above everything else. And whilst the flowers speak for itself, it was really the family members and their staff that made the experience what it was. No real downers to speak of at all, except that we weren't able to purchase their book as a souvenir because they'd sold out of their English version! The book contains the recipes from chef Andre at the back which was a lovely touch. My parents want to return again already!

Norway,Jostein H,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"After having heard about this place for many years, we decided to visit. It is a park like we had never seen, so full of all kinds of flowers, trees of all kinds, representative of several kinds of climates (tropical to desserts-like), waterfalls, lakes, beautiful lawns, etc. And opportunities for bathing, swimming in fresh or salt water, etc. Truly amazing. The 4 hours or so we spent there went by quickly. It helped that the weather was just beautiful.

The set-up was very professional. We booked on the net, and were picked up by boat (ferry) in the central and touristy part of the harbour of Stavanger, and thus very easy to find. After a boat ride of about 20 min, we were welcomed at the island, given a tour of the of the park before seated for a very nice dinner. After dinner, there were time to wander about on your own. If in Stavanger, do not miss the chance to visit.

Norway,Worldwonderer365,Flor og Fjære,2.0,"This is a good half day trip. First, we could not find the boat. Turns out, it was a ferry, which did NOT have the logo on it. We walked all over and finally went to the office to find out where the boat was. It was unmarked and next to the Fish Market. We rode inside the ferry, so the weather was not a problem (wind, rain, etc). We took our walking shoes & water. When we arrived, I noted that they had umbrellas, in case it rains. I greeted the chef, as we disembarked and asked what he was cooking. His reply was, ""I'm not the cook, I'm the psychologist!"" I was not sure how to interpret that. We arrived in late May. Plants were in buckets & pots & not yet in the ground; what was in the ground was small. A storm must have tattered the leaves because it all looked a bit disheveled. We were given a very nice 20 minute tour. Unless your husband is into gardening, he probably wouldn't enjoy it, we decided. For lunch, we were taken into a large dining area & again greeted by the cook. His humour was odd, as he described the food. It was Sea Bass, Salmon, Steamed vegetables, Potatoes, Rolls, etc. The group was large & my friend and I could not find a seat. We asked where we should sit. They replied, ""At the tables"". We had to ask them where, because there were no available seats left. They did not find us a seat. We sat at a table, that had not been set. They were disturbed that they had to set it! The group had made reservations. They served everyone bread & drinks, but not us. We had to ask for these. The drinks are NOT included in the price. We drank the bottle water we brought with us. It was buffet style, so we served ourselves. The food was nicely prepared, but simple. It was not anything you couldn't prepare at home. The desert was nice. Afterwards, we went to the gift shop to buy a calendar. It was closed. They didn't bother to open it for us, even though we were in a group of 60 plus, and we could see stacks of calendars. We decided to just get back on the boat & leave. One person asked if she could wait for the next ferry & they told her no. They were not accommodating to anyone. The bathrooms were clean. The chef has been on that island WAY TOO LONG. We did not feel it was a good value for the money & time spent in May. We have no plans to go back. Best wishes.

Norway,mahatinu,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"Stavanger was our first port of call during our July cruise. We had read up about Flor og Fjaere and everyone described it as a MUST DO experience. Fortunately our cruise operator (P&O) had arranged a special 2 hour tour to see this place, and we took it. (The only other way to visit is to do a 5 hour trip with lunch).

Trip starts with a short boat ride to the island. We were not disappointed once we reached the island - fantastic, amazing place. We were lucky with a warm sunny day, and everything was in bloom. Brilliant colourful gardens, we could not stop taking photos! They only use 5 gardeners to maintain this place!! Initially we were shown round all the different areas, and then had about half an hour to ourselves to wander. Coffees available at the end to enjoy.

The vision of the original owner to create was exceptional and that is why I've awarded it a Very good. However, it is an expensive trip and we found that a lot of time was wasted at lunch. Our guide whisked us around the gardens and we were first in the dining hall where we waited for ages till everyone was there. Then we were the last to get our buffet food and last to have our money collected. This all took about 1.5 hours. For all the 'hype' we didn't find the meal that fantastic either and drinks were extra cost which we weren't warned about. This is a money-making machine far removed from its original vision. Fine, but it made me feel a bit taken for a ride.

Norway,Esme99,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"I would definitely recommend visiting Flor og Fjaere, it was a fantastic day out. The journey out is a pleasant 20 minute ride and you will receive a warm welcome on arrival. You're then taken for a short tour in either English or Norwegian and can learn about the history of the garden and restaurant.

Lunch in the restaurant was fantastic. The chef is very charming and met our group to give a welcome and explain the menu before heading inside to the dining room

The meal was really delicious, good luck saving room for dessert! There is a small wine list with a few wines by the glass. The dining room is beautiful with floor to ceiling windows so you can enjoy the view.

After lunch you can spend an hour walking around the gardens at your leisure take lots of photos and perhaps sit and read or talk for a little while.

Unfortunately, our return boat was scheduled to leave at 16.30 we returned to the pier at 16.23 and found the boat had just left. A bit of a bad end to the day as instead of waiting until 16.30, they just leave when enough people get on board. It looks like two other people from the later lunch sitting got on the boat in our place. Luckily there was another boat in 50 minutes, but I was pretty upset that this happened as it put us under pressure to get to the airport it time for our departing flight which I find very stressful. I couldn't stop worrying about it for the next 50 minutes which kind of ruined the experience for me.

I would usually expect that I could trust that if they say the boat will leave at 16.30, it will leave at 16.30 but as this is not necessarily the case, so don't trust that you will make your ride back. Be sure to be at the pier at least 10-15 minutes before the departure. A shame because everything else was perfect and a really special experience.

The whole outing is quite expensive compared to other things you might choose to do for the day, however remember it includes your return ferry, a guided tour and the lunch is really top-notch. I think it was definitely worth the price paid.

We visited June 15.
The whole garden had retained its fairy-tale like beauty in the landscaped areas of rocks, water and trees. The extensive areas planted with brightly coloured bedding with lots of walkways and water features were more chocolate box. Both together reinforced our opinion that it is certainly one of our top three gardens. For some of our time there it rained but it is such a marvellous garden that it hardly dented our enjoyment.
We visited both times from a cruise ship so that, though expensive, it was not as pricey as the usual lunch garden combination. It is worth the cost although we would have liked to spend more than 2 hours here.

You will find blooming flowers, bushes, all kind of trees, including various fruit trees and palm trees (yes, in Norway!). They have put it so beautifully together with nice pathways and beautiful lawns and small ponds, waterfalls and rivers. The best time to go there is of course in summer time; June, July or August. Not to speak of the wonderful food they serve.
You travel by boat from Stavanger - takes about half an hour I think. You pay for boat trip, guided tour and a wonderful meal. It is rather expensive, but worth it!

It’s simply mind blowing what they have managed to create on a small island in the middle of a norwegian fjord. The guided tour around the gardens was both interesting and lovely. Later we were seated for dinner, and the chefs presentation of the menu gave us a few laughs :) Luckily he also could cook the most wonderful dishes. Great food, lovely surroundings and overall a perfect trip on a warm summer day.

Flor & Fjaere is owned and operated by Siri and Olav Bryn and their family, who are very much in attendance to meet and guide their guests. When H.M.

These gardens incorporate flora from around the world so you walk from one continent to another,some areas greet you with an explosion of colour, some with sculptured plants and by using the rocks and different levels waterfalls are in abundance.

The trip starts with a boatride to the island where the garden is. The garden is a marvel and symbol of what can be achieved with long, hard work. It is so beautiful and nothing like what you expect to find in the north.

OTHER TIMES ARE AVAILABLE
Once there you are split into 2 groups (English or Norwegian speaking) then taken around a little paradise.
Afterwards the chef (meant to be one of the best in Norway with a star) welcomes you to his restaurant and service is done by each table in turn (no mad rush when the buffet comes out)
Fish soup was sooo tasty to start followed by an amazing buffet, you will not leave hungry!
Desert and coffee follows.
Beer/wine/water is available until 1 hour before your boat leaves at 2130.

First, there was a guided tour through the garden. Then Chef Andre introduced himself, which was really hilarious. The food he prepared was at least as great as his standup comedy performance at the beginning, especially the fish soup.
The garden is also great, really beautiful and hard to believe that this is in Scandinavia.

So, if you consider what you get (ferry transfer, great meal, beautiful garden which definitely needs a lot of money to maintain), the price is extremely fair.

Norway,Marte R,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"I just had my first trip to Flor & Fjære. I had heard wonderful things, but I was totally unprepared of just how beautiful this place actually is. I can't quite describe it, other than comparing it to an oasis in the desert. Here you will be overwhelmed by flowers, beautiful plants from all over the world and a hospitality from the hosts that leave you wanting nothing more. I have travelled the world, and walking on the small paths of this little island out in the Norwegian fjords brought back flashes of memories from the cacti in the Bolivian deserts, to the cherry blossom trees in the valleys of deep deep China.
When it comes to the food and service, it was pretty good. For a food-lover like me it was a bit of a let-down. That being said, it was a buffet, so naturally the style of food has it's boundaries. However, the ingredients were local and fresh, there was a nice variety of different courses, and the fish soup (starter) was very tasty. In hindsight I wish I ate more of that.
The only thing on the menu that was a letdown, was the dessert, - that was also the only thing not made on site by the chefs.
The head chef deserves a mention as well. I've worked in the industry, and have witnessed countless awkward episodes, where the head chef had to stand in front of the guests, presenting the menu. Trying to pull out a joke, and have it failing miserably. The head chef at Flor & Fjære however have made a genuine stand up comedy show out of presenting his menu.
In a Jack Dee-like approach, he explains how he hates working there, and all the struggles of running a large kitchen on a small island of the coast of Norway, and it's hilarious.

Basically, this place is great. If I could take part in planning the menu (not have a buffet) and I had the money, I would have my wedding here. It's like stepping into a movie set, or a fairytale.
Don't have too high expectations of the food, but do of the scenery, and you'll have an unforgettable experience.

Norway,Badger12495,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"I visited with my sister and niece. We booked mid week for the evening trip (including boat trip to the island and evening meal). To be honest, we liked the look of the literature but had no idea it was going to be as good as it was. Absolutely amazing. Upon leaving the boat, we were shown around the island. The flowers and the 'settings' were truly breathtaking and we were shown around by an English speaking guide (the granddaughter of the original owner). Then we were given a talk by the chef who introduced the menu (he was hilarious and such a character!). The setting of the restaurant was a dream, the service fantastic and the food stunning (3 courses - all superb). We were then supplied with a flask of coffee to enable us to spend time walking around the island (plenty of seating around the island). The attention to detail throughout our trip was impressive. Altogether and impressive and memorable trip and myself and other family members would certainly return should we be in Stavanger again.

Norway,JoNi180,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"The boat trip, the island, the flowers, the tour and the meal all lived up to our expectations. It's a very special place and the family owners are obviously proud of their hard work. After the tour we were met by the chef who was supposed to tell us about the menu. He has a very strange negative attitude to his work, the island, his food and his customers. (If he was a stand-up comedian he would be the kind who insults his audience.) I found him to be very unpleasant and brought down my experience and enjoyment of his food before I even had the first bite. The food was good - not excellent. The service was good and the dining room is beautiful.

We had a very special day and will remember it fondly. However, maybe it's time the chef found a new job, it seems as if (in his own words and repeated several times) he is ""fed up"" with Flor og Fjære.

Cacti and palm trees were in abundance, as were 55,000 other plants connected by pathways and even koi ponds and mini-beaches. There was much to explore, plenty of time to sit in one of the many garden retreat areas and just soak in the beauty, and the meal was outstanding. The visit begins with an overview tour, and we were pleased to be in the very small English-speaking group.

We were than seated for dinner. Very disappointed that not even water was served for the price! Any drink, even water, had to be purchased. All the food was brought out on heated plates than we waited and waited to be called to eat and we were the first table. Fish soup was excellent. Salad, noodle dish, carrots, potatoes, fish, muscles, chicken curry, pork fat with apple sauce, lamb burgers and hot dogs sat under lights until they called us up. A few of the dishes didn't stay hot and the noodles were stuck together. I wish they had one meat/fish dish that wasn't spicy......not everyone can eat that. So my dish consisted of stuck together noodles, carrots, potatoes, and a lamb burger. For me the food was an expensive disappointment. Dessert was good....very small cheese cake. We had plenty of time in the garden afterwards. So, I say go for the gardens!

We came here as part of a conference and when we checked out the website beforehand, we immediately thought ""Tourist Trap""! We were completely wrong and totally blown away.
After the pleasant boat ride over, we were taken on a guided tour that explained the evolution of the gardens and some of the details of how they were maintained. We then were brought back for the dinner. We figured that the meal would be typical group dinner food - nothing to rave about. Wrong again! The food was delicious and the wines were excellent.

Dinner was delicious, a fantastic and fresh buffet. Before dinner the chef comes out to explain the menu and with that you get a pre-dinner stand up comedy show - he really is very funny.

A tour of the beautiful gardens reveal flowers, bushes and trees which clearly belong elswhere. Grapes and palm trees have no place in this part of the world but thrive, thanks to the island's micro-climate and the skill of the gardeners. After my first trip I was inspired to grow an apple tree in the espelier method as I have a terraced garden in nearby Stavanger. My 'Coxs Orange Pippins' this year were delicious. The gardens are not the only attraction here however. The restaurant's chef is not only pretty good at preparing food but also a wit of some standing. His sarcastic comments when presenting the days menu make the food taste so much better.

You have to take a boat to get to this island and during the sommer there are regular tours to this island. You will be greated upon arrival and a guide will walk you through this small island and explain about the different flowers, plants and will give you a lots of usefull tips for your garden. Upon end of guiding you can eat here, The chef here is hillarious if you like his kind of joking. The food is also good. You have to plan at least some hours to make this trip.

Norway,Sylvi C,Flor og Fjære,5.0,Brilliant! Beautifully manicured lawns and flowers in all colours and varieties. An enthusiastic guide showed us around and told us about the history of the island - followed by a scrumpcious meal in the restaurant - well worth a day-trip!,Jul 2013

Norway,Ramona260,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"The trip to the garden comes as a package deal incl. trip to the island, excursion in the garden and buffet dinner (drinks are at an extra cost). The price for the package - 890 NOK (113 EUR) per adult visitor - is a bit steep for where I come from, but considering food prices in Norwegian supermarkets, it's worth it.
While the main reason for visiting F&F is the garden, of course, the fish soup also must get some praise. Also - thanks to the kind and friendly staff! I spent a wonderful b-day there.",Jul 2013
Norway,riikkasii,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"this place is amazing, beautiful!! I've been here twice, and after the guided tour of the garden, the cook tells about the food. the way he talks about the food, makes your mouth water, but the actual food is just ok. It was not bad, but nothing great. Maybe he sets people's expectations too high. I was there a year apart with my two visits, and they had exactly the same food both times.",Jun 2013
Norway,Lillian H,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"Stavanger is a nice city, great scenery, beautiful fjords, historic sites. But it also has a secret - ""Flor og Fjære"". If you love flowers and plants, this is must. Take the time and listen to one of the guides when they show you around on this island. By the way - you dont have to love flowers to be impressed by this place. The island is a littel bit of paradise.
The food is OK.
Would recomend to visit the island when i weather is nice.
The fee for the island is ""included"" inn the fee for the boat.

Norway,Delfi83,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"The garden was lovely, but after the Dutch chef's never ending attempt at stand up comedy, boasting about his food - I was disappointed to have to queue in a line to get average fish soup, salads, pasta etc. It was a bit 'mass production' but I guess how they earn their money. I would recommend greeting guests with a canape/drink before the garden tour, as we had to carry our things and were literally starving buy the time we finally got to eat. A little disappointing and I will not return.",Jun 2013
Norway,Lisa C,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"If you want a magical and unique experience in Stavanger then this is the place to go. The serenity and calmness that comes upon you as you enter into the gardens is just undescribable. There is so much to se and smell, that you could just walk around for hours and hours.

Norway,Jesper T,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"This place is both a botanic garden and a fantastic restaurant that is located on an island. We were two families that went here in the middle of the day together to enjoy the beautiful garden and some good food. To get there you have to take a small boat ride that is included in the visit.
The garden is beautiful and really takes your breath away when you are guided trough the different areas, such as cactus, herbs, flowers and trees all separated of small streams and lakes. You don’t have to be fond of flowers to think this is an amazing place.
The restaurant serves meals during the day and in the evening. You have to book a table in advance. The food is very tasty and well-served. During the day the main course is a buffet and the starter and the dessert is served as a la carte. In the evening it is only a la carte. Although it can sound cheap that the food is served as a buffet it is a mistake to think that. The food is delicious and well-served and a lot of the ingredients are from the garden.

Norway,Pete_Br_27,Flor og Fjære,3.0,"The work of changing this island into a garden of peace and flowers is quite remarkable. It deserves the credit for the effort. On the other hand the relentless Norwegian weather can really spoil the beauty. On a rainy day with a lot of wind one has to simply rush through it, and that's shame. There are lot of benches otherwise to relax and there is plenty of good food in the restaurant. All that was very enjoyable.",Jun 2012

In the northern hemisphere, herein lies a beautiful mecca of tropical and semi-tropical plants flourishing in an environment that supports this lush vegetation. Flowers in a rainbow of colours and varieties are prolific as are a variety of trees. We had a great tour and explanation in English of the gardens, followed by the chef's explanation of the gourmet meal that we thoroughly enjoyed after. Time was provided after the meal to stroll through the gardens on our own before the return cruise back to Stavangar featuring a magnificent sunset. What a lovely excursion and well worth the time and cost.",Aug 2012
Norway,nicksname,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"This is certainly worth a day trip if you're visiting Stavanger. The gardens are really beautiful and very photogenic. We were fortunate enough to go on a sunny day and the boat trip was nice too. We had lunch as part of the package. It was OK for that type of ""mass"" catering - served buffet style with tables being called up in order. It's probably not our favourite way to eat but a reasonable standard for what it was. However, without doubt, the gardens are the drawcard.",Aug 2012
Norway,Morten Lillesand,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"This is a very interesting experience for those living in the Scandinavian countries, and especially high up north. This is an island which has been transformed into a botanical garden and which actually houses a lot of very exotic plants. It is indeed exceptional for this part of the world.

It is probably the only outdoor place in Norway which has palms. The restaurant which is there is also very good. Highly recommended.",May 2012

Norway,Masood K,Vigeland Park,4.0,"We had a full day and a half in Oslo and being art lovers, we decided to visit this park. The park is big no doubt so it’s a bit of walk before you come to the first of the sculpture but the moment you come close to them, you immediately feel a connect.

It for sure seems that the artist is communicating a message. The expression of each of the sculpture is amazing. Some of them are poses of daily lives, of mother playing with child, the father playing with the children, etc. Being the month of Feb, the lake was semi-frozen, as sheets of ice could be seen on the top layer of the lake.

It’s a nice place to just hang around and breathe some fresh air and walk along the path admiring the artist’s hard work.

Standing in one area can you experience the design and how it can create an echo. We then went back in the following evening after snow had fallen and a clear sky. Photographing the statues with stars in the sky and snow on the ground was magical. Would highly recommend a visit. It is easy to get to by tram. The tram stop is right at the front gates. The gates are open 24 hours. We were so taken with the statues and the artist we bought the book that has recently been translated into English. It helped us appreciate this park even further.

The only thing that bothered me is yes, the statues are naked and no, public, you don’t need to touch all the penises. Even the grumpy baby. It’s probably why he’s grumpy. Wouldn’t you be?",Jan 2020

The park structure was designed by a single artist named Gustav Vigeland by himself. Gustav had created more than 200 sculptures and this park is the biggest sculptures park in the world which was also being featured on my blogs. I highly recommend the place because as soon as you will enter the park, you will get amazed by the power of nature full of trees and flowers. The sculptures have different meanings and interpretations. The park is free for the whole year round means you can save more money while you are exploring the place.

Great place to visit with children! You can make a lot of funny photos with those sculptures :)

The cafe at the gate wasn’t great either. The staff weren’t very attentive or showed any interest in serving. The coffee wasn’t great either.

Norway,metrochica,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Gustav Vigeland's massive sculpture park is both a beautiful art collection and kind of creepy. I thought it was a real interesting choice for a city because it isn't the typical cookie cutter sculpture park. There's a lot of deep statements about humans that Vigeland captured in those statues. I loved his take on the cycle of life fountain. It was very surreal. I wish I had a guide to explain all of the tiny reliefs around the base of the fountain. The monolith clearly took a lot of skill and 13 years to carve. But I wasn't really a fan. The park is definitely worth a visit because it is truly unique. There's also a great Anne paa Landet cafe to the left of the park's entrance within Frogner park. It is super cute and has great homemade food. We got big bowls of chicken soup which were fantastic for a chilly fall day. We used our Oslo card to take the tram to park. Sadly, the Vigeland museum was closed, but we did visit the Oslo Museum that is also in Frogner Park.

All of the sculptures are without clothes, because Vigeland wanted them to be timeless! The sculptures capture human emotion, are playful and thought provoking! It is the world's largest sculpture park made by one artist! My daughter and I visited in September and the weather was perfect! After strolling through the park, we had a relaxing treat and tea at the small cafe. There is also a coffee shop near the front gate. Entry is free and Frogner Park in a short 15 minute tram ride from downtown. It's also a stop on the bus line and the Metro is a ten minute walk away. If you have the time, this is definitely worth a visit when in Oslo!

In this atmosphere the park as a unit made for me oppressive impression. Its monumentalism and straight lines of the park are typical of Mussolini’s passions. The main statue- the obelisk- emotionaly for me relate too close to the concentration camps in Poland and Germany. And in the same time brilliant technique when looking separately to every statue- unbelievable count of human emotions frozen in stone and bronze. So, it was interesting to see, but it is not the place I want to return back.

I found some of it incredibly thought provoking and stunning in it's detail and art expression. We seem to rush our visit to about 90 mins. but felt I could have stayed there much longer. Plus the accessibility to the airport was so easily made with public transportation.

Norway,Davidjellis,Vigeland Park,5.0,"To set this review in context, I am not a huge fan of art, and sculptures I can take or leave, but I found Vigeland Sculpture Park totally captivating and surprisingly good. I fully expected that my wife and I would just pop in, have a quick walk around and then move on, but 90 minutes passed by very quickly and we could have easily spent much longer here.

The sculpture park sits inside Frogner Park, which is expansive and pretty with lots of colourful flowers, fountains, ponds, etc however the highlight is of course the sculpture park, featuring a large selection of works by Gustav Vigeland.

There are two long rows of individual sculptures lining both sides of the main thoroughfare, including the famous Angry Boy statue. Beyond that there is a large bowl-shaped fountain supported by six naked male figures surrounded by an odd array of figures under what resembles broccolli florets, and then at the back of the park there is the Wheel of Life and the impressive Monolith column.

The many statues around the monolith depict various scenes and groupings of male, female and child sculptures, all unique and many in very interesting poses. The sculptures also range from young people to elderly figures, showing all stages of life.

It's a fascinating place and well worth a visit. There is no charge to enter the park, and there is a Hop On Hop Off bus stop right outside the park entrance.

Just take tram 12 from in front of the Central Train Station and get off at the Vigelandsparken station. The park is about 4 miles northwest of central Oslo and the train station. The park is always open and there is no fee to enter.

I visited this impressive park and sculpture garden with my wife on a Friday evening in late May and really enjoyed it. We had a limited amount of time in Oslo so we visited this attraction in late afternoon after most other attractions were closed. The park is large, so it takes a while to walk around and see all the interesting sculptures. I especially enjoyed the large Monolith on the highest point in the park. It is about 50 feet tall and is amazingly carved out of one stone block. There are 121 people carved into this statue and they look like they are piled on each other. This place is very popular and there were lots of other tourists and locals walking around. If you want to walk around in quiet contemplation, make sure you get there very early.

Overall, I really enjoyed this impressive park and recommend it. This is a must-see attraction when visiting Oslo. I heard this is the most visited tourist attraction in Oslo so expect a crowd. There is a small playground for kids and a restaurant near the park entrance. Your kids may get bored looking at all the statues, so you may want to let them play on the equipment before leaving the park.

Norway,GandC_UK,Vigeland Park,5.0,"The park and the Viglen sculptures is spectacular with great views from the central monolith. Most of the staues are human nudes but tastefully done. Tram 12 has stops at 2 different entrances. The park itself is free but the Viglen museum just outside the park is chargeable or with the Oslo Card, this was closed for a change of display when we were there. In the grounds is also the Oslo museum, included on the Oslo card, this is quite small but has a useful cafe and loos, (the loos in the park require a contactless card for 150 KR)",Sep 2019

Norway,DickfromSeattle,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Oslo is a nice city but it is no Paris. The highlight of our visit was the very cool Vigeland Park, accessible via Tram #12, and famous for the nude but wholesome statues by Gustav Vigeland. He was a Nazi, but past politics of dead people do not seem to bother the Norwegians the way they do the more politically correct Americans. Imagine if Norman Rockwell had painted all those heartwarming homecomings and Thanksgiving dinners with every character naked. And imagine that he was a member of the KKK. Rockwell would be banished from our prim and proper culture, but Vigeland is still celebrated for his amazing talent. (His brother Emanuel, BTW, was a member of the resistance, and has a notable museum of his own.)

Norway,Linda A,Vigeland Park,5.0,"We visited this spectacular sculpture park on a recent trip to Oslo - this was one of my ""must do"" places and I was not disappointed! All of the statues are individual and different, showing the human body in all its glory.

The parkland where the statues are sited is equally as impressive - a huge open area in the middle of the city with grassy areas, flower beds and a lake - it is well used by local families.

The climb up to the upper levels was difficult due to a lack of hand rails, and coming down again afterwards was even worse - take care if you have decreased mobility.

I didn’t know what to expect as this was a stop on the Hop On, Hop Off bus, but I was thrilled we hopped off.

I was not familiar with Angry Boy so the entire park was a delight and a surprise for me. If you get uncomfortable or are going to find yourself snickering at nude sculptures, this is probably not the place for you. There are hundreds of amazing sculptures gracing the grounds of this beautiful park.

I was surprised to find local school kids out on a field trip here and they were climbing all over the sculptures and drawing their own versions of them.

Overall, an impressive place to take in the sights and explore what it means to be a human

Norway,David S,Vigeland Park,5.0,"What an impressive sculpture park. This needs to be clear, Frogner Park and Vigelandsparken Park are the SAME PLACE. This park is a public park and is FREE. USE PUBLIC TRANSPOTATION! Kids loose interest fast; but, for adults, taking the time to see sculpture Gustav Vigeland created displaying the cycle of life is incredible. The love put into each sculpture is shown in the details. It’s hard not to touch them to make sure they really are rock. You can’t help but think of someone you know in each figure. Not by face, but by moments in life. This park will make you reflect on life and there is no way you will not experience thousands of different emotions.

Norway,Tripstaker,Vigeland Park,5.0,"This is a unique place, so no surprise that it's Oslo's most visited tourist attraction.
I expected statues to be scattered randomly throughout the park. Instead they are on both sides of a walk from the entrance up to the monolith.
It's a lovely park in its own right, but the sculptures take it into a category all its own. And there are so many.
I especially liked the first section, capturing the moods and moments of parenting.
Further in, it's adults depicted at different stages of life, and these fascinate as well.
They're so incredibly life like, especially in their facial expressions.
They were unlike anything I've ever seen caught in stone.
Just unmissable!

It’s a beloved place for locals to walk their dog, runners and tourists alike.
It’s clean and well-kept and it’s so big it never feels crowded (unless you find yourself near the entrance when the huge tourist buses arrive!)
There’s also a big playground for kids and a restaurant near the main entrance.

Norway,Olivia,Vigeland Park,5.0,"If you only have time to see one attraction in Oslo, choose this one!

Vigelandsparken, or Frognerparken, as it is most often referred to by us locals, is the biggest public structure created by a single artist in Norway.

The park’s story is very interesting. Go on a tour if you have the chance. Otherwise, just enjoy the amazing sculptures and the park’s lovely fountains and small flower gardens scattered around.

Make sure to see the infant garden hidden to the left of the bridge, before you cross it.

The park is also a great place to have a picnic, go for a run or read a book. It features a very nice café, a cool outside restaurant, a kiddies park and the very lovely and small Oslo City Museum (free entrance). By the park you also find Vigelands museum.

Follow the river all the way down to Skøyen if you want to go for a longer walk. The path is beautiful. At the end of it you can jump on the blue tram or bus and head to the city center (buss 31) or to Majorstua (buss 20).

The parks is also a great place for families, elders and small kids. Bring a picnic cloth, a book, food from a nearby store and enjoy your day!

Lovely in all seasons, specially springtime, summer and fall.

Enjoy!!

PS! Colosseum movie cinema walking distance, in case of rain.

Norway,Marty Bielicki,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Entering Vigeland Park is ""FREE."" When I first saw the statues of Vigeland Park it was at night in 1979. It always impressed me. Coming back in the day time in 2019 impressed me even more.

This famous sculpture park, made from 1924 to 1942, is nearly 200 bronze and granite statues made by Gustav Vigeland and his associates. This is the largest world collection of sculptures under one person. There are 600 total figures from Norway’s great sculpture artist in an area known as Frogner Park.

We actually walked from Karl Johanes Gate to the Park. It did take nearly 45 minutes, stopping every-so-often taking pictures along the way. Tram #12 from Central Station will get you there in no time.

Gustav Vigeland did study under August Rodin. You will see that all of Vigeland statues are “nude.” The meaning of all these statues can be interpreted in numerous ways. Our favorite area was the 300-foot bridge with statues lining the structure.

“The Angry Boy” is one of those statues. It does draw plenty of people. You can tell the hand in bright yellow with all the people touching it over the years. There is also another small part that is bright yellow which I will fail to mention. Women in particular were drawn to touch this area.

A beautiful fountain separates the bridge area to the 50-foot monolith sculpture. We found this fountain to attract many people to take selfies.

The 50-foot high monolith sculpture is quite impressive as the centerpiece of the complex. It is the highest area in the park. It took over 14 years with 3 stone carvers to make this statue of people climbing upwards. We interpret this statue representing people’s struggles in trying to get-ahead. You can form your own opinion.

There is museum with a number of Gustav Vigeland’s sculptures. Close by is a popular café. There were tons of people there on the sunny day we visited.

This is a popular park. We noticed the area to be extremely clean with “NO” graffiti. People of Oslo are proud of this park and rightfully so.

Doing research, we found that Gustave had some major criticisms. There are a number of people who contend his artwork “reeks of Nazi mentality.”

He did make a comment before his death in 1943, “I welcome German soldiers with their excellent discipline to walk around between my work.” Norway was indeed divided in its support of Germany during WWII.

First of all we had a walk around the delightful gardens, and then our guide told us we were going to a sculpture park.
She gave us a brief background of the sculptor’s life and times, but nothing she said could prepare us for the sights we were about to see!
The sculptor produced over 350 sculptures whilst also designing the gardens in which they stood.
Unfortunately he never lived long enough to see the project finished.
Also, he never sold any of his sculptures.
The sculptures themselves are of the life of humans from infancy until death, all in various positions, either alone or intertwined with others, and all naked.
A round stepped area of sculptures surrounds a large tower of similar figures.

Oslo is a compact city and The Park looks way outside but from The Royal Palace we walked and I would recommended it. An easy slightly uphill 30mins stroll through residential streets. Just keep straight when exiting from the back of the Palace.

The park is open 24 hours and my advice is to get there early before the buses invade. You can catch the No.12 tram, but we were having too much fun on the electric bikes and left them at the entrance.
It's a beautiful park, but had wished that maybe we had a guide or researched it a bit more before we got there as there isn't any actual information in the park itself. Once we googled it, we appreciated it a lot more. There are over 200 huge sculptures and are grouped into ""The Wheel of Life"" and ""The Clan"" with a rather large walkway leading to the bridge. Gustav Vigeland actually designed the park and its very impressive layout. Must admit with the huge volume of sculptures and how impressive they were, was a bit over the nudity and genitalia halfway through it.
We wandered through the entire park, and it really is beautiful with the thoughtful seating areas in shady areas set around in semi circles with a sculpture in the middle. The plantings, flower beds and huge fountain are stunning. If you can, take your time and discover the whole park (this will probably take a huge chunk out of your day, but it's worth it). We went past on the hop on, hop off bus around midday on another day and the place was packed with people and buses. Get there early, or perhaps later in the evening.

Norway,Peter_Bomberg,Vigeland Park,5.0,"The sculptures are all unique and convey feeling, the sheer size and scope is impressive but to find it in the city is even more so.

The park is very well laid out and never feels repetitive, it's not just an open space with sculptures it's a park designed to show off the sculptures, follow the main axis and go trough 3 or 4 separate but connected spaces.

I have to say this is a must visit, right up there with the Viking ships. Each is unique but on a nice day this is a fantastic outing.

Norway,traveltheworld012,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Norway’s most famous sculptor and wood carver has over 200 sculptures here.
I visited here when I backpacked around Europe in the 1970s. I was back again with my wife this August 2019. It brought back all the wonders of that first visit. This sculpture park is magnificent! The park is free admission and open 24 hrs/day.
Gustov Vigeland studied in Oslo, Berlin, Paris and Florence, where he gained inspiration from Rodin, renaissance artists, antique and Egyptian sculpture.
These sculptures explore in particular the topics of death and the man/woman relationship. This park is his magnum opus the Vigeland Park in Oslo, but he is also known for several well-known sculpture portraits and the Nobel Peace Prize Medal design. 2019 marks the 150th birthday of this amazing man.

During our visit this year, the park was crowded with tourists. I counted at least a dozen tour buses while we were there. The sculptures encompass a very large area, so don't let the crowds deter you from visiting. This park should be at the top of the list for anyone's visit to Oslo.

However, just to be walking the long street inside the park, pass the bridge with a the bronze sculptures and the granite pieces. You see the impressive craftmansship. Plus enough places for wonderful selfies. If there isn't to many tourists in your way.

The park also have family places to play around. Plus some cafees and a gift-shop. Surely, there is possibility to bring back some tokens from the day you went here.

It is easy access from tram and your not having a tiring walk. If you want a green pasture in the midst of the city, easy to go to and not needing to spend big-cash. This a sight to go to.

Norway,lobstaluva,Vigeland Park,5.0,"There is no doubt that Gustav Vigeland was a very gifted artist. He envisioned creating this park to share his talent with the world, but he did not live to see its completion. It is the largest such park in the world highlighting a single artist. There is a main promenade, side paths, flower beds, greenery, a pond, bridge, fountains, and over 200 statues of bronze and granite. The statues are of naked humans of all ages in all phases of life. Some are comforting, some are humerus, and some are.......well, freaky. What was Gustav thinking??

The centerpiece is “The Monolith” which is 46 feet high and set on a flat raised area. There are figures climbing all over it and each other trying to get to the top. Another interesting piece is “The Fountain” which is surrounded by 20 figures in different stages of life. You might chuckle when you see the “Angry Boy.”

It is a lovely, peaceful place for a leisurely stroll. There is also a museum, cafe and gift shop. Just enjoy!

Norway,Normanta,Vigeland Park,5.0,"I sat at the entrance to Frogner Park eating my lunch in some shade from the scorching sun. As I sat there I watched the almost constant stream of Oriental visitors being disgorged from coaches and tramping up the drive to see the statuary, known as Vigelandsanlegget. Some people accuse Vigeland's work of having a Nazi sentiment. I don't think so; much of the sculpture in the era after the Great War had similar characteristics. I admire his creative imagination and his amazing productivity. Many of the visitors smiled and sniggered at the complete nakedness of all the figures. I didn't. I saw raw human emotions unencumbered by clothes. Clothing could have indicated station in life. An old woman comforts another grief-stricken woman; an old man nurses his dying friend; two laughing children clamber on their mother's back using her plait as an imitation bridle; a group of teenagers giggle at something; man and woman regard each other; two rivals glare. In the middle is the unique monolith with 121 naked figures of all ages, entwined together as they ascend to the top of the 14-metre high column. I would like to see it all in winter without the crowds.

Norway,Ed C,Vigeland Park,4.0,"The sculptures in this park are outstanding, perhaps too outstanding. It was difficult to get a clear view (or photograph) of any of the popular sculptures with all the bus loads of tourists surrounding them snapping selfies.

According to our guide they are actually damaging some of the statues by insisting on holding on to part of the stature while taking the selfie. The oils from their hands are corroding the protective patina on the statue. This is most obvious on the ""Angry Boy"" statue where the areas being touched are bright and shiny bronze whereas the rest of the sculpture is weathered green.

To me the most impressive part of the park was the fountain surrounded by sculptures and bas-reliefs depicting four ages of man - child, adult, parent, & elderly. Above the fountain is the also impressive monolith.

The park is a must see. I recommend you go early in the morning and avoid the crowds.

Norway,nobodee,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Vigelandparken provides some of the most breathtaking sculptures of human beings - might add naked human beings - of over 100 sculptures with stories to tell. Won't go into the details, as the stories can be found in Wikipedia and websites.

The entrance is free, yet this was one of the most interesting attraction, including seven or so museums I attended.

Easy to access with tram - and be sure to buy tickets, especially on the way back to the city, as there will be a good chance who will check your train ticket - even on weekends.

But, I drift - allocate 30 minutes if you want to walk quickly through the whole park - it took me nearly two hours at a leisurely pace, and avoid tourist groups.

And, yes, there were quite a few tourist buses - why not? With free entrance with eye catching sculptures, it's an easy attraction to showcase.

Definintely worth a visit, if time allows.

Norway,Corihi,Vigeland Park,4.0,"The sculpture park features over 200 sculptures by a single sculptor, Gustav Vigeland. It’s amazing that one person created all these sculptures. The sculptures are all naked men, women and children representing the cycle of life. The sculptures are not my cup of tea, but it’s definitely a must-see in Oslo. I would’ve liked a map or brochure, but we were told that Vigeland didn’t name his sculptures because he wanted everyone to interpret the statues on their own. I don’t recall the amount of time we spent in the park, but I think it was about an hour. I think you should allow 2-3 hours to see everything at a leisurely pace and to relax in the park.

Vigeland was interested in the whole of life and two sets of sculptures explore this, one in stone, the other in bronze. Entering from the back gate we were struck by the huge obelisk which is carved with figures. Around this are colossal figures in all stages of life. Further on is a beautiful fountain where the bronze statues begin

Of course, there are the usual flowers. Well- kept,,of course. I wish we could have spent the day there. Apparently, it was a gift to the people from Vigeland and is open all year round n

Description: a free sculpture park, great for sunny days and lots of interesting/thought provoking art by a sculptor called Vigeland.

Highly recommend this park provided it’s good weather (it’s all outside/no cover) and you are happy with a long-ish walk from the city (or catch public transport).

Hundreds of sculptures, plenty of green space and lots of fun photo opportunities.

There’s a beautiful fountain and key sculpture up a few flights of stairs.

Lots of space to sit and have a picnic and very safe (lots of families and tourists).

A beautiful walk from the city down a wealthy part of Oslo (and past the palace and gardens).

Highly recommend checking out the angry child/baby statue and the man attacked by babies.

Make of them what you will - very interesting, diverse and thought stimulating.

A great, free activity in an otherwise exorbitantly pricey city.

Norway,radx4,Vigeland Park,5.0,"We visited Vigeland Park while in Oslo. This is probably one of the most famous attractions in the city.

It's a nice park with a large collection of statues. It's famous not just because the sculptures are impressive, but of course because the subjects are all naked (apparently Vigeland didn't mention this ahead of time when negotiating the contract).

We did have a tour guide, and she explained the significance of the sculptures. The sculptures around the fountain are the ""tree of life"" that show people in different stages of life. I don't specifically recall the others, but I'm sure there is significance to them as well. The park is nicer with a guided tour, but you can certain enjoy the sculptures on your own.

The centerpiece of the park is the monolith, an enormous carving with over 200 people made from a single stone. It definitely stands out.

We took a tour bus to the park, but Oslo's public transportation is pretty good and you can likely take a street car there as it runs right next to the park. There is also a small parking lot there, so you could drive too.

If you're visiting Olso you're probably going to at least stop in Vigeland Park. I definitely recommend it.

It’s a vast, beautifully landscaped sculpture park filled with hundreds of bronze and granite sculptures by Norway’s greatest sculptor, Gustav Vigeland. Vigeland worked onsite for almost twenty years designing the sculptures. The sculptures are expressive, tasteful and visually impressive.

Bring a guidebook with you to help you navigate and understand the sculptures as there is no onsite signage. The Rick Steves Scandinavia guide book had a thorough description of the park which really added to our enjoyment of the park.

There are three main sections to the park: the 300 foot long bridge lined with 58 individual sculptures; the fountain, surrounded by 24 tree of life sculptures; and the monolith, surrounded by 36 groupings of granite statues. You can find the Sinnataggen (Angry Boy), probably Vigeland’s most famous statue, in the middle of the bridge. Each section is incredible!

If you don’t want to look at man-made art, enjoy the plants, trees and birds. The place is huge with something for everyone.

There are over 200 pieces by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland in both stone and bronze. He won a contest in 1900 and was granted a huge plot of land by the new Norwegian government to place his statues. The park opened in 1907.

The sculptures show every phase of life from birth until death. I’m glad to have had a guide show us around or so much of the meaning would have been missed.

Very unique. Worth a visit any time of year. Would love to see the fountain working and the roses blooming. I’ll bet it is really amazing!

For some the lack of clothing might e a distraction or impediment. Not one stitch was seen.

Cost is free the toilets were not but they did take Apply pay or a credit card $2 but a number of people went in on one charge.

Norway,buttereyes,Vigeland Park,5.0,"“Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered, I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City to take back the child that you have stolen."" (Sarah, The Labyrinth)

It's been rumored that Bowie didn't pass on, but instead returned to rule over his Goblin City. I can't be certain, but I suspect he could be found somewhere within Vigelandsparken, perhaps inside the labyrinth...

Walking through the wrought-iron entrance gates to the park, you may feel like you've wandered onto the magical set of the movie baby of Jim Henson, Ridley Scott, and Wolfgang Petersen. In reality it is a world created by Gustav Vigeland, who designed the park to showcase his life's work of 200 impressive bronze, iron, and granite sculptures.

The park might not recount epic fantasy tales, but it does tell evocative stories of relationships and the circle of life through sculptures from precocious children to elderly couples embracing.

A bridge lined with statues in humorous poses ushers visitors to the gardens, fountain, and monolith. We were not questioned by a Fox Terrier knight riding a sheepdog while crossing, but we did find ""Angry Boy"". The baby is bronze now, so Sarah must not have solved the labyrinth in time!

Beyond the gardens, enter the labyrinth...just don't choose the door that leads to *bom bom bom* CERTAIN DEATH! Above the labyrinth looms a formidable fountain held up by giant Prometheus-alien-like statues.The statues appeared to be granite, but Fassbender probably just hadn't awoken them from stasis yet.

If you survive the labyrinth, climb up to the Monolith Platform to marvel at the never-ending view of the vast kingdom and obleisk of twisted bodies. If you look up, you may spy Falcor flying overhead!

With luck you've made it through the park in time so that you too won't turn to bronze like Angry Boy. Then like Sarah, you can tell Jareth, ""You have no power over me.""

The park is free to enter and is open year round.
Enter if you dare.

Norway,Vicky P,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Nevertheless it was an interesting though dangerous at times walk while slowly crawling along icy paths to take a better look at a statue or a group of statues. According to a local friend, the beauty of this park is that it sings life and death for that matter though if you want to put the things you see in boxes, you would probably fail miserably as there is no clear logics if at all in the way the statues are placed, so statues of kids are right next to adults and old people and love comes immediate after death, or the other way around, it all depends where you start your journey. And again, according to the local friend, the park is the most peaceful place on summer nights when the only people you share it with are sculptures.
