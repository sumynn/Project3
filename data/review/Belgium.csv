Belgium,Rita,Grand Place,5.0,"You can visit the place for free. We visited this place when we went to Brussels in October 2021. We saw some people did not wear their mask but we kept wear our masks.

We can see the beautiful square buildings in this place. At night everything turned even more beautiful. They have some restaurants for people to enjoy their day. It is difficult to find place to sit. So, it is standing place.

The place is easy to reach by tourists maps. We walked from Brussels metro station to this place and took around 15 minutes.

Belgium,Kei P,Grand Place,2.0,"My wife is in a wheelchair with limited mobility, which means she can get out and walk a few meters if she has to. She definitely had to in order to see this square. The streets leading into it had cobblestones that were so uneven I couldn't push her so she had to walk in while I pushed the chair behind her. Good luck if you can't walk at all.
Once we got in the pavement was a bit smoother so I could at least push her but every few meters we would come to a bone-jarring stop as we hit an uneven space and were stopped dead in our tracks. But we did make it around well enough to take some photos then we had to walk her out at the end.
So you may be thinking that the next best alternative would be to take some sort of mobile tour: a car, bus, whatever. Well we did that. We had an electric Rickshaw pick us up at our hotel so we could leave the wheelchair behind and he took us for a nice tour of the sites. Well, a lot of them anyway. When it came to Grand Place all vehicles are banned because of terrorism fears so we couldn't go in. So if we didn't take that wheelchair trip we would have missed it completely.
I did get a lot of nice pictures of the square, both in the morning while it was deserted and while it was lit up at night. Unfortunately I had to leave my wife back at the hotel and go by myself in order to do it.

Belgium,June A,Grand Place,5.0,"I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit Brussels during the brief period last summer when things returned to at least some semblance of normality. I stayed just a few minutes from the Square and so walked past or through it almost every day in some capacity. It's a huge open space filled with the most glorious and majestic buildings - the best known of which are of course the famous Guild Houses. These are every bit as beautiful as they look in the pictures and house a variety of different institutions some of which are open to the public. The restaurants and bars were open for business when I visited and were doing a brisk trade with people no doubt wishing to make up for the many months of confinement. On the day I arrived in Brussels the square had a team of acrobats entertaining the crowd, which I must admit threw me a little. It was though all very organised and although crowded I felt perfectly safe as everyone was masked up and enjoying themselves. The atmosphere at night is very different - the buildings are lit up with groups of friends sitting on the cobbles in the square drinking, smoking and catching up with each other as the sun gradually does down and the light fades. The buildings look even better at this time than they do during the day and for a woman alone it is of course perfectly safe.

Belgium,Amel,Grand Place,5.0,"The Grand Place should definately be on your list of places to see. Make the wonderful historic buildings that line the square the reason to visit but it also features a large selection of bars and restaurants and the side streets full of the same plus many tacky gift shops and perhaps average chocolatiers. If you want a choice of above average chocolatiers wonder up to Le Sablon for Wittamer and the amazing Pierre Marcolini. Shopping for a gift or momento try antique and junk shops along and around the Rue Haute and Rue Blaes leading to Place Du Jue De Balle where you will find a daily Flea market.

Belgium,BPMKMT,Grand Place,5.0,"This review is a year later, we visited last summer. Been lucky enough to visit a few beautiful squares in Europe in our time, The Grand Place is my favourite. The old town streets all will funnel naturally towards the middle of this beautiful square with 2 beautiful tall buildings that stand across each other. Interesting note, neither are places of worship one is a Government building. I would recommend joining a tour with one of the locals with a yellow umbrella. It is free, but do expect to tip the tour guide, it is how they make a living and it is well worth it. From there you make your way anywhere, Brussels is very walkable, I suggest a walk by the Gallery where they sell tasty chocolate. Sit and have a Belgium waffle and expresso. I would recommend Neuhaus and Mary's chocolate if you are like fine chocolate. From there make your way to the Royal Palace. You can't get lost, you can always make your way back to the square with the arches of the tall buildings visible.

Belgium,WarrenFretwell,Grand Place,5.0,"If you go to Brussels, then this is a must place to see! It is a large, square plaza surrounded by buildings, including a town hall, that can only be described as opulent.

Started in the 10th Century, built and rebuilt over the ages, it is a marketplace that now house offices and restaurants. It is said to be one of the most remarkable plazas in Europe and it cannot fail to impress.

Lots of tourists, especially at night when some of the buildings are lit up with colored lights.

The alleyways that lead to and from the Grand Place are ripe with shops, chocolatiers and stores that cater to tourists. There are restaurants as well, but I found better prices a little farther off.

The area seems very safe. We went during all times of the day and night and never encountered any problems. Of course, you should probably keep your cash in a money belt anyway.

Bring a camera for photos and videos because this is the place that was made for it!

Belgium,Bob K,Grand Place,4.0,"The Grand Place is the central square in Brussels. It is surrounded by opulent guildhalls and two larger edifices, the city's Town Hall, and the King's House or Breadhouse building containing the Brussels City Museum. The square measures 223 x 361 ft. The Grand Place is the most important tourist destination and most memorable landmark in Brussels. It is also considered as one of the most beautiful squares in Europe, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998. To counter the Town Hall’s symbol of municipal power, from 1504 to 1536, the Duke of Brabant ordered a large building to be constructed across from the Town Hall as a symbol of ducal power. It was erected on the site of the first cloth and bread markets, which were no longer in use, and it became known as the King's House although no king has ever lived there. Over time, wealthy merchants and the increasingly powerful guilds of Brussels built houses around the square. A number of guild houses have been converted into shops, terraced restaurants and brasseries. Notable institutions include Godiva Chocolatier and the Maison Dandoy speculoos confectionery. One of the houses owned by the brewers' guild is home to a brewers' museum. This square has lots to offer. Allow ~1 + hrs for your visit.

During the Festive Season the sound and light show is part of the Winter Wonders programme where a 360 degree sound and light show takes place on the facade of the Grande-Place including the City Hall.

The Grand-Place is surrounded by chocolate shops, bars and restaurants worth visiting is De Kelder and The Cave (reservations recommended) and if you’re looking for a pub type lunch, I can recommend the La Rose Blanche, a traditional cafe-restaurant with a stucco ceiling rose and heavy wood beams with a wonderful atmosphere.

Belgium,Alex David,Grand Place,5.0,"The Grand Place can truly claim to be Europe's grandest stage set. Completely surrounded on all sides by imposing, ornate buildings, half of them topped by gilded decorations, the whole space feels rich and theatrical. My first look at the square had me completely entranced by its beauty, and made me walk around with my neck cranked up and my mouth open. But is also a place of contradictions where on the one hand you have fancy cafes serving drinks at exorbitant prices to the well-dressed, and on the other folks of all kinds just sitting on the bare stone pavement eating Belgian frites and drinking beer like the place was a beach in Australia. In a way, it acts as the perfect heart of Brussels, a city with a taste for the surreal.
Because of the beautiful buildings there are many photo opportunities around the square. To get the best shots keep in mind these few tips:
--the north-east side of the square with the dark-colored Maison du Roi and the Chaloupe D'Or, are best photographed in the afternoon when the sun faces them directly
--conversely, the Hotel the Ville and the marvelous entire north-west side are best photographed in the morning light.
--one of the best vantage points from where to photograph the whole square is from the raised stepped entrances of the Maison des Ducs de Brabant building on the south-east side of the square.
Also, don't miss the opportunity to see and photograph the square at night, when the buildings are all lighted in golden colors over the busy, glistening cafes underneath. There are no lampposts in the middle of the square, meaning that--unless there are events going on--you end up walking in a central pool of darkness surrounded by walls of light. It is magical, especially in misty winter.

There are a number of touristy restaurants around the square, as well as the Information office and a church. Many more cafes, shops and restaurants are in the streets close by.

Belgium,pgb2pgb,Grand Place,4.0,"Decided to visit the Grand Place to see the sound & light show for 2019, missed last years show so was a priority this year for the family.

We went to eat first at a nearby restaurant and then walked into the Grand Place just as the light show was starting. It was very well done and a great opportunity to take photos or shoot a video... all you saw at head height was camera phones. The show is very well done and really impactful, it lasts a while so find a spot and enjoy. We chose one of the top corners behind the nativity shed, it gives a good view of the whole Place and wasn't too crowded (the centre was heeving with people).

The only issue was when the show stops for a break, everyone then moves to leave via won of the exit/entrance streets. This caused a huge crush of people as you had masses trying to get out and a similar number trying to get in. It became quiet dangerous when a young girl fell over, luckily the crowd managed to stop while she quickly got to her feet again, but it took all my energy to try and lean back to keep the crush of my own children ahead of me.

The commune/Police really need to set up some form of crowd control to keep people safe, it would only take one thing to start a stampede and somebody would get seriously hurt.

Apart from the crush at the end though it was a great experience and well worth visiting, just don't rush to leave (let the crowd go first) then you can exit at your own pace. Parking is fairly good with a host of local car parks, they're not cheap but will offer a safe spot for parking. Note that it became very busy on the roads to the car parks after 7pm, this was a Saturday so maybe that was part of the reason.

More information can be found in guides and on Trip Advisor. And, if you are an American, do not expect to find signs or descriptions in American English. In Belgium, many signs are in French, Dutch, and Flemish. It’s an adventure! Some venues do have audio tours for a small fee.

Belgium,sanju_222323,Grand Place,5.0,"The Grand Place is indeed grand. As the city’s central square, it is the most visited landmark, home to two of the main attractions in Brussels, the Town Hall, and City Museum, as well as former guildhalls. if you’re coming to Brussels, I’m sure you’ve already got this one marked on your to-see list. Surrounding the square are the characteristic Belgian guild houses, the Town Hall, and the Maison du Roi where the Museum of Brussels is now located.

Also known as Grote Markt, Grand Place was a major market place that dates back to the 10th century. now It’s lined with many cafes, making it a good place to sample traditional Brussels’ foods, such as modules (mussels), waffles and french fries, which originated in Belgium, not France ( which of course everybody knows for sure I believe). the Grand-Place is probably the best place to begin your tour of historic Brussels; it is within walking distance of many of the city's main attractions, including the St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral and the beloved Manneken Pis. This is also a great location to grab a cup of coffee or a beer and watch the world go by.

This is also the site of the bi-annual Flower Carpet where one million begonias carpet the square over Assumption Day weekend. It is filled with a carpet made from flowers every second of August.

It is said among locals that the statue of Everard t'Serclaes brings luck and grants the wishes of all who touch it.

Belgium,ElaineAndGreg,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"Bruges is relatively unknown in the United States and, although we travel a great deal, we were not much aware of it. In fact, it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Bruges was one of the richest cities in the world around 1400 and the architecture and city grid are very much intact from that period to around the mid-1600s. It has wonderful buildings, canals, decorative elements, and buckets of charm. You can have a delightful time in the historic center, and you will find endless surprises if you go outside of it.

Bruges is one of those cities where the city itself, rather than a particular building or site, is the star of the show. San Francisco, Prague, and Amsterdam are in the same boat.

The atmosphere and ambience around the city is wonderful. There are great restaurants and shops and it's just fun to explore.

This part of the city really is as magical as the pictures show - better perhaps when you see it for itself.

It centres of course around the main square and the smaller streets that lead off in all directions - and of course the canal area, where one if you choose to cruise leisurely on a boat trip to see the city from a different angle. Personally I prefer to walk, but we are all different.

However, we were extremely disappointed by the sour mood and rude people who live there! We've never seen such dour faces in our entire lives. And here we were, grinning from ear-to-ear, happy as can be, as we walked around the city, pushing (the cutest baby ever!) in her stroller. Not one smile from anyone. Not a one. No, that's not true. The owner of the restaurant we went to was nice (and he smiled) and the owner of the B&B we stayed at was a very warm and hospitable person (she wasn't from there). What is wrong with these people? Why would anyone (much less EVERYONE) be so miserable here. This was in 2009. It is now 2021. I know we'll go back because now I am interested to go see those museums again. And our cute baby is now a scowling pre-teen, so she'll fit right in. JK

Belgium,Cargs101,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"We visited Bruges for 4 nights over Christmas. This gave us time to enjoy walking the city once the day trippers have left. It is such a beautiful place to walk and enjoy the sights any time of day but at night with the lights and mist it is amazing.
At Christmas there are a number of markets in the central area where you can enjoy beer, food and trinket shopping. The markets are not as good as some of the German markets we have been to but they are still a nice place to spend an hour or so.
If you have the chance to spend time in Belgium then Bruges is a must visit and it should be more than just a day trip to enjoy it fully.

Belgium,WayneLLC,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"To start with, I regrettably did not try any of the infamous Belgian waffles while I am here...

So, Bruges and Ghent were my primary destinations for a day-trip plan from Paris and they turned out lovelier than I have imagined. Do check out my Ghent review that I will be doing in a bit if you are planning a similar day-trip.

While staying a day or two would have been perfect in the ""Venice of the North"", accessibility and walk-ability were a huge plus for this Belgian city. Do refer to my photos taken for a quick summary of the attractions and activities you can cover in a good 3-4 hours worth of exploration, all consolidated in this bite-size review.

""Canals, cobbled streets and medieval buildings"" were some of the distinctive charms of Bruges and it is just a short walk from the Bruges train station. While i am not going to list all the attractions (that you can easily researched with a quick google search), you can take comfort in knowing that they are all easily accessible within one another, by foot.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Plot an itinerary: You may think this is a 'duh sort' of advice.. While the city is very walk-able and you can't exactly get lost here, the planning of your specific route can be essential for ones that are coming on a tight, half-day trip. It is very easy for you to miss out, with many attractions just around the corners or close-by.

Personally, I used google map to plot out my itinerary and loosely explore around. Definitely set an alarm like I did so you are conscious of the time - to get ready to move on especially if you are on a tight schedule.

2) Gears: Dress comfortably, equipped with good walking shoes. Camera is also a no-brainer for this picturesque city.

3) Recommended to do: Try the waffles (while i personally did not have any waffle, I am pretty sure all the waffles here are good). Grab some Belgian chocolates and get on the canal cruise.

Belgium,Diana C,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"Really enjoyed our long weekend in Bruges. Centre is quite small so you can walk to most places, but horse and carriages available from market square. Many museums and art galleries and we found out too late there is a museum ticket which covers many venues and obviously cheaper than buying singularly. Lots of chocolate shops, there were several markets not just the central one and of course all streets maintain their historic look. I live near Salisbury and there there are ancient buildings but next to them a 1980’s concrete monstrosity, this doesn’t seem to happen here, there are modern buildings but tastefully placed, so looking down any street it is pleasing to visitors. The towers on the market square well worth a visit , but expect queues, best to be at bell tower really early at opening as tower so narrow only a few allowed up at a time. Eating out is good but expensive. Overall a delightful city, loaded with history and art , well worth a visit.

as art lovers we were disappointed by our visit to the Groeningen Museum as we was enticed in by names like Jan Van Eyck, Hieronymous Bosch and Bruegel but there were only one or two of these. We were disappointed by the small number of first rate pieces and while some of those lesser known local artists were not without merit, most left us cold. Staff seemed bored and were rude.
The town is the star of the show and every day we walked and found delights around every corner. Belgian chocolate is everywhere and it's delicious as is the hot chocolate. The beer's good too!

Belgium,Belkys H,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"Bruges – an unforgettable experience. From the cosmopolitan London arrived to the tiny Bruges via the Eurostar train, in just 3 hours. Bruges is the capital of West Flanders in northwest Belgium that is distinguished by its canals, cobbled streets and medieval buildings. Bruges is a treasury cove full of activity in spite of the weather. It is easy to explore and there are surprises at any corner. There are plenty of things to do there, whatever you do; it will be a Belgian experience. · The Historium: a great way to understand Bruges medieval heritage in 2 hours.
· The Groeningen Museum: this museum features great painting by the Flanders primitives Jan Van Eyck, Hieronymus Bosch, Gerald David and others great artist from the 1400-1500. · Church of Our Lady: Bruges has many churches, however only seeing this one is mesmerizing. The building itself is a masterpiece. It hosts a Michelangelo sculpture and medieval structures with fresco paintings, among other medieval pieces. I love the iron work and the arches in the ceiling.
· Saint Joseph Hospital or the Menlingae: it was hospital in medieval times, now it is a well elegant museum that hosts six painting of Hans Memling. The building is worth the visit and seeing 6 Memling at the same time made my day.
· The Christmas market: with many of the delicious treats from the region.

Bruges offers a great shopping experience as well; many local and international brands are found here. Belgian chocolate is everywhere! And of course the Belgian beer is a must. I tried Straffe Hendrik from the local Half Moon and it was amazing! There are many other things to see in Bruges, however only be there near the market would be enough to get a taste of this enchanted city.

We have found a difference in a few years where we used to be able to walk around and seek out little spots to eat at a reasonable price but everything has become so commercial and overcrowded and expensive. The delight has gone from our love of Brugge. Locals were having to wheel their bikes, that have priority, and some were even carrying them. The weight of people were taking their toll as even at the church of the Holy Blood the general boise and disrespect on the stairs and in the church was incredable. Do the masses actually appreciate where they are these days.

Avoid eating on the main square but definitely have a drink there to watch the world go by and definitely think about making restaurant reservations in advance as a lot of the restaurants get quite full. Unlike others, I don't rate the Christmas market though - it's small, doesn't really change from year to year, busy and a bit on the tacky side of things. Does this stop me visiting in December/early January, no, but I wouldn't be going for the market anyway.

Belgium,Stephenbkk20156,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"We loved the Medieval buildings, narrow streets, curling alley ways, a new architectural surprise around every corner. We hated what they've made of it - a tourist theme park which, if you are not caeful, can seem as dead and meaningless as Disney.

We walked in from the busy station area, across an area of park land which acts as a buffer between Historic Bruges and the real world. Nice walk for a summer's evening, but as we progressed the are around us became more and more visited and less and less lived in. Streets and rows f houses hollowed out. Tourist numbers swelled.

After a few chocolatel-boxy streets, we were well and truly lost but heading more or less in the right direction. A building with a large courtyard. Lovely place. Nobody home, so we wandered at will around the buildings, clicking our cameras as as we went. Some kind of museum or performance space inside. Several like this.

Then we found ourselves on a street of medieval buildings with a river crossing it under a bridge. Every building was a curio shop, most of them closed for the evening.. Lace, ice creams, post cards, scenes from days gone by. More lace. Some beautiful stuff.

Churches. Bigger buildings. All on the same medieval theme. Grandiose. Impressive. Itching to be photographed. Narrow roads gave way to wider ones. The river developed bridges and pools. Tourist boats. Little triangles where roads met became great squares.

The bigger the square, the more the hubbub of tourists. Even some vehicles, We came to one enormous square. All church on one side. All bars and restaurants on another. Civic buildings on the remaining two. Absolutely beautiful. Performance space in the middle. A great place to sit, soak in the atmosphere, eat, drink, ignore our fellow toursits, and watch the sunlight fade as summer evening became night.

An that was as far as we got. Ate oue fill and found a taxi rank just off the square. Quick ride back to the narrow reality of our purpose built station hotel.

Magical visit..

The name changed to Rozenhoedkaai because of the stands of roses that were there.

The historic centre of Bruges can be reached by a 20 minutes walk from the train station- along the way you are transported back in time.",Dec 2019

There are so many beautifull things to see and all on walking distance. You need more than 1 day to see it all ... museums, houses big and small, churches with amazing treasures, a tour on the canals, windmills, ... Michelinstar restaurants, small cosy brown cafés, great hotels and b&b, peoples restaurants with our own special meals, ... souvenirs like beer, chocolat, lace (buy the real stuff not made in China !), on the secondhand market along the canal you will find something to your liking. I must stop ... you must find out for yourself what a great place Brugge is. Don’t forget to talk to the people - they are the best ... guys and guides ever.

Belgium,Jo T,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,We have “done” a pre-Xmas weekend in Bruges a number of times. It is always a bit different but the highlight this time was a free walking tour with a young “Bruges Ambassador” called Dimitri. Lots of chocolate shops willing to take your money but note that only 10 of them offer home-made chocolates. Plan to park and walk to your hotel as most don’t offer parking. Your car is not needed once you arrive. Two nights is good and easily doable (if you take a Friday day off work) from the South of England via the Tunnel. Many places closed on Mondays so do check beforehand. Recommend booking Restuarants as the ones which will have space at the last minute are not necessarily very good.,Dec 2019

Loved this city but be prepared that generally shoppes opened around 10 am and closed around 6 pm. Restaurants and pubs stayed open later. Quiet, stunningly beautiful & romantic city.

Very easy for us as there was a port shuttle bus from the P and O Ventura at Zeebrugge and then another free bus to the lovely church at Blankenberge. This was our pick up and drop off point near the train station. The return fair to Bruges was €4.30 and it was one stop and 15 minutes. Very seamless.
After a short walk stopping to admire the lovely scenery and chocolate shops we happened on the historic centre. Bruges was very scenic, very clean and not what I expected at all. There are many museums if you have a few days there. Many Belgian beer shops and the Christmas markets which start towards the end of November. Would definitely return to do this another time.

The food is bit expensive here. Don't know about the hotels as I did a day trip by train from Brussels. There are around 40 trains a day from Brussels, Leaves about every 30 mins. Walking around the town is a good idea, every few yards u see a photogenic view.

I also visited the church of our Lady and saw the 1505 famous work of Michelangelo 'Madonna and child' and the museum, entry is only 4 euros.

An easy day trip from Brussels but don't don't Ghent and Bruges in one day, u will end up rushing and not soaking in the beauty.

Belgium,RJ koch,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,Brugge was one of the coolest places that I’ve ever been too. Incredible charm and great historic locations. We were fortunate enough to have a canal view from our hotel and we couldn’t get enough of the view. The people were very nice and the food was great. I would recommend Brugge to anyone that enjoys beauty and history.,Oct 2019
Belgium,AndrewC,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"Wow what a lovely city. I came here as a teenager and always wanted to come back so did so 25 years later with my own family. I have been to Rome, York, Edinburgh, Paris and many other historic cities but none are as romantic, beautiful, clean and safe (from what I experienced) as Bruges. Everything is also in my opinion really good value compared to SE England. Amazing food, canal boat trips, horse carriage rides, brewery tours, museums and fun sights to see. We heard you maybe need 1.5 days here but we comfortably spent 3 days enjoying everything. An absolute gem of a place to visit. Fantastic!

Belgium,Michael M,Historic Centre of Brugge,4.0,"visited for a weekend in late October and was taken aback with how beautiful and quaint the city.
Found the whole experience very nice and enjoyed having dinner in one of the many restaraunts around the square.
Went on the horse drawn carriage around the town which cost 50 euro for 5 people so reasonable enough, and also took the canal trip at 10 euro and again was very good value.
Recommend a visit particularly for romantic break.
Oh and what can I say about the chocolate !!!

It is a bit busy (as expected) but there are less busy periods (Sunday morning) and areas if you want to avoid the crowds. All the buildings are so well maintained. There are few sights to see but for us was just walking around the city. Plenty of restaurants to choose from (be careful to check the opening times as some are open just few hours a day). Most restaurants are small and cosy and seem to be family run businesses which makes the city even more unique.

Depending on the activities, you can visit the historic part over a weekend if you are on a short stop or visit.

A canal boat tour is a must. So many amazing buildings to visit, the queue to climb 360 stairs for a panoramic view was very too popular, we chose an art gallery instead. Many of the attractions are well lit up at night so an evening stroll is worth doing as well. Brugge has a good rail connection to Brussels Midi rail station, express train takes one hour, there is also a slower train. Brugge speciality meal is mussels, really nice, there is also a huge range of beers to choose from (4% ~ 10% strength).",Oct 2019

The history is interesting and we did three free tours by Legendstours.be and enjoyed them. All the tours began at Grote Markt. I recommend doing the tours to get the most of your visit. The chocolate, beer, waffles, and food are great. Rabbit in plum sauce, mussels, and Flemish stew are the local fare. We tried them all and were satisfied. See the Belfry, walk along the shops, see where Maximilian was kept locked up. Eat a Liege waffle...yum!

I love to photograph every where I go and I found Bruges very photogenic. The buildings, bridges and canals are stunning.
We took a boat ride which was €10 per person and was well worth it. You get to see so much from the water and it was a lovely way to chill and take in the views.
Well worth a visit, especially if you love chocolate.

We didn't go into any of the places, but really enjoyed just seeing the area. It is very clean, with no litter anywhere.

Of course, there is also the attraction of Chocolates, Waffles and beer when you need a rest.

Wortha 100%, she has an amazing English so it was easy to understand everything. Only suggestion for bigger groups that ours, maybe it would be good to have a micro.

Belgium,annijes,Historic Centre of Brugge,4.0,Lots of restaurants border the edges - tourist prices but good to pop into and people watch.

But frankly the whole town is a wonderful, picturesque place full of photo opportunities. It's a quaint but touristy town. The architecture is old and the colours slightly muted, but not dull. Horses with carriages regularly ply the town's cobblestone streets, though they charge aplenty to ride on. There's plenty of restaurants and shops abound with reasonable rates compared to Brussels. The whole town is compact and easily navigable. Definitely worth a visit if in the Benelux region, or if passing through Belgium.",Aug 2019

Belgium,Kebba74,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"The first thing to strike me about Bruge was the cleanliness of the streets. Despite having a high footfall of tourist, some of whom are messy to say the least and have a tendency to discard waste, all the streets including back alleys and side-streets were almost spotless and a testament to the workforce of the municipal authority. Parking in the centre was not a chore either with two well appointed public car parks offering Underground parking and toilet facilities. On street parking was limited but easy to navigate the regulations with all pay machines offering multi-language instructions.

The sights of Bruge are amazing, the architecture grand and ornate. I recommend the 35 minute boat tours that leave every 10 minutes or so from at least five boarding jetties dotted around the centre. The guides on the boats are knowledgeable and add some good humour to the sightseeing.

Whilst a little on the expensive side for evening dining around the centre of town (Markt), you can look to the side streets to find smaller brasseries and restaurants offering value for money meals. All food establishments we visited served decent portion sizes and had menus offering traditional Belgian dishes and local specials.

Probably one of the more picturesque European cities to visit at night, Bruges is definitely worth exploring after dark. It feels safe and secure to walk the streets as there are plenty of people milling around well in to the early hours.

Belgium,Annette M,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"Bruges is a beautiful historic town and a perfect day trip from Brussels. No need to book a tour. Just take the train to Bruges, then take the bus from the train station to the center of town. Will cost less than 20 EU for round trip. Your train ticket will also give you the option of a stop over in Ghent. That’s what we did. We took the public transportation to Bruges, walked around town. Took the 6EU boat ride, (well worth it!). Bruges is special because, unlike most Belgian cities, rather than tear down and rebuild, they restored. So it is a very historically accurate town and beautifully scenic. Unfortunately, it is no secret. So, everyone comes to Bruges. Full of tourists. Most locals stay away from town center. By contrast Ghent, also a historic and scenic town is a university town. It, too, is easily accessible. When you get off the train, again, a bus is needed to take you to the center of town. They run frequently. Also do the boat tour in Ghent. A nice way to get an overview and save some walking time. This combination makes for a perfect day out of Brussels.

Belgium,Xave Edison,Historic Centre of Brugge,4.0,"Bruges is one of the most beautiful and romantic historical town in Europe.

The main square is surrounding by gigantic historical buildings such as Belfry of Bruges and Historium Museum. You have plenty of choices to fill your stomach as there are alot of cafes, restaurants and fast food nearby. Take note: the food in Bruges are quite expensive.

Same as Amsterdam, canal walk is one of the main attraction in Bruges. There are plenty of scenic views along the riverbank and by far, viewpoints at Jan Van Eyck Square and Rozenhoedkaai are the best.

Consider walking to Minnewater if you have time. It is less touristy and the scenery is equally beautiful. We spent awhile sitting beside the riverbank looking at swans & ducks swimming by and also enjoy some quiet moments.

Overall, we enjoyed our visit in Bruges. Though it is quite touristy, there are still plenty of places around the town which you can enjoy some peacefulness.

Belgium,Nay,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"I fell in love with Bruges. What a beautiful picturesque city frozen in medieval time. Its story is amazing and its punishment by the Emperor Maximillian turned out to be a blessing (400 years later). Hence why it is frozen in time ( take a tour to learn the story). The people are friendly. Great shopping. Beautiful quaint streets. Beautiful churches and buildings. I see why it’s a UNESCO site. It is so beautiful that’s it’s referred to as the Venice of the North. A trip to Belgium is not complete if you don’t visit Bruges. Also, a day trip is not enough. We stayed 3 nights and it was too short. Make sure to take a picture at the most photograph place in Bruges called the rozenhoedkaai view. My last picture is it.",Aug 2019

Belgium,Eurotripper49,Historic Centre of Brugge,4.0,"A very cleverly thought out museum for any age range as you have a choice of the virtual experience or the choice of just enjoying the museum itself. My two daughters were thoroughly entertained with the virtual experience, the only downside I would say is that they lost interest in listening to the historical side of Bruges on the digital audio headset and were more interested in the virtual reality experience at the end. However for adults it is beautifully set out and with options of stepping out onto the balcony for a full vista of the market square and getting a beer if you want. I personally would manage without the virtual tour however I do understand the appeal for children and teenagers. Altogether a creative introduction to the history of Bruges 😊

The footpaths are very narrow with constant traffic and silent bikes passing by all the time. Every second shop is waffle or chocolates. When we stopped to eat in the square at davent spaghetti we enjoyed our food but it was ruined by the endless horse rides going past. It was a hot day and the rides were full of stupid tourists that clearly thought their enjoyment was more important than the horses. One horse ride had a box that held around 8 people. If they wanted to make it better get rid of the horse rides and pedestrianise the whole town.
Ghent had no horse rides that I saw the pavements were much wider and the town was more pretty.

I arrived in the morning to find the streets empty of people. This changed very quickly, though. Bruges is a popular place and here is why.

Amazing architecture. You can roam through the centre without having any specific destination in mind and you will always find an interesting view. Romantic souls will spend hours finding their favourite spot.

Narrow cobbled streets, river, bridges, coffee and waffles. Sit down by the river and watch the world go by. Or have a boat trip. You cannot get lost in this neat medieval town.

Great as a day trip if you are staying in Brussels and a must-go not only for the fans of the film In Bruges.

One of the windmills is open to the public. The main squares were very busy but you only have to walk a couple of streets away and it's really quiet. If you like museums it is worth considering a museum pass. Our hotel gave us some money off vouchers, which covered the pass. There were also some smaller exhibitions, which were also very good.
There is a free bus shuttle, which has a circular route and takes in the railway station and the main square.

Belgium,Wanderlust,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"Bruges is very pretty and just as described by many others. We really enjoyed walking around the old town - it’s not very big. We stayed in Brussels and took a train to Bruges for the day which was only 55 mins away. It was easy to do and worth the trip. There are lots of museums and historic buildings and many shops and restaurants.
We took a boat ride around the little canals for €10 for 30 mins which was really informative and enjoyed learning about the different buildings. The boat trip was worth the money just for the amount of information we learnt.
Be aware just as in Brussels quite a lot of places charge 50 cents to use the loo. McDonalds in both places do this even if you are a customer!
Bruges also seemed more expensive than Brussels for most things.

Belgium,KJN-Family,Historic Centre of Brugge,5.0,"We were in Bruges for four nights. One day we drove to the coast but the other days we spent here.
The most beautiful streets are definitely the ones spreading out in all directions from the town square. I recommend exploring those streets early and/or late in the day when the bulk of day tourists are not there.
We found it best to walk through all the streets and parts that are still within the ""circle"" of the historic town but are far enough away from the very center between about 10 am to 5 pm. You will feel like you are in a different city because you will not see many tourists but still get to explore quite a few nice spots. Also, in addition to that, walking the perimeter is a great way to experience the town.
Our first day we spent in the main part and it drove us pretty crazy. Did not like it very much. It feels like a circus and zoo combined.
I was glad we were able to change our minds by staying away from the super busy parts in the middle of the day. During quiet hours, Brugge is absolutely beautiful and lovely.

Oh, and take one of those boat tours before you begin to explore the town. Many fantastic photo opportunities, a different view than from the streets, and you will recognize many places later when you walk by.

Belgium,Gem,Historic Centre of Brugge,4.0,"Brugge is undeniably beautiful. It is something of a victim of that beauty in that in our experience it was heaving with tourists . Yes , well I was one of those! Four of us stayed locally for 3 nights. We enjoyed the small boat trip and carriage drive. We mainly wandered about soaking up the beauty of the historic buildings and small waterways. We did visit the Frites and Chocolate museums. They were informative and not overcrowded. My husband did the brewery tour, which was fine. Trips, accommodation and eating out are all very , very expensive. I can’t say our experiences of the food, or accommodation in any way justified the inflated price with quality; the exception being the cafe in the concert hall , where we had lunch, which was very good.

Having had this experience, if I were going again solo, or as a couple, I’d arrive and stay overnight, get up early, 6.30ish, go out for a wander in the central historic parts . Get a leisurely breakfast and then aim to go on an early boat ride and / or carriage drive. By this time the tourists arriving for day trips / tours will be pouring in to the centre from the coach park and train station. This is the time to try the lovely walks around the more tree and parkland periphery of Brugge and for summer, much quieter and cooler once the heat is up. There are still enough cafes to pop into if you want a break, or take a picnic. Brugge is not large so a walk around the perimeter is achievable in probably an afternoon at a leisurely pace . At any point you can be back in the centre in ten minutes of walking . Try wandering some of the less tourist trail streets if you do want to get in to the centre. Also the small parks, are pleasant to walk through.

Not mentioned in any guide book was an outdoor swimming area in part of the canals that we happened upon. It had a small changing facility/ shower. It was quite close to the centre.

Good luck.

The old station has been transformed and extended to three (or is it four) floors and escalators glide alongside the staircase, but it is majestic. Try to visit the old station café too, although there are other options for snacks and take aways along the concourse.

Belgium,bfltd0,Antwerpen-Centraal,5.0,"It is hard to believe that a building of this beauty is used for something so banal as a railway station. Clearly with a new and an old section, the feature we found most interesting was that there are at least 3 different levels that trains arrive and depart from and it was odd to sit on a seat on one platform and look up to see a train on the floor above!

We already had tickets so didn't need to use the standard facilities, but we were just bowled over by the architecture of this place.

Well worth visiting as a building, not just a railway station.

The sheer scale of the engineering drilling digging and tunnelling to create such a structure within an existing masterpiece of a station is truly stunning.

The station dominates the skyline - from De Keyserlei, the adjacent zoo area and indeed the square. Needless to say, great and numerous photo opps inside and out. It is of course the main Antwerp station and has good facilities - a nice coffee lounge and two good mini supermarkets amongst other shops.

You can very easily get to Ghent and Brussels as examples in about an hour. It is obviously well worth a visit even if you are not using it for travel - you cannot miss it as it dominates the area.

Belgium,differentname,Antwerpen-Centraal,4.0,"... you won’t forget it.

This train station is modern and old at the same time. It is a spectacular building rich in architectural fenestration, heavy in stone and light in glass. Possibly the most grandiose architecture displayed in any European train station.

It is built like a palace to impress.

It is a great place to start your tour of Antwerp, heading down pedestrian friendly streets to the heart of the city, and further to the riverfront, thru, arguably, the best sites in town, Grote Market, the cathedral, and then onto the red light district, which is always fun...especially for the teenagers.

This is a beautiful City, and we do not hear much about it in the USA, except for the changing influences brought about by immigrants that plan to change the culture of the land.

Constructed between 1895 and 1905 this amazing looking station with its exquisite stone facade and vast dome is a great introduction to this most beautiful of cities ,designed by Louis Delacenserie with the main viaduct into the station designed by Jan Van Asperen who was a local architect.
Antwerpen Centraal is now regarded as one of the finest examples of railway architecture in Europe and in my opinion in the world.
During World War 2 the station was severely damaged when two V2 bombs hit the main hall ,this damage was visible for 40+ years after the war ended and was finally repaired the 1980's ,I just love to walk around this amazing station taking in the grand architecture, the main hall is awesome but the whole station is superb,its massive but very easy to negotiate, it's most definitely well worth checking out if your planning a holiday to Antwerp.

Also terrifying as it is 3 levels and I’m not ever really sure I am going onto the right level. I do love the waffles at the stands. A must try if you are looking for a quick breakfast or a snack. But the favorite part of this train station is the lobby area where you can buy your tickets from a kiosk or stand in line at the ticket office if you need help. They are always friendly and helpful.

Ok the furniture may I have changed to something modern and it may not have the same 'buzz' of cultural conversation if once echoed to but - wonder of wonder the restaurant is still running - with waiter service - a good selection of well cooked inviting dishes (plus a 'quick-choice' for those in a hurry).Wonder at the magnificent mirrors reflecting the light, marvelled at the stained glass and imagine yourself back in time when the steam seed gently though the atmosphere. Gone now of course, but there is a collection of locos and carriages alongside one of the upstairs platforms used by present day trains and on the same level as the restaurant. Enjoy, ask if you can't find it, but don't miss the experience. When you go out again into the square, turn round and look back at the station and its' adjacent buildings.

It has shops of various kinds and it is a hub of great activity. You can catch a train to go practically anywhere in Belgium or Europe. You can also catch other modes of transport, either from the building itself or from right outside, such as trams and buses. It also has a huge parking area underground, cars and bikes. Buying tickets is not very difficult, although, as we discovered, you need to make a bit of time to buy tickets for outside the city, as it can be a bit time consuming.

Belgium,Redminster,Antwerpen-Centraal,5.0,"Antwerp Central station (Antwerpen-Centraal) must be one of the most beautiful and most impressive railway stations in Europe. Trains arrive/depart on three levels (reminiscent of the new Berlin main station) and the original main hall is reminiscent of Grand Central Station in New York, without being as busy, and arguably more beautiful architecturally.

We visited the tourist office in the station twice during our long weekend. The first time was to get some general information on the city and on city bus tours.

The second was when the city's tram/underground ticket machines slightly ridiculously would not accept Euro notes larger than €10 and didn't take card payments. In this case, the helpful lady sold us a couple of day tickets quickly, efficiently and with an excellent explanation of the best way to get to the MAS museum from the main station, even down to which staircase to take out of Meir underground station to change onto the 7 surface tram.

Everything was conducted in perfect English, something I've come to almost expect in Antwerp, such is the high level of English spoken by most customer-facing people I've encountered in the city.

Here you find beautiful dome and and waiting room lined with opulent walls of Baroque architecture, topped with glass ceiling and green iron works indicative of late 19th century Art Nouveau, the en vogue architecture of the day when the station was constructed (1895-1905). What you can see is really impressive, well worth a few clicks of the camera.

We further enjoyed a brief visit to the Le Cafe Royal, a beautiful station cafe and extension of the architectural delights found throughout Antwerpen-Centraal Station.

Belgium,Shawn P,Antwerpen-Centraal,5.0,"The station is beautiful and very well preserved, as most central stations in Europe. This station has several levels of track, (3)three that i could see. That was cool. I took the 7:45am from Antwerpen Centraal to Amsterdam Centraal, the train was very nice, i have taken a few high speed trains in Europe before like, ICE in Germany and renfe AVE in Spain, but i think this was the cleanest and most comfortable ride i've had. I had a premium class seat and was served a nice breakfast. Personnally i think this service was a bit pricey, there are several cheaper ways to get to Amsterdam, but i had a few time restraints and needed to be there quickly. So this worked for me, I believe a 110 Euros oneway, there is a slower inner city train that takes twice as long but is around 30 Euro. I also heard of a bus service called FlixBus that has a ridiculously low fares (i mean like 8 Euro oneway from AMS to Antwerp, or 21 Euro from Antwerp to Paris) not sure how they can offer those prices, but its worth the look.
Overall i think traveling through this train station was quite pleasant, and easy as a tourist, I only speak English, and I had no problem navigating and getting questions answered.

Belgium,Booffamily,Antwerpen-Centraal,5.0,"This one time I should give 6 stars. This magnificent 19th century railway station is nicknamed ""the cathedral"" for good reason.

An absolute must-see",Jan 2018
Belgium,maggie2791,Antwerpen-Centraal,3.0,This is a magnificent building with platforms on three levels.

Well worth a visit when coming to Antwerp",Oct 2018
Belgium,I-am-not-Robin-Hood,Antwerpen-Centraal,5.0,"The external frontage of the station is an architectural gem. The inside boggles the mind in terms of how the original designers came up with its structure. Trains seem to be literally stacked on several levels and the view from the lower part looking upwards is almost awe inspiring. On one level there are rows of shops, cafes etc. One might imagine that such a complex structure would be difficult to negotiate, but the clear signage allows you to find your way easily.",Oct 2018

The building draws you literally in and leaves you stuck with its impressive beauty. Here is a travel terminal that is not geared to let you consume, but just allows for a moment of reflection that life is beautiful and that places need to be seen. Grand ceilings, gentle light and a space to bow to the trains that roll in and through. The Antwerp rail terminal should not be missed on your next journey...oh and you also can consume stuff there...but that just feels optional though",Jun 2018

Ranked between 1-4 among world's most beautiful train stations, this architectural masterpiece could easily be mistaken for a museum.

Belgium,JTFT_17,Antwerpen-Centraal,5.0,"Ever entered a trainstation where poetry is painted on its arches? Ever entered a cathedrallike building, not a place of worship,but inviting you for reflection, with a magestic dome protecting temporarily expositions and a hall that is an excellent venue with the right acoustic for a great flash mob? Ever stood speechless before a building elected the #1 most beautiful trainstation in the world, while witnessing a unique walking art gallery, a parade of the most stunning pictures of the annual Burning Man Festival? If your answer to one of this questions is yes, you have been a most welcome visitor to the Central Station of Antwerp. You can even find trains, but do not rush in just minutes before yours is leaving, take time and have a look at the magnificent restored original steel and glas construction that protects you from the rain and wind; then take a breath and look down the three underground levels. Originally there was only the ground flour and it was an end station. Supreme engineering held this massive construction ‘up in the air’ so the tunnels under the station could be constructed for underground through traffic for local, international and high speed trains in any direction your travelers’ compass invites you to. For those who want to catch a plain at Brussels Airport, there you have 4 trains every hour that drop you just at the inside elevators to join the level of your choice. Remember that this station was built by the second King who colonised Congo and the Brussels’ bourgeoisie could enjoy the Sunday train to the Zoo next to the Antwerp Central station ~ I suggest you try to ‘read’ the architecturally translated history of that rather dark part of the history of this tiny country founded only in 1830, now hosting Antwerpen, one of the most important harbours, diamond, printing, finance or trading centres and foremost an outstanding capital of research and art in the world,

Also, it runs a very efficient operation of its trains or railway system.

Belgium,James P,Antwerpen-Centraal,1.0,"We love the high-speed trains we have taken in Europe--the Thalys from Amsterdam to Paris; its twin, the TGV between Paris & Milan (both ways) and Paris-Zurich (also both ways). These sleek trains glide over welded rails at up to 175 mph. Even the IC connection we took this time from Brussels to Bruges after an uneventful trip leaving Paris sped along at around 90 mph. But BEWARE: the trains in Belgium DO NOT RUN ON TIME, as they do in other countries. Our train leaving Brussels for Bruges was some 20 minutes late pulling into this Central station for our departure. And it only got worse--much worse--when we left Bruges four days later, with a connection in Antwerp to catch the high-speed Thalys to Amsterdam. We bought those tickets at the rail station in Bruges as soon as we arrived that Sunday afternoon; the cost was $174 US for two people, first class, for the two legs to Amsterdam. On Thursday, the IC train to Antwerp left Bruges on time, but slowed for apparent track repairs and pulled into its Antwerp station 20 minutes late. Our 30-minute break between trains had shrunk to 10 minutes. FAR WORSE, unknown to us until our arrival, the THALYS leaves from a different depot--the CENTRAL STATION--a 10-minute cab ride away. We caught a cab, raced toward there, raced down the two levels to the lowest underground tunnel, and had our feet just two steps from the closed doors of the Thalys when it pulled away. So back upstairs to the international ticket window (only 1 of 3 manned) and a long line in front of us. After about 20 minutes, we got to the window, explained the problem, and asked to exchange our tickets for the next Thalys at 2:30 p,m,, which we did have time to catch. BUT NO, WE WERE DENIED. We were told they could not be exchanged, we had to buy new tickets. And the cost was now higher at US $238 for ONLY THAT SECOND LEG of our original itinerary. We paid it, with no other choice, and arrived in Amsterdam without further trouble. But I doubt if we will ever travel by Belgian rail out of Belgian stations again. We agree with what the young man (a local) in line behind us said at that ticket window. He told us the Belgian railway system is the WORST IN EUROPE!!!

Belgium,Barbara L,Antwerpen-Centraal,4.0,"I am living in Holland but very close near the Belgium border. Antwerp is our town to go to for shopping, fancy restaurants or just a walk around the city. I still can remember the first time when I was a little girl when I entered the main station by train. It is an impressive buildling with a impressive central area. Most of the time at the square next to the station there are small (free) events for the kids. Around the corner the entrance of the Zoo starts. If you are in Antwerp, even with kids and not travelling by train, it is worth while visiting. The area around the station is known for it diamants. In many movies this area is used as a filmset. It just needs to be on your list when you go to the city as a tourist. From the station it is one straight line to the Meir, the know shopping street. After the Meir the shops ends and the nice restaurants and bars starts.

It is situated in the middle of the city center and busy all day long.
There are food stops and toilets, accessible for strollers and wheelchairs.
Easy to go to Brussels and Amsterdam or the Belgian cost. Several exits, the most populair is Astridplein (were the Zoo is), just one step away from China town and the jewish quarter (Diamond center of Antwerp/ the world).

Just outside you can find any type of cuisine, any culture...

If you are using this as a train station, not just a tourist visit, there are three levels of tracks. If you have to use the elevators to go down to the tracks on the lowest level, be careful how you choose or you will not wind up on the correct platform. The restroom costs 50 Cents (Euro-version). There is food and I can really recommend the waffles with chocolate sauce.

It is beauty and splendor on a grand scale! There will never be another building like it!

Interesting blend of the old with modern architecture and glass making it bright and airy especially on the upper level.
Clean, spacious, safe. Good information desk.
There’s a nice café (Le Royal) upstairs where you can admire all the ornate décor of a golden time while enjoying a local bite or drink.

Have a stroll through the station and take it all in!

On exiting though just be aware that bicycles share the same pavement as pedestrians so keep a very sharp eye out! I was almost run over by one as we exited the station on the taxi rank side. Eek!

It also contains a range of cafes, and an excellent restaurant, and a very helpful group of staff at the tourist information office in the same building. Beware, however of the new left luggage lockers. These take some getting used to, and require a lot of attention to ensure that the door is completely shut, thus completing the electrical circuit. During my last visit there was a lot of head scratching going on amongst visitors.
Finally the station is the hub of numerous public transport links and adjoins the city zoo which is a major attraction in its own right, and is a few metres from the major concert venue of the Eliszabethhaal . . .

Your first sight of it is as you approach from the train platforms, and you really want to watch your step because you are likely to be staring at the facade with such wonder that you won't notice where your feet are!

The main hall rises about eighty feet above the marble floor, with the intricate ceiling patterns and arches sitting on massive stone columns. Make sure you are not in a rush, as beauty such as this deserves a few minutes of staring before moving on.

After checking the prices of different types of fares for the tram we bought the 10 journey tickets as it was cheaper than buying 2 single journey tickets.

We got off the tram at Gravensteen and walked through the old town ending at Korenlei and Graslei. This entire stretch is so beautiful with lovely architecture, bridges, canals, churches and is also full of cafes, restaurants and various shops. Some of old buildings have the date of construction engraved on the facade. Most of the tourist attractions of Ghent are all in the city centre.

We also discovered in the Koren Market area lots of metal discs embedded on the street which were depicting the lifestyle and culture of the locals of yesteryears.

Unfortunately we had to leave Ghent before it got dark and we could not get to see the lit up town, specially Graslei & Korenlei, which I believe looks stunning at night.

Belgium,WayneLLC,Ghent City Center,5.0,"To start with, I regrettably did not try any of the infamous Belgian waffles while I am here...

Bruges (first, being the furthest) followed by Ghent (before proceeding to Brussels and back to Paris) were my destinations for a day-trip plan from Paris and they turned out lovelier than I have imagined. Do check out my Bruges review if you are doing similar planning. Do refer to my photos taken for a quick summary of the attractions and activities you can cover in a good 3-4 hours worth of exploration, all consolidated in this bite-size review.

Similar to Bruges, I love Ghent for its accessibility, walk-ability and actually found it strange that Ghent is not gathering as much love as Bruges or Brussels.

The crossover of eras, marked by the mixture of historical canals, medieval buildings covered by a well organised public transport system of trams really makes traveling in this city an experience of much romanticism.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Plot an itinerary: You may think this is a 'duh sort' of advice.. While the city is very walk-able and you can't exactly get lost here, the planning of your specific route can be essential for ones that are coming on a tight, half-day trip. It is very easy for you to miss out, with many attractions just around the corners or close-by.

Personally, I used google map to plot out my itinerary and loosely explore around. Definitely set an alarm like I did so you are conscious of the time - to get ready to move on especially if you are on a tight schedule.

2) Navigating: Generally, the mode of getting around in Ghent is by tram. Getting off at Gent-Sint-Pieters station, you would need to take the tram to Korenmarkt and start your adventure there in the center of Ghent.

You can grab a tram ticket from the machines but if you are staying for a few days, you may want to head to Lijnwinkels(kiosks) to grab the 1 or 3 days pass which cost € 7.5 or € 15 for unlimited bus/tram rides on their services. Tram within Koremarkt is especially accessible as it covers routes within the city center that brings you to various attractions readily.

On another important note, ask the locals for the Direction that you should be taking the tram. If you are unfamiliar with the tram system here, the map really was not of much help as I took the tram in the wrong direction and had quite a dilemma as i traveled all the way to the other end.

3) Gears: Dress comfortably, equipped with good walking shoes. Camera is also a no-brainer for this picturesque city.

4) Recommended to do: As with Bruges, try the waffles (while i personally did not have any waffle, I am pretty sure all the waffles here are good). Grab some Belgian chocolates and get on the canal cruise.

Belgium,Claude H,Ghent City Center,2.0,"The city including its center is gorgeous no doubt and we have been coming here probably >50 times.
The problem today is the mobility if you are a tourist or on business and have to take your car. I have EV which at least allows me to get into the city. Great but why are the few loading spots reserved for shared vehicles only? Secondly there is an ununderstandable system of one ways and restricted areas developed by some kind of genius that even the GPS cannot absorb. Count for at least 100 euro a day in fines ( I suspect this might be the city’s objective in the end). In the end we couldn’t get to the hotel, there was no parking space and when we finally got in and out of an astronomically expensive public lot (vrijdag markt) we ended up getting fines for driving in and out of the parking lot. There must be some local demonish mind acting here? Geraard den duivel maybe ?

It’s not a cheap city but nowhere near the Scandinavian countries. From the railway station get the tram to Korenmarkt and your on the edge of the medieval town.

We wandered for a while, clicking away with our cameras. This view here, that medieval building there. A castle. A guildhall. A view of the side of a square that could have been unchanged since the 1500s. And churches, churches, churches.

After a while, we started to look for a place to have a drink. No problem finding several of those. We settled on one, just before the rain came. Sat under an umbrella, sipped on our beers and watched the summer-time tourists scurry around.

The outskirts appeared to be like any other city & wasn’t much to speak about. However the centre was lovely. The buildings were beautiful & of the same style as Brugge. I will say it was very busy whilst we were there which is annoying as too many tourists just take away from the beauty.
We had a lovely coffee & waffle/pancake on the river, enjoying the autumn sun.
Probably won’t return to Ghent unless another family member wants to who hasn’t been.

Belgium,Don-c-Johnston,Ghent City Center,5.0,"I actually enjoyed getting a lot better than Bruges. The city center it’s not just one big square and nothing else around it, has a lot of different side streets with little shops and restaurants. There are a variety of cathedrals, museums, and shops to browse through and spend your day. I usually just go to market Square take some pictures walk around, grab a knickknack or two and leave. In Ghent I walked around for quite a few hours.
For my money if you’re going to go to Belgium, besides Brussels, make sure Ghent is on your list.",Nov 2019

Belgium,shelleylucky,Ghent City Center,5.0,"We were only going to spend a day in Ghent so we decided to go on a walking tour to give us a good overview and some insight into this beautiful city. We have used Viva tours before in Brussels and Bruges and found them really interesting. Thursday Oct 31st was a beautiful sunny day, albeit very cold! We did the morning tour with Katia and really enjoyed it. Right from the start Katia was welcoming, engaging and funny. Her knowledge of Ghent was extensive and she delivered the information in a way that kept one interested, partly because of the fascinating little historical stories she wove into it. She also gave great tips about unusual bars and cheap eating places. We were very glad we did this tour as we felt we had made very good use of our short time in Ghent. Well done Katia!!

Belgium,WanderAlex,Ghent City Center,5.0,"Had no intention of visiting Ghent , but had a few hours spare and decided to have a look as it was on the way to the airport . I was very pleasantly surprised. Ghent is often over shadowed by the likes of Brussels and Brugge . But it’s as history filled and photogenic as both of those cities , if not more .
I suggest getting off at Ghent Dampoort station, as it’s only 10 minute walk to the historic centre as opposed to the larger Ghent St Pieters station. Which requires another tram to get to the city .
There is plenty to see and also boat trips to be had .
Will happily go back for a proper visit soon .

There are many fine restaurants and bars all around the centre. I particularly enjoyed a bar outside the old meat market which had outdoor seating one side and a river view terrace through the bar.

You can buy the card at the Tourist information on Sint-Veerleplein 5, Ghent opposite the Gravensteen castle. The tourist info folk are super helpful and really passionate about their city.

I think if I didn't have the card, I'd have spent about €50 and I only took the tram once. More savings = more beer!

It also helps if your guide has a great sense of humour as ours did. We were there on a Sunday so not too much was open. There were a few market stalls, a chocolate shop (thank heavens) and quite a few cafes were open. So thankful for the chocolate shop. Couldn't imagine visiting anywhere in Belgium and not being able to purchase one of the things they are famous for....and it was soooo delicious!!!! Our tastebuds for having a party!

The altarpiece, the churches, the abbey, belfry and the 2 castles take no more than 2 days in total. Do take a boat ride through the canals for a different perspective and do purchase the 2 day Ghent pass so that you can just wander.

Ghent had beautiful architecture, which when lit up at night transforms it to something wonderful. It feels lived in and friendly. Prices are more reasonable and it’s not as crowded. I felt safe exploring.

An important trading and merchant city, the streets and squares are full of historic and characterful buildings, which we enjoyed exploring even though it poured with rain one day that we were there.

There is not just medieval architecture to see. The city has renaissance, baroque and 19th century architecture, with a little from the 20th century and, bang up to date its new Market Hall at its centre.

Belgium,Ben T,Ghent City Center,4.0,"The city centre are quite lively during the morning and it has a romantic atmosphere at night. Although the center is not nearby the train station, the tram outside the train station can take you to the center. Although, look both way before you cross the road, as I found the tram/ transport a bit chaotic. Also, the team ticket machines doesn't have English. So get your Google translate ready.

Furthermore, I like the iconic churches and historical buildings. It gives a gothic atmosphere at night. Plenty of pub around and you can never say no to Belgium beer.

Although this city are quite student focus, yet there are a lot of tourists around. At no point that I feel out of place.

Food is not a problem as long as you sit down before 9 pm. As most of the place doesn't serve food after that time.

Ultimately, this is a charming city and a place for a weekend trip.

We ended up taking the train to Ghent and spent the day leisurely exploring the city center. It was perfect. We walked through some of the usual tourist standards, but the highlight was really just wandering aimlessly through the market streets, squares, and surrounding neighborhoods. On the September day we visited, our wanderings intersected with a lunchtime concert, booksellers by the riverfront, a political speaker, and a few outdoor cafe rest-stops with great drinks & views of community squares.

Friendly people, great buzz, and easy to explore with or without an agenda. Well worth a day trip, and we'd happily return for some time in Ghent.

Belgium,BradJill,Ghent City Center,5.0,"We recently spent several days in Bruges making a day trip to nearby Ghent where we stayed much of the day sightseeing in the City Centre. To be honest, it is best to spend at least a couple days in Ghent to explore the city properly. However, if you have limited time, you can still make a nice day trip here from Bruges.

Train journeys from Bruges take approx. half an hour. Tickets can be easily purchased at the Bruges station using the ticketing machines. Purchase a return ticket so you can save yourself the trouble when ready to return from Ghent. Arriving at the Ghent Station, there is a convenient tram (line 1) linking the station to the city centre. Just exit at Korenmarkt and you are right in the heart of the city centre.

During daytrips to Ghent, you should be able to comfortable manage visits to St. Bavo where you see the famous Ghent Altarpiece, St. Nicholas and the Ghent Belfry (allow extra time if you want to climb) while being able to see other important and impressive buildings around the city centre, such as Stadhuis and the Royal Dutch Theatre.

You can walk over to St. Micheal's Bridge for outstanding views of beautiful rows of historical guid houses that line the canal at Graslei and Korenlei. From here you will also find great views back towards the city centre as well. A browse of Korenmarkt and visit to the medieval castle called Gravensteen are also worth the time if you have it to spare.

Allowing time for lunch, an afternoon coffee break and perhaps some souvenir shopping, the attractions will likely fill up a good portion of your day, especially if visited leisurely. You can then start thinking about your return journey to Bruges. Just return on tram line 1 back to the Ghent Staton and catch the next train going in the direction of Bruges. There are plenty so you won't likely have to wait long.

Belgium,sge31,Ghent City Center,5.0,If you're planning a trip to Bruge you would do well to extend your journey an additional 45 minutes (if you're driving) to Ghent. Just 90 minutes drive from the Port of Calais it's well worth a trip to. It feels slightly larger then Bruge and is just as photogenic. Many markets and squares and restaurants and bars here - just not many ATMs! We went to a bar that only took cash so had to find an ATM and there only appears to be one. I've never queued so long to get some cash! When the sun goes down the town comes to life in a different way and the bridges and castle/cathedral are lit up beautifully.

We didn't do much of the touristy stuff in the city and I loved the city much more at night. But it was also a rainy January day, so wet and busy can take a lot of charm out of any experience. So I am very happy we went back for the evening stroll. You should too!

Customer service non-existent, even though it is quite expensive to eat in. Cannot get over the fact that in some places you need to pay to use the toilet even as a customer :)
Even if it is a tourist attraction, quite a lot of restaurants do not have menus in English. Pedestrians seem to have fewer rights than bicycle users :)

Belgium,HunterBloemfontein,Ghent City Center,5.0,"... and take their recommendations for the conventional and alternative walking routes to follow through this consistently beautiful city. We had a choice to visit Brugge for a second time, or Ghent, and the choice we made, to explore Ghent, was well rewarded. To me, it is even more impressive than the admittedly beautiful Brugge. Walking through literally centuries of history, seeing facilities (like the medieval slaughterhouse), buildings (like the centuries old castle, that dates back to 1108) and beautiful canals and streets is a fascinating and worthwhile undertaking. On the way, enjoy some sweet treats ('noses' or Ghentse neuzen), or sit down on the canal bank with Warme (=Warm) William, and tell him your sorrows. You will not regret any of it.

Belgium,gerbid,Ghent City Center,4.0,"First off this is a student city, no question. You can nearly feel the learned energy and it's fantastic.

The city itself had a mix of really old buildings with really new or newer buildings.
It's very pretty and the river gives it a calm effect. Maybe because the trams and bikes are not down there.

Some of the attractions are payable and a little on the expensive side for us. €10 each to enter the castle. The cathedral is free and there is so much history in there your head will hurt.

The only downside are the trams and bikes. For a visitor they are a distraction in the city center especially when you are not used to them in your own country. The chances of being run over are pretty high.
Saying all that it well worth a visit especially the cathedral.

Mankind has been a biped for hundreds of thousands of years and walking is the most natural exercise possible that utilises ALL muscle groups. It is also free of mechanical equipment so no bikes to litter pavements, block doorways, endanger pedestrians. The politicians zeal to woo bikers in Gent and in Belgium has led to cyclists assuming pre-eminence among ALL road and footpath users - hand signals are almost NEVER given to drivers and pedestrians are expected to give right of way even on shopping streets. Lord help us when the young careless bikers of today start driving cars with the same lack of road safety sense that they display daily. Then try arriving at St Pieters train station in Gent - when you've finally found the signs you will have to walk about 800 meters down steep ramps to find the cars under as tunnel. Meanwhile the service vehicles of the utility nationalised companies park right outside the station where the taxis ought to be. In the rain, pulling suitcases on wheels the downward walk is hard but departing means hiking up the gradients. If you are less that fully mobile and fit GIVE GENT a MISS even though it is a beautiful medieval gem. If they don't make you welcome there are many other cities to enjoy!

We loved everything...the beautiful canals,a castle dating from 1100’s was a block from our door. We visited a couple gorgeous churches and were surrounded by beautiful architecture. The restaurants were vegan friendly & very good. Of course a great selection of beer, chocolates, French fries, waffles! We also loved the shopping opportunities we encountered from the morning market everyday in the square to eclectic shops all around the town. People were very friendly in general.

Belgium,dragonflyazul,Montagne de Bueren,5.0,"Montagne de Bueren is a 374-step staircase in Liège, Belgium. The staircase is named after Vincent de Bueren, who defended Liège against an attack by the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold in the 15th century. It was built in 1881 to honor the 600 soldiers who died in the battle.",Dec 2019
Belgium,Adrian F,Montagne de Bueren,4.0,"One of the must-sees for any visit to Liege, simply because of its uniqueness of 370+ steps in the middle of the city! Plus, you get a good workout while visiting it too (reasonable level of fitness is required, but nothing too strenuous or dangerous). At any rate, the stairs are fairly broad and not very steep, so you can always take a break in between.

At the top, you get a view of the city, which gets better if you climb up a bit further to a war monument which gives you a broader view of the city and river. Here, you'll also find the remains of a citadel with a hospital on top. Nothing too fancy so give yourself a maximum of 10 mins here.

A note about the nearby Coteaux de la Citadelle: it is basically a network of paths you can take that criss-crosses the hillsides among houses next to the stairs. I would recommend first ascending the Montagne de Bueren steps just for the thrill, then descend via one of these paths. I would particularly recommend the path called 'Terrasses des Minimes', which takes you across some gardens and ruins with some amazing uninterrupted views of the city along the way.

This stairway to heaven starts right in the historic centre and finishes higher than the top floors of the high risers standing next to the river. View-wise, it’s like slowing taking off in a helicopter. It is also a pleasing and satisfying physical effort, you literally feel Liège in your bones as you climb! Just respect that there are people living there, and that at least in theory, it’s a very quiet place, lots of green and nice gardens behind those quirky houses that almost win or lose a whole storey from one side to the other of their facades. Imagine what it must have been like bringing the bricks to build those!

We decided to go through the park and down the hill rather than climb down the stairs and came across a community farm in the center of Lèige! A lovely find too.
The next day we climbed up the 274 steps again, along with 1800 costume-decked marathon runners and enjoyed a beer at the bottom ""pour courage"" and a beer at the top ""pour célébrer"" a successful ascent.
The steps are a nice way to see Lèige, with or without the beer.

It's called la 'Montagne de Bueren' after a famous defender of the city in the 15th century. The staircase was later built - so the story goes - so that troops on duty in the citadel didn't have to yield to the temptations of Liege city centre's red light district (then on the other side of the mountain) and could walk directly to and from their barracks on the more salubrious side of town! There's an alternative way up, via a steep hill and shorter, and less steep staircase. You get great views across Liege from the top.

As far as 300+ steps go; the climbing was pretty easy, the stairs aren’t too wide or narrow, railings, they’re level with landings between each flight. The houses along the steps are adorable, each with its own quirks and style. A man who lived about halfway up was moving and had signs posted asking strangers to help him carry a few bags or a box down as they went, so many people helped him out. It was amazing to see that kind of kindness from strangers. I’d love to go back to visit soon.

Belgium,DSC-NOVA,Montagne de Bueren,3.0,"Montagne de Bueren is a steep staircase of 374 steps leading (roughly) from the flats of the river basin to the highest point in Liège. If you care at all about the history of the steps, they were built in 1875 and named after Vincent de Buren who led an uprising against the Duke of Burgundy around 1500. He lost, and so did about 600 men who died in the battle.

We found the steps were somewhat difficult to locate on foot even though it is only about a 15 minute walk from the Liège Opera House. Best bet it just to follow Rue Hors-Chateau and keep looking toward the high ground.

The steps are steep—the angle is 30%--but it is terraced with places to sit if you get tired. Depending on the time of the year, be sure to pack some water with you because it is likely you will get very thirsty before you reach the top.

A couple of things: (1) some folks use these steps for exercise so you may well find folks running past you as they race to the top; (2) although this isn’t a particularly scenic climb (you can always look behind you to the Meuse River for some inspiration) there are a few alcoves where you can spy some very nicely curated gardens; (3) there are few (none?) facilities along the path so come prepared; and (4) there is no direct path for the physically challenged. You can head to the top of the steps via an alternative means (bus or car) but these stairs are not for people with physical limitations.

At the top, of course, there are benches where you can pause and look back over the city and the river but be aware that some folks just take up semi-permanent residence on them and refuse to budge.

Some people find the view from the top intoxicating; I’m afraid we did not. Liège in itself isn’t a particularly scenic city and this part of it even less so. As a result what you get is a vista of a normal city from a higher vantage point. But it is abstractly interesting, the steps are fun way to spend an hour, you get a huge sense of accomplishment when you climb that last step and really, there isn’t a lot else to do in Liège for a tourist so go for it.

But once you get to the top, be sure to head toward Parc de la Citadelle and the war memorial within it. For reasons known best to the citizens of Liège, the Parc was chosen to host the city hospital and outbuildings. While functional, the busy building with all the traffic and pedestrians certainly disrupts both the monument to the dead and the green space.

Montagne de Bueren is 374-step stairway in Liège, Belgium. In 2013, Montagne de Bueren was ranked as No1 on The Huffington Post's list of Most Extreme Staircases.
Having completed the incline, the decline is to follow.

Belgium,Vincent_Cad,Montagne de Bueren,5.0,"This ""mountain"" is indeed a very impressive 374 big steps sterway. For sure, it's not for older or cardiac people.

But don't be afraid, it's worth the pain ! It's the N°1 must-do in Liège.
On the top, after being proud of yourself, you'll discover the best view of the town, and the War Mémorial next to the old citadel that defended Liège. (Now with a hospital in it).

For the good information, it is said that this stairway was built in the Middle Age by the chief ot the armies. With it, the soldiers could come quickly in town if needed, coming straight from the citadel.
But it is also said it was built so that the soldiers would have avoided the old main street, where many pubs and happy girls were attracting them.

Don't hesitate to ask the way to local people if needed.
And if you're there at the end of September : see if you're in the period of ""Coteaux"", which enlights the site, so beautiful.

If you have the possibility to have a look on the top in the night... You should try !

They were certainly more interested in setting up their drinks and smoking areas than sharing the best spaces to overlook the town. In the end and after 30 minutes of walking around up top waiting for them to leave we gave up and walked back down the hill. Perhaps if we had gone on a different day my opinion would've been different but the climb was spoilt by other people's selfishness.

When we finally got to step 374 and sat down to pant, another young stud came bounding to the top gasping for air. We were content just to get there!
If one is even reasonably fit and not otherwise unable, this is almost a must stop when in Liege.
And when you get to the top of the stairs don't stop just yet. There's more. Walk a few steps, turn right and head for the observation platforms and to the monument. There you are afforded a great view of the city and beyond. Also, at the top of the stairs to the monument you will find a really cool and peaceful park where you can stroll and enjoy at your leisure.

Belgium,501maciej,Montagne de Bueren,4.0,"Montagne de Bueren is a long flight of stairs leading from the town centre to the top of the plateau where city's Citadelle (fortress) is located. Some find the climb exhausting (my dad), some rather boring (my daughter) while for other it's a daring challenge (my 7 year-old son). However some locals use it as a jogging ground as well.
Nevertheless at the top (turn right at the end of the stairs and follow the street for 100 meters) everyone is amazed by the panorama reaching as far as Ardennes and clearly demonstrating picturesque location of Liege.
There is a monument commemorating local infantry regiment standing courageously at the defence of Liege in 1914 - spectacular and solemn, a good example of Belgian monumental style of first decades of the past century.
Next 200 meters from the monument (further right or downriver) there is a big steel balcony at the edge of the cliff. The steel plate itself is a map of the Liege's surroundings - you could stand on it, admire the panorama and compare the information from the steel map with the real view. Right below you can see one of Liege's particularities: a pasture with some sheep grazing in the middle of the city.
Tips:
1. Bring your drink and sandwich - it's a nice place for picnic but no food available at the top.
2. If you don't like the stairs you could even drive there - still I recommend the (not so) hard way.
3. Few other descent routes include a nice one through the wooden slopes to the
Saint-Leonard esplanade
4. Once a year stairs are decorated with hundred of candles to commemorate the past heroes - quite an experience to walk such illuminated stairs in the evening
5. If you are surprised there are actual houses on both sides of the stairs - explore the surroundings to find several other very narrow and atmospheric stair-backstreets, all with inhabited premises. That's how they colonized the plateau's slope centuries ago.
6. When you'll climb the stairs and go down same way go reward yourself at Brasserie Courtius, right at the steps of the stairs, look for big C sign.

Belgium,Fany,Atlantikwall Raversyde,3.0,"It was the first time I was visiting this museum. I had high expectations because of the reviews and what I have read about the museum. But... it was a deception.
To sum up: too much covid restrictions
Just from the starting of the tour you feel a lack of information, there are few information boards to understand the history and what you are seeing. What you see the most is the ""audioguide"" icons, but these are not available. I would say that in more than 4 months they had the time to offer a different system (obviously using your own earphones). Also, you can see several interaction panels that are removed. You feel all the time that you are only viewing a part of the museum.
But the worst part comes with the closed zones. Which does not make sense, as there other small zones which are permitted (the forum is counted). I attach some pictures. It's really frustrating to see all the places you cannot go.

A few more remarks:
- One of the guides inside the museum did not speak English. So we also missed this explanation.
- 90 min estimation is fairly low. We spent 2 hours and half was closed, so...

Still, I think the museum has a lot of potential and it can be a really really good museum. For example it would be great the the guides insides would be characterised.

I wish I could come back and see the 100% of what it can offer

Belgium,Alex S,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"I was recently on a motorcycle trip across wester Europe and decided to make a visit to the site which has both First World War and Second World War Atlantic Wall installations in-place.

It takes about two hours to work your way through the bunkers, gun in-placements and link tunnels. The site not only shows the extent which the Germans whet to defend the coast but also shows the way the that they went about their daily life manning the wall.

The interactive handset works well, it has one snag in that when your handset is telling you about the installation you are looking at, the person before you or after you may also be listening to their unit and it becomes hard to hear the commentary. The units don’t have headphones.

For me I’m glad I made the detour and spent the time visiting the museum.

The newly WW1 section has a lot less to play with, and while some touches are lovely (the horizon of shipwrecks expand in the audio guide), it feels a bit thin. If you wonder where items 15-19 on the WW2 battery are, they are in the tunnel from the WW1 battery, which they assume you will visit first. park well inland and walk round ANNO 1465 to get there.

The opening museum section showed great promise, but we were only given one audio guide per two paying adults - and my 6yo grabbed it so we missed out on loads of info while he tinkered with it. It didn’t want to repeat sections easily and wasn’t that intuitive to override. The various stop-off points were interesting but I felt we completely missed the broader context - what was happening in Europe that brought the Germans to that area? What was it like to be a German soldier working there? More personal interest stories would have been brilliant. I also couldn’t tell when we moved from WW1 to WW2 sections - and the rationale for different sections. As others have flagged, I found endless explanations about the calibre of the guns particularly eye-rolling. All in all a good half day, but I can’t help feeling we missed out on a lot.

Well maintained and fascinating; the direction arrows seem confusing, but if you just follow them it all works out perfectly. self-guided and you don't need the audio guide, although they are available if you want them.

You enter from the rear of the site away from the beach. If you've been to sites in Normandy, then you will know the sort of thing to expect, but this is still a pretty well preserved set of tunnels and bunkers and gun replacements with some guns to illustrate.

Lunch in the cafe is quite decent. Had an omelette washed down with very palatable local beer Jus de Mer. It is also close to the archaeological site which is definitely worth some time as the reconstruction is really quite well done and very atmospheric with the audio guide.

As we climb those steps, we realize the Germans and the capturing Canadian troops also climbed them. I am disabled but also a veteran. I couldn’t let my disability stop me. It took me a long time and my wife sent out a search party, but proudly my perseverance paid off. If you want even more rewards, google map it and look at the satellite image and check out the English Earthquake Bomb craters. I think you can use a cane, but there are only a few places where there are many steps and many places to sit down and recover. If this cripple can make it, I think many disabled people can do it.

And it is not just at the museum. If you take the tram from Ostend (get off at the Raversijde Domein stop), you will cross the road and go back east a bit to reach steep stairs that you will climb up and then climb down the other side. The view up there is great, though. At the bottom of the stairs, turn left and head down the paved lane.
But, if you can handle the activity required, I highly recommend it. You are treated to a view of the royal cottage just as when the king lived there. Later, there is a cottage set up the way a German officer had it. You see bunkers and gun emplacements, but also scenes set up in some buildings to show what they were like for the Germans who occupied them. There is a great free audio guide. When I went, there was a thought-provoking exhibit set up all over the Aachen battery called ""Un/settled"" about the current refugees in the world. Outside of the museum, there is a companion exhibit on the Belgians as refugees during the wars.

As a bit of a WW11 history buff I have visited many WW11 museums over the years and this one is high on my list of top museums.
The construction was interesting to note with it being different to other complexes visited in Normandy and the fact it is so complete. The array of original equipment was unbelievable too by the sheer volume and nicely arranged displays.
The audio tour is a fantastic addition to guide you through the history of the site.
I was a bit rushed due to time constraints and not expecting there to be so much to see and would suggest a minimum of 2 hrs to really explore the site at a leisurely pace.
Please note though with lots of steps and narrow tunnels this site is not suited to those in wheel chairs or with limited mobility.

Belgium,tizzysue,Atlantikwall Raversyde,4.0,"This is a great off-the-beaten-path attraction for history and military enthusiasts. The outdoor museum consists of trenches, bunkers and restored garrisons from the WWII era. A photographic history of the Atlantic Wall and some interesting artifacts was located in the museum's small building. The self-guided tour with our audio guides (included in the admission price) narrating the history of sites that were built into the hills and dunes of this coastal area. Although it was a misty and windy day, we spent almost three hours here.

There are several important notes to potential visitors: 1) The museum is somewhat difficult to find. It's accessible by taking the coastal tram to the Raversijde Domein Raversijde stop (note there are two stops named ""Raversijde"" - this is the second one), crossing the highway and following the walking path that begins with a climb up wooden steps. We didn't see any signs, but were able to find it by following the path in the direction of mounted artillery. 2) The museum visit requires a great deal of walking and climbing up/down steps. It is not suitable for those with mobility restrictions. 3) The site doesn't have a lot of amenities; only restrooms and limited selections of items at a small gift shop. 4) The WWI area (Aachen Batterie) is undergoing renovations and its reopening has been delayed several times. One of the guards stated that the new target date is July, 2018.

This was one of 15,000 sites between France and Denmark which made up the Atlantikwall a defence built by the Germans to stop the Allies making a landing. This one had been made into a museum as it was owned by the Crown Prince of Belgium. You got to go in the tunnels and see the armoury used. Also there were examples of implements used by Germans on the beaches to stop the Allies.

Kids under 12 were free and it was 8 euros for adults. There is also a lovely cafe on the site near the entrance / exit.

Belgium,Kevin B,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"The Atlantic Wall museum is an exceptionally well preserved part of Hitler's European coastal defences. When you see bunkers scattered around the UK you probably wish they were as well preserved as this. Part of the reason is that the German forces did not destroy the bunker system here - as they should have done - when they legged it from those pesky Canadians who were coming for them and liberating this part of Belgium. All they did was blow up the big guns and leave the structures intact.

As a result you can see the intricate layouts, dormitories, tunnels, medical bay and gun emplacements in place with models of personnel and genuine German militariia in place and in context. They must have the largest collection of Lugers and shell casings in the world; it's brilliant.

So, I took the boy for a bonding mid week Belgian sprint. He loved it, but then all boys probably would. He stood in the sentry box in the same position as a German soldier did when Rommel visited, ran through the tunnels, was in awe of the guns and even listened to the audio tour.

Allow two or three hours, which includes Prince Charles's rathermsweet and touching country house. Tack on another hour for a leisurely lunch in the nearby restaurant. Note that there are NO toilets in the bunker area but you can use the loo at reception. Make sure you do as it is a long walk back ...

You will definitely need the audio guide as there is so much to see and understand.

Access for wheelchairs and prams or strollers is nearly impossible as far as I can see, and people with limited mobility might have to miss some of the tunnels as they are quite low and there are many different levels here and there. If you don't like tight spaces there are many areas where you can poke your head out for a breather.

It is a MUST SEE for Canadians because the locals still completely love you. I spoke to one of the staff and he was all choked up. There is another museum nearby devoted to the Canadian forces called the For Freedom Museum ... I think.

A grand day out and thoroughly recommended if you are into military history. Curiously touching when you look out over the cold North Sea and imagine those soldiers waiting for the main invasion which never happened, apart from when the Allies appeared from the landward side. The hastily created, rather rubbish gun emplacement pointing inland speaks volumes about how utterly wrong Hitler was when he thought the allies were going to land here.

More and more of the bunkers will be opened up over the coming years, so it can only get better.

Belgium,Kev69,Atlantikwall Raversyde,4.0,"My friends and I had been meaning to visit this place for the last year or so but never got round to it. Also, the first time we passed by along the coast road, we saw the musem from the outside but couldn't work out where the entrance was. However, this time round we were making the museum a main focus for our day trip to Belgium and we weren't disappointed.
Once again we approached from the coast road, and when we parked up for a photo opportunity we saw signs on the external gates pointing out the route for the entrance - it was easy to find our way to the car park after that.
However, there are several other attractions adjacent to the car park so at first glance we weren't sure where the German fortifications were, but after a few minutes we found the route down towards the coastal fortifications - it's a five or ten minute walk from the car park depending on how fast you walk.
When we got the the ""wall"" we were faced with an old Belgian building which didn't seem to fit in with military fortifications but don't let this deter you - you can't actually see the fortifications and bunkers from behind the coast. Entrance was 8 Euros, and that includes a handset for the tour, which you conduct at your own pace.
We were a bit confused at first because the first ""points of interest"" in the compound were related to the Belgian Prince Charles you helped to preserve the bunkers after the war. You can go inside his old cottage which is very picturesque.
After a five minute walk we arrived at the bunkers. These are placed quite a few metres apart but linked by former walkways and/or new wooden walkways. You can go in most of the bunkers and the tour lasts about two hours - there is a fair bit of walking so you can't rush this tour, nor can you bypass anything unless you simply want to walk straight past it.
I'll let my photos do the talking from now opn but suffice to say it is an enjoyable and very well-preserved museum, and the bunkers are some of the best presevred that I've seen along the whole of the western coast.
One final thing - there wasn't much of a gift shop which was a shame because I'm sure I would have found something to spend my money on!
By the way, this isn't suitable for people with walking difficulties or wheelchairs.

You immediate notice some air (and harbor) defense using Flak Weapons, a torpedo sea-mine etc. there is road into the dunes which brings you from concrete shelter to the other. In most of the shelters there are mini-museums showing the weapons, or the communication systems, electric power engines etc. I have never seen so much and they even have an enigma in the comms-rooms. Anyway, you noticed I am enthusiastic, we spend 3 hours. It is quite a walk through the dunes so good weather (but not too hot) is advised.

The walk is quite easy, bumping your head agains the fortifications is the biggest risk, but walking through the dunes implicates it is up and down.

I was also using my smartphone as backup and between them we ended up on the carpal for an adjacent attraction called Raversyde 1465.

After another drive around it turns out that you have to park on that car park and walk to the Atlantikwall museum. Very poor effort on the signs I feel. PARK BY THE HUGE RADAR AND WALK THE REST OF THE WAY.

Belgium,VERONICAtho,Atlantikwall Raversyde,4.0,"Visited this museum as part of a classic car tour, and whilst the weather was wet, wouldn't have missed this for the world - fantastic representation and preservation of bunker life.

Previous comments covered most of the salient points but some additional views

Finding the museum is problematic - signage is poor - key word to look out for is Raversyde.

Restaurant and loos available near car parking area - tried the former and it was good for a light snack and still serving hot food late afternoon. Portions good and prices fine.

One can buy a combined ticket for the war museum and the medieval fishing village for a small additional sum, but it probably takes at least c2 hours to do just the bunkers so you would need sufficient time. The entry cost Is more than reasonable given the scale and quality of the museum.

The bunker museum is spread over a fairly large area - lots of walkways, narrow tunnels, steps - and if you are not a great walker or that mobile it may be problematic to get the best from it. The wooden planking could be slippery if very wet. Best to wear suitable shoes.

The hand held commentary devices included in the price are easy to use and are great - and it's worth listening to additional commentary they give you an option to access.

The montage exhibits are excellent - and make the museum come alive - with the most amazing detail of the different areas of the bunkers eg hospitals, living quarters, the commandant accommodation, command bunker, arms and rations stores - you could spend hours just looking at the superb authentic details and exhibits beautifully laid out.

That said why this museum does not get full marks from all four is us is because of the way the models have been defaced by bizarre blond wigs, dreadlocks and grotesque hair styles. As far as we could discern it is an attempt by an artist to get one thinking of the conflict in other countries and the effects on women. We felt this could be done in a far more appropriate way as one can only speculate how younger visitors would be affected by seeing some male models with ornate blond wigs. One wonders how they would construe these displays and recognise the modifications were not the norm - it detracts from a very serious subject. We all really disliked it!

This is a superb museum, where one hopes constructive feedback will get the hideous wigs removed.

Belgium,Phil C,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"Having spent 3 days in Bruges I decided I wanted to explore somewhere else, and hopped on the train to Ostend. There are lockers at Ostend train station where you can leave bags - I paid €4 for a medium locker for the day. I then purchased a day travel ticket for the bus, which you can get from inside the train station.

Either bus 68 or 69 from bay 10 will drop you off outside the entrance. These buses only run every hour, so check times in advance. The journey takes around 20 minutes - the stop you need is the one just after the airport.

The main attraction on the site is the Atlantic Wall museum, but there are two other sites you can visit, and a combined ticket doesn't cost much extra. The Atlantic Wall museum is amazing, especially on a good day as most of it is outside. I spent almost 3 hours looking around, reading all the signs and taking lots of photos.

You can't buy food or drink inside, but there is a coffee shop near the road where the bus drops you off. Staff didn't speak great English, but I managed to order a take-away sandwich for around 5 Euros.

Belgium,Sheed888,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"Just when you think you have gotten to grips with the scale of WWII there is something else to see and learn about, and this place is no exception.

Other costal defences have been preserved post attack but this place looks untouched and preserved as if it had been last used merely days ago.

The multilingual portable speaker you carry round is simply to use and full of everything a WWII buff wants to know about.

This place puts into perspective the entirety of the Atlantic Wall and the manpower it must have taken to create it.

Timescale to walk round this museum and take in the info on offer: 1-3 hours depending on your pace and the amount of people also present.

The path of the tour is indicated properly and the audio guide is a very nice plus (it's included in the very reasonable price). It's all very well preserved and kept clean as good as possible in my honest opinion. Too bad some of the visitors are too lazy to take their trash with them.
There was a slideshow of a photographer who took very nice pics of bunkers, he is very talented.
The staff on the site are very friendly and helpful aswell.
You can get there very easily by tram, there is a stop called ""Domein Raversijde"" and if you come by car there is also a parkinglot.
To make a long story short: it's a must see and very educative.

Belgium,Kristen H,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"We recently visited the Atlantic Wall. We were staying in Bruges and took a train into Ostend. We purchased a day pass from the manned Ostend transportation booth at the train station. You can take bus 68 or 69 out to the museum. Taking the bus gives you front door service to the museum area, and finding the museum was not confusing using the bus route. The bus stop is right after the airport entrance. Push the stop button, and the bus driver will drop you off in front of the museum.
There are several museums and a nature trail at this sight. We bought the combination ticket and visited the recreated Medieval fishing village along with the Atlantic Wall. It was very reasonably priced at 10 Euros.
After visiting the two museums we visited the restaurant on site called Walrave. It was delicious! It was mussel season, and we ate very fresh mussels there.
At the end, we walked to the west from the Atlantic Wall and took the steps over the dune to get to the tram. By buying the day pass we were able to ride the bus more inland and the tram along the North Sea.
This was an amazing place to visit. Riding both the bus and the tram allowed us to see more of Ostend. The history of this location in Belgium was amazing. By visiting the two museums we had learned about Belgium medieval fishing life, and the many foreign countries that had used the site for their military actions in the area.
Going to the Atlantic Wall was a great day trip. There is so much to do in the area (our ticket included two more museums we didn't get a chance to visit). There is also a nature walk area as well. We only did the part between the medieval fishing village and the Atlantic Wall. We saw local birds and wild flowers on the walk.
I highly recommend this as a part of your trip to Ostend, Belgium.

They will give you a hand held device in your language and you follow a path through the dunes to look at the original German Bunkers and artillery emplacements.

It gives a clear reproduction as part of the Atlantic that was set up by the Nazis to defend the European coastline.
It is my view of inestimable historical value.
On the site is located a number of other museum sites that can all be visited ( mediaval tribe village of fishermen, the house of Prince regent Karel) with a combination ticket which is valid throughout the season. So you can easely visit quietly at several times the different sites.

This site is well maintained, with the bunkers and dugouts fitted out as they would have been when in use. Not all of the guns are still there, but some emplacements do have cannon.

It was perfect, overcast and wind blustery weather that set the mood for this place. Bring good walking shoes because it is a long walk. As an ex-military person, this place set my heart a-flutter with the well preserved artillery pieces and abundance of multilingual and informative signage. There was an art exhibition when i visited that was set deep into lone bunkers which gave it a somewhat creepy feel. Anyone with a morose, teenage Goth daughter would do well to drag her here.

We usually skip audio tours, but this one was very helpful and not overly verbose. Be sure to leave enough time to see everything. I would suggest going in the morning vs. afternoon. We were told we had “plenty of time to see everything” when handed our audio guide, and then ten minutes later an employee told us the WWI section was closing (3:30) and we should move on to see the other exhibits since there would not be enough time. He then followed us around from one exhibit to another until we gave him the slip. Besides being rushed through, we enjoyed a few hours stepping back in time.

Historic sight with big and small guns. We followed the yellow path, but really they all run in together. If you are limited on time or ability to walk the entire path, the big guns and better sections of displays are at the middle and at the end. Ask which way to go when you get your ticket punched.

Belgium,Graeme M,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"This really is quite an amazing place. You can see gun emplacements and trenches from WWI that were subsequently modified and added to as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall during WWII and finally hastily modified after D-Day.

It is astoundingly intact as a set of fortifications. This is then added to by the excellent full-scale diorama scenes in many of the bunkers.

The audio guide is great and a bargain at 5 Euro entry and 2.5 Euro extra for the audio guide.

There is a clearly marked path to follow and, with the audio guide, it takes a couple of hours to get around. You get to go inside most of the bunkers and tunnels, with the exception of those that are unsafe or inhabited by bats. It is a surprisingly extensive complex.

Belgium,Catmar192,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"This place is tough to find but my goodness what a piece of history!
This series of tunnels, rooms and walkways is well preserved and very well organised.

You enter through some gates and pay in a portacabin (where the only toilets are located), its really reasonably priced at around 30 euros for a group of 4 adults and 2 kids. From here there are a seemingly endless series of steps, tunnels and small rooms to explore via a clearly marked trail.

Health and Safety rules in Belgium are not as strict as England, there is real Barbed Wired around the site and some low rails at sharp drops, so if you take children be wary of allowing them to wander alone.

There was a rather strange series of ""srt"" exhibits on display around the site when we went (August 2015), i can only imagine that it adds some funding to the site. There are no warnings before you enter some rooms where there are very explicit images of genitalia, and another room where a video of a nudist beach is on display. I can't fathom how this is relevant or appropriate in a war monument/museum...but there they were!

This site took us 4 hours to look around, the kids had a fab time exploring the tunnels and were not bored at all..

Belgium,Catherine B,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"Our eldest is 12 and a WW2 enthusiast. A couple of days earlier we had visited the Kazerne Domein in Mechelen, which chronicles the fate of the Jews in Belgium. That was a sobering but wonderful afternoon in another fantastic museum. This, however, was more his thing and he absolutely loved it- tunnels, machinery, bunkers - we got a real sense of the mechanics of war: the plotting, the strategy and the conditions. Our other son, however, needed to go to the toilet half way through. This was a bit of hassle and he wandered back to the entrance and waited there for us (the only down side to be honest).

We opted for the audio guides. As it was very cheap to get in we didn't mind paying an extra €2.50 each. They make for an all-the-more engaging and meaningful experience.

I got the feeling that this museum is a work in progress and that, in time, it will be further developed. This did not at all hinder our visit. A very enjoyable and educational afternoon, all topped off by a stop off at the cafe on the way out. It couldn't have been better. Highly recommended!

Very informative & well presented. It is large and spread out. Not suitable for the disabled and involves alot of walking, some of it through tunnels/galleries.
It was clean, well lit & signposted in the passage ways & bunkers. Some good depictions of life both in WW1 & WW2 with dummies, uniforms & weapons.

Belgium,George H,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"The Atlantic Wall museum/exhibit is a MUST if you're in the area. It's a well designed and well maintained attraction that provides a stark reminder of our violent not-too-distant history. You can spend at least half a day here(maybe a full day) and it's quite good value too. There's a lot of walking and on the wall itself you'll be quite exposed, so I'd recommend you choose a day that's not too hot or windy (I survived the walk). Look out for the giant radar dish from the road to find the entrance, or if you're arriving via the coastal tram you need to go inland up the steps and over the sand dunes. Best to check it out on the internet first.

Go a couple of miles past where GPS takes you and look to the right (banners will be about a quarter mile back off the main road). It is behind another open air museum (can't remember the name but it looked like an old farm) and a restaurant. The site is one of the best preserved pieces of history we have ever seen; it definitely has that ""Longest Day"" feeling to it. The site is very worthwhile and an easy day trip from Bruges.",Jun 2015
Belgium,mrbnottm,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"We really enjoyed our visit to this unusual and well preserved attraction that evokes memories of both World War 1 and World War 2. It was part of a great day out and I would have to say that it was the star attraction of our week in Belgium. Arriving in Ostend by train from Bruges (where we were staying) we were able to conveniently purchase in the tram station at Ostend a family combined ticket, covering the return tram journey from Ostend to Raversijde, a few kilometres along the coast west of Ostend, where this preserved part of the Atlantic Wall is located. Our ticket also entitled us to visit it,and we spent about two and a half hours there, learning all about it with the aid of audio guides, because it really does take that long to explore it properly. The rest of the day was also very pleasant, with a nice lunch in the nearby cafeteria, a walk through the nature reserve behind the wall (where we saw and heard many frogs !) and a visit to an attraction consisting of modern reconstructions of houses that formed a typical 1465 fishing village there, which again featured audio guides (with actors voicing the residents of the 1465 village). Admission to this was also included in the price of our ticket. Before going back on the tram to Ostend we had an energetic walk along the big beach at Raversijde to end a perfect day.

Was worth the drive out thoroughly enjoyed it and seeing some of the past in a preserved environment with the artillery pieces still in the same place and a very hot day was well worth the trip.Cost was only €5 for an adult.The only downside was as we walked into a bunker there was a film showing on a TV of naked women and men cavorting on a beach which had nothing to with the Atlantic wall Iam no prude but I wouldn't want my young children seeing it.

Belgium,MandCF,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"Make sure you find this place - it is not easy. We knew nothing about it but saw it as we drove past to Ostend - it goes on for a fair way so was obvious. We went back the next day and persisted until we found the entrance round the back. However, it is the most comprehensive picture of the German Atlantic wall defences - first world war and second world war that I could imagine. A 2 hour walk through tunnels, gun emplacements, fantastic displays with great views over the Atlantic. This has been put together really well including English translations throughout. The entry price is very reasonable.
The only problem is there is no half way stage way out so you have to see it all. Worthwhile as it was to see it all - not least because it got better and better, it would be helpful to have a way out option half way round and a toilet half way round. If you haven't got 2 hours then ask at reception what you might do - one of the staff rescued us towards the end and took us a short cut way out. It is a fairly straightforward walk round despite regular steps if you can walk ok. A very good cafe nearby.

Even if you haven't been to other sites such as Normandy you will find this interesting.

There's a fair amount of walking, climbing, ducking involved… So keep that in mind. Total visit time can vary on your interest, I took approx. 2 hours.

You will need ALL day and a nice pair of comfy walking shoes to trek this amazing place. The compound takes 2 hours to circumnavigate at speed. There are several bunkers and cannons, guns and fortifications left by German forces to ponder and admire. Signs are well posted and in multiple languages.

You get up close to the weapons, you walk in the trenches and tunnels. You see the barracks, that sort of thing. We got the audio guides which were pretty informative. Be prepared to walk, a lot. Up stairs, down stairs, in tunnels. You definitely get your work out. We also went on a day that had rain off and on and there isn't much you can do about it when standing outside but we made do.

What a fascinating place this is. Remarkable number of tunnels, gun batteries and some guns (and quite big at that!) still remaining in-situ. Brought to life by little cameos of life for the German forces.
It was extremely easy to find, despite what others have reported. Take the tram from Ostend, get off at Domein Raverside, cross the tracks and the road, walk up the steps set in the sand dunes, turn left at the end of the steps/walkway, walk about 300m and you're there. A plus of using the tram is that this gives you a discount on the entry price.
Only downside is that the café is adjacent to the car park so we didn't go there. There are toilets in the reception where you pay.
Make sure you allow plenty of time to take it all in, listen to the audio guide and take photos. We spent around two hours.
No wheelchair access, which is understandable when you see the tunnels, steps etc. We saw a family with a toddler and a baby in a buggy but they struggled to get round and I wasn't sure why they'd taken such young children to this museum.

Belgium,Brian P,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"The Museum can be reached by road or the Coast Tram, when buying your ticket ask the booking clerk where to get off. When you get off the tram cross the road and go up the steps walk across and down the other side, at the bottom turn left and walk along the road you will come to the museum on the left. There are three museums in this area and two of them are on the same site the War Museum and Prince Charles Monument which is in his original house.

The Atlantic Wall on which the museum stand is the only part of the wall still maintained, it was restored on the instructions of Prince Charles. There are many well preserved trenches and other buildings including look-outs and gun emplacements. You need to allow about 3 hours to do the whole site and to see all.

Then across from the museum is the old fishing village some 200 meters walk, follow the path through the car park and you will come to a cafeteria, walk through the cafeteria and you will see the buildings in front of you.

The cost for all three of these museums is just over 9 euro's, if you are doing other attractions in Ostend its cheaper to buy an Ostend Pass 12 Euros for 0ne day 15 Euros for 2 Days it is a good saving as it gives entry to all museums and is available from Tourist Information opposite the Casino.

Belgium,lazy_1970,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"An excellent outdoor museum to recap your WW history of western europe- worth a full day. Which is the reason that this museum complex issues a combo ticket which is valid for more than a day!
Many have written about the museum- I completely agree with them and so would not spend much words. Rather, I would tell how to reach!
We reached Ostend railway station and headed for the tram stand. The enquiry counter sells a combo (transport to and fro plus all 3 museums) which drastically reduces the cost. She told us to get down at 'Domain Riverside' (my anglicised name- might be incorrect), NOT at 'Riverside'. But didn't tell us the next steps. We kept loitering and looking for the entrance even though we could see those huge guns! Even google maps could not help.
So, here they are for you:
Cross the road and take the stairways next to the Raversjide (Riverside) arrow. This will lead you to a smaller road behind this hillock (so you cant see the ""sea"" anymore. Walk left for 300m and you reach the entrance on your left.

Belgium,Ancutz,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"Such a sight to see! Anti-aerial batteries, bunkers, so many tunnels... And so well preserved, thanks to them buing built on private property. You really get a feeling of what this Atlantic Wall was meant to be and do, of how the Nazis were contemplating defending the beaches. You also get the story of how useless it was.. You don't get to see this in Normandy... Went there with friends visiting me and what a great and inspired way to spend some hours, an interesting outdoor activity.

The Museum is right beside the beach, it is lovely. From the road below you can see the cannons coming out of the bunkers, directed towards Oostend harbour. Unbelievable that it should not be better known..

We drove there, it is not that well signposted. The domain is signposted, rather than the Atlantic Wall as such and we almost missed the entrance. We had no trouble in parking, as there are spaces available and it is not a mass tourist attraction. We did not have time to do both tours - WWI battery and WWII battery, we decided to stick to the latter and saw it at a leisurely pace, listening to the audioguide included in the entry fee, reading the information, watching the displays (recreation of how life was inside the bunkers), walking around. It gave a feeling of a quite an easy life for those in charge of this particular bit of the Atlantic Wall. But what a massive effort to build it.

The Atlantic Wall Museum shows the preserved batteries from WWII. Our kids LOVED running through all the tunnels and pretending to be in the action. Lots of walking both inside the tunnels and outside. Wonderful views of the coast as well.
Our only complaint was the disorganized ticketing process. We purchased our tickets at the Medieval fishing museum (attached), but then had to wait in an EXTREMELY long line to get the audio guide for the Atlantic Wall. They did not separate the people who already had tickets from those purchasing new tickets. The gentleman working the ticket booth was extremely helpful, but spent FAR TOO LONG chatting with each individual customer. After waiting over half an hour, 2 out of the 3 audio guides we had for our party broke down less than halfway through the museum! I do recommend getting the audio, as the information included was extremely interesting. I just wish they had worked. We would recommend the museum add a few signs near the entrance explaining how everything works, so the ticket agent could process guests more swiftly, instead of repeating everything over and over (in multiple languages - quite impressive!).
Despite the early frustration, we loved our visit and had a fabulous day. We highly recommend this museum.

This segment of it in the open-air museum is very interesting, with a number of different routes of duration up to 2 hours available to follow. The audioguide is a great accompaniment with much historical context.

The enterprise involved in establishing and maintaining the fortifications is plain to see. The pathways of the museum traverse all the important aspects, illustrating amongst others the military & armaments, vital communications and life for the soldiers manning the posts.

Go up these step and down the other side you will see a mobile home park in front of you turn left and follow the road and then you will come to the entrance.

Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours to cover the site properly using the Audio Guide. it is quite an eye opener on what Hitler was up to.

Best to get an Ostend Pass as it allows you into all the museums and exhibitions free 12 Euros for one day 15 for two saves a lot of money, obtainable from Tourist Information near the casino.

Belgium,Ken S,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"We spent a couple of very enjoyable hours exploring the First and Second World War fortifications at the Atlantic Wall Museum.

It cost just EUR 6.50 per person to enter and the price includes an audio tour - just key in the three-digit number at each location and you are provided with an explanation of what's around you. There are even additional numbers that you can enter for in-depth information.

The fortifications are very well preserved, especially the WWII ones. However, some of the WWI fortifications were demolished to make way for the WWII ones. The fortifications are brought to life with weaponry, furniture, uniforms and other artefacts from the time. All very interesting.

The tour takes some two hours. It is not suitable for the less able - one of the guides told us that there were 400+ steps along the 1.4 mile route. And make sure you have a wee before you enter - there are no toilets on route!

We had a great time. If you like recent military history, this museum is a must see!

The audio guide is very helpful with a lot of details without being overwhelming.

I spent 2,5 hours and felt that it was time well invested.
And you also have access to other attractions like the Village 1465 and the Royal house.

The only criticism is the lack of information once you leave the tram. You need to cross the road and find the passage in the dunes. You should cross the dunes and then walk to your left (towards Oostende). After 5 minutes you will see the entry to the museum, but you can always ask to some passerby since this area seems to be popular among bikers and walkers.

Belgium,brightsideoflife2014,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"I am a 'war fan' (WW1, WW2, battle of Waterloo...)
I went to Normandy beaches to visit the beaches where it all took place. I visited the bunkers and a couple of museums.
Consequently, I decided to visit our own Atlantic wall. I convinced my spouse and my 13 year old boy to accompany me. They didn't regret it.
Indeed, it's not for free just like in most of Normandy sites, but this Raversijde site is in perfect condition since no battle occured there. Secondly, you have an audio guide which always makes your visit more enjoyable and more instructive. In addition, there are boards which give other explainations. Finally, you have around 15 rooms with plenty of artefacts and manequins which recreate the atmosphere of that period.
We have spent there 2 hours and a half.
My reflection coming out was that I prefer to pay which alowed me an instructive and enjoayable moment. So, I had a great time and my wife had a good time. My kid had also some good moments. I must say, he is not easy to satisfy.
I recommend to come at the opening (10:30 am) because it gives you the possibility to have lunch wherever you want and to come back to have a Middle Ages experience by visiting the 1465 'village'. It's actually 4 differents types of old houses where they used to be constructed with the real bricks found under the ground. Nice visit for the whole family. Afterwards, you have an interative museum about the Middle Ages and all the artefacts found on this site.
It was about a one hour and a half visit and it was 5:30pm already. I Must say that we had spend 2 hours in a nearby restaurant.
We wanted to have a look at the prince Charles' house but it was already closing time. The man at the entrance told me that it would take around one hour and 20 minutes to visit the 2 buildings. So, I will have to come back. It's not so bad for me because I'm living one hour away and the ticket is still valid in the future but if you come from abroad, you better manage your time to visit these houses that day because this visit is included in the combined ticket = 9,75€ (adults; 8,10€ > 12 y and for free <12) for the 3 museums.
I would recommend to have a snack at lunch time to be able to see everything and to go to the restaurant when the museum is closed.
If you are coming from the center of Belgium or if you have to return in that direction afterwards, I would suggest to avoid week ends because you will hit traffic on both ways if the wether is nice.
Attention, I haven't seen a nearby toilet during the Atlantic wall visit. So I advise to pay attention to this important aspect before starting your visit.

Belgium,David C,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"Although I am English I travel to Nieuwpoort on a fairly regular basis and every time I pass by on the Tram I always vow to get off at Domein Raversige (you must press the bell for the tram to stop as it is not an automatic stopping stage). This month I made it.
Travelling from the Ostende direction you alight from the tram and turn to your left, cross the road and in front of you will see the steps that lead up to the top of the dunes, follow along the Wooden walkway down onto the roadside (warning:- watch out for cyclists) and bear Left. You will shortly come across the Museum entrance which is situated on your Left. We did the ""short walk"" which takes around 1 and a half hours and costs €6.50, you are provided with a personal ""Talking Book"" handset which tells you the history of the feature you are viewing (once you have put the appertaining numbers in which are denoted on the various ""Marker Boards"" which are dotted around the site).
It was fascinating to learn that these emplacements were initially built during WW1 rather than WW11 as I thought. Apparently the ""Atlantic Wall"" stretches from the Spanish border to Scandinavia (around 1,670 miles).
This Museum is part of our Worlds Heritage and it hard to believe that places like Oostende and Nieuwpoort were occupied and had their freedom taken from them for so long, it must have been terrible that ""A Careless Or Loose Word"" could have ended in internment or worse.
Great value for money!!

It is an absolutely fantastic, fascinating museum that shows aspects of the war from ""the other side"". With original and replica displays, it feels in places as if the Germans had just ducked out to the pub for lunch and would be back at any moment.

This is quite outside Ostend itself though : take the tram , which will take you swiftly to the outskirts of the city. Beside the museum, you can also enjoy the surrounding park Walrave as well as the well preserved dunes. Nearby you will find a nice tearoom / restaurant Walrave or you can take a walk to Raversyde where there are several cafés and restaurants. Still not tired? Then follow the seafront promenade or take the path through the dunes which will take you to the little church in Mariakerke OLV- ter-Duinen ( Our Virgin Mary of the Dunes).

Its fascinating how the Germans could build such a defense wall in such a short time.

Belgium,ScepticTone,Atlantikwall Raversyde,4.0,"We'd decided to take a P&O minicruise to Brugge for our biannual tobacco-run (prices in Belgium approximately 1/3 of the UK price, btw) and, as we'd done this enjoyable trip more than once and 'done Brugge', my wife & I decided to visit Oostende & the Atlantic Wall Museum for the day this time, having thoroughly researched it on the net. To my shame, I hadn't heard of it before, or more likely, had forgotten about it due to my advanced years.

The 2 night P&O minicruise from Hull-Zeebrugge also includes a 20 minute return coach transfer to Brugge which conveniently drops you off outside a cafe in a soulless suburban area, yet which is only some 100 metres from Brugge Centraal rail station.

The Belgian rail system is top-notch: all electric, fast, cheap, modern, clean & efficient, unlike another rail system I could mention, and you know which I mean.

So, we bought two day return tickets to Oostende for the princely sum of €8.00 each from the (English-speaking) booking office, The Oostende train runs every 20 minutes & the journey takes 13 minutes. Here's a tip: in Oostende there's a distinct lack of cash machines, but several in Brugge station, so if you're short of cash, don't waste an hour tramping about in Oostende like we did, but cash up at the station.

We'd checked the weather forecast & noted that it was set fair for Belgium that day. In the event, it was 30C! Thus the very long train was PACKED with Friday trippers off to Oostende, which we hadn't factored into our trip equation. Standing room only, so it was merciful that the journey only takes 13 minutes frankly.

Conveniently & logically, the train stops in Oostende some 100 metres from the tram terminal, but we wandered off fruitlessly in search of an ATM along the seafront. Oostende is a BIG town, btw & was swarming with fun-loving Belgians with beach gear, all heading off to the seaside & the seafront restaurants, but at least we got to see & sample the excellent seafood stalls (the equivalent of our pitiful seaside cockle/whelk stalls, but on steroids, and offering beautiful & cheap cardboard plates of giant mixed seafood takeaways at about €4.00).

Anyway, you stroll to the tram terminal, buy a €5.00 day-rambler tram ticket & board the Kusttram (conveniently labelled ""Kusttram"" in big letters on the front of the train at the terminal).

You have to validate your tickets by sticking them into a machine which date/time-stamps them. You only have to do this once

But (TIP) they only work when the driver/security guard turns them on, after the tram's set off, so don't look like a foreign dork like we did, trying to stick them in immediately on boarding at the terminus only to be advised of the above fact by a kindly Belgian lady sitting nearby.

You can use this ticket all day, hopping on & off any Oostende tram at will, but it only needs activating once. The Kusttrams operate about evry 10/15 minutes in season.

The Kusttram runs up & down the Kust (do I need to translate this? Even we got it first time & we're not too bright), & very fast & interesting it is too, as the beautiful sandy beaches of Oostende stretch for mile upon mile & are very attractive, if you like beaches, unlike, I must add, the suburbs of the city, which consist mainly of medium-rise blocks of concrete flats.

You know which stop to alight at for the Atlantic Wall Museum, having checked this on the Kusttram website. I forget the name of it. It was in Flemish. And was long.

Having alighted, you now face the challenge of crossing to the entrance to the site, what is possibly the most dangerous road in Europe for pedestrians, the kust road: a dual carriageway with a simple zebra crossing & lots of cars driving at Belgian speeds, driven by Belgian drivers. Enough said. Take care.

There follows a long tramp up the coastal hill on wooden steps then a half kilometer tramp along a (that day, HOT) dusty road to the site entrance.

I can't elaborate much on what has already been detailed about the actual content of the Atlantic Wall site by other excellent reviewers, apart from emphasising that it'll take you about 2 hours to tramp round it, there's no way of shortening it as you're guided by your remote-control-like audio guide & it's pretty much a one-way trip with no obvious escape route, so take some food & water & there are no toilets en route.

The trenches and bunkers and searchlights & giant guns are fascinating & you lose all sense of direction weaving your way in and out of them via the dunes, trenches & tunnels, but now & again you emerge from a brick tunnel to find an Oerlikon or Bofors gun or giant 175mm cannon (decommissioned, sadly, & no ammo) which you can mount & play with if you want & take silly snaps, so long as nobody else is watching, obviously (TIP).

I wrote this review from the perspective of a day-tripper to Oostende as an alternative to doing a full-on Bruges jaunt on the P&O minicruise. Prices quoted correct as @ August 2013.

This was a really interesting afternoon and having visited a lot of museums relating to both wars this holiday it was fascinating to do something that gave the perspective from the German side of the war.

Great value for money, fantastic views of the sea and beach and we got plenty of exercise! Make sure you wear comfortable footwear as you will be on your feet for a long time.

A must see if you are in the area!

Stop off at the cafe for a nice cold Belgium beer on your way out. They also offer a simple menu of meals such as lasagne, lighter options like omelettes and lots of lovely desserts including Belgian waffles.

Belgium,SteveBeat1961,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"A fascinating labyrinth of WW1 and WW2 German fortification, The Atlantic Wall designation refers to the later of these two conflicts and was intended to stop the Allied D-Day invasion on the beaches. As it turned out the Allies landed at Normandy and this section of the 'wall' didn't see action and was captured by Canadian forces when Ostend was liberated.

The museum tour is a series of bunkers and outposts linked together by trenches and tunnels and it's quite a long walk, especially on a hot day (so take some bottled water). These posts might be a gun site or crew accommodation or support buildings and many include superb recreations of the posts as they might have been when in use by the Germans.

There is a informative audio tour, but do make sure your unit is properly charged before you leave the reception. It was a busy day when we went and I was given a partially charge unit which died halfway round - luckily I could earwig on my wife's audio

As I mentioned, there are plenty of period weaponry and equipment in situ, as a gun emplacement battery there is plenty of artillery pieces for you to examine - ranging for light antiaircraft guns to whopping great guns intended to defend against Allied shipping. There are also quite a few very nicely done tableau showing German personnel at their posts, complete with a large amount of authentic equipment. I was surprised at just how much wartime kit that the museum had on display.

As well as being quite a long trail some of the tunnel entrances are quite low, at 6' 3"" I struggled from time to time to get through without bumping my head! Some might also find some of the tunnels a little claustrophobic.

Altogether the complex is very impressive and while it did not see actual service during D-Day it was important enough to receive a visit from Field Marshal Rommel himself, and there is a display which documents the inspection carried out by this famous German general.

One small criticism I would make is that there are no toilet facilities half way round the tour - which can take you about 2 hours to go around - so make sure you go at the reception building before you undertake the tour. I am also sure that the tour is not mobility accessible (and this applies to those that might have young children in prams).

Finally, I should mention that the Atlantic Wall Museum is actually part of a group of attractions adjacent to one another. There is also a Raversyde Anno 1465 - a recreation of a medieval fishing village - and the Natuurpark nature walk. So you can make a whole day of it if you want.

As usual in Belgium there is a well stocked Cafe nearby - through the nature walk - which serves everything from ice creams to large pots of mussels. And, of course, a wide range of beers!

Getting to the attractions is quite easy as there is a tram stop on the beach promenade right outside the pedestrian pathway to the park. In theory - if you are fit enough - you could actually walk from Ostend along the beautiful foreshore, but honestly the tram is simple enough to use and it runs very frequently from the centre of town.

The admission price includes audio in several languages at lots of points along the route giving in depth knowledge and background info of what you can see, went on here etc. A mass of tunnels, trenches, memorabilia, guns and history.
Hints, park on the sea front and walk over the track to the left hand side of the guns! Wear comfy shoes! Take water! Leave plenty of time as you can also go into the royal house on the same plot (lasts about 20 mins depending on how much you listen to), the museum and another location which we didn't have time to complete.

The combination of the displays and the fact that the visit involves a lot of walking (or running) around in former trenches, bunkers and along underground paths made this a fun outing for him and for us. He asked a lot of questions related to everything he has learned in school about WW2 as well as to the stories of his grandparents (who were children in WW2). The audioguide and the displays made it easier for us to explain. As for myself - when I was a child, I used to visit my grandmother at the belgian coast. I used to play in the dunes in bunkers without ever knowing their complete history. I am now finally well informed. Excellent and fun museum.

I appreciate the time they took with the audio tours and the price was very low. this is the real deal, so be ready to walk, climb, duck, and get a little dirty as you go through the displays. I thought I knew a lot about coastal forts, but was frankly amazed at the engineering, tunnels, and politics involved in this fort.

Belgium,Dion M,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"I came here with a colleague from work as we are both interested in military history. This museum covers both WWI and WWII. The German army used the site in both world wars using prisoners of war to improve and expand the site. This is a small part of the huge Atlantic Wall constructed by the Germans which stretched from Norway down to Spain.
The site contains bunkers, artillery pieces and anti aircraft guns. It is also filled with brilliant dioramas with mannequins dressed in German uniforms, weapons, ammunition boxes and radio equipment.
Included in the entrance fee is an audio guide which I found fascinating. It gives you the background history of what you are looking at instead of just telling you what it is.
While we were there we passed two groups of children on school trips. All the children were engrossed with the story of the site that their guide was telling them and in the site itself. I don't think I've ever come across a school trip before where all the children are so well behaved and attentive and not running amok.
It's hard not to be moved by this museum, whether it's amazement at the amount of resources the Germans used to man the wall or revulsion at the forced labour and brutal treatment of the prisoners used to construct and maintain it.
The day we went we had clear skies and sunshine, however, it was bitterly cold. The site is among the dunes on the north sea coast and is quite exposed when you're not inside one of the bunkers. I'd advise taking a hat, gloves and scarf with you if you visit outside the summer months.
This is well worth a visit and I shall definitely return when I'm next in Ostend.

Belgium,Scotty4454,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"In 2012, my wife and I visited the Atlantic Wall and Museum in Ostende, Belgium. The tour is amazing and well worthwhile when in the area. This is part of the Atlantic Wall which was constructed prior to and during WWII to prevent an invasion of Europe by Allied forces by the Germans, and overseen by Field Marshall, Erwin Rommel. The site consists of honeycombs of tunnels and bunkers facing the English channel as well as gun emplacements which remain today.You gain a unique perspective of this place where the Germans looked out over the Channel anticipating the Allied Invasion as they did. The Museum is adjacent to the tunnels and bunkers and contains books and other displays related to the history of the Wall.There is considerable walking involved and those with fear of enclosed places need to take note.

We were lucky that there was a medieval fair at the time we came to visit. It was quite interesting to find out how people lived and acted in those days. I also enjoyed exploring the Atlantic Wall. Those Germans knew how to build solidly and it was interesting to learn more about WWII.",Aug 2012
Belgium,HD10,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"This is a vast site containing large preserved sections of the 'Fortress Europe' sea defences; built by the occupying German forces during WWII for the inevitable invasion of mainland Europe by the allies. The site is fascinating as this section af defences utilised previous fortifications from WWI.

The park can be entered either from the sea front (the De Lijn tram stops right outside) or from a rere road from Mariakerke. Be careful if using the sea front entrance as there are a large number of steps and these woiuld be difficult for people with mobility issues.

The attraction is divided into two sections: WWI and WWII and form a figure if eight formayion. Both sections are easily do-able in an afternoon. Alongside the wall sections themselves, which are fascinating, they are intersopersed with small exhibitions based on a range of things from food and uniforms to code-breaking. There are also anit -aircraft and beach defences interspersed among the wall alongside restored rooms such as map rooms, sleeping quarters and magazine rooms. Since my last visit (2007) the quality of written information has greatly improved and I believe audio guides are available- though we didn't use one.

It is an amazing site and truly absorbing. Just by looking out to sea and the various points of the coast that can be seen it becomes obvious why this section was of strategic importance.

The wall forms the front end of a much larger site (Domein Raversijde in the tour leaflets available) which also houses that residence of the regent Pince Karel, a wildlife park and a traditional arts and crafts section with small workshops. There is alos a visitor's centre with an art gallery (temporary exhibitions) and a cafeteria towards th rear.

I thoroughly enjoyed this site- it is both atmospheric and well presented. There were also a number of guides placed around the site to offer assistance and guidance- which was a nice touch. If you are staying in Ostend-a good way to visit the site is to get the tram along the seafront and then walk through the site past the cafeteria and get the bus back into Ostend at the rear of the site. (there is a small bus stop outside a farm opposite the rear entance to the site). The only point I would make is that it can be blustery so wrap up. It is a site best done in dry weather as most of it is outside. A fantastic visit.

Belgium,superbarre,Atlantikwall Raversyde,4.0,"Yesterday, it wasn't the best of weather, that happens in Belgium, so I was wondering what to do with the kids. After google, we decided on the Atlantic Wall at domein Raversijde, near Oostende. I've passed this site like a hundred times, but never imagined what lies between and under the dunes, overlooking the sea.
They have created a very nice path through the remakns (although 'remains' doesn't quite do it justice), bringing you passed bunkers, canons, sleeping quarters... Very fascinating to see everything as it has been during WW2.
For the smalleschlidren,, it can be quite a walk, via trenches, stairs and a wooden pathway (no weelchair entry). My four year old was struggling at the end.
Take about two hours to visit, the audio guide is included in the very moderate 6,5 fee. Children tag along for free. There is a cafe/restaurant at the site.

Belgium,RobinsonKktc,Atlantikwall Raversyde,5.0,"I used to walk my friends dog in this area about 25 years ago and never realized what was hiding behind the tangle of bushes and grass until a recent visit to Belgium.
The Atlantic Wall museum just has to be the best preserved part of Hitlers Fortress Europe.

Actually, the fortifications date from well before WW2 and stand in the grounds of a former Royal retreat. Tastefully renovated the outdoor museum retains many of the original guns used during WW1 and WW2 along with interesting displays of how the garrisons used to live during the two world wars. The highly informative and easy to use electronic guide was amongst the best I have ever used. At 6 Euro this is the cheapest entertainment you are likely to find in Belgium and do allow more than the 2 hours suggested for your visit. A word of caution however, the site is not suitable for anyone in a wheelchair or with walking difficulties and they do not take credit or debit cards in the shop or for entrance to the site.

I found the walk and tour very informing the wall was built by the germans in the first world war and extended furthur in the second , there is lots to see and hear through the radios they give and there is also tours just phone them up, there are places you go into and see how they lived and survived in these tunnels and the view was lovely. I do have to say if you do go, you need good walking shoes and a water proof as when we went it was abit windy but sunny, also take some sort a refeshment with you as you are miles from a cafe when you are going round it takes approx 4 to 5 hours so be prepared but worth going to on your visit to Ostend go its is well worth the walk and effort. i enjoyed very much and will go back, whilst there we met a tour guide who spoke really good english and he was really informative about the place and i enjoyed the chat.

This is one of those places where the ambience is part of the fun. It’s a beautiful Medieval square. Even the newer buildings have Medieval elements so that they will fit in better. There are usually 6-12 horse carriages and the bell tower frequently chimes.

At one time, the canals came up to the edge of the square (hence the market), but today the closest canal is a few blocks away. Of the buildings on the square, you should make a point of visiting the town hall.

One note: the row of restaurants on the square looks great, but take a look at the reviews before you try one. There are many nearby restaurants that don’t appeal primarily to tourists where you might have a better experience. Your choice.

Belgium,Stephenbkk20156,The Markt,5.0,"We loved this square. By the time we found our way there, on foot, from the station, we had had enough of narrow streets, closed gift shops (it was evening) and sporadic human contact. The square opened before us, wide, crowded and buzing with action.

Here was a chance of dinner. Here was nightlife. Here were hugely impressive buildings we could see without craning our necks. Here was life lived to scale.

We were surrounded by a miscellany of large, medieval buildings. Each making us gape in admiration. They didn't particularly belong together in the same square but each, individually was impressive. In the centre of the square, a fairground, a stage with a rock concert, parking metres, parked vehicles. A few, many taxis and bicycles, circulating around the edges. People, crowds of them, walking, drinking, dining, taking photos.

It wasn't really quare. The skylines were very uneven. The architecture was of different styles. We didn't care.

On the far side, a row of restaurants with inside and outside dining. Trade was good. Competition healthy. We read the menu blackboards and a waiter found us a seat. Dinner. With a view, an atmosphere, a view of the milling crowds.

As we ate, very late afternoon became night. The revels continue. Rge floolights came on. Perspectives on the buildings around us changed.

There was a taxi rank just round the corner. That got us back to the hotel, replete and content. We had discovered the living heart of Old Bruges.

Belgium,Joanie H,The Markt,4.0,"We visited the Christmas market in Bruges on the first weekend it opened, we travelled there by Eurostar then local train, so it was very easy to get to and just a short walk or taxi ride from the train station. We stated in a local hotel, the market was spread over two squares, each had stalls selling Christmas decorations, clothing, food to buy to eat or take home. They had Christmas music playing and the whole market had a great atmosphere, the mulled wine was delicious, very hot and very strong.
We had a lovely two days there to walk around the market and the whole of the town. The shops were decorated with all Christmas themes and they were lovely to walk around, you had plenty of things to buy, Belgium chocolate, lace, beer, waffles. I would recommend this town and market and I would love to go back next year.

Belgium,830wendy56,The Markt,5.0,"I have just come back from a visit to Bruges, it is a beautiful place. We did a free 2 hour walking tour with a guide called Lander who was very informative and amusing, he showed us parts of the city that we probably would not have found on our own. I think it was a must to get your bearings in the city. Generally we had wonderful food, but we did have a bad experience at Cafe des Arts, the food was good, but the waiter was very rude. We were a bit disappointed in the actual markets to start with, I thought there would be more Christmas decorations and unusual crafts, but later found some lovely things on sale. We liked the brewery tour and sampling the beers sitting outside. A lovely city to visit.

Belgium,Mike S,The Markt,3.0,"This is the second time we have visited and ended up being a little disappointed this time.
The market takes up a fair bit of the square ,but this time the ice skating was a bit of a walk away.
The stalls were all very christmassy, but prices in my opinion were quite high.
Plenty of variety of stall from food , clothes and Christmas gifts all neatly laid out in the square.

The restaurants around the market didn't want to just serve you coffee and a waffle ,but wanted you to eat a full meal.
We ended up walking quite a bit to find somewhere where we could sit down and have a hot choc and waffle.
Although very picturesque I would say a weekend is all you would need when visiting the market.

There are two main markets - one in the main square and another smaller one around 10 min walk away. Both are exactly the same though - just a bunch of pop up cabins selling mulled wine, little Xmas trinkets, hot dogs and burgers etc. One walk around both markets was enough and both lacked that Xmas WOW feeling we were looking for. Not sure what they have done different this year but it is a bit of a let down.",Dec 2019

All of the wonderful buildings, lit up with Christmas lights are a delight. The ice skating rink which used to be here and was a centrepiece in the square has moved to the Minnewaterpark. In the Markt there are a lots of lovely covered stalls selling hot spiced wine and all sorts of gorgeous edibles. It's not that great for Christmas gift shopping but that doesn't matter because here you are surrounded by such great shops, especially chocolatiers, but lots of others too, to potter around. As others have said, avoid the restaurants around the market. You will get much better quality and value by stepping off the beaten track.

The tourist information centre in the train station provided maps with the churches, belfry and main places to visit clearly marked. Bruges was very charming, with much to see and enjoy. It was, however, extremely ‘touristy’ and so felt rather like a treadmill to get through, at times the crowds and traffic made it tricky to navigate our way around. It goes without saying the most expensive places to eat and drink were in the main squares. That said, there were places to sit, take away waffle and chips establishments and plenty of atmosphere to soak up.

Belgium,Monu D,The Markt,5.0,"Though the entire town of Bruges looks like a big painting, the Market Square is the most important highlight of the town. The square, right in the heart of the city, is surrounded by colourful guild houses, the Provincial Court and the tall bell fry. In the centre are the statues of Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck. There are quite a few narrow lanes from here leading to different parts of the town and one of them will take you to Burg square, another pretty square with some nice buildings.

The square has plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants. There are some benches too if you want to take a break from walking. Just sit here and spend a few hours soaking in the views and see the world go by. One can also hire a horse carriage here to see Bruges in a more relaxed way.

Wheelchair users may find moving around a little bumpy as the roads are cobbled and the ride is not smooth, but it is still worth the trouble. I myself am a wheelchair user but I thoroughly enjoyed going around this pretty town.

In the evening we went back to the square expecting a lively environment with illuminated buildings and lots of activities (like we had seen in Prague Old Town square) but sadly it was not the same here. The place looked quite deserted and there were hardly any people around. Our visit was in the the first week of July so may be it was too early for evening festivities.

It's a huge tower with a beautiful Cloth Hall. Opposite the Belfry there is a row of colorful stepped gables with lovely names like ""Le Panier d'Or"". To the east side there are grey, neoclassical buildings. These are decorated with statues and little towers. It's great to enter the Historium building, walk up the stairs and admire the square from the balcony of the Duvelorium pub. Also the last side of the market square has lots to offer. Just take a moment to discover the octagonal weather vane on the facade of the Bouchoute house.

Belgium,LCE180496,The Markt,5.0,"This place is very funky and bright, the atmosphere of the 'Markt' is very energetic, this is due to people busking on the streets (much better than UK ones), horse and carts going past you at every 2 minutes, tour groups with foreigners, people going in and out the many attractions and restaurants, there is lots going on here.

Most of the buildings are in old resistance style and mixed with coloured patterns. There are a few gothic buildings as well, such as, The Belfort van Burgge, Provinciaal Hof and The Historium Burgge.

If you are only here for a numbers of hours, I recommend you take the 'City Tour of Bruges', this sits on the right hand side, just in-front of the Provinciaal Hof. The tour lasts for an hour and the driver will show you all the monuments and buildings that are important to the city, and also point out all the attractions etc. The bus will depart from Markt Square and bring you back here. I absolutely loved the Windmills, you will see these all over Belgium and Holland, they really are unique.

I really enjoyed this part of the city, the 'Markt' reminds me of photos that I have seen of Germany and Poland etc, I would rate it 10/10! have an absolute ball exploring Bruges!

Belgium,retireeVancouver,The Markt,3.0,"This square is noted for its connection to commerce while De Brug is noted as Bruges' administration center. Only on Wednesday mornings, visitors to this square will see market stalls selling fresh veg, fruit, and flowers. However, most tourists come to see the Cloth Hall and its Belfry Tower. The cloth hall once was the center where merchants bought and sold Flemish cloth. Tourists can go through the passageway in the Cloth Hall to see the interior courtyard, but the cloth merchants bought and sold their prized Flemish cloth inside the building (not open). Around the square are guild halls now turned into restaurants. Also visible at one end of the square are stepped roof gables of colorful row housing that have shops on the ground level. This square also features a bronze statue featuring 2 Flemish heroes responsible for winning the Battle of the Spurs in the 1300's against the French. A frieze encircles the round concrete base with illustrations of the events of that battle. Often this statue becomes a meeting point for groups while others cluster around the other notable feature on the square - the Belfry Tower.

The medieval Belfry Tower was built in the 1200's to show off Bruges civic power and wealth. Because of its height, it was used as a watch tower before the carillion bells were installed in later centuries and before the cloth hall was built around it. The Tower is one of Bruges famous landmarks. It has a carillion of 47 bells, but most tourists want to climb the tower (366 steps) for its views over the city's rooftops rather than just listen to the ringing of the bells. The bells ring between 11 and noon on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Adult admission to climb the stairs is 12E with a discount for seniors at 10E. Check the Belfry Tower website for closing dates and opening hours, as it was closed on the day of my visit.

To get a good photo of this square, stand behind the statue and point the camera at the Belfry Tower.

Since nothing was happening in the square on the day of my visit we left after taking our photos and headed up a major shopping street, Steenstraat, close to the bell tower, to visit the Sint Salvatorkathedral.

Belgium,Stanley S,The Markt,5.0,"The Markt is like a Hub on a bicycle. You can go in any direction to walk, find a destination or walk. Itself, it has beautiful architecture, including the Belfort Tower, and you can tell it is the source from which all activity flows. The day we arrived it was later in the day and empty so we felt like we had The Markt, and Bruges itself, all to ourselves;very romantic. The next day was entirely different with its day guests and bus tours. It was so crowded, I still wonder if it was some sort of holiday. Early in the AM and towards evening you can get a horse drawn carraige ride, but why do that in this incredible walking city. The Markt, as well as the city were spotless and we saw shop owners washing the streets in front of their shops as well as local sanitation workers steam cleaning the streets. We noticed at night, all the shops had the same small garbage bags neatly tied in front of their shop for pick up (must be a local ordinance) that were gone by morning. We were there for market day when the square is filled with flowers, produce, breads,meats,cheeses. etc., all being sold from stalls or massive trucks that open up to filled Caselines. It was a nice walk-through and had we not already had breakfast, grabbed some items. The only negative about the Markt is the touristy restaurants on the square, all selling and hawking with gaudy signs, the same items, just under different cafe names. It seemed tacky and not at all in keeping with the Medieval look. Walk around, enjoy and drink in the atmosphere, just don't step in any left by the ummm... (BTW, most wore diapers or catch bags and if there was any left behind, it was quickly cleaned).

Canals and cobbled pavements, surrounded by surreal, huge buildings. Reminded me of a mini Camelot. Many places look like the British houses of parliament.

Jaffa a great burger at Jilles, lovley chocolates from Dumas, went on a fairground ride, took loads of pics before returning to Calais to complete a booze run.

Belgium,carolquinn777,The Markt,5.0,"The Markt Square is a great place to visit. It's full of historical buildings. It's like stepping back in time. The buildings are beautiful and decorated in gold. The Markt Square is a fantastic place to visit there are lots of streets off it to visit, but you have to very careful as it is so busy with traffic cars, buses, bikes and horses and carriages. It's a bustling little place. The town hall has an information point and is beautiful. A horse and carriage tour is €50.00 for half an hour and does not include tip. A free walking tour is ideal to help you see lots also leading off some side streets you can get a boat tour for €10.00 per person for 25 minutes. Shops close early evening, but there is a good selection of restaurants around the square.

I would recommend you plan to stay longer so that you can see the square and town at night.,May 2019
Belgium,Bryan W,The Markt,4.0,"First piece of advice here, do not eat at any restaurant with pictures of the food posted by the menu, or with a carnival barker urging you in. Just don't do it.

If you are in the Markt in Bruges you are within 50-500 meters of about 5 different Michelin starred restaurants. Put your smartphone to work and find one.

The Markt: It might be packed with tourists, but the old buildings are packed with interesting shops. If you think something looks like a tourist trap, it probably is, keep walking and you'll find something authentic in a few more steps.

Don't be afraid to walk a few blocks off/around the Markt square too. You'll find more, and more authentic things, if you do.

The entire town is absolutely charming (clean, walkable, picturesque)!!

Helpful Information
Located in the Historium (in the Markt) is the Tourist Information office. There you can purchase the Brugge City Guide 2019 for 7 euros. The guide is outstanding! It includes 3 different walking tours... directions, descriptions, and a wealth of other information. It is all you need to have a lovely day in Bruges.

As a result there were tons of young kids ,plus the centre of the square was occupied by machineries and vendors

The surrounding medieval buildings gave its beauty,with different periods of architecture,gothic,baroque etc

There are restaurants, chocholate and waffles shops surrounding the square

The fries are particularly tasty served with mayonnaise or ketchup (don,t miss it)

The food I found somewhat expensive

One can also venture and climbed the tower which is more than 365 steps but it gives a good view of the square

Make sure you try the french fries and it is served with mayoinaise. Not what you would think but believe me, it is homemade and very different. On our first trip to Bruges, we declined it. Determined to try it and are hooked. Had fries every day.We mostly ate off street vendors so we could stroll around like the locals. If you choose a restaurant and we did for dinner, it can be a 2 hour or more experience, they are in no rush for you to leave and we usually had to request our bill.You will never go wrong with anything you choose but you need to try their Finnish stew. and it is always served with fries.

The architecture is beautiful year round, and there a number of bars/restaurants where you can take a table outside and watch the world pass by. Even if you don't fancy climbing the Belfort, you can admire its elegance and catch one of the carillon concerts: there's a wonderful atmosphere at midnight on Christmas Eve, when you can warm up with a glass of gluhwein as the carillon plays carols.

You can take a horse and carriage ride from here 50 euros or try an electric rik shaw ride 25 euros.
The market square gets very busy so you need your wit about you as bicycles/taxi's/horses/mopeds all use this area. The cafes and bars in this area are expensive and not all that good, try going just off the beaten track. OK for a coffee to watch the world go by whilst taking in the splendor of the buildings and architecture.
Remember to wear good walking shoes/boots as the whole of Bruges is cobbled the roads/pavements and cycle lanes. It is very bumpy underfoot and my advise would be not to bring suitcases to Bruges unless you really have too, a backpack is the easiest way to get around unless you are taking a taxi door to door to your place of stay.

Belgium,BradJill,The Markt,5.0,"Markt has a history that dates back over a thousand years. A marketplace was held here for centuries. However, what you find today is a beautiful square lined with traditional Flemish buildings filled with restaurants and alfresco seating, the beautiful Provincial Hof building and the iconic Belfry Tower.

Within the square there is an impressive monument statue of Flemish patriots Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck. At times, there are also nice festivals and seasonal markets held here, like the winter Christmas market which we have enjoyed the past couple of years. This is a nice way to spend an hour or so in addition to viewing and visiting the buildings at Markt.

Markt is a place worth spending time in Bruges even on the shortest of visits to the city. With longer stays, do make time to see Markt during the day as well as night, when the buildings are lit with flood lights. It is a romantic and scenic location after dark.

Belgium,Jo C,The Markt,2.0,"No idea why people have reviewed the market as excellent, I can only think they've never been to the UK markets like Winchester or Sailsbury, even our local town in Farnham had a much better one than Bruges.

There is nothing there apart from a few places selling scarves and gloves and or ornaments.

People appear to use both markets as an open air bar and that was the best bit about it.
The second market out of the square was better than the main square (apart from the setting and tiny ice rink)

We went especially for the market and were very disappointed.

The Christmas lights were lovely though.

Bruges is stunning and a must visit, not much to do but with the amazing beer and beautiful city that's all you need for a few days. And the shopping is good.

Go to Bruges at a cheaper and quieter time of year.

Prevent visiting the restaurants on this square. Although they look great on the outside, the ones I visited had mediocre service, mweh-quality food and the interior needs some adjustments. Also prices are high compared to the quality. Follow some small streets and try some of those restaurants. They are way more personal and have greater atmosphere.

The Markt also plays host to the Christmas Market, including the ice skating rink. It is a fun and festive atmosphere.

There is a smaller one which had lots of food and drink log cabins as well as a ice skating rink outside

There were many cabins that sold decorations, clothes etc... as well

The other square had more cabins and was much larger so the horse and carriages could stop there waiting for customers €50 for a tour

It was very cold so the mulled wine and different liquor coffees were great

The whole place felt very Christmassy

It’s 70 miles from Calais and well worth a visit at any time of the year

Some stalls were OK and there were some very nice Christmas decoration stalls but there seemed to be very little real effort made to make it an 'experience'. Compared to Budapest, Vienna and Edinburgh (which are all great and really Christmas'y) Bruges made me feel like it was just after taking my money as easily as possible. We wont go again.

Bruges, however, is a wonderful city with many old and historic buildings. Take a day or two to check it out. Eat chocolate and buy exquisite lace. It's a real treasure. If you want Moules Frites then don't eat it at a cafe in Markt square; go off piste and find a little bistro. You will save money and if you are a Brit like me, Europe is getting to be very expensive, obviously!

Belgium,GARRY S,The Markt,5.0,"My wife persuaded me to visit Bruges specifically to see the Christmas markets, a prospect that filled me with great trepidation. I have to say that, being the most unchristmassy person you can find, I was pleasantly surprised.
All things in Bruges radiate from the Markt. The architecture here is stunning and is dominated by the Belfort belfry tower. At this time of year the square is filled with an ice rink and numerous wooden market stalls selling a variety of food and goods. I was surprised to find that the food stalls here were pretty reasonable considering the high price of eating out in Bruges, a pint of beer 4euros, hamburgers 4 euros and hot dogs 3 euros.
After dark, the place is transformed into a wonderland of lights both on the stalls and along the streets and many of the buildings around the Markt are tastefully decorated. The atmosphere is great and even an old Scrooge like me felt a little christmasy.

Belgium,Rachel_Bing,The Markt,3.0,"The buildings on The Markt are absolutely beautiful and worth seeing, especially the Belfry. The Christmas Market itself was very disappointing and much smaller than others we have been to around Europe. This one consisted mainly of food stalls which were pretty average and there were only a few stalls selling Christmas products. If you go to Bruges at Christmas you will find the little boutique shops much better to pick up gifts. There is a second Christmas market nearby which is meant to be the smaller of the two but that one is much better, lots more vendors and gluhwein served in cute mugs so I recommend you head there!

If you are not there for Christmas markets then the square is delightful and you can get a horse and carriage ride starting there around the sights of Bruges.

Belgium,dja807,The Markt,4.0,"Very busy and very pretty. The town center is lovely. Walk around there is more to the market area then you think. Nice shopping some locals are really nice others seem a bit dry. In other words buy your products pay quickly and leave. As you head into the side streets the retail experience improves. Particularly around chocolate shop vendors. Off the square there are numerous sites like the art museum with a Salvatore dalli exhibition and the department store Sissey Boy. Plenty of bars or brassaries not too much in the coffee shop offering. However most bars sell coffe or tea per say. They would rather you had lunch i suspect. If you arrive by coach it took about fifteen minutes leisurley walk to the square through the streets. A map would help if you can get one. There is no bus service connecting the square to the visitors coach park in 2018. However you can get a bus from near the square to the Bus Station which is a short 10mins easy walk to the coach pick up point. The visitors all day coach park is further away. There is a free van pick up and drop off around Brugge from near the square which stopsvat the BUS Stn. There is also a city tour van near the square. Horse rides are via a que system in the square and cost 50Euros for 35mins around the old town. I noticed quite a few people catching cabs back to the visitors coach park. We caught the local bus which requires a pre paid ticket. Hope that info helps

Following people who were out and about doing the same thing managed to walk close to the Shopping area then these Horse drawn Carriages appear which tickles the fancy and I stop to admire these. As you walk along this Street / road you discover Chocolate Artisans on either side of the Road, coffee shops and waffle outlets. Then you see various international Brands, Churches and Historical amazing Buildings with rich heritage, history and architectural designs. There were so many shops and Foot outlets independent to see. As I walked around I came to this Lake where Tourists were in boat Tours. So many nice hotels on the Lake. There were Beer Museums and other Museums or Buildings which you could queue up for a Tour. I overheard a Tour Guide explaining that there were 356 Steps to climb to get to the top. A tour guide was also explaining the Chimes of the Bells where the Church Bells weren't as loud of the other buildings. There was opportunity to capture the moments. I came across Art Galleries too. Personally a Day trip isn't enough to capture the whole essence of Brugge Christmas Market. I also stumbled across a Children's Choir performing which was nice to watch and see. Well worth another visit as I've discovered a Retailer I used to patronise in the UK and I was pleased with some items I needed and was looking out for. This is my experience. I hope it helps others.

The weather wasn’t ideal but was completely out of our control. Having got the the market I was incredibly disappointed. Half the size I imagined it to be and as previously said full mainly of hats,scarfs and drinking stalls. I’d imagine children getting very bored with little to look at and being very busy. The Christmas lights were not switched on until 4-4:30pm. The festive atmosphere was missing. Instead we were greeting with repeated stalls and lack of variety. On the plus the mulled wine was lovely 😊

The builds whilst beautiful would be better and more appreciated in dry weather. Overall I sadly wouldn’t be rushing back to Bruges next year.

All just mass produced & same as anywhere, your local town would probably do it better! There is another one, in the next square but just as bad!

It’s lively in the evening for people who like standing & drinking, with a couple of drinks/ food stalls open!

So wouldn’t recommend to anyone, but the buildings in the market square are gorgeous!

Belgium,D_K,The Markt,2.0,I was really disappointed by the market as I heard so much about it before traveling to Bruges and the expectation didn’t meet reality. If you’ve ever been to Camden Market in London this is a great disappointment as it’s much small without a lot to offer.,Nov 2018
Belgium,francefan65,The Markt,2.0,"We have been to Bruges many times both in summer and to the Christmas market. We have just returned from our latest trip and we were very disappointed. On past visits to this beautiful place the Belfort Square has been really atmospheric with lots of cabins all lit up ready for Christmas selling artisan goods as well as food and drink, but this time there were few visitors and what stalls were there were really run of the mill. Many were shut up, possibly until evening time. Many people we spoke to had visited as part of an organised coach trip and stated that they would not visit again. The German Christmas markets are much better. Come on Bruges, get your act together and make your market one to remember. We have already decided we will not return

Belgium,Thomas H,The Markt,4.0,"We chose to go Bruges as part of a mini cruise and definitely had to visit the Markt Square. We also decided to go look at the Xmas Market too.
The markt square itself is gorgeous, some buildings date back many of years and has so much history.
Xmas Market - Basic stalls which consist mainly of food and drinks with a few bauble shops...we weren't disappointed as the shops around the Markt square and leading to the square are filled with Chocolate, Xmas and liqueur shops so the whole place is amazing!
Definitely recommend anyone to go visit it :D.",Nov 2018
Belgium,Sue E,The Markt,2.0,"We recently booked our trip to Bruges, timing it with a trip to the Christmas Market. Whilst Bruges itself is very pretty, the Christmas Market was so disappointing!!!!!!! Most of the stalls were food and drink, with only a handful of stalls selling gifts and crafts. Basically, jewellery and hats. There were probably not many more than about 20 stalls, and that’s being generous. Our spirits lifted slightly when we walked up another road and saw some more Christmas stalls, but it really was only more of the same. If you’re looking for inspiration for Christmas presents, this is not the place to go. The other surrounding shops were ok, but not the type of thing you would need to travel to. Unless you want to buy chocolate of course.

It is a safe place to visit and has that air of magic sparkle. We were in the square on the morning that all the outdoor seating areas were being dismantled for the winter and were in awe of how these were being packed and relocated ready for storage. The Markt is a central meeting point for all and if you fancy something to eat then it is all here but be aware, you will pay that little bit more than elsewhere in the city.",Nov 2018

The architecture around is amazing, you can't stop making picture here. And also, most of the sightseeings and interesting places to visit could be reached easily and quick by foot starting from this point.

I do not recommend to visit a restaurant here, because other than the sights there is nothing special. The food is overpriced and not very good.

The market stalls are next level structures. The ones back home are more akin to fitting out 1970s caravans with deep fryers and benches. These are mobile delicatessen’s.

Beautiful fresh produce. If we were staying at a place with an oven we would certainly loved to have purchased some meet, vegetables and cheese to feast on.

Belgium,Rummage,The Markt,3.0,"Thanks to its over emphasised reputation and Zeebrugge's cruise ships Bruges now enjoys levels of tourist density comparable with Venice. On the day we visited the Markt walking on crowded footpaths was uncertain often required resorting to the roads and braving the sullen and silent cyclists. All public hotspots are paved with cobbles uneven and sharp making hard soled shoes a must. I was hobbling after one hour. The chocolate shops are everywhere and the product no better than Lindt. The staff were friendly and liked a joke. Even slightly off the beaten track there are parks and canals more relaxing and slightly less crowded. Don't expect a grand historic experience. You will be glad when it's over and you can rest your aching feet and strained patience. 10 years ago on my first visit I loved the place but times have definitely changed. p.s. Belgian trains are just about OK but download the ticket to your phone and avoid the ticket machine queues which never seem to move.

We walked from the hotel to the Historic center, very large market with magnificent Historic buildings such as churches, cathedral, shopping area, restaurants, coffee shops and canals.

Silent bicycles coming up behind you every minute your trying to pass people on narrow pavements so it wasn't relaxing. Did enjoy a Belgium beer and watch stuff.

Nearly all the bus lines stop at the Grand Markt so if you're heading to the city from the train station (Bruges), it's a short ride (except maybe if the bus stops everywhere dropping off passengers). But when we took the bus from the train station, it was short but entertaining because a passenger started singing opera songs 😁. Oh and the ride is €3 per person, so make sure you either have euros on you already or have your money changed at the train station (money exchange place is right inside, before you exit to the bus pick up area).

You have to choose a time when you expect to visit the castle, because the amount of people that is allowed to visit is limited.
An audio guide is included with the entrance fee. Because of covid you will not get headphones. You are allowed to use your own earplugs.
The audio is done by a local comedian. He explains the history of the castle and the inhabits on a rather comical way. You can choose between Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish.
The visit with the audio guide will take about 1,5 hour. Be aware there are a lot of stairs involved.

The castle itself is totally unfurnished, and doesn't even use any multi-media to give a sense of what it might have been like. So basically you just wander round a few empty stone rooms. There are a few weapons, and a few torture items - but no labelling to explain anything - the ""comedian"" advised us to use our imaginations - i.e. he had no idea and hadn't bothered to find out.

The whole thing is a missed opportunity in the centre of town to do something really impressive.

1) we need better explanation for the different rooms to visit, the speaker was telling his story but it was presented in such a way that we were not sure of the history whether it was real or invented.
2)there should also be more explanation about the rooms and objects in more than one language, only dutch was used and nothing in other languages.
3) the site is dangerous for small childeren because there is no fence protection on the walk way for little once.

Belgium,VKristofvanB,Gravensteen,2.0,"Due to Covid 19, the tour has been changed to a one-way walk around. Many things that were visible in the past are no longer visible - a shame when paying 12 euros, receiving an electronical guide, version of the audio is fit for children, age 10 but not for adults. Many expanation cards are no longer visible so it's a bit of guessing what you see or better think you see - torture room is after bars and not interesting at all anymore ..... conclusion: it was much better in the past and far to expensive!
I really hope the visit gets back to the old version .....not even taken one picture, not worth it ....

Belgium,DaniErin,Gravensteen,5.0,"I'm not one to always choose the Audio Guides however this tour is a must have with the guide! The narrator takes you on a journey back to the time when the count was living in Gravensteen. There was humor, love, and torture. The tour took just over an hour to complete. Excellent thing to do in Ghent. Go at 4pm before they close to beat some of the crowds.",Mar 2020

Belgium,EastYorksAndrew,Gravensteen,4.0,"Lovely interesting castle with an unusual history. You pick up an audio commentary device and follow the numbered signs. The guy who recorded the commentary is a bit of a comedian, and some of the stuff is a bit off the wall, but it saves you getting bored with just facts!
Parts of the tour are outside, so it’s best to pick a dry day. The views over the city are good.

We had no expectations and knew little about the structure or its history, but we ended up loving our visit. The castle is beautiful and in great shape. We agreed that the audio guide included with the entrance fee is the best we’ve ever heard. It was well organized, easy to follow, included a narrative and was more than just a dump of facts and figures. At times the narrator had us laughing out loud. This is a must-see for anyone visiting Ghent!",Feb 2020

Belgium,wibster2000,Gravensteen,2.0,"This looks as though it should be an amazing experience. It is a lovely building well restored. BUT - there is absolutly no information on what you are looking at. Nothing in any of the rooms to say what they were for, or when built, or who by. There is an audio guide included in the 12Euro entry price - probably the worst audio guide anyone has ever made. Endless drivvel - maybe intended for children but so long winded they would be bored to death. No serious information at all. More important - there is no indication at all of the number of steps you have to go up (then down). Many are in stone spirals with worn steps and poor lightling. Anyone with any disability or just poor knees or a breathing issue could find it far too hard, and there is no way out once you are in the guided route. Beware!

Belgium,Lenore P,Gravensteen,1.0,Ghent is a city of history and art. The castle is historical but the audio guide has crude jokes and does not address the history in an educational way. It cheapens the experience. Paid the entrance fee and the audio guide and left after ten minutes. Use your time elsewhere. If you have children with you they might enjoy it.,Feb 2020

Very suitable for people who like to know history, or families who want to walk through a real castle, after that you can go back to the shop, so something for everyone.",Oct 2019
Belgium,Worldwide Traveller,Gravensteen,5.0,"I enjoyed this visit simply because it can be done in a matter of 90 minutes and can give its visitor a good idea of what those times were like in terms of live in general and people.

Serious historians may be put off by the way the visit is conducted yet hey, this is a vacation and one is suppossed to have a good laugh too.

Take care your time, enjoy the visit, grab very good pictures of Ghent from the top of the castle and leave it with a smile on your face.

I would not recommend it for small children since some of the details shared on the audiotour are more of an adult nature.

Well scripted and well presented, the guide is personal, humorous and gives you historical facts with a modern take.

The place is historical but everything about it is accessible. Touch the walls, sit on the benches, take loads of pictures. The audio tour, while cheesy, made the experience more fun. The narrator tells stories and explains various features of the buildings with humor - some of which might be questionable for smaller children.

There are stairs, low door ways, stone floors and tight spaces throughout. We found it a great way to spend 90 minutes or so. We visited during Christmas so the castle was decorated with fir trees, garland and wreaths. Quite festive!

Belgium,vfehling,Gravensteen,5.0,"I visited Gravensteen with my 12-year old son. We both enjoyed it very much. The audiotour consisting of 18 relating stories explains each space you are visiting with the story of Filip from Alsace, founder of this most impressive castle of Flanders.
The story is also underlined by paintings, cloths and flags.
I visited the castle before years ago. I remember the torture room left a lasting expression then, but the equipment has now been moved and is not as graphic as it was then, which is probably for the better and more suitable for children.
Very impressive display of weapons as well.
Overall I rate a visit to Gravensteen a must when visiting Ghent. Highly recommended.

Much of Ghent is an ordinary, working city, but of course there is the beautiful, historic centre. We had made our way through the ordinary bits for way too long. Then, suddenly, it became extraordinary, as a stonking great castle was immediately produced. Not a reconstruction, or modern confection. A genuine, castle left over by the tides of history.

It is big and imposing, here to stay. It makes good use of the river it stands on, for both defence and scenic purposes. Uneven surfaces underfoot, high curving gateway overhead.

They wanted money to go in, and we were not ready as we still hadn't explored the historic heart of the city. Plenty of people coming in and out.

For us, then, it was a very timely landmark, showing us we were really on the right track. The Medieval buildings we were looking for surrounded us once we left the castle entrance.

There are many rooms you can stroll through, some narrow stairs, a big yard, a rooftop which you can also climb. We had the luck to catch the sunset while we were on the rooftop and it was such a nice view over Ghent.

Narrated by ""Wouter"", each of the 18 stops had us both in hysterics. Each was the perfect combination of historic content and great storytelling. So much so that my friend is going back to try the other languages to see if they are as good. I certainly hope so.

Well done to the team who produced it.

Belgium,Rebekah Bethany,Gravensteen,5.0,"I’ve visited twice, once with my husband and again with our young children (8 and 9). I would be happy to see it again! It is so fun to spend the afternoon walking around this castle. The new audio tour is very good! It is a bit suggestive at times, (I would say rated PG rather than G) but it all went over our kids’ heads. If you are visiting Ghent, you really should visit Gravensteen! It is totally worth the cost of admission.",Nov 2019
Belgium,Trish V,Gravensteen,5.0,"This is a must see in Ghent, Gravensteen castle overlooks the top of the town. Audio guide is interesting to say the least, a different type of ""story telling"", which you'll either love or hate. Great views from inside over the city.",Sep 2019

Belgium,Marco Z,Gravensteen,5.0,"Really very nice and modern museum. You wouldn't expect much from a castle, other than just walking and take some pictures. Instead, we got a great service and a nice experience. Reception was very nice and we immediately felt pleased, then we got audio guide, included for every guest. The audio guide is highly funny and interesting, not your usual ""boring""guide. It's interesting, diverse, funny and has a personal touch! Whether you like museums or not: highly recommended. Plus, the view is really worth it.",Nov 2019
Belgium,crag1975,Gravensteen,5.0,We have visited many castles in the UK abroad but Gravensteen gives a lesson on how to positively involve the kids (ours were aged 8 and 11). The commentary via the headsets was excellent for adults and kids alike. One of our children has ASD and surprisingly he used the headset and loved it too. The price to get in was economical for adults and for children it was free. The staff were friendly and at the top of the castle there were wonderful views/photo opportunities. Recommend.,Oct 2019
Belgium,GeorgieW,Gravensteen,4.0,"The castle is right in the city center and is beautiful and very imposing. There is a €10 charge, which isn’t too bad, but there are very few signposts with information. There is a self-guided audio tour, but it’s rather dreadful - relies too much on attempts at humor (including about inappropriate subjects, such as torture devices) and not enough actual historical information. In all, a cool place to visit, but research it first.",Nov 2019
Belgium,DesmondJones,Gravensteen,5.0,Great castle. A must if you are in Ghent. Just a lovely wander around with fun commentary and and good views of the city. Kids are free which is great.,Oct 2019
Belgium,Advait S,Gravensteen,5.0,"It is a lesson learnt, how to make an average castle look something out of this world. Give it an awesome 😎 commentary. The audio guide in English hits it out of the park. It conveys the necessary information and in an extremely funny way. The five stars ✨ are for the commentary.
Just too good!!",Oct 2019
Belgium,Danièle D,Gravensteen,5.0,Impressive and outstanding castle architecture. You should consider going as well for a boat tour to see it from this angle which enables you to take stunning photos.,Oct 2019
Belgium,AndrewC,Gravensteen,5.0,"We were based in Bruges for a few days and wanted to do our final day in Gent having done pretty much everything in Bruges. The castle was really nice. Like most historic places on Belgium (unlike the UK) children have free entry which is great. The castle itself was really well kept and you are guided by an audio tour(you really must take this here as information is lacking otherwise) by 'Wouter' who had a really very funny, enjoyable and informative tour of the castle and knowledge about the original Count. I guess it could be improved further with more artifacts in the rooms like beds tables etc but that is just being picky as the audio tour is great and you can imagine everything from the description. If you are in Gent or Bruges this is really worth a visit if you have the time. One of my favourite sites to see while I was here.

Belgium,Ellie Illing,Gravensteen,5.0,"My boyfriend and I visited this on our trip to Gent. We wanted to do something cultural that would teach us some history of Gent. This was one of the best castle tours I've ever done (I've been to a lot) The audio guide is included in the ticket which is very reasonable, €6 for under 26yr olds. It was the best audio guide
I've had in a castle, it told you stories of the castle, the man on the audio was a local and had a bit of a backstory himself, it was funny, very discriptive, and interesting. The route was thought out so visitors didn't clash on stairs etc. There was lots of seating and the castle was in very good condition. I especially liked these cartoon tapestries in each room that were cartoons of the backstory of each room.

Belgium,KentGriswalds,Gravensteen,4.0,"A really nice castle with a good audio tour which is very informative. The only small criticism is that in the hall with lots of exhibits (weapons, armour etc) all of the information specific to each item is written solely in Flemish. With the large number of English, American and French visitors that were there when we visited it would add to the visit to have the information also written in other languages.",Oct 2019

Up until today we have had such varied interests that we haven't stayed together on many tours. Today's tour of Gravenstein castle was the exception. All 8 of us went on the tour, it was 10 euro per person and included an audio guide. The audio guide was so entertaining and educational at the same time.

Enjoy a cake and coffee at the restaurant just outside the entrance afterwards.",Sep 2019
Belgium,burnsie93,Gravensteen,4.0,"I was really looking forward to touring a medieval castle with my kids. We got the audio tour which was super helpful to understand castle life in those days and what each room was for etc. I could have done without the crude, slightly sexual commentary which wasn’t appropriate for kids.

The one complaint I have is about the audio guide. While it was entertaining, I do wish that it had been more educational. Having the ability to choose between comedy and a more historical look would have been better for my interests.",Sep 2019

Belgium,Sevda G,Gravensteen,5.0,"If you're into epic medieval castles, this is THE place. Outside it looks like a traditional medieval castle and you can take great pics, but I definitely recommend going inside too. They offer audio guide tours which were very immersive, informative and with high entertainment value as well (if you're into comedy). You can also take pictures inside and in the inner yard, and especially from one of the towers where you can see a panoramic view of Ghent.
Was definitely a worthwhile experience.",Sep 2019

This is a well preserved site where you can climb the towers and walk the papapets just like they did 400 years ago.

Well worth the time. One and a half hours for the tour with great views of old town from the parapet",Sep 2019
Belgium,AJ K,Gravensteen,5.0,"Take your time with the steps as they are steep, but so worth getting to the top of this building for the spectacular views.

Belgium,Gerry Falchick,Gravensteen,5.0,A 12th century medieval castle in the easy to get to center of Ghent was a delightul surprise as it was accompanied by an amusing audiio tour adding some levity to a really serious edifice replete with torture chamber.

Belgium,AnnKzn,Gravensteen,5.0,A well thought out and humorous audio tour. Castles are always fascinating but they can get too much of the same thing. The audio kept the pace going with the interesting story of Count Philip of Alsace.The view from the top of the tower was beautiful. This castle has a dungeon where prisons were kept. On display is various equipment used for torture.,Sep 2019
Belgium,LucijaPlantak,Gravensteen,5.0,"I really enjoyed the visit to this amazing castle.
The structure itself is stunning, but with the free audio guide you truly find out a lot of intriguing details and it's all being told by a funny storyteller in a witty way. The possibility to do everything in your own pace and play the recordings when it suits you makes the visit even more enjoyable.
It is really nice to see how much effort they put into modernizing the tour and into making the rich history of the castle interesting to wider audiences. The staff was also very polite and cheerful.
Highly recommend!!",Aug 2019
Belgium,margeauxn,Gravensteen,5.0,"This was certainly my favorite part of Ghent! The tour was about 1.5 hours and cost 10 euros. It was so worth it. The audio guide was very cleverly written and the castle was exciting to explore. The views from the top were unbelievable (so worth the climb). Speaking of climb... You have to walk up (and then down) a TON of stairs in a narrow spiral staircase. I'm not in the best shape and I found it difficult. But don't let that deter you... even with all the steps, it was so worth it!

Note: I took Tram 1 to Korenmarkt and then Tram 4 to Gravensteen (I'm not sure if I could have taken Tram 4 all the way from Gent-Sint-Peters but it saved me a ton of walking).

I recommend this place for families.,Sep 2019
Belgium,Debbie Z,Gravensteen,5.0,This is a self guided tour of medieval castle with brilliantly done commentary on audioguide. The commentary was entertaining and humorous.

Belgium,Xave Edison,Gravensteen,4.0,"The castle looks magnificent on the outside and we decided to pay the entrance fee of Euro 10 to explore the interior.

The audio guide is free and the history is presented in a humorous and interesting way.

The castle is quite big and there are plenty of rooms (armour, torture dungeon, church etc) to explore. Some will require to climb up/down narrow spiral staircases.

The best viewpoint to take the exterior of the castle is at Sint-Widostraat, just across the canal.

Belgium,Deborah L,Gravensteen,5.0,"Add Gravensteen (Castle of the Counts) to your list of must-visit sights when in Ghent. It was a fascinating experience and an extremely enjoyable one because of the audio guide. I have never listened to one like it. I was tempted to pay the entrance fee a second time just to listen to the audio guide again. It is full of information about the history of the castle and its former occupants as well as describing the significance of each room. The story of Gravensteen is told with humor and sensitivity. One moment I found myself feeling a bit blue for those who resided within its walls then the next one laughing out loud at the commentary.

The views of Ghent from the towers are beautiful. There is a dungeon with many implements for torture and another room that displays armor, swords, knives, and muskets. I spent about ninety minutes there, meandering through each room, reflecting on what I’d just learned.

It was a pleasant way to spend some of my last afternoon in Ghent. I almost passed it up, but I am glad I did not.

One note of caution: while the audio guide is lighthearted and entertaining, when the attendant at the desk said it was for children ages 8 or older, I thought it was a “responsibility” issue with a younger child treating the equipment properly, when in actuality, some of the content of the audio guide was a bit more graphic when speaking of the devices of torture, and my 6-year-old quickly asked to skip that part of the guide which we gladly did! I think it may be a bit much even for children ages 8-10, as my 10-year-old daughter didn’t care to listen to that portion either. Overall, it was fun, and has some absolutely gorgeous views of the city of Ghent!

Belgium,Christel D,Gravensteen,5.0,"We went in the summer with a teenager and a 65+.
We received headphones (available in several languages) and started the audiotour. Follow the voice through the castle. It will take 60 to 90 minutes.
I have been there as a teenager and allthough the castle hasn't changed, the experience has.
It was great: humoristic, interesting, easy to follow,...
Prices are democratic.
Not possible for strollers, wheelchairs and people who have trouble walking (many steps and stairs).
Located in the middle of the city, it's a good place to start or end a tour through Gent.
It brings you back a few hundred years in time.

There are tons of stairs. I'm walking impaired and I sadly couldn't make it through the whole thing, but from no. 13 to 18 I sat comfortably on a bench in the yard and listened to the rest of the story while admiring the castle.",Aug 2019
Belgium,Ian C,Gravensteen,5.0,"The rather sombre and forbidding Gravensteen (Castle of the Counts) in the heart of Ghent dates back to 1180 and was the residence of the Counts of Flanders until 1353, after which it has been used as a court, prison, mint, and a factory until its restoration from 1893–1903. You can see different architectural styles on its exterior, reflecting different phases of its development.

Children love it, there are lots of steps to climb, with great views over the city, the inevitable torture chamber, a good exhibition of armour and weapons plus, when we were there, blacksmiths were at work in the courtyard.

I wouldn't pay 10 EUR again for visiting the castle and here why: a lot of people, so you cannot really enjoy viewing the interiors; the audio guide contains way too long narrations, what doesn't nicely feet into quite a poor interior; the internal passage along the castle's wall, where you appear at the end of excursion, doesn't contain a fence from the internal side, though the altitude is quite high: I was scared that my children, especially wearing audio guides headphones, can just fell out.

It is easy to get to from the train station using the Metro. Once there, you may purchase a general admission ticket which includes an audio guide. I will say the audio was very juvenile and immature. Considering, there are so many age levels that attend the tour - we understand. However, the comments made are a little hard to follow along with and it's easy to not want to continue. Much history to be learned and the castle is absolutely stunning! There is also a shop available to purchase souvenirs that are SO good and memorable. Overall, the tour is worth the trip!

My son had been researching Ghent for our trip and highlighted this as a thing to do. From a family perspective the tour and audio guide was spot on for us in regards to it's level, it's humour and the fact that it didn't try and take itself to seriously. My children greatly appreciated the ""horrible histories"" approach to the tour and were still talking about it days later. I think that the brains behind this attraction are to be commended for trying something a little different in approach.",Jul 2019
Belgium,iloveyoutoo,Gravensteen,4.0,"To be honest we actually went because we liked the reviews that said the audio tour was inappropriate!! It was pretty silly but I thought it also came across as fun and funny at times.

There are a lot of steps in the castle, and you have to stand about a fair amount of time listening to the audio tour but without it, I wouldn’t have known what we were looking at or which room we were standing in!

However I got hot ears and after a while the voice on the audio tour became pretty tedious, so I skipped a couple of things! I can see (or hear) why some people wouldn’t like their kids listening to it, but medieval times were pretty gruesome so you’re going to hear about torture - it wasn’t all about princesses being woken by their handsome prince back then! It’s not really much worse than the kids horrible histories books!

Belgium,alligeek,Gravensteen,5.0,"We (me, my husband and our 9 year old son) decided to cut our day trip to Bruges to stop in Ghent and visit Gravenstein, and I’m glad we did.

The castle itself is super cool and appears to be well preserved. It’s more impressive and authentic than some other castle tours I’ve been on *coughWarwickcough* and doesn’t seem like a tourist trap loaded with soda stands and shops. There’s a small shop at the beginning, but the rest is seemingly true to how it appeared when the Count lived there.

The audio guide was a huge hit, both with the adults and our son. They really did a great job of telling the Count’s story and the history of the residence with some truly good humor mixed in. Usually we’re not “audio guide people,” but I’m so glad that we did this one.

All three of us loved this and agreed that this was one of the highlights of our 11 day trip to Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris.

The castle is in really good shape and is very impressive. The price for audio tour and access to the castle is very reasonable. The tour itself is throughout the grounds and the audio guide is suitable for people of all ages, really making the tour a fun experience. For those looking for in depth history it will be harder to find, as the guide goes into more details of the city founding and the roots of the castle and its early owner.

Overall this is a MUST do in Ghent, and if I was going back with friends I would take them back to it.

We were there an hour before they closed, and decided we didn't want to waste time with the audio tour, but the guy at the counter convinced us to give it a go. Not wanting to argue in our limited time, we took the audio guide, and were planning to just hang it around our necks, not really listening to it.

We put it on to pretend to listen, then got instantly hooked! We've never done a tour so interesting and funny before (we have done loads of audio tour). It really is well done, and you definitely should give it a go. The palace really came alive with the narrator. Loved it.

Belgium,Montreal_native,Gravensteen,5.0,This place had the best audio tour I've ever had. Its free and 100% a must when visiting Gravensteen. Our cashier didn't mention this until we walked in and noticed everyone had the ear phones on. We quickly figured out that you need to pick them up inside the gift shop. The castle is truly amazing and the audio tour was again the best one yet. It was both educational and funny. Definitely a must when visiting Ghent!,May 2019
Belgium,deVries2016,Gravensteen,5.0,"Beautiful castle! We were actually passing through and decided to search for the castle and good that we did!

Belgium,PamdP,Gravensteen,5.0,"This castle in the middle of Ghent takes you by surprise. You suddenly come upon the castle complete with battlements and even part of a moat. It has been kept in original condition as much as possible so you get a real feel for what life must have been like. You can climb the towers, walk along the walls and see the big fireplace where outdoor cooking took place. It is a great place to explore especially with the audio guide. There area lot of steps, some quite steep, so some people would not be able to manage it all, but even then you can get a good feel for it.",May 2019

A local comedian does the talking and takes you through the castle in 18 spots. From lounges to dungeons and from cellar to the top.
This top gives you an excellent view over the city.
The gift shop is not that particular special...more of the same as in other gift shops mostly.

I enjoyed my pleasure way of seeing it, but I think the audio tour would have been good too. I'm sure they can tell a lot of stories that I didn't get just from reading.

Belgium,wendyanddavid536,Gravensteen,5.0,"Gravensteen (Castle of the Counts) is a hugely impressive and very well preserved castle in the centre of Ghent, built in 1180 to replace an earlier smaller fortification dating back to 900. It was the home of the Counts of Flanders until 1353, then successively a court, a prison, a mint and a cotton factory.

There is a large central keep with various outlying residential buildings surrounded by an oval defensive enclosure with a large number of defensive turrets.",Apr 2019

Belgium,B81W,Gravensteen,5.0,"The audio tour is definitely what makes this castle worth a visit, my partner and I both found it very funny. Yes there is some minor swearing and innuendos so if it were a film it would probably be a 12 not a U so use your discretion re younger children listening. The castle itself is in very good condition, you get to walk around the majority and the views from the higher terraces are spectacular. Some very steep drops so keep tight hold of kids hands in these areas as there are no barriers. Loved the illustrations on the walls, shame there were no pictures or books of these for sale in the shop, as I would have brought these!

Another then let us in no problems with our pre-booked tickets. The castle is stunning and very well preserved. We got the audio guide to find out a bit more about the history and while it was amusing in parts, sometimes it was just a bit smutty and with all the sex jokes we found it hard to tell which parts were truly part of the history and which were just added in for effect.",Apr 2019

Castle has one good exhibit which was of the armour and weapons other than that its mostly empty.,Apr 2019

Belgium,Giedrius N,Gravensteen,5.0,"Castle itself is a huge stone building with empty rooms and few exhibitions. What makes it a worthy trip here is an audio guide, which you get after buying a ticket. The storyteller is quite witty and tells a story about each section in the castle. Stories are accompanied by authentic sound effects, which makes the experience there even better.

Make sure to travel here as early as possible, because during lunchtime it can be a bit crowded.

Belgium,Onnanohito184,Gravensteen,5.0,"A must see when visiting Ghent. The castle was built in the 8th century and has been extremely well preserved and looked after. It’s a stunning grey stone construction, surrounded by water on most sides (but not entirely). Go in and get the audio guide, which will walk you through the castle and its history in about 1h and 15 minutes. This is by far the best audio guide I have ever used in a museum! It’s not just telling you the historical facts about the castle, it’s not only dates and names from the distant past. The narrator makes the story telling extremely compelling, funny and spiced with details that you normally do not hear about historical figures. The audio guide also has sound effects which help you better dive into the past and picture all the details of medieval life. An absolute delight!

Belgium,StellaB69,Gravensteen,3.0,"Castle is brilliant to walk around with fantastic panoramic views of the city and we got free tickets from our hotel, so saved €10 per person which was a bonus.

Some staff were amazingly friendly, others just rude. A please or thank you rather than shouting at people for unsuspectingly taking a bottle of pop (which appeared to be the equivalent of dangerous contraband) into the castle would have gone a long way.

The audio for the UK was ‘unique’. I’d say it was written by the Monty Python crew, but sadly not. Whilst there was humour in it and we found it quite funny, there was very little actual history about the armour and the castle which meant we didn’t get to know much about it.

On the whole, buy a guide book rather than the audio if you want history, use the headset if you want a surreal audio experience!

The audio guide given is free and while it is entertaining, there can be some fairly crude jokes they became increasingly more noticeable from number 11 and on. Our kids were able to pick up on it, so if you don’t want you’re children hearing slightly sexual jokes and graph torture details, I would have them skip the part about the Counts bedroom chamber and the room with banners hanging showing executions. Other than that, honestly, it was great! Very informative on the history, the castle itself is in fab condition and kept up very well. Worth visiting for sure!

HELPFUL INFORMATION:
Normally we spend many hours if not the day in a museum or historical venue exploring artifacts and reading provided information. However, Gravensteen even at a slow pace only took us about two hours to thoroughly cover.

Directly across the street from Gravensteen (located in the old fish market - look for Neptune overhead) is the tourist information office.

Also just a short walk from Gravensteen is Himschoot Bakery...take the time to stop in! Himschoot pastries are delicious.

It also helps to bring the castle alive as without it, you won't get the full benefit as there isn't much in the way of artefacts or furnishings.

Do climb the top and look out of the battlements, such a fantastic view over the city, looking down the river. It's not perilously high so most acrophobes can cope but be warned, there is a spiral staircase (one way only) so lots of steps, bring comfortable walking shoes.

Very cheap considering it's a castle, you can see lots of work has been done to it over the years but this shouldn't divert your attention to the history of it. The staff are super friendly and welcoming, we spent a good 1.5-2 hours here and did not regret it.

There are almost no artifacts in most of the castle or any hint of life in those days. We opted to not get the audio guide and basically paid 10 Euros to see empty rooms. Only one chamber has artifacts in glass cases which house swords, spears, guns and armor. Walking around the walls was unimpressive as there is really nothing to see.

If you don't take the audio tour, you can also stroll at your pace and the castle is not so large that it requires many hours.

The beauty of being ""lost"" on the streets of a new city we visit is that we inevitably come across some really amazing places without even having to look for them.They just appear in front of us! And so it was with Gravensteen Castle, or the Castle of the Counts. It's big, old and quite imposing. Its history starts way back somewhere in the 9th century, with a castle being built around the early 12th century. Philip of Alsace built the first real stone castle on the site in 1180, according to the information provided on site. The castle has evolved from a count's residence, over time, to a cotton spinning mill, to a prison, to a mint, a part of it a Fish Market, from a small fortification with wooden buildings to an imposing castle, and from the seat of the Council of Flanders to a museum and tourist attraction. Definitely worth a look in!

Key tip: take the audio tour. It's fun, very informative and you get to see all the details of the castle and know the history behind it. One downside, the headphones aren't cleaned after use...and directly shared with new tourist...take some hygienic cloths along ;)

The tour takes you through the main parts of the castle while listening to the castle story and some curious facts.

The castle facilities and area are well preserved and the audio guide is well prepared.
A very good visit if you are in Gent.

It makes the whole tour a story about the people who lived there, it's jokes around and makes you actually interested in the facts about the castle. It is not boring.

Belgium,Shelliu,Gravensteen,5.0,"The best done audio tour of anywhere I have visited- it was available in many languages, was informative and witty. I loves the balance and the timing. It wasn’t drawn out or too long and kept the story interesting. It’s perfectly laid out to view the castle in its entirety as well. There is an incredible amount of history that this castle stands for and it’s right near the center of town.

There were a lot of stairs so leave your stroller/carriage at home and bring a carrier if you have one. A must visit when in Gent. Also, a great price when you buy a Gent City Card...get in to the Castle and more than a dozen other places plus free transport for EUR 30 for 2 days or 35 for 3 days.

Belgium,Aileen E,Gravensteen,4.0,"The castle is pretty cool, but everything could do with more explanation. The rooms, what they were originally for, who lived there, some in-depth history. The artifacts and layouts were not always in a logical order, and there was no flow to most rooms. Once you leave the heavily populated rooms, there could also do with being more signs as to where to walk next. We all got a bit disoriented and lost in the courtyard.

Medieval History isn't bright and fluffy, so don't expect it to be and you'll be fine.

Not for anyone with accessibility needs, it's quite steppy.

A beautiful 12th century castle plonked in the centre of the city but back in the day it would of been the only thing here. We went early because we learnt that it would get busier the later we left it so if you wanted to explore the castle without hoards of tourists make sure you go early. The headset and guide was funny if not a little strange but enjoyable and amusing and you will have fun exploring the castle along the way.,Oct 2018

Belgium,SJMachrihanish,Gravensteen,5.0,"I'm assuming, of course, that the same tongue-in-cheek audio tour is translated into all the languages catered for. As I was listening to the Count of Flanders pooping into the moat whilst the town residents cheered loudly at the loud plop and splash made by his robust stool I couldn't help but think this would only make a Brit smile (or a Russian, we apparently share the same sense of humour) but not the average European or American. It is, though, why I awarded this attraction five stars and not just four. The commentary is not afraid to be a little risque in parts so square-bears had better decline the earphones - as should folk who don't appreciate toilet humour! Well done the actor who narrated the excellent commentary for bringing it to life and I probably would not have learnt so much if it had been read by someone with zero charisma in his voice or if the story had not been so entertaining.

Instead it was confusing at times in that numbers on the tape didn't align with numbers in the rooms, some rooms had multiple numbers and attempts to add humor and make light of horrible situations seemed inappropriate.

The building is obviously as it was but a new audio guide has been introduced. I believe it is trying to appeal to a more adolescent audience, a mixture of comedy and horrible histories. Perhaps it lost a little in the translation but we failed to find it either amusing or informative.

The sheer age of this wonderful building already makes exploring it a worthwhile thing to do, and well worth spending some time on. The audio guide ... Well, it's an acquired taste. Delivered by a well known Belgian comedian, its touch is lighthearted, and perhaps a little too much so. I found it self-congratulatory and less informative than it might have been. But then, there is so much else to see, in and on top of the castle. Switch it off if you're not impressed; you will lose very little. As the plaque at the entrance says: Come sniff some history.

Not many display items, some armour and weapons, and torture devices, but what really makes this tour is the audio guide, being done in a really humerous fashion, such a nice change, which we found really entertaining.

Review of Gravensteen Castle
Pending review

I was born in Gent and have mixed memories of growing up here. After 30 years living and working abroad I returned early 2017. My city has changed a lot over the years and for the better.
I now visit all the places my (grand)parents took us as kids or that we went to on school trips.

The Gravensteen castle brings back a lot of happy and excited memories. Listening my grandpa tell stories about the place and of how he remembered it when he was a young boy growing in the shadow of the castle was like living in a storybook. I now tell some of the stories to my own kids and you can see the twinkle in their eyes as they listen.

Since we are back we have paid several visits already. And for kids and history buffs this really is a must see when you visit Gent. Every visit reveals something new. Can't recommend this place enough.

Belgium,Jenn,Gravensteen,1.0,"If you're just after a nice walk around an old castle and not actually interested to learn anything about it would probably be a nice hour. I could imagine my neice and nephew would find some of the humour hilarious the audiotour is definitely aimed towards kids.

If though, you visited because you were actually really interested in learning about the old castle; the history, origins and really anything interesting/cool about it you can't find out easily (inc. about the previous inhabitants) then you're really out of luck with this audiotour...

There are no boards around to explain why there are trapdoors here and holes in walls there... there is nothing at all except for the guy on the audiotour telling you about how he ate gone off yoghurt and sicked it up, or describing the toilet holes in the floor in massive depth or that he and his wife bought a house nearby and have 2 kids.

Was so disappointed I looked into buying a private tour so I could go back the next day and do it with someone who really knows the castle and all its secrets but its sadly €80 minimum charge... and of course so last minute that they were booked up for the next week.

Really love castles but I've come away from this one knowing so little except what I saw with my own eyes (or was able to Google while there). I hope they improve it and if they do I'd like to come back to find out some more about this beautiful place.

The hilarious comments of comedian Wouter Deprez has you wondering if there is maybe MORE after the last number came up. It is a wonderful humoristic approach that makes people all over the site smile while listening to the comments, whilst still giving you the basics of the history of the site. And impressive it is.

It's a beautiful castle with a canal running down the side of it but far and away the best thing about it was the hilarious audio guide, you'll never hear another like it we think. It delivered the history in a funny and amusing way. We run history workshops for a living and we always think that using humour is one of the best ways to teach. It's an audio guide that will amuse adults and children alike but may not be for the uber serious who love plain facts and figures. We thought it was amazing and without it we would have been around the castle in a quarter of the time. It really brought the place to life and we could see other visitors were enjoying it too. We loved the wooden picture boards that accompanied the audio too. Well done Gravensteen, I wish more sites would do something similar. There's also a great little armour and weapon collection dating to various centuries, including a 15th/16th c pellet bow and the largest sword I've ever seen!

In this castle you can take an audio tour that explains every part and room of it. Which is actually very good so you can know what happened there and not just walk around without even know where are you standing !

It is not expensive and you if you are under 26 you receive a special discount.

For me the best thing are the escalators, you can actually feel like if you were centuries ago going up and down those ladders. There was a knight ready for pictures with you !!! And you can get some souvenirs at their in site shop.

I’ll definitely come back, this time with my family

A few things have changed--you now get a corny presentation over a media set/headphones--with quite a bit of off-color innuendo in there, surprisingly. And the torture chamber in the basement has been removed in favor of a much toned-down version elsewhere, which was disappointing. That was fascinating/gruesome last time I was there.

Being young teens, they were fascinated by the torture room! But overall you get a good idea of how this castle was used for so many purposes through the ages.

We visited Gravensteen Castle (The Castle of the Counts) with 6 adults, a 3 year old and a baby. The castle is not accessible for pushchairs so we used our baby sling which was perfect, there was plenty of information boards in several languages to explain the various rooms and parts of the castle.

We had to change plans at the last minute, and they were very helpful in accommodating us and changing our reservations. The hotel is in a perfect location, right across from the castle and a two-minute walk from the beautiful Graslei area with its magnificent town houses and many good restaurants. Also it is a ten-minute walk from the major sights. Also lots of restaurants and shops in the area. The hotel itself has a main building ( older, more traditional) and an annex, more recent, where we stayed. We had a standard room, which was a good size, had a very comfortable king-size bed, was air conditioned, and accessible by elevator. The bathroom was a good size, and the wifi worked no problem. The breakfast spread, which is a little pricy, was generously supplied with the usual plus hot scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage. All the staff we had contact with were helpful and pleasant. And, the parking is on the hotel grounds and very easily accessible, a great boon in the middle of the city. Highly recommended.

Negative: so much more could have been communicated about the historical context: original purpose of the castle (preventing Vikings navigating on the river Lys?), what did the Counts of Flanders do there except sleep and eat, were there any battles (there is a fragment of a 'goedendag"" in the museum but no mention of the nearby battle of the Golden Spurs), no reconstitution of medieval furniture (excellent example is the Dover castle in the UK), no details about how justice was administered when the castle was used as a prison, no explanation about the transformations of the castle when it was rebuilt, nearly nothing about the manufacture of cotton fabrics in Ghent, etc. Finally, torture chamber was either closed or removed during our visit.

One main room in the Castle showcases suits of armour, amazing cross bows and very old guns. The rest of the Castle is pretty austere, but this is in keeping with the age of the building.
I would agree that you need to.be careful of the open walks around the lower walls. Very easy to go over the side with a substantial fall. We spent about one hour here, quiet happy to photograph this ancient building and in wonder if those who walked these rooms before us. Views over Ghent are a bonus.

I paid for the cable car. 10 Euros per person was outrageous, but I paid because I didn't feel like walking up the 400+ steps at the time. The cable car ride itself only lasts for maybe 2 or 3 minutes. The 10 Euros also covers the cost of entrance to the citadel.

There is a café, giftshop, toilets (not free), and a small museum inside the citadel. Of course, you're afforded wonderful views from the top.

Arguably the main attraction in Dinant and when the weather is fine it's a rather pleasant experience.

The 17 Euro combo fee (for adults) to do all three was a great value. You can buy tickets at the top of the citadel where there is a free parking lot, or you can buy them right at the bottom of the steps/cable car that go right up to the citadel. The boat we took was leaving every half hour from Quay 3, a very reasonable walking distance (less than 10 minutes) along the riverfront from the Citadel. The 45 min. boat ride was enjoyable. We waited for a boat with tables available on top. A boat worker took our order and brought our drinks to us.

For our visit, we were lucky and found parking on the street that was 5 euros for five hours. There are some public parking garages downtown as well. Because of COVID-19 the citadel tour is self guided. We were happy to go at our own pace and there were lots of signs and explanations in English.

So I went to the entrance office and asked if they could simply open the exit fate to allow us entrance.

The man said that to go to the cafe we all had to pay € 10 per person!

Belgium,Omkar0007,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"Recently, I visited Dinant (famous city in Belgium, birthplace of saxophone inventor Adolphe Sax).
Famous spot/things-to-do: Collegiate Church of Notre Dame de Dinant, Citadel of Dinant, Meuse River, Kayaking.
I would not explain these spots in detail as you can GOOGLE it.

1) The city offers great view from the citadel along with some creative setup created to explain how the citadel was used in the former century (Maximum 2 hours).
2) The city is on the banks of the River Meuse where you can enjoy your food with a variety of cuisines available at the restaurants. You can also grab your food and enjoy it walking along the banks of the river.
3) At the entry of the Citadel you have an option to purchase a ticket costing about 10 Euros including the entry to the Citadel and the cable car. You can also purchase a ticket worth 17 Euros which additionally just includes a boat ride in the Meuse River. (I would not recommend this boat ride if you are planning for enjoying Kayak). You surely save 7 Euros.
3) After having visited these spots and with your tummy full you can walk down the road for about 3.5 kms to Dinant Evasion office. I personally recommend this walk along the river.
4) At the Dinant Evasion office, you can purchase the tickets on site or I would highly suggest to book your tickets online as during the holidays, this place can get crowdy and you wont get any Kayak available.
5) Kayaking is available in 2 options- 12 km and 21 km. If you are really really really fit then only opt for the 21 km option otherwise my personal opinion is that you select 12 km. This 12 km Kayak trip starts off at a different location but you have shuttle going to that spot at regular intervals from the Dinant Evasion office.
Tip- When you are making your reservation for the Kayak trip it provides you with several Kayak options. Don't look at the money difference, always select the COMFI-KAYAK. Its blue in color with a comfortable seat. This seems to be an easy journey but trust me at the end you shall be fully exhausted if you dont have a good comfortable Kayak.

Belgium,George K,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"This was our second visit to the Citadel, the first one being some years ago. Arriving at the top by cable car just after 11 am, we narrowly missed a guided tour (most rooms are only accessible by tour), but the next one was apparently scheduled at 11.30. 11.30 came and went and then a rather puzzled guide appeared and changed the time to 12.00 - much to the annoyance of the waiting visitors.

Eventually a tour began and when we said that we were British the guide simply handed us a leaflet in English describing the major points of the citadel. He then proceeded to talk in French and summed up in Flemish. No English, although there were also Americans as well as ourselves on the tour. He rambled on at great length and it became obvious that many of the 'locals' were becoming bored.

Fortunately a young Dutch couple offered to translate for us and along with what we picked up, we understood the main points. Later a Belgian lady expressed her annoyance that he didn't speak English and said that he showed the Belgians in a bad light.

Probably our bad luck to get that guide as on the previous occasion, the guide made sure of the visitors nationalities and spoke in four languages.

So, it's a fascinating place with a commanding view over the town. Thoroughly recommend it, but make sure that the guide will speak your language.

Belgium,Traveler332829,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"There is very little at the top to see unless you go on the guided tour. It wasn’t even possible to see the excellent views without the guide. This may have been fine if we could have understood him. We were given an explanation sheet in English which took 5 minutes to read yet the tour lasted an hour and a half - we were losing the will to live! It was cold, the exhibitions were poor and there was no possibility of looking around by ourselves. This was not explained before entry otherwise we would have given this a miss. I have to say the guide seemed enthusiastic and the French and Dutch speakers seemed happy with the experience.

Belgium,kp5555,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"We took the cable car up to the citadel from the town today and, having read other reviews on this site, decided to wait 35 minutes for the next guided tour. It was totally worth it. We had Joseph who was a fantastic guide who moved effortlessly from French to Dutch/Flemish to English to cater for the languages spoken by our group. He was very funny and made a particular effort to involve the children in the group. He explained things more vividly than reading a leaflet could ever do, and his guiding included pointing out several buildings that could be seen from the viewpoint and also explaining which is the best Belgian beer (on our way home we bought the one he had recommended and I'm not sure I agree...). All in all a very worthwhile and entertaining trip. (The guided tour is included in the entry price so there really is no reason not to do one.)

Belgium,Sarah W,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Firstly it’s really reasonable to get in - €35 for the 4 of us as the kids were considered adults and it included use of the cable car. Hubby doesn’t like heights so this was definitely not his favourite bit but I loved it. The views over Dinant are amazing.

We went to the self service cafe. Food was reasonable for a quick snack; two hamburgers, a panini and a large chips for €15. However the amount of wasps around was awful. I’d advise to buy the food and move well away from the cafe area.

The citadel is fascinating. You go into the tunnel and turn left into the 1914 Exhibition. It’s really worth the visit. Cool tunnels house the exhibits and take you through the story of the invasion of Dinant in the period of a few days. Very sad story but well presented. There was information in English, French, German and Flemish/Dutch which was so helpful.

We went further into the main courtyard and there were other things to look at. There is little information in one room so I have no clue what we were looking at and lost interest quickly. There is a small cafe here and a shop although the shop has very little variety.

Some areas looked to be closed off except to larger groups. This includes the top level which I’d have liked to see.

All in all well worth the money and recommended. Interesting enough for teens not to moan and want to be on their phones!

We are coming back to visit the town as the citadel took more time than we anticipated.

Belgium,high_low73,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"The Citadel of Dinant overlooks Dinant from its cliff. The Citadel you see today was built during the Dutch occupation in the early 1800s, the French destroyed an earlier fortification (build in 1051 and rebuilt in 1530) in 1703. To visit the Citadel, you can take a cable lift located next to the cathedral or climb 420 stairs, your choice.

We took the cable car, but the stairs would be just as good. The views are not a must do.The citadel is not that large, but you can have a guided tour for free that will enhance the experience. Still it's small, and not that informative. The surrounding area is not that big, but includes a playground, restaurants and a plane put up for exhibition. There is also a souvenir shop inside the citadel.

Highlight of the visit is the 1914 exhibition. It is moving and will tell you the story of the atrocities Dinant had to suffer during WWI. Very moving experience.

Belgium,annett2980,Citadelle de Dinant,2.0,"Unlike other citadels in Belgium, you are obliged to pay an entrance fee here and cannot simply stroll around on your own. There is, however, a short cable car ride and an optional boat trip included in the price, so I'd personally say the fee is justified (no reductions for students, though!). The view from the top is stunning and the boat ride was quite relaxed and fun, but I wasn't too impressed with the organisation once you get to the heart of the citadel. At the ticket office, you don't get any information about what to expect and once you are up, there is a map, but no signs with further information, so I just walked around a bit. The first room was actually labelled ""4"" and I only later figured out where the other stops were supposed to be. However, room 3 was closed off and and overall, the exhibition was okay, but not worth the entrance fee alone. What really bothered me though is that I only later learned about the possibility to do a tour - I'm assuming with the lady who walked around asking people (in French) whether they spoke French. I don't, so I said no and she just walked past. I had no clue what she wanted from me and I'm a bit disappointed I apparently missed the opportunity to get some guidance up there. Also, a major part of the citadel was closed off to visitors, including the place where you would have gotten the most stunning view over the river - again I'm guessing that the tour actually takes you there, because I later saw people from down below. What also bugged me is the fact that you have to pay for the restrooms up there - with a whopping price between 9,50€ and 16€, you'd expect to at least get a free toilet. So overall, I was quite disappointed and left very unsatisfied, though with a bunch of very pretty pictures.

Belgium,Roots2Wings,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"This is arguably the top attraction of Dinant, if you leave the Saxophones aside & it will not fail to impress you. As a citadel, it fairs barely average but considering the history, it is interesting. The guided tour is very good and takes your through the places explaining the history for about an hour. For me, the best part was the view of Dinant from the top. The parking space is ample & free. You can buy the tickets at the gate (I recommend the combo ticket which offers you entry + cable car return journey + a 45 minute boat ride in the river). Cable Car (funicular) ride is 2 minutes only, with an option to go free if you can climb 400 stairs or drive your car (be aware of line ups during peak times and expect one way roads). After the entrance, there is a small eetcafe, toilets (50 cents) and children's play area with an old fighter plane & anti-aircraft gun at display. A good place to sit & relax. Citadel & Cable Car - both are child buggy friendly.

Just a couple of posters with a little text, a long hallway with some lights that projects dates on the floor but doesn't explain them, a dark room with some projected shadows of soldiers en no sound effects that are supposed to let you experience the feeling of being in the middle of the action (to me it was just a dark room). Then another hallway with a room with a guillotine, a table used to cut off hands and a treasure chest with a special locking mechanism, then a couple of cells with dummies in them that look 60 years old sitting on e bad with a stool next to them. Last hallway contains some prints of historical paintings that the guide talks about for half an hour. Then there is a room that is slanted so you feel out of balance, very kitsch, that you can only visit with the guide. The shop and the cafeteria are old and shabby. The cable car is decades old and tends to break down. It is getting a major overhaul in 2019, though.
In short, avoid, it is a waste of time.

The car park is accessed from behind the Citadelle, and the route rounds seems long, but is sign-posted all the way.

Access to the Citadelle itself is not cheap, however a combined ticket to offer a ride on the cable car to the town centre and a boat trip can be purchased in one, and this softens the overall cost.

The fort is interesting and historically quite moving - focusing on the first world war, and the movement of the German troops.

The view from the Citadelle is impressive, and from a height the river looks inviting.

As an alternative to the cable car - there is a route with over 400 (steep) steps from the town to the Citadelle - going up is not for the faint hearted.

Belgium,NickyP,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Dinant is a stunning little town and well worth a visit if you are in Belgium. We had seen a leaflet with information about combination tickets.... €14 for a 45min cruise, cable car up to and entrance into the Citadel. If you wanted to extend your cruise to a 2 hour trip then the combined ticket costs €18. Unfortunately the latter was unavailable on the day we visited for some reason so we bought the €14 tickets from a desk on the riverside. The cruise was beautiful, some guided information given out on the tannoy, including in English.

We then went to the entrance at the bottom of the cable car to the Citadel. The lady behind the cash desk took our tickets from us and then gave us a receipt and we went on our way. I wish I had known that she was also supposed to give us a map with information as to where you are and aren’t allowed to go without a guide - and also that there are guided tours! We had absolutely no idea that we had missed out on a big chunk of the visit until I came to write this review and read all the others. It seems that this happens fairly frequently too - so if you are planning a visit make sure you ask about the tour!

The cable car ride up was quick and easy and saved walking up the 408 steps to the top! The part of the Citadel that we visited on our own was well maintained with some good information and clever displays and the views from the top were absolutely stunning.

All in all it was good value, a lovely afternoon out and we have some beautiful pictures as a reminder of our visit. My only gripe is the fact that we didn’t receive all of the information that we should have done which is a great shame

Belgium,Karen T,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"To avoid taking the tramway up to the Citadelle, we took a taxi from our hotel (Ibis), which cost a little more than 10 E. It was worth it not to be crammed into a little cage and being shot and shaken up a rugged clip, to dangle in the air. Well, that's my problem, but I wasn't going to even try the thing. Entering from the parking lot up above was brilliant, and we managed to secure a brochure in English, though I was prepared to translate from our French guide's lovely commentary for my husband. She only knew a few words of English, but we made it through okay until.... until.... after we spent a bunch of time looking at the nice collection of fire arms from over the centuries, we walked through a door that showed that no one who was disabled or in a pram should venture through. That should have been my warning, but once we were through the portal, I heard the door click behind us, and we were suddenly in a dark space with the sounds of automatic weapons going off all around us, as we filed, way too slowly, through the museum's replica of a WWI trench, complete with sandbags and models of soldiers in gas masks. I had to keep telling myself 'This is just a building and everything is fake,"" but the walls moved in on me, and I longed to rush ahead, pushing the people taking video of every little thing out of my way. I looked down and counted the wooden planks in the floor as we trudged through. Yes, it's a good lesson for all, to know what war was like, and to experience something horrible in memory of the terrible, terrible war, but I think it would have been nice to know that if one has a fear of being in small places in the dark, this was probably not an appropriate adventure. And even though we eventually found our way out of it, the next bit was confoundingly difficultt for this old lady (72 yrs), as we found ourselves walking at angles through a cave of illusions, hanging on for dear life, deep in some kind of cavern until, finally, we exited near an exit and daylight. It took about half an hour to recover from the vertigo caused by the last leg of the tour, but to be honest, I can say it wasn't THAT BAD, once it was over. I just wish I had known it was going to be like that, and I want everyone to know, just in case they're Claustrophobes like me.

But as such, the tour guide we had, Anne-Marie, made the 5 of us English speakers feel totally welcome, explained what she was talking about in the different languages, and made us feel really welcome.

It turned out to be an interesting and informative experience. On a very hot day I eschewed the steps up to the top in favour of the small cable car. Slightly alarming but quick and easy. Once at the top. I was not yet sure this would be anything other than a view! And what a view. You rise above the cathedral, itself an imposing structure, and see the river and the land beyond. On a hot, sunny day the breeze was a welcome extra.

This commemorates the time in the August of that year when the Germans stormed the city and killed many, many innocent civilians indiscriminately and the exhibition relives this terrible time and gives a real sense of the horror and loss in just 3 weeks one August. There are many different facets to this part of the exhibition, so do visit this part. I gained a real understanding of that moment in history.The real value is the free guided tour which while only in French or Dutch, offers an english leaflet and I understood enough French to understand some of what was said! The tour takes you to part of the citadel which you cannot reach alone including a higher viewpoint. It is stunning. An amusing part of the tour at the end is the trench experience which might sound like an odd thing to say, but they have created an interactive experience where the structure is tilted so you have the experince of leaning backwards in order to stay upright! In fact that bit should come with a warning as the steps down are very uneven and awkward and if you have isues with balance or slight mobility issues, this wil be alarming and uncomfortable.
So my advice is to igbore how unfriendly it looks from the ground, there is cafe and playarea too and lots of people with dogs!

Belgium,eeyorelover,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Did the combined citadel and boat trip, and the dog was allowed everywhere in the citadel and on the boat.
We did the guided tour, and we weren't expecting to hear the tour in English, but have a leaflet, but our guide did the tour in three languages and was brilliant. Taking the tour is a must as you go to places you can only see in the tour.
The cable car up and down is also nice as wouldn't have fancied walking up the stairs.
The boat trip was also nice although the boats used for this tour are not super modern, but they have a bar on and it's a nice way to pass an hour. Also not too crowded when we went.
This is a must see if in dinant.

Belgium,timmiewh,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"While the citadel is very impressive, the value comes from the guided tours which are in either French or Dutch, with only some leaflets for people who don't speak these languages. The grounds that are open to all were interesting and the view is beautiful. The citadel pass can combine with a cable car to the city/citadel and a 45 minute boat tour down the river which was better value for money than buying individually.",Jul 2018
Belgium,GuppeC,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"One suggestion, go for the combo ticket: Boat trip, Citadel and the Teleferique. The cable cars you can use if you just like to, or if you don't feel like climbing 408 stairs.
My son never used a cable car before so that was a great excuse. The citadel of course is the main piece of the visit, 100 metre above the river. You get great views over the surrounding area.
Another suggestion: take the guide, it is even free and the guy is crazy, in a positive way. He splits the groups and makes the tour interactive, you play, you learn and you get to visit the places you otherwise do not see. Really that guy made the hour fly by and you learn about the history of the citadel, of Dinant and a lot more
My son is 5 years old and that age keeping their attention for the whole duration, great!
After your visit to the citadel, you can have a boat trip and see the rest of the surroudings from the water.

Belgium,Sunil M,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"This small town of Belgium is a great place to be transported back to the times when civilization was few and wars were being fought. It is a wonderful place to experience history and feel the ambience of old world Europe. It is also the birthplace of the inventor of the Saxophone. The entry to the town demonstrates this suitably by placing huge saxophones on its footpaths. It has a Saxophone museum in case you are interested in its history. The fort above the Citadelle was a slice from the past with well maintained interiors and a lovely view of the town of Dinant. It takes a short ride by cable car or a steep climb of 400 steps to reach the top. It has a breathtaking view and one can just sit there by the restaurant with a cup of coffee or tea and watch the view. It also has a lovely play area for kids who get bored by history, so one can explore the fort while the kids play. A must visit town if you are in Brussels as it is just 2 and half hours train ride from Brussels central. Once can just go in the morning and be back by evening. The citadelle entry also includes a ferry ride with a guide and is worth the money.

Belgium,Fodinette,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"We drove up tp the Citadelle to take advantage of the free parking. We then took the cable car down and had a look around plus lunch. We did a boat ride but not sure it was a good use of our time.
However after taking the cable car back up, we really enjoyed looking around the Citadelle. Firstly make sure you wander through all the rooms and halls off the entrance hall as there are some hidden gems. Find out when the next tour starts and make sure you go on it. Our guide was Joseph and he was AMAZING! He spoke French, Dutch and English so the majority in the large group were well catered for. On top of that he was very entertaining, especially for the kids who he made VIPs and really brought the history to life for them. We explored the roped off areas with the tour and as it was included in the price were really impressed. The views of Dinant were great. Very very enjoyable!

Belgium,Fondue4two,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"The best part of this place is the ample parking. Of course you then have to pay to ride the cable car down to town but that is ok.

The citadel itself is light on sights and it appears mostly closed. The guide booklet is almost worthless since there is no map. Sections appear to be closed - not sure if you need to be on a guided tour to see those. We happened to see a group exit one of these areas and so we scooted in and saw the secret areas which includes the best view from the citadel down to the river.

My advice if you go is to ignore the chain that closes of the section to stop 4.

Belgium,98Young,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"The Citadel has a lot of history - we found it very interesting and good value for money. We parked in the free car park at the top, walked down the steps into Dinant for a look around and then went back up on the cable car. The views from the top are amazing. Most of the Citadel is only accessible as part of a guided tour - these are not in English and we were given a leaflet which mostly explained the history rather than what we were looking at in each part of the Citadel. The French tour we were on sounded rather more informative and entertaining. It is worth doing though as it is difficult to sneak through without being with a tour guide. The recreation of the WWI trench and bunker were very well done but, be warned, this part of the tour will surprise you.

Belgium,LaChatNoir,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"We opted to hike the 408 steps to the top, you pay either way. And there were exactly 408 by my count. Plenty of places to stop and rest a bit along the way. To see the most interesting parts of the Citadel itself, you must go with a guide. Included in the price of your ticket. Ours spoke just enough English to be able to hand us an English language brochure, which didn’t seem to ever match up with anything she was telling everyone else. She must have been a good guide, though. Cause they were laughing.

About halfway through I noticed a Spanish speaking family duck ahead and continue on the tour on their own. The guide made a feeble attempt to call them back. But they were successful in their escape. So my husband and I scampered along quickly once we got to the barracks section. Which meant we explored the recreated war trench (cool!) and sideways room (even cooler, but not sure what it’s meant to imply, it was very topsy turvy and disorienting, TBH I felt a little sick to my stomach for a moment, but it passes quickly. Then we were on our own to explore the dungeons area and headed back down on the tram to have that experience.

The entry fee is about 10 euro for an adult and something less for a kid (including telepherique). We have bought a ticket to the Disney sand sculptures but couldn't find were to watch these sculptures. From others we heard it was a bit disappointing.
The Citadelle is situated at a great spot. The museum and the guided tour is ok. Not really great but average. Great to listen, read and experience the history of the Citadelle. This area has a huge history (WO1 and WO2). IT is Nice how they try to make it within reach of the kids. Everything in different languages. They are still restoration some things so it is under construction. The weather was to poor to play in the playground but in the summer this will be a great place for the small kids. Hope there will be something for the parents too.
Taking the stairs or ""le telepherique"", or both it is good value for money. Nice place to spend some hours. The restaurant was really small so we didn't enter.

3 Ways Going Up:
1. the first two ways are from the valley gate which located just behind the Church of Our Lady (Collegiale Notre-Dame). when you see the tower of the church then you just find the gate. visitor can go up by cable car; and another alternative on foot with 408 steps.
2. another access is by car till on top parking area, just in front of the on top gate ticket box. unlike in the city valley area, the on top parking is free. so if you use car, you don’t have to purchase the ticket from the valley gate, you can purchase it when you reach on top gate. the web of this citadel clearly indicates which road reaching to the on top parking; and it is very easy to find as there are clear road sign in each turn till the parking.

on top the citadel, visitor can also enjoy drinks and some bites while viewing the city and its surrounding. there is also small playground area just in front of the café, so it is also good place for kids.

the citadel itself was built in 1051 to monitor its surrounding, especially the Meuse valley during the ruling of Prince-Bishopric of Liège,. the last Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold destroyed the citadel in 1466 and later was renovated during the occupation of France troops under its leader Louis XIV. Alas, it was destroyed again, and in 1800s the Dutch rebuilt the ruin. Belgians also occupied the citadel during their fight for independence.

The brief cable-car ride to the top - it’s included in the ticket but you can walk up around 400 steps instead if you prefer - gives fine views and takes you right to the front door.

There is a large playground for children at the top of the cable car, as well as a small cafe, while inside the Citadel itself there are numerous rooms to explore and panels describing the history of the building and the town.

The most interesting were the tunnels describing the events of August 1914, when Dinant was the scene of fighting between the Germans the Allies in the early days of the First World War. Learning about the tragedies and the roles of the likes of Charles de Gaulle gives a better understanding of the town as a whole.

We just missed the last tour with a guide. Without a guide you are not allowed to visit the restricted areas. I think you should see everything with the guide, otherwise it is more sightseeing. And the sight is stunning. You should walk the 408!!! Steps down ( or up if you're Well trained) and you can come up (or down) with a lift.

The citadel itself showed an impressive fortress, thick walls, big canons. It is a nice piece of history and I hope it Will be preserved well.

Belgium,jontyg543,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Thank you Trip Advisor reviewers for your advice. We followed it and it helped massively.

You can park free at the top of the hill next to the citadel.

We opted for the citadel, cable car and boat package, which was about 50 Euros for 5 (2 adults and 3 kids)

Do take the tour of the citadel, rather than walk around it alone, because they take you to places you don't get to unless you are on a tour. They give you a leaflet in English to read as you walk around, which is OK.

The cable car is short and sweet.

We did a boat trip as well. It wasn't mind blowing but enough fun to help the day along.

The church in town is awe inspiring - huge!

Our experience of eating in town was VERY poor. It was, to be honest, a rip off. However, we may have chosen poorly.

That said, it was a fun day.

Belgium,Christiaan Slabbert,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"I visited the citadel after doing a canal cruise; a combo ticket to do both saved me €2.50. You can buy tickets next to the canal (picture attached) or at the citadel itself.

For the fit, over 400 steps await to lead you to the top, but I opted to take the funicular instead. At the top, I only waited about 15 minutes for a guided tour to start, but was surprised that guided tours are only offered in French and Dutch (simultaneously). As visitors are not allowed to roam around by themselves, I felt really sorry for people who were stuck in a tour they didn't understand. Our guide was happy to do a short discussion in English at two pit stops, but most of the tour was lost to a majority of people in the group. The guide was very knowledgeable, though, but it was tiring to listen to the same thing twice (the guide first said something in French and then repeated it in Dutch); it made a lot of people in the group agitated and I think made the tour longer than what it could actually be. Despite tours only being offered in French and Dutch, information panels in German and English are offered at certain spots, and the guide has information leaflets in other languages, including Spanish and Portuguese.

The citadel itself was very interesting – and the lookout point, the main attraction that everyone goes there for, was worth the wait. The most interesting part was at the very end, the bunker-like WW1 structure.

The history of the citadel was explained by the excellent tour guide who delivered his tour in Dutch, however, he was also very happy to provide some additional English commentary as my Dutch is fairly basic (I was lucky as the busier tour times were earlier in the day).

My young children enjoyed the trip and as Dinant and took great pleasure in watching me attempt to eat one of the local delicacies a 'couque de Dinant' which had me in fear of losing some teeth !

Its not worth to pay entrance if you are interested in the citadelle, because there is nothing interesting to see at all. Old wall and bricks, that's all.

The view on the other hand is great. Not spectacular, just great. If you are willing to pay I think it was 8 Euro, then do it.

The views from the top offer a great overview of the valley.

We managed to join a tour about half way through - which turned out to be quite lucky - as the first part of the tour might not have been suitable for my 8 year old son with it being a little gruesome. Our guide was really good - seemingly able to seamlessly switch between French, German, Dutch and English. He paid special attention to our son - and made him very involved.

We enjoyed having frites on the terrace before heading down. I decided to take the (many) stairs. I would recommend this - unless you get vertigo easily.

We combined this with the boat trip which was also a nice way to spend an hour.

He knew a lot and had a very good and humorous way of telling it. He had quite a difficult task: he gave the tour in French, Dutch and English. And by the sound of the laughter, all three were equally funny.

Then we took the ride down with the gondola. Short, but especially our three yo son loved it. We went on the 45 min boat tour. It was a cold day and it was very warm inside, which was wonderful. It was a nice short trip. The tour was guided but I must honestly say I didn't pay attention, I was too busy chatting and entertaining our toddler.

There is a nice sand sculpture exhibition, and an exposition about the events in World War II, when the Germans committed serious atrocities against the civilian population. The guided tour gives an overview of the history of the citadel, and I think it is a must if you want to see the place. Besides weaponry and rooms such as the bakery, there is one quite peculiar item. That is the carriage used by one of Louis XIV's mistresses to traverse the country during the siege of Namur.

One can visit the citadel in many ways. For the more sporty visitors there is a stairway in the cliffs to go up from the town right into the fortress, dating from 1577. There's also a funicular. Or one can also drive al the way and enter there the citadel from the backside.

Not only the historical scenery is nice, the great panoramic view on the beautiful town of Dinant and the Maas river is a real plus.

Enjoy the view from the top, spectacular! There is now a very interactive museum display within the Citadel, and surround sound of combat takes you back to WWI and the battle of Dinant, a battle that I nor my kids were familiar with.

I especially would like to talk about the ""La Citadelle"" which is a mountain, not very high, but with an amazing view of the whole city. After having walked a lot, I stopped on the top to see the wonderful panorama and to eat something in a really particular restaurant, the food was not too bad. I also visited an abandoned castle, and from there there was a fantastic view better then the top of the mountain, but be careful because it's really hard to reach it!

To begin with, the citadel per se is not very well preserved. On the exterior, many of the sculptures and carvings have gone missing. Inside, there is indeed a wall of majestic & beautiful stained glass. The original has been destroyed in the war; still we’re awed by this reconstruction. But on the other 2 sides were just rather plain-looking glass windows.

We drove to the top of the cliff, intending to see the wall. But the entrance fee per se cost 8.5 Euro even without the cable car ride. Utterly exorbitant and we turned away.

I regret to say that had we known these beforehand, we probably would not have made the trip to Dinant at all….

Unfortunately, for some reason the tour was available only in French and even knowing a little bit of French, it was quite difficult to get interested. Regardless of that, this is a must do. Lots and lots of information that I really enjoyed reading and very cool reenactments to feel as in the moment of battle.",Aug 2016
Belgium,Yiannaki-and-PP,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"We took the cable car up to the citadel and a guided tour was included. The guide was marvellous. She gave the tour in 3 languages but managed to keep everyone interested. The museum and exhibits in the citadel are very interesting telling of Belgium's entrance in to WWI as well as history of much earlier battles and life of soldiers in the fortress. One of the most interesting exhibits was a recreated WWI trench and a collapsed shelter with an uneven floor, which, when walking through, was very disorienting. The views over Meuse valley and the entire region from the citadel were amazing. Well worth a visit.

You cannot visit this without a guide, who only speaks French (and dutch but this was just a summary of what he said in French, I know this because I understand both). There was somebody who spoke English in our group but he didn't even pay any attention to that.
You have to follow a too big group hoping you can actually hear the explaination (if you understand French).
On the positieve note, it is pretty and you can get some cool views from this place, but not worth the money.

Belgium,Mark D,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Nice trip up the hill, you can go by foot on the stairs, or by cablecar (we did the last :).

The citadelle is built on a rock at the river Meuse in the ancient days, very old buildings but most spectecular are the view over the city Dinant and the river.

Nice museum with a funny tourguide (we had a bi-lingual tour in Dutch and French, not sure if they have English tours, but the guide answers questions in English).

Nice to see attraction if you are in that area.

At the top the views are striking. There are toilets, a cafe and a playground with plenty of picnic places. Following the arrows into the Citadel provides access to the fortress. Some excellent story boards and interactive displays engage the visitor in the battles fought there. These were presented in from languages which was appreciated. The cobblestones are very uneven so wear good shoes. It cost $8.50 for the cable car and access to the Citadel. The steps option is steep and there are about 300+ steps. The Citadel is worth a visit.

I was already just happy to be there, had enjoyed the train journey down and was ready to enjoy a tremendous day in Dinant. However I was so disappointed in the Citadelle Tour. It started so well the cable car trip was great the walk and view from the top spectacular. Then I walked into the Citadelle itself and was impressed by the view and displays and went to the desk to enquire about the tour.They made no attempt to talk English at all, when I asked if there was an English tour they informed me it was in Dutch and French. I have no problem with that, as these are the predominant languages in the area, but if you want to promote your tourism then you need to think about some form of English, even if its a written handout? I went with the tour despite not understanding a word and think it would have been enjoyable, the displays and views are really good and the little English I did find was interesting. I would like to compliment the Lady at the entrance as she was extremely helpful and went out of her way to help and explain everything I asked about, however her colleagues above, had a lot to be desired.

The tour allows you access to sites that are locked for individuals who are not on tours. There is not an extra charge for the tour and it is just a matter of timing. The tour was primarily in French but upon request, comments were made in English. On the tour, you get closer to the cannons and get to see the weapons displays. You also get to experience this crazy and uneven stairwell that is like an amusement park ride. Enjoy the views!",Aug 2016
Belgium,Elaine J,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Car park at the Citadel was difficult to find because of road works and the annual fair made driving chaos. We opted to park a little way out, walk and take the cable car. The cable car was an experience for the kids. The panoramic views are fantastic and entry price for the Citadel and return cable car seemed quite reasonable for a family of five at 35 euros. The only down side was that no map is issued when you purchase your ticket. Also, most of the Citadel is only accessible by waiting for a guided tour (a clock displaying the next tour time is outside the small bar/cafe). Unfortunately our tour was only in French. On a more positive note, the guide spoke slowly so we could understand some of the tour. Some areas have 4 language displays. The most interesting part of the tour was the mock trenches you navigate through. If you don't take the guided tour then you will miss most of what there is to see.
Also of great interest is the free self guided tour giving a history of Dinant in WW2. Well worth a visit.

Belgium,wvdm2016,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"The citadel of Dinant commands wonderful views of the city, the river Meuse, and the surrounding landscape. But unfortunately, the fortifications can only be visited with a guided tour, and we found that to be something of a circus attraction. The guide loves to hear himself and has an interactive style that is very crude. For kids it may be OK, and I have nothing against this, but for a reasonably educated and civilized person it is an affront. If you don't take the guided tour you will miss out on some stunning views, but most of the views can be had from the area close to the playground.
The great advantage of going to the citadel and taking the entrance fee is FREE PARKING and FREE CABLECAR to the city. This is much better than parking in the city and going up by cablecar.

Fortunately a Belgium gentleman informed us that a guided tour starts every 30 min or so, and takes you into parts that are not freely accessible.The girls in the ticket office had failed to explain this.
We joined a tour but the guide only spoke in French or Dutch, but she did give us a leaflet in English. The tour was OK, but the displays were a little amateurish compared to National Trust properties.
There is an option to do the Citadel plus a River cruise, personally, I think the River Cruise would have been more interesting.

It is there every hour, so check the timing of the guided tour. The tour will give you a lot of information about the castle , the world war and the contribution of the people of Dinant in the world war. A guided tour is a must to understand the place.

Towards the end of the guided tour you have to pass through a place which was bombarded during the world war and there is gravitational force there which pulls you toward the center, and when you walk through that passage you actually feel you are being pulled to one side.

The view from the top is just stunning and photograph enthusiasts will just love it.

The view is the best you will find of the area & that's nice. The cablecar to the top is also ricket-y and fun for a few moments. However once you get up there, prepare to be underwhelmed. I didn't see anything about a guided tour but if that were available, I might say give it a shot. Without a guide, you really wander through a few static displays of life a few centuries ago without any context or content. It definitely looks like the exhibits haven't been cleaned in a few years. It appears that the biggest claim to fame for this place was an unfortunate event in WWI and it was certainly catastrophic for the area. However I would also have enjoyed to learn more about the many years before that for this structure.
Perhaps the most confounding thing here is what I would call a fun-house room that you walk through as you finish the static displays and the room is pretty dark and tilted at a 30+ degree angle. Again if there were context for this it might have struck a chord with me, but it didn't.

They provide an excellent WWI historical narrative at the beginning of the fort so take the time and review it.

A tip. Take the cable car up to the Citadel. The steps are a real challenge to climb, easy to come down. There's a café with toilets at the top near the cable car station. Surprisingly with a Meteor aircraft on display in the grounds. There's another café inside the Citadel walls.

The citadel itself is full of history. The majority of the exhibits deal with the suffering of Dinant's inhabitants at the hands of the Germans. Many were massacred, and the town's historic buildings reduced to rubble

The views over the river and town are stunning. The church below the citadel is also worth popping in for a bit more history, and impressive stained glass windows.

Belgium,JW S,Citadelle de Dinant,2.0,"While we were staying in a lovely little castle close to Aye, we decided to make a day trip to Dinant, a town that has been there since, at least, the Middle Ages. The town has a few interesting sites to visit, like the house of Adolphe Sax, the inventor of the saxophone, or the Leffe Museum/brewery. But most visible and present is the citadel on top of the hill. It towers over the town and looks very impressive. To go there from the city one needs to either climb stairs, almost 500 steps, or one can take a cable car. The citadel was our choice of site-see activity for the day. We choose to climb up and descend via the stairs. Good for our daily exercise. If one has vertigo, the way down can better be done by cable car. The citadel itself has quite a history but the way that is being presented is poor. We walked around for 10 minutes before we decided to descend. This was also due to the fact that the citadel was under construction and part of it was closed for the public. One could only see the materials and tools that were left, scattered across the renovation area. It looked messy. For me it scores good on the view one has over the river and town below. But for the presentation it gets a 'far-below-average'. But the entrance fee was not worth the visit. We may have picked the wrong site to visit, but then again, the rest of Dinant was quite boring and a bit dirty as well. Not sure I would visit it again.

There are tours with guides that take you around the citadel explaining the history and much more. But it's a pity you can't walk around freely everywhere (only in certain areas) without the guide, because the tour is a bit rushed for my taste.
The best bit is the simulation of a trench and of a collapsed shelter, where everything is shifted 30 degrees.
A multimedial exhibition also talks about the 1914 war fights in Dinant and the survivals stories.",Dec 2015

It was quite the view from the top looking over the city, river and down on the Notre Dame Cathedral below.",Nov 2015
Belgium,Russell G,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"Visited this place in 1987 and had forgotten how dull it was. My son was keen to get an idea of the history and connections with the two World Wars. That was okay but the tour was a waste of time again plenty of English speakers on the tour but just given a printed sheet to read. The displays have seen better days, in fact little change from 1987 that I could remember. Poor service at the cafe, view was nice mind you.
Save your money and do something else.
In fact the whole town seems to be in decline, lots of empty shops and a down at heel feel.

The view of the town from the citadel was spectacular. A coffee shop beside the main bridge had very good coffee. You can also relax sitting on the benches along the river side.

The citadel itself is rather small, compared to other castles and fortifications in the area. Another construction of Vauban, the foremost military engineer of his age, though later destroyed and rebuilt by the Dutch. Tour will take less than an hour and there isn't really that much to see.

Belgium,Chris K,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Upon turning up at the ticket office a sign indicated you could buy a ticket for the citadel along with a 45 min boat trip for €14 each - something we were planning anyway. You can either walk up the steps to the citadel or take the cable car.
Upon getting to the top there is a café, a toilet block and an old jet plane. When we got there the café was closed the toilets were in a poor state of repair and tatty.
Making your way through to the main court yard numbered signs are scattered around to prompt you to read the little map that you get with your tickets. The view's over the town and river are very good. It will be great on a clear day. Some of the displays could do with a bit of modernisation but the others are good especially the trench display and down through the tunnel walking on a slant - feels like your drunk. The information contained in the 1st world war display was also good.
In all a good place to visit with some good things for kids around the age of 6+.

So you can go by your own, but be close to the French or Flemish speaking group. Not try all tours by time only. You have to go with the group but read your English brochure. Very interesting museum about battle during First world war. Don't miss view from the top. Great view. You can have a snack in the Citadel restaurant, but we decided to eat in the town.

Drove up to the citadel which was the highlight of the city. Parking was free. The entry ticket to the citadel is not so expensive, but then again it is not very big. As a history buff I thought the WWI exhibition was excellent. There was also a free tour conducted by a very nice guide in French and Dutch, but with information pamphlets in other languages available. The sloping room (which had been hit by a bomb) was a fun way to end the tour! And of course, stunning views of the city and river from the top. Disappointing that they charged for toilets though.

Belgium,serash,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Seriously, the scenery is breathtaking. We did enjoy a very lovely afternoon there. According to our experience, each of us has to buy a ticket for the citadel. It's funny though cause the ticket is for citadel itself. It doesnt matter you walk or take the cable car. So you dont need to pay extra for taking the cable car. BTW, the cable car is completedly automatic (no staffs help us there )and moves kind of fast. It is very different from i have taken before.
We hightly suggest people should spend time with their tour guide as we saw more with the guide.
The only thing i dont like so much is we had to pay for the toilet even if we already paid for the ticket which is not so cheap. Overall, it was a very nice trip here.
PS: currently there is a sand exposition of Disney until 30/09/2015 It was small but lovely.

Belgium,Scuttler78,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"Give Dinant a miss. We found it to be very dirty, crampt and the restaurants expensive and generally unclean. The citadel is bizarre. The cable car up to the top is the best bit. It is all a bit of a rip off. The cafe at the top is very poor, everything available to eat has to be done in a deep fat fryer. The playground is fine for kids but placed next to a military graveyard. There is a pub at the top but we couldn't get out to it, we were trapped by the closed unmanned gate, no doubt to entice us to the cafe (which they failed at!). The citadel is empty, no staff anywhere. There is a bar but they do no serve food. A strange gift shop, selling overpriced tat. You even have to pay for the toilets on top of the entry fee which gets you very little. The exhibit is pretty scary, not suitable for young children (although this wasn't displayed anywhere). The exhibit focuses entirely on when the town was invaded by the Germans in the war and a large proportion of the population were massacred, cheery stuff. The exhibit has some scary sound effects, screams etc which are pretty terrifying along with all the other macabre stuff. All in all, pretty horrible!

Roads leading to these tourist attractions are literally smeared out on the streets. Actually we started wondering if piles of dog poop and cigarette buds are the main attraction in the city and not the saxophone theme. On top of that the restaurant which brands itself 'romantic' due to its pink colours on Place St. Nicholas...the rudest service we have experienced in the three weeks Belgium, in fact we walked away after snatched at by a restaurant owner who seems to be more friendly with dogs than clients.
Another issue which is quite a problem overall in Belgium is finding a toilet (either you are forced to consume drinks/food to use toilets, either the public toilets are dirty/closed, either it is quite clear that there are self-made public toilets alongside roads and forests.
For what concerns me and my family, we are never ever putting a foot anymore in Belgium's poopest city called Dinant! The Flemish people in Brugge, Gent, Antwerp, Ypres ext. live in clean cities and the population is very friendly!

On a lighter note, the views are great, children may get a gruesome thrill at seeing a guillotine, and the last room, taking you out, is a surprisingly discomforting experience. Well worth a visit. We were there for two hours.

Wondering why we climbed over, only to be shouted at and called back by the staff. We soon realised why !

If you are a bit younger or in very good shape or have a lot of time there is a 408 step stairway carved into the cliff. Unfortunately what goes up that way must come down that way.

Or there is the way we did it; by car.

The problem with the citadel visit is that you can’t tour the top of the walls (part with the green in most commercial pictures on tourist websites of Dinant) and a number of other interesting places. The highlight of the visit is the view of Dinant from the citadel which is quite beautiful.

If you are in this neck of the woods and have time for only one my recommendation is Dinant citadel for a great view and not much more; Bouillon citadel for a spectacular fortress tour with a good enough view.

There is a special exhibition (covered in the €8 per adult admission fee) that takes you through the experiences of the inhabitants of Dinant (the Belgian city which suffered the most civilian murders at the hands of the German troops in WW1) as well as the heroic stand the city's inhabitants stood against the encroaching army. Highly moving and worth the time to view it.

The admission fee includes a guided tour through the main citadel. As we understood it, only guided tours are available, which means that you have to wait every 15 mins or 30 mins for the start of each tour. However, the super-strict (bordering on rude and mean) ""gate master"" seemed ok to let some tourists in off-schedule, while being militant with others. There didn't seem to be rhyme nor reason to who he would let in and keep out. Inquiries were met with no answers except a barked ""wait"".

Being of the more independent variety of traveller, we weren't so keen on this feature, as the pace of our assigned tour guide was exceedingly weird. The tour guide would labour on and on at seemingly nothing-to-see points of the tour, and speed through the really interesting parts. Additionally, you were not permitted to linger at the parts of the tour that you might deem more interesting.. the tour guide actually stopped the entire tour when even ONE participant lingered to view the exhibition in better detail!

There were no options for other languages (our tour was French-only) and if you spoke another language, a leaflet was thrust your way and you were pretty much summarily ignored for the rest of the tour. The leaflet only gave the barest of information.

All in all, while the citadel itself was fascinating and rich with wonderful history, the guided tour was frustrating, rude, exceedingly arbitrary, and completely redundant, we thought.

A quaint part of the tour were the stairs that reached all the way down the cliff to the town below. A little hair-raising for those afraid of heights, but the view is unbeatable. Alternatively, included in the price of the admission fee is free usage of the cable car that goes between the top of the citadel to the town below (both cable car and stairs come out at Dinant's magnificent Collegiate Church of our Lady (Collégiale Notre Dame de Dinant) where there are plenty of restaurants to eat at along the River Meuse.

All in all, it was a great day out to Dinant (we also walked along Rue Adolph Sax, visited the Sax Museum and walked around the whole town). Only two things stop me from giving the Citadelle attraction 5 stars: the surly tour guides and staff, regardless of whether you're speaking French or English, and the senseless tour format.

You can tour the citadel and take a ""Funicar"" (Cable car) ride down to the town where everything is within walking distance. It's 8 Euros for an adult, which gets you into the gorgeous citadel and a round trip cable car ride! Park up top for free, and walk around the town!

TIP #2!!! The ""Lookout spot"" within the Citadel will allow an AMAZING birds eye view overlooking the town. Well worth the money for any amateur or professional photographer!

The museum was amazing. Very lifelike, and described in 4 languages. They spent a LOT of time designing the museum. It was extremely interesting to see the different stages the place went through, and how it coped with being occupied. I highly recommend it. Museum alone was worth the visit! Everything else was a plus!

Belgium,Tanksmon,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"We were looking forward to using the Citadel as the base for our visit to Dinant. We were expecting much more, having been to many museums and castles withing Belgium. We were truly disappointed with this museum. The museum itself was poorly arranged and the people meeting you were nice, but they had very little information. Also, they had no tours in English -- only French and Dutch. When we did get on a tour, they did not follow the guide and went basically wherever they wanted. The good part is the overlook to the city, and this was very much worth the cost. Other than that, the museum seemed old, poorly planned, with poor service and a very sketchy historical overview. The people and history of Dinant demand much more.

I like the Citadel especially for the view. You can see the whole city. It's quite impressive!

A guide allows us to see the Citadel, as well as the views of the whole city. When we were there, there were about hundred people following the guide. He did his best to make it fun. The Belgian humor is quite funny. For example he said that once we were on the deck to see the city, it would take us but 1 step to get down to the city.Yikes! LOL

Belgium,Zoltán K,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Once it guarded the bridge over the Meuse, today it is besieged by tourists and understabdably so. Retired locals guide you around the citadel, showing you how soldiers used to live in the barracks and fight if they had to. There's also a very interesting WW1 exposition remembering the centenary of the start of the Great War. Don't forget to tip your guide at the end of the tour as the whole show is for free. There's a cable car going up and down from the foot of the mountain where you have to buy your entrance tickets.
Up the hill, a few meters from the citadel, you'll find a big playground for kids, a fighter jet and a WW2 era flak gun, toilets and a French military cemetery with graves of fallen soldiers. Worth the trip. One of our best trips in Wallonia.

Belgium,Mariner79,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"We bought a combined ticket which also gave us a 45 minute river excursion, entry to the citadel and use of the cable car to get there (408 steps are the alternative). 15 euros each - good value. Aside from the great views over the Meuse and the town, the citadel offers an excellent tour in which the history and consequences of the town's capture in 1914 are set out. It's an informative, multi-media experience which does well to portray the horror of battle and the cruelty of the senseless slaughter of nearly 700 civilians by the German army. Inside the citadel there is a cafe and gift shop, and just behind is a restaurant area and a play park for children. Well worth a visit!

Belgium,snowydog,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"Spent a happy couple of hours here one rainy Saturday and would recommend if you are in the area.

The primary attraction is the old fortifications dating back to Louis XIV in parts, set on top of the high cliffs overlooking Dinant. On site is also an attractive bar and a more functional snack bar and ice cream parlour. For some unknown reason a late 1940s Belgian airforce Gloster Meteor is also on site looking rather sorry for itself.

It is only possible to gain access to the main area of the fortress by joining one of the regular guided tours (they were every 45 mins when we were there) but I believe these are only in French and Dutch (there were 4 english speakers in our group but the guide explained that translating into three languages wasnt practical) so if you dont understand one of these, then you will be limited as to what information you can take in.

On the positive side you can still enjoy the panoramic views over the town and down the Meuse valley from the terrace and go into exhibitions as to what some of the rooms were used for. The best part of the tour however was a replica of a WW1 trench, constructed in the 1930s but with the floor set at a sharp angle so it is very disorientating. Despite not really understanding what our guide was saying from other peoples reaction he was clearly very entertaining and knew his stuff.

Also included in the EUR 9 entrance fee is a rather good WW1 museum majoring on the experience of the Citadel and the town of Dinant during the 1914 German invasion. They have tried to recreate an ""atmosphere"" in the presentation rather than just show a load of dry documents and with a limited knowledge of French and certain items translated into English they have largely succeeded.

Perhaps the most exciting part of the entrance fee is that it also buys you a return ticket on the cable car down to the town of Dinant. This was running every 5-10 mins when we were there and saves an awful lot of steps up and down the steep cliffs. All in all good fun and a great way of seeing the town without having to pay extra for parking as you can leave your car in the free Citadel car park. Not sure Dinant is the prettiest town Ive ever seen but considering its near total destruction perhaps that not surprising.

Whilst there, you may also want to visit the military cemetery containing the graves of French troops sent to help defend the Belgian fortress and there are also some UK graves there as well.

On its own I would rate the fortress tour as average and if this is your thing, definitely head for Namur further up the valley which is altogether much large and better. However, if you are in Dinant already, as a package considering what you get I would rate it 4/5.

Belgium,DW752013,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"The best way to see the citadel is via one of the guided tours which gets you into all the rooms that are not open to the wandering public. Our very animated tour guide spoke French, which our french speaking Belgian friend then translated to English for us. While the guide repeated himself in Dutch for some others, a third group translated to Portuguese for some other tourists. It worked out much better than expected and the tour guide managed to be entertaining even though I only caught about 1 word in 10 that he said.

Belgium,GMW1960,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"The town on Dinant is completely overlooked by the Citadelle. It can be seen from everywhere and draws you upwards from wherever you are. The steps are steep, but with several resting places along the way (which we needed) and the view gets better and better with every step. If you have small children with you, or unfit people, don't hesitate to use the cable car! Once at the top, you can see all along the valley, over the whole town and it is a spectacular sight.
the Citadelle itself is well looked after, with a small gift shop and cafe inside. They have done a good job of commemorating the battle here during the first world war, and it is quite atmospheric inside, with the sounds of battle all around you and excellent (multilingual) explanations at each stage. I was quite moved by the descriptions of the massacre, and the burning of the town.
There is a second world war plane on display, and cafe with a playground for the kids at the top. It is possible to walk back down, or (as we did) to take the cable car ride. Overall, a very worthwhile visit.

The parts which you see on the guided tour are OK, but not really so fascinating. A few exhibitions with wax dummies wearing uniforms re-enacting some battle scene, or, lying in a prison cell, or baking. Our guide was quite old, and whilst I was impressed that he could speak so many languages, I found his tone quite monotonous. He spoke first in French, then Dutch, and after some time, also in English too. However, he didn’t pause between each of the languages, so I was almost asleep when I realised he was speaking English. Although the group didn’t seem that big, it felt quite crowded being in all the whitewashed tunnels and rooms, and got quite warm too. I was glad to get out in the fresh air again.

He looked bored repeating his bad jokes again and again. The tour is set up as a walk through the history of the citadel starting with the build till the German occupation.
Unfortunately they ran out of interesting facts about the citadel and they decided to rebuild a war scene in the last part that was about a battle totally unrelated to the citadel.

You can also drive up to the backside of the citadel. The only way to see the entire citadel is to join one of the official tours. The tour is included in the entry price and you'll find multiple locked tours if you try to walk around on your own. There is a clock outside the gift shop that tells you when the next tour starts. The tours are generally in French and Dutch but sometimes the guide speaks English too. They also have brochures that they can give you in various different languages like English, Japanese and Chinese. The tour takes about 45 minutes and was very interesting (if you like history). It might be a little long (and dull) for younger kids though. They have bathrooms and a restaurant at the top as well. Not handicap accessible due to stairs and uneven, rough cobblestone walkways.

The citadel is perched on a rock high above town. Definately suggest parking in the free parking at the top, then using the cable car (included in the ticket) to visit the town.

There is plenty of free parking up by the citadel entrance. Before you pay to enter, you can visit the French War Cemetery by the entrance. Once in the Citadel itself, you need to take a guided tour to see most of it. Unfortunately, the tour is only in French or Dutch, but there is a leaflet in English to assist. As is the way in Belgium, it seems to take twice as long as everything is repeated in two languages, and with the tour lasting almost an hour, it may be too much for very young children.
Following the tour, there is a children's play area, and a cafe/bar, which was good value for a light lunch.
You can then take the cable car down to the town, and walk around. Dinant is a pleasant town on the River Meuse and worthy of an hour or so visit. If you don't fancy the cable car, there are about five hundred steps down, and five hundred back up again!

Belgium,NMBS2001,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"Dinant is is a small town on the Meuse River, dominated by its two tourist attractions: the Citadel, which overlooks the town from a 100 metre cliff.

Because of its strategic situation on the Meuse river, Dinant has witnessed several battles and destructions that changed the historic heritage considerably. Outside of the city is a rock, called 'le rocher Bayard' (the Bayard rock). It stands completely separated from the rest of the main rock of which it obviously used to be a part. The Rocher Bayard was separated with an explosion to provide passage for the French troops of Louis XIV after they had taken Dinant. However, popular belief has it that the rock was split by the hoof of the giant Bayard Horse, when it jumped from here over the Meuse river. The Bayard horse is a legendary animal from the story of the four Aymon Brothers.

These four brothers were on the run for Charlemagne and escaped through the Ardennes sitting on the back of the Bayard Horse. Dinant is a beautiful place to stop and sadly it was getting late and we could not do the city justice. Famously Dinant is the place where the saxaphone was invented and where Charles De Gaulle was injured during WWI.

The Citadel had a lot of history, but the tours were very unorganized. We couldn't manage to get a tour in English, so we wandered about to see the place for ourselves. The lights were all off in the corridors (unless you were on the guided tour), but we managed to find our way anyway. The signs explained a little history, but not much. The best part was probably the tilted room underground. Not worth paying 7 Euros for... but it was fun anyway.",Sep 2012
Belgium,Havalyn N,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"This place costs 7 euros per person, and there's nothing here worth that much. Yes, the view is spectacular, but the citadel itself is nothing compared with other, less expensive ones like Namur. Inside is nothing but a courtyard, most of it roped off, and then a long descent of stairs that you think is going to lead somewhere interesting. Nope! We arrived at the bottom in a little gift shop where we could pay another seven euro each to take a lift back up to the top. We said, no, we're young, we'll go back up the stairs! We did. We had to stop to rest three times and by the time we reached the top we were thoroughly disgusted with the famous citadel of Dinant. Impenetrable perhaps, but definitely uninteresting.

Belgium,CAPTAINCOOK10,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"I visited Dinant as a child and never managed to visit this impressive structure at that time. It has always remainded somewhere I would return to, So 40 years later.........
Started well, cable car was good. Reached the courtyard area and waited in anticipation at the meeting point for the Guided Tour. Oh dear guide in Dutch, Flemish, German and French but not English. Still the guide handed out an A4 sheet in English - good that meant we could just wander at our leisure? WRONG!!! It appears that you can only do this after you've endured the entire tour conducted by someone old enough to have witnessed the original construction and given in three foreign languages! So, if you don't want to be bored rigid save your money - visit one of the many other Castles in the area. Absolute Rubbish.

Belgium,jemWirral,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"Visited citadel, price e7.80 for entrance and cable car (price for toilets not included!)
Citadel is fairly interesting and some good views, however at no point do they advise that you have to follow the tour guide to see all the points of interest. The tour guide speaks only in Flemish and French and although you have an English pamphlet, it it frustrating as you cannot tour the citadel at your own pace - the tour guide unlocks doors as he goes around.
Useful tip - there is a free car park at the entrance of the town (north) next to a school, less than a ten minute walk to the citadel.

Belgium,Alan C,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"We had a great time in Dinant. We parked in Citadel parking paid for the sky tram and the citadel. We went down to the town ate lunch and then after seeing the town we went up and toured the citadel. This was built in about 1100 ad. It has seen lots of battles. The only problem is the tour is in French or Dutch. However, they do have an English pamphlet and signs in English. This is just an awesome town to visit with family. Lots of history. They have an Playground close to the entry of the Citadel that the kids loved to play in.",Jul 2012

In Dinant was born Adolf Sax- instrument designer, and this fact you can notice on the main street and bridge :) Hmm what can I recommend for tourists ... there is good campsite over the river (better to speak in french... but it's not so difficult to draw a tent: and to be understand :P), sometimes you can meet there intersting and open minded people :) And you have to try belgian beer: Hoegaarden and Kwak which is drinked in v. unique glass!!!

Belgium,Benzeretto,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"Dinant is a wonderful little town. Just avoid the Citadel. The admission price (eight euros) includes a ticket to ride the tram up and down the mountain (no difference if you decide to use the stairs) and a horrible tour of the Citadel. Even it’s not written anywhere to visit the Citadel you can only follow the guide, you’re not allowed to walk round on your own. You wait 20 minutes for a tour in French and Dutch in almost empty rooms. Some information boards written in English. No audioguide or leaflets. Very bad organized.",Aug 2012
Belgium,JacquiBournemouth,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"Breathtaking approach on the train into Dinant. Also fantastic views from the top. It was a hot day when we were there, and we had a well deserved beer at the top whilst looking down on the town. Cable car up was stuffy so walked down which was well worth the effort. Big negative was that we were not allowed to walk round on our own so couldn't see everything. Didnt want to pay for a tour and would have rather been allowed to see everything at our own pace. This should have been explained when we paid 7.80 each to get in. Although we enjoyed it, I have to mention the negative.",Jul 2012
Belgium,pbxl1,Citadelle de Dinant,2.0,Passed Dinant during a 1 day trip in the Ardennes and wanted to visit the citadel but you have to pay for everything and a scheduled tour ...I did not want to wait cause I had other things to visit that day ...Near the river there are nice restaurants to relax ..Take a walk to the bridge and cross it and enjoy the view....,Jul 2012
Belgium,DZEBORAH,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"The cable car ride up to the citadel was quick and fun. Once we were up there, we could either enjoy the view over the city and then go back down, or wait 20 minutes or so for the guided tour, which was the only way to access the areas which could give you information about the citadel and some history of Dinant.
The most difficult part of that was that it's a tri-lingual guided tour and you have to wait through a couple of languages before the guide explains things in yours and most often, those who have heard it already in their language start chatting and making noises. it got to be QUITE tedious, because I really am not into moving that slooooow!
We eventually snuck away and just followed the exhibition numbers on our own where each one had an explanation of each site anyway.

Belgium,Thurio,Citadelle de Dinant,2.0,"The fare of nearly eight euros for the very short cable car journey is excessive, although it might be said the view is worth it. I last visited this site over sixty years ago and it is just as I remembered it, nothing has been done to improve the visitor's experience.",Jul 2012
Belgium,AllKnowMother,Citadelle de Dinant,1.0,"We parked our car and purchased a parking ticket for one hour, intending to visit the citadel.
In the printed 365 Belgian tourism guide, published by the Belgian Ministry of Tourism, it is clearly written that the duration of visit is 1 hour and that tickets for the cable car and for the citadel can be purchased with credit cards. At the tickets booth we were told that they do not accept credit cards. They prefer cash and do not care about their cotumers' convenience. Not to mention the fact that it's a lie.
We arrived to the citadel with the cable car and only there we discovered that the citadel can be visited in a guided tour only, which was going to start 20 minutes later and there was nothing written about the duration of that guided tour. Nothing about these facts was written or told at the tickets booth, upon tickets purchase. So nobody can plan his visit while he is down in town and nobody can know how long will it all take and to purchase a suitable parking ticket.
We waited 20 minutes for the guided tour and started the visit. Because of the complete lack of organisation, many persons join the tour in the middle, making the guide stop and give repeated explanations, so the guided tour is repeatedly interrupted, making it longer and longer. Unfortunately, in the middle of the guided tour the parking time we paid for at the parking meter was going to end, so we had no choice and left the tour and went quickly down back to town with the cable car and missed the end of guided tour.
To make the visitors more angry ( if possible ) they charge their visitors an additional amount for using the restrooms at the citadel. You already paid for the cable car and for the citadel but it's not enough, you pay again for toilets. Nowhere in the whole world have we encountered such insolence and dirty cheating.
Hiding information and not giving the visitors the possibility to plan their time and visit is complete disrespect for the visitors that pay these workers' salaries.

Belgium,sussexstorm,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"The Citadel could be a great tourist attraction if they'd only invest a bit of money in a decent audioguide. We had the misfortune to go when there were two organised trips - a party of very badly behaved schoolchildren and a party of older people. The guide coped pretty well, considering there were about 100 people in the combined group, but we had to wait whilst he spoke first in French and then in German. There were information boards with some info in English or if you could fight your way to the front you may be lucky enough to get a leaflet in English, but we found the whole tour quite tedious. It took so much longer than was really necessary, and being stuck in a tunnel listening first to French and then to German was quite boring. The guide was nice and obviously knew his stuff, but an audioguide would have been so much better for us, as then we could have learned so much more and done the tour at our own speed.
However, the views from the top are wonderful! And there is a nice cafe with good views.

Belgium,MartinsburgRay,Citadelle de Dinant,5.0,"Not only is Dinant the birthplace of Aldolph Sax, the inventor of the saxaphone, but it is a beautiful little city along the Meuse.
Taking a stroll along the river was quite relaxing. The Citadelle was interesting. You get a great view of the city from atop. The city offers lots of shopping and some of the best pasteries you can buy. Good bars and good food.",Jun 2012
Belgium,J D,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"The Citadel sits atop a picturesque view of the small town of Dinant. The town itself offers lots of shopping and dining for a nice day trip. The Citadel itself does not have much to offer. The admission price includes a ticket to ride the tram up and down the mountain, and a tour of the Citadel. The ""english"" tour is not english. The guide hands you a brochure written in english and tells you to read it as you go along while the rest of the tour is in French.

Great pictures of the river can be taken a top the Citadel, which is a nice plus, but the tour is roughly an hour long and takes you through empty room with cheap, cheesy displays made showing stories of the wars.

If you are traveling through Belgium and are going to pass near Dinant, then I suggest stopping here. You can spend roughly 3-4 hours in the town/Citadel spending a nice leisurely afternoon. The restaurants and cafes in town and along the river offer a nice atmosphere.

Belgium,Peter C,Citadelle de Dinant,3.0,"Dinant is a great place to visit - dominated by the Citadelle over looking the city. You can get to the Citadelle either by walling up a (very ) steep climb, or by taking a cablecar (price included in the fee for entering the Citadelle). The view from the top is truly stunning - and I am sure that the Citadelle would have been very interesting - but we were not allowed to visit beyond the courtyard as we had to pay / join a guided tour. As someone who is allergic to guided tours, we declined.",Nov 2011

Belgium,ReluctantFlyerLondon,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"The Citadel of Dinant is located on a clifftop, towering over the city itself. The entrance is at the foot of the cliff. From here, there are two options to reach the citadel: the stairs or the cable car (included in the entrance fee).

The stairs are very good if you feel like burning of some excess energy. There are about 400 steps, so there is plenty of opportunity for toning the leg muscles. The cable car trip to the takes about 20-30 seconds and both offer nice views of the city. Once at the top, you will be at the entrance to the citadel.

Inside, there is a gift shop, where you can get information on the next available guided tour. The tour is very much recommended. It provides information on the history of the region, of Dinant and, more specifically, of the citadel itself. The tour guides are volunteers and are very enthusiastic and will happily answer any questions you might have.

Around the citadel there are a couple of cafés where you can buy one of the local beers and enjoy this while enjoying the views of the city.

Belgium,Carmen M,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"On December 30 we visited Dinant.
First we saw the Citadel of Dinant.
Program is: from April to October daily from 11 am to 5 pm, from November to March is closed Fridays (except during school holidays) from 1 pm to 4 pm.
price is 7.8 euros which included the elevator to the top, if you don't want to climb the stairs.
You can choose between the stairs with 408 steps (dated 1577) and / or the cable car, built in 1956. Both lead to a staggering view on the city of Dinant.
The splendid panorama of the landscape, 100 meters above the Meuse, is breathtaking.

There is a lift taking you up to Citadel. Visiting costs around 7 euro. Nearby is parking for 1euro/hour. Tour takes more than 1 hour.

You can go inside only with a guide. At that moment there was only French speaking guide but we decided not to wait for another one.

Belgium,Doubutsu,Citadelle de Dinant,4.0,"If entered on foot via the town of Dinant, the entrance is near the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame; a quick cable car ride to the top is included with the admission fee. For a challenge, take the stairs instead. Much of the fortress is accessible only with a guided tour (departing about every 30 minutes from the courtyard near the gift shop). This includes a dead-end corridor where French troops reportedly fought to the last man during World War I, prison cells, part of an ancient bridge recovered from the Meuse, and most oddly of all, a World War I bunker apparently shifted several degrees on its side by a direct hit. The guided tour was only in French and Dutch but there were signs in English on the route.

I'm not sure how often it's present, but a band was playing horns with great skill during my visit. Views of the town and for miles down the Meuse River were unparalleled from the Citadel. Be sure to also check out the view from outside the walls themselves, near the classic jet (think it's a Gloster Meteor) close to the cable car station, as it provides a nice view of the Citadel itself and its surroundings.
