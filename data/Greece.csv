Greece,misterchester12,Acropolis,5.0,"What an amazing place! Yes, it is a must on any trip to Athens.
But, I encourage you to bring lots of water.
The kiosk near the booking office was outrageously priced. While I expect some inflation of prices as it is a tourist hot spot, I do not expect to be charged 4.50euro for a small bottle of water, elsewhere you can buy a large bottle for 1 euro.",Nov 2021

Greece,Luke-n-LauraB,Acropolis,4.0,"You cannot visit Athens without heading up the acropolis!

Greece,smac,Acropolis,5.0,"Well, I can tick off a bucket list item having always wanted to visit here - I wasn't let down. The whole site is totally awesome and the history is palpable and alive. You really must visit.

Be aware: arrive as soon as you possibly can. We got there for 8am (opening time) and enjoyed a calm walk around - it was busy but fine - no waiting and very civilised. However, as we were leaving, swarms upon swarms of tour groups from cruise ships were ascending and I was so relieved that we had avoided the nightmare; the site has many steps and is uneven, so to have to manoeuvre the site with so many people would have been uncomfortable and would have spoilt the visit.

Mark my words, avoid peak times to ensure your enjoyment and safety and pre book your tickets so that you can skip the queues.

Greece,GBJ-Cookies,Acropolis,5.0,"Arrived early and the lines were starting to grow. There is a steep walk up uneven ground, lucky for us we visited in October when the temperatures were only in the low 80s.
There are a limited number of restrooms and a lift for disabled visitors.
The views from the top are stunning and you can get up close for that iconic photograph of the graceful Parthenon.
Be sure to visit the nearby area of Plaka after your visit.
The lines around midday as we left were very long, bear this in mind when visiting

Greece,LadureeFan,Acropolis,5.0,"It was incredibly windy when we visited but so worth it. Would not advise visiting after a rain -- as it was, the stone paths were smooth and slick from years of wear. We got tickets from the side entrance -- didn't check out the front entrance but we were told the side entrance would be less crowded. Even so, there was a line. If you go to the front of the line, you can download a QR code tht allows you to buy tickets on your phone and skip the line. Recommended! The site is huge. Never realized how big it is. When I think of the Acropolis, I think of the main structure ... not all the other structures on the premises. They are doing a lot of renovations so lots of scaffolding and other equipment on site but well worth a visit.

Greece,Norman M,Acropolis,5.0,"There are some unmissable world experiences: this is one. Other reviews will have written plenty, so I'll be brief.
I used the 3-day combo pass and it worked well for me. There were no queues anywhere but I was Earl in the day and it's later in the year. Still, the weather was excellent. Don't forget water and sun protection even now!
If time permits, visit twice. First to get the idea, and second, after buying a guidebook and reading it, to consolidate. If no time, buy the guidebook beforehand.
I didn't use a tour guide, I prefer to wander. Each to their own. Enjoy this world-class experience.

Athens is a bit of a dump, very crowded, dirty and busy place but the Acropolis really is a must see, must visit, iconic, world famous site. €20 to get in and a pleasant walk to the top.

Greece,Mr. Fisher,Acropolis,1.0,"I am writing this negative review in protest of the inflexible policies of this popular tourist attraction. I went recently on a Sunday morning with the intention of visiting the Acropolis Museum in the afternoon. By mistake, I entered the wrong line and ended again in the Acropolis Park. I had no idea that the Acropolis had more than one entrance and one of them is very close to the museum so it is very easy to get confused and get in the wrong place. I only realized this after I bought the ticket and asked a staff member about the museum. They were very unsympathetic about my situation and refused to refund or even appologize for the confusion.",Oct 2021
Greece,ChrisAndEmilieJ,Acropolis,5.0,"Amazing! We went on European Heritage Days so we were able to get in for free.

Greece,Bobby P,Acropolis,5.0,Make sure you buy the 5 day pass. Its €20 for the acropolis on it's own but only €30 for the 5 day pass so well worth it. Great site. Was a lifelong dream to see it. It didnt disappoint. However Delphi was even better.,Oct 2021
Greece,Pseudolus,Acropolis,3.0,"TL;DR version: As one other reviewer posted here, visiting the Acropolis is more stressful than it is enjoyable, romantic, or fun.

While the Acropolis is beautiful and certainly worth the effort to climb and enjoy, the staff there make it incredibly difficult for visitors to do so. The flow of traffic is somewhat difficult to navigate, and many visitors have audio tours in their ears. When they happen to wander in the wrong direction, the staff attempt to steer them back on course and have to do so quite loudly or harshly — atop of patch of very slippery marble. Disappointingly, the staff try their hardest to control the way people take photos, and this is where we ran into trouble. A rather overzealous woman stationed at the southeast corner of the Parthenon shouted at us from across the marble field to delete our photos “out of respect for the site.” Unfortunately, the fact that she had screamed so loudly to us meant that every single person in the area had heard the commotion and turned to watch the (non-)drama unfold.

After we approached the woman (it took a minute or so to actually walk over to where she was), we asked her “Which photo was the problem so that we know not to do it again.” In the end, after reviewing our photos, she apologized (we had not crossed a barrier, we did not pick anything up, and were not climbing anything; it should also be noted that pictures may be taken of all the structures without flash). It made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience, and we departed from the top of the hill not shortly after (due in part to simply being tired).

Unfortunately, it is now painfully clear the awful reputation of the guards at the Parthenon is one they deserve to have — they are, for all intents and purposes, mall cops. Not even one minute after our collision with this woman, we heard her whistle again at another group of people. Athens has been an absolute joy so far, home to some incredibly nice people, and all of our interactions at other attractions, supermarkets, and retail shops have been lovely. I’ve been able to practice my Greek as much as I can, and I’ve loved every second of it. It is a shame that the staff at the Acropolis are so hyper-focused on fighting the wrong battles. I saw many children climbing the ruins, people slipping on marble, and elderly persons in need of assistance with no guards around to offer any. Also, the rather large guided tours clog the entryways (particularly at the Propylaea), making the Acropolis a rather precarious site. In my eyes, efforts could certainly be made to improve safety over policing those who had not been doing anything wrong. If you are expecting the same level of kindness or professionalism one would see at any museum across the EU, at the Colosseo, Palatino, Les Invalides, or the Catacombs of Paris, forget about it.

Greece,Maaike,Acropolis,3.0,"The view and buildings are impressive. What I personally missed was the storytelling in the information that was provided. Many of the signs were (too) literally translated from Greek, which didn't make them really pleasurable to read. There were some guided tours, but they weren't advertised at the ticket office.

When I visited there was no waiting line, so at least around this time of year it's not necessary to buy a skip the line ticket or anything like that.

Tip: buy the combination ticket (€30) which allows acces to various archeological sites. When you're under 25 the ticket is free.

Greece,phat_dawg_21,Acropolis,5.0,"We had a guide for the day which really made it easy to cover a lot of Athens in an efficient manner.

We had purchased the combined thicket the afternoon before so we could skip the line. And our driver as able to drop us in the parking lot at the top of the hill so our walk to the entrance took less than five minutes.

Go Early. We were there at about 8:30 and the crowd was already starting to build.

There is quite a bit to see so allow at least 90 minutes so you can take time to take it all in.

Greece,Heidi J,Acropolis,5.0,"The whole area was fascinating to me--far grander and more impressive than I realized! History makes sens and definitely comes into perspective better after visiting this grand site. I recommend you hire a guide (we tried but couldn't book for our time slot) or download a guided tour (we used Rick Steve's guide which was invaluable.

Greece,John J,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis in Athens is something you visualize when you think of Athens - much like the Taj Mahal in India. In both cases, pictures do not do them justice.

Greece,B1714D,Acropolis,3.0,"I do not want my rating to mislead travelers - Acropolis is a 5 star, one of a kind site, but I deducted two stars because of things explained in the headline.
This was my fourth visit to Acropolis over the decades, and this time I went because of my 15y daughter who wanted to visit it.
My first surprise was a 20 Euro entrance fee - significant rise from my previous visit 5y ago, making it the most expensive site not in Greece, but in all SE Europe.
Second, they demand mask wearing !!!??? I deeply respect all Covid measures and obey all of them, but wearing masks in such a vast open space in scorching 40+ 'C in July really makes no sense.

Greece,Yetizod,Acropolis,5.0,"Went to the Acropolis, Sept 2021. So Covid was still a thing and I would assume it impacted the crowds. That said, I highly recommend going either early, or late in the day when the cruise crowds are gone. It's busy all the time, but when a few thousand surge in all at once I bet it gets pretty hectic.
Secondly get a licensed guide. We had a gentlemen named Angelos Kokkaliaris, who I recommend very strongly. A guide will really make this place pop. If you're not a total history buff, a lot of what your looking at is just piles of rocks.
In summary, this was absolutely a bucket list visit. The site is overwhelming. You really feel like your walking through history. And craftsmenship that went into this temple, 1500 to 2000 years ago is nothing short of mind blowing. This is a must do.

Greece,WinerDinerFaversham,Acropolis,4.0,"Obviously a must see. We followed the advice abs series at 08:30 (its open form 8-8) until October. It’s similar to the Forum in Rome with temples for the gods. It used to be a walled city and considering that’s it’s built on a hill makes the architecture even more impressive. The views are stunning and stretch to the port. There is nowhere to buy food or drink but there are watering taps and toilets at the top. Check before you drink as the heat turns the water into bath water temperatures.
We entered from the main gate and exited through the theatre (not the amphitheatre which is still in use) and we’re greater by a string of restaurants with cold water and cold beer.

Unfortunately the experience was tarnished by a NATO delegation doing a media tour. There was no prior notification ( I understand that for security reasons but simply stating that it’s open later would suffice.) We arrived at half past 8 and had to wait in the searing sunshine until 11:00 without any access to toilets as they were also locked, before the last VIP’s sauntered down the path to the exit to much boos and hand clapping. One delegates comment summed the NATO up perfectly “you learn to ignore them”.

Once we got to the top we were amazed at the structures and the views of Athens. This is something you do not want to miss and you don’t want to be hurried.

Don't get me wrong, it's a cool place, but my favourite thing about the Acropolis were actually the vies of it from various places around the city - Aeropagus Hill and Panathenaic stadium.",Aug 2021
Greece,Kratz1,Acropolis,1.0,crap - over staffed and inaccurate info. the last entry time does not match online info so we travelled across town with kids to be refused entry. The 5 staff members standing around at the entry thought it was very funny and were utterly unhelpful. would make sense to have one of those people do some work on the website instead of having them make jokes about visitors.,Aug 2021
Greece,Tony S,Acropolis,5.0,"Be prepared to walk and walk some more. This outcropping in the middle of the city is just as high as it appears, and requires patience and stamina .

Greece,Mari,Acropolis,5.0,"From the moment I was in contact with Faye﻿ about my upcoming trip to Greece, she was extremely knowledgeable and accessible in helping me plan where I wanted to go in Greece. (Rick Steve’s trip was cancelled due to Covid). Every suggestion and recommendation she had was excellent and helped me navigate efficiently and joyfully through Athens. From her extensive knowledge of archeology and history, she fast- tracked all the important information that I needed to know without reading every placard in the Acropolis Museum. It can be overwhelming to be in Athens in the summer heat, but enthusiastically and energetically, Faye lead me to the great sites and her guidance was invaluable!! I would beyond recommend this classy lady to guide me wherever I wanted to explore in Greece! Do yourself a favor and just trust her guidance. She knows what she is doing! From finding a shady spot at the Acropolis so she could go into more detail about a marble sculpture- to how to get to the airport: Faye is who you want by your side in Greece. I would highly recommend this guide.

We booked with Dimitris Papandrou – knowledgable and understanding about my slow mobility – we found him at the entrance. There was a small line, maybe 20 people, at the ticket booth. We went right when it opened to try and avoid the heat of the midday. Be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen! It is an uphill climb, but it doesn't feel like one as our guide kept us enthralled with historical facts and history lessons – most of which is not on the reading plaques around the artifacts. The view is spectacular and the history is remarkable. Well worth the climb and remember to take your time and soak all the ancient history in.

From our hotel it looks as if the climb up the hill will be a long, hot tiring one, but with our private guide (which I highly recommend), it was quick and easy and painless. Be sure to wear a hat, sunscreen, and take a bottle of water. Thanks to COVID, and going early in the morning, there was no line at the ticket booth. We walked right up and right in! The ruins are breathtaking, and so beautiful. Be sure to take your camera! Sadly, there were those with no respect, who were climbing over the ruins, standing on top of the ruins, and generally not being their best selves, but luckily the crowds were not bad before noon. As we were leaving to walk to our lunch in Plaka, the crowd had begun to pick up quite a bit, as did the heat.

Greece,Nicole P,Acropolis,4.0,"Loved seeing the Acropolis. Some tips. Go in the morning - it does get hot and there is no shade. Also, they advised us that a few days prior they had closed the site from 1-5pm because there was a heat advisory. There were guides outside the Acropolis offering tours and we joined up with another couple to pay 20 euros per person. We found it well worth it.The ticket for the Acropolis is 20 euros, but for 30 euros you can get access to a few other sites around the city. We did the 30 euros and regretted it as we didn't end up using it (we only had a day in Athens). Also, it doesn't include access to the Acropolis museum (which we wrongly assumed) and that's an additional 10 euros. The museum is really great - nicely designed space to learn more about the history and see the original artifacts.

Although there is quite a bit of restoration going on, it doesn't detract from the visit. It's good to see they are doing the work.

Greece,permia,Acropolis,5.0,"Setting out at sunrise along Athinas past Monastiraki and taken with the ever approaching vista on high, we arrived before the 8am opening.

A gorgeous sunny morning in low season made it a perfect time for visiting, having it practically to ourselves.

Entering through the magnificent soaring Propylaia we admired the gorgeous Temple of Athena Nike, constructed in the 420s BCE to celebrate Athenian victories over the Persians.

Even though the Erechtheion Caryatids are replicas, it is a great sight infused with myth and mystery. Later we saw the graceful originals in the brilliant Acropolis Museum.

A Statue of Athena Promachos was a striking monument in antiquity. It honoured the Protectress in gratitude for victories in the Persian Wars and stood about 9 metres high.

What can be seen today of the Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia comprises elements of foundations and walls. It is likely that the Cult of Artemis commenced on the Acropolis in the 6th century BCE.

Walking around the Parthenon was marvellous yielding many fabulous views of the stunning Temple. The Pentelic marble changed appearance as the morning light progressed. It was easy picking out the modern segments in the columns, all part of preservation and renovation that has been underway for decades.

On the way to the Theatre of Dionysus we first gazed at the wonderful Herod Atticus Odeon, where many famous artists have performed, including Maria Callas in 1957.

On the route we saw some notable remains of ancient remains - Stoa of Eumenes II, Byzantine Cistern and Temple of Asclepius and Hygieia.

Greece,Temer2,Acropolis,5.0,"My husband and I visited the Acropolis as a day trip whilst on a cruise and it definitely a beautiful sight.
The stunning architecture with plenty of other ruins to see, plus beautiful views out across the land and to sea make for a great day out.
We had to queue in the heat and then it's quite a climb up fairly slippery marble amongst massive crowds so maybe better to see on a sightseeing bus (as my parents and sister did) if you're less moble.
There were lots of people (and we arrived around 10am) and it was quite disorganised getting up to the Acropolis but far more orderly getting down. However once you're up, the crowds don't seem quite so bad and people are happy to make space for photos. If you're in Athens, this is a must visit, particularly if you like architecture or history.

But my main reason for taking this tour is to see the Acropolis and that is where I stayed the most during this short stop over.

When I reached the Acropolis there was already a long queue for the tickets. It took me around 30 minutes to queue up and get tickets. After that we climbed the hilly steep path towards the Acropolis. Along the way I took photos of the view overlooking the city.

My trip to this place fulfilled my childhood dream of seeing the ruins that I only see in textbook and my history classes.

the fact that the Acropolis is in the middle of the city center and you can spot it from different locations it just give a special vibe to the city.
Make sure to have comfortable shoes!",Oct 2020
Greece,Laura,Acropolis,5.0,"The most astounding piece of Ancient Greek history left with us and it does not disappoint.

Would 100% recommend going to the Acropolis museum before you go up as you learn everything there is to know about this magnificent structure and its history. This makes the difference from looking at an old marble monument to using your imagination looking at every Parthenon frieze with it telling a story.

The only downside was the scaffolding as they are doing restoration works however rather a Parthenon with scaffolding than no Parthenon at all.

We entered by the gates nearest to Acropoli metro station and got in for free as it was Oxi Day (28th Oct). We spent around 2 hours here but you can take as long or as short as you like.

The views of Athens once up there are incredible with sights of Piraeus and Glyfada on one side and the white washed walls of Athens all around on the other.

Please note that the attractions included on the €30 ticket are all FREE every Sunday between November - March. We would have paid the €20 entrance fee to see it though as it is just spectacular and a must if you are in Athens, it just so happened that the day we had planned to see it on was a Greek national holiday so we had saved €40 and counted our blessings!

The €30 combined ticket is definitely worth paying for if you are interested in the Temple of Zeus, the Acropolis Museum, the Archeological Museum and so on.

However if you are there to just see the Acropolis, go on a Sunday between November to March and spend the money you have saved on a meal in a local restaurant around the Acropolis and a well deserved drink!

*WHEELCHAIR USERS OR MOBILITY ISSUES PLEASE READ* ———

To finish I’d like to add that I had dislocated my knee during the week we were in Athens and still managed to hobble to the top with a good partner and a slow pace. There IS a lift for wheelchair access but it has been suspended as works for its replacement are in progress (this was emailed to me 4th November 2020). So please do email or ring in advance so you can plan ahead.

Greece,Hannah Mirissa,Acropolis,5.0,"So obviously the Acropolis was amazing but the main thing I want to talk about is the walk to the top.

A lot of the reviews make out the walk up to be a bit of a nightmare. I am very very unfit and it was a piece of cake. I was so over prepared, I brought my hiking shoes, gym leggings and a massive bottle of water and honestly It’s a gentle uphill stroll with a few steps here and there. I was honestly shocked when we got to the top.

If you are elderly or disabled I could see this being tough but I think it’s the same as walking up any steep road in Athens because it’s well staggered.

It might be different in the height of summer but it’s honestly nothing to over prep for. Do start from the Acropolis metro side though if you want a longer walk round to the top.

We went in at the entrance nearest the Odeon of Herodias which seemed less busy than the one nearest the metro station.

There is a lot of ongoing restoration work at the Acropolis which is interesting in itself, we spent around 3 hours there and walked miles up and down to the Parthenon, temple of Athena Nike, and various other temples mostly from 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD. Incredible amount of history here and you can just imagine yourself here a few thousand years ago. Really gives us an insight into how life might have been. The route around the site takes us around and down to the old theatre of Dionysus, which is well preserved from 500 years BC, which was really interesting and gave us an idea about cultural life around that time. The orchestra was an important part of performances even then, and apparently there was an annual festival for poets and musicians to show their talents in a competition. There was an example of a bust made in honour of one if the participants even though he didn't win, but must have been very good, Menendere. There were hundreds of seats (5000), in the auditorium, so the concerts must have been good. They listened to plays, comedies and tragedies and satire. ( I had never heard the word tragedian before!).

Familiar names performed here, such as Euripedes, Aristotle).

We opted for the audio-tour (with own smartphone as device) and although the tour is well prepared and in general very easy to understand, the COVID-caused new routings (walk on the right path) on some of the areas - and especially the top of the plateau with the Akropolis itself - deviated significantly from the flow of information and that was very confusing (as there is no option to select specific numbers according the attraction you’re in Front of you have to follow the one and only order of the lecturer). While this issue is understandable, it detracted quite a bit.

Greece,Stéphane,Acropolis,4.0,"Yes, they ruins but they have to be seen if in Athens. I was probably lucky to visit away from the summer crowds. It is still warm and you’ll need a cap and water to climb up there. It can be steep and also slippery. With so many people walking to visit, the stones have become smooth.
The view from the Acropolis is fantastic.
The downside is the eternal renovations that spoil a bit the sight of it.",Oct 2020

Greece,M&M,Acropolis,5.0,The Acropolis of Athens and its monuments are universal symbols of the classical spirit and civilization and form the greatest architectural and artistic complex bequeathed by Greek Antiquity to the world.

Greece,Paul_Cra,Acropolis,5.0,"I feel robbed and extremely sad that there're still companies like Get Your Guide which unprofessionally insult the consumer's trust.
I purchased a regular ticket to visit Acropolis, which resulted validated three days before. At the entrance, the security informed me that this unpleasant inconvenience happens often times when tickets get bought through Get Your Guide.

I called Get Your Guide five times and always received the same vague explanations. One time I've also trusted them when the customer service person promised me to send a new (hopefully valid) ticket. I was relieved...until I realized she sent me back the same invalid one, with the same booking reference and details. a complete mockery!

Greece,Steve B,Acropolis,5.0,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens staying at the Grand Hyatt (Review to follow) and this morning we visited the Acropolis.

The conditions were ideal - a gorgeous Autumnal Day and very few (certainly by normal standards) other visitors. On arrival at the Payment Booth, we opted for the Adult 30 Euros Combined ticket which can not only be used to gain entry to a number of other Attractions (Ancient Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Kerameikos, Aristotle’s School, Olympieion & Roman Agora) but is valid for 5 days.

Although parts of the Acropolis resemble a Building site (and this has probably been the case for many years as so much more work remains to be done) this is a world class attraction and no visit to Athens can be regarded as complete without having witnessed this experience at firsthand. Believe me, there will never be a better time to do so than right now!!

Greece,SpaceAgeDad,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis is the centre of the ancient world and is still an amazing site with its impressive walls and containing the iconic Parthenon and other historical sites. Your approach up a series of ramps and steps to the main entrance with its partially restored Propylaea gives a sense of its importance. The Parthenon is the main attraction and is being systematically restored which means there are building works and scaffolding on parts of the structure. The Temple of Athena Nike and the Erechtheum are the other main extant buildings worthy of a visit. Fantastic views right across the city in all directions from the walls. Several sites around the slopes of the hill such as the two theatres are also worth a look. With the current restrictions there is a marked route around the Acropolis with marshals to guide you but with lower visitor numbers and no crowding this gives good separation and excellent views of all the monuments so this was a great time to visit.

We came at 6PM the site closed at 7PM but it was still nice and enough time to see it all. Only thing is that we been told rudely by the staff “you cannot pose here” which was so out of place because the reason people go there is to also take pictures even though the site was almost empty.. So that was little uncomfortable. To see the sunset we exited and took a little walk to the hill to watch the sun goes down which was super nice!

You are only allowed to bring in water so be warned as we brought some nice slushy drinks and then had to finish them before going in and the people who know your going to the Acropolis won't tell you that you cannot enter with the drinks they are selling.

Arrived early and found the south entrance which is closer to the metro line and museum. Steadier incline to the top with stunning views all round. Some slopes and steps so not wheelchair friendly and not great if you have walking difficulties. Not many hand rails. Due to covid one way system is in place.

Try to go on a cloudy or not so hot day, there is no much shade, like almost to none, and even in a cap i almost got a son stroke. Take water with you as well.

Greece,Travellingdoc,Acropolis,5.0,"Always wanted to come and Sep 2020 was truly a great time.

The entrance was opposite the acropolis museum and I believe there is another entrance on the exit too.

No queues to buy the ticket , could also book tickets at the self ticket kiosk about 100meters before the main entrance.

It cost 20 euros for just the acropolis or 30 if you like to visit the other 6 sites offered in a 5 day period.

We downloaded the free audio from Rick Steves which is about an hour long. The first 20 minutes is a hot hike up to the theatre of Dionysus and then to the Propylaea.

Then through the Propylaea you will see the pantheon in front.

We were there at about 1030am and there we some shady spots. The status of the maidens in Erechtheum was beautiful.

Toward the far end is an amazing view point of the city of Athens. There was toilets half way up near the theatre of Dionysus as well as adjacent to the pantheon.

An amazing place! Wasn’t too crowded on Tuesday 15th September 2020!

We took the path up the metropolis and the sights were breathtaking, it was absolutely beautiful and is worth the uphill walk. You can see the whole city from the top. It is very slippery and rocky so don't make the mistake I made wearing flatform wedges. You need trainers with grip or else you will slip. You have to climb over many rocks and steep slopes, so if you are afraid of heights make sure you have someone to hold your hand. We bought the €30 euro ticket to see all 5 sites which we didn't end up getting to due to the heat (we couldn't hack it lol). It was worth it though the sites are beautiful.

We were advised to use the south entrance as it is less busy and the views are the same, also to avoid late mornings as that’s when most of the organised tours are there.

Greece,Colin Kaljee,Acropolis,2.0,"The only time I've visited a major tourist site in Europe and made to feel very unwelcome, borderline unwanted.

The acropolis was, architecturally, stunning, the views were magnificent and the facilities were pretty good.However, I'd suggest management perhaps invest in some signage, or arrows to indicate the one way system and out of bounds areas, rather than instructing staff to shout at visitors for crossing invisible lines or moving in the wrong direction along lanes whith no visible dividing lines. Teaching the ticket kiosk staff to recognize the acropolis's own online ticket voucher would also be a good start. If you really want to go overboard, why not suggest to your staff that paying visitors are essential and should be made welcome, rather than a nuisance. In essence, an amazing site, staffed by very irritable, officious, unhelpful and grudging individuals, who seemed to view their job as harrying us through as fast as possible.

Greece,Silverleviathan,Acropolis,1.0,"The sights were good and the temples were very impressive but the staff were a huge let down. They were extremely rude and wouldn’t acknowledge the pre-paid tickets my partner and I had already bought, forcing us to purchase even more at full price. They were also very rude and abrupt when telling you where to walk as the paths are not clear at all. The plaques explaining the exhibits are boring and only explain the way they were put together, nothing about what the buildings and things were used for or represented. I’m lucky my partner is an archaeologist so we weren’t at a total loss but I would definitely say to the average person to purchase a guide book as otherwise it is very boring and confusing, not laid out in an interesting way at all. Also there is construction machinery everywhere. Only worth it for the temples at the top of the hill and the views. Also don’t go in the middle of the day as there is almost no shade. If you are a tourist, be insistent and don’t let them scam you out of more money, which they will try to do.

HOWEVER - we loved it and really enjoyed the experience.

I would make sure you bring suitable shoes and water - the shop there only sold fizzy drinks and sugary juices!?!

The tour guides at the top are actually very off putting - they try and outbid each other and get slightly angry at one another. In hindsight I’d pre-book a tour and include the museum.

We did persevere and found Simon a lovely tour guide who did a fab job and took us round for €60+ entry. We were in there over an hour, he was informative and engaging (hard in the heat).

Instead, it felt pretty quiet, and you could really take your time over it. It was extremely hot, and there is not much shade at the top, so please bring a hat and a water bottle (there is a drinking fountain where you can refill). The scale of the whole site (not just the Parthenon) is very impressive and there is really detailed information boards through the place to tell you about the history.

Greece,Lilian Z,Acropolis,1.0,"Visited the Acropolis this evening (because of the heat in the afternoon) with my sister and her 3 little boys. All very excited to see the Acropolis. We bought our tickets at 19:15 but we were not told that you have to start leaving the highest point at 19:50.

We start walking assuming we would have enough time. After 10 minutes a lady tells us we have to walk faster and when we reached the top we were told we had to walk immediately back downstairs.

The way the people were asked to go downstairs was not friendly. It was quite aggressive. The people were treated like cattle and I really couldn't believe my eyes. We had to walk so near to each other because they wanted everybody out at 20:00 o'clock. Walking with so many people so near to each other not taking into account that there is the corona virus.

The stairs are quite slippery and my sister got nervous because of the workers yelling at the people. She fell off the stairs with her 2 year old son in het arms. My nephew of 6 years old also fell off the stairs and the same happened to a man walking behind us.

So I paid 20 euros to go through a gate to be told they will close and then to be treated I a way that was far from human.

Tip 1: tell the people you're closing at 19:50 if they enter after 18:30

Tip 2: find another way to get everybody out of the Akropolis at 20:00.

Read up a lot of reviews as wanted our experience to be the best it could be without a guide and decided an early morning visit would best suit us. We picked up the combi tickets of €30 per adult (the children went free as under 18 and British passports) the previous evening at Hadrian's library. No que which was brilliant.
Got to the Acropolis via the South eastern gate at 9am. Skipped the ticket ques(hurray!!). Walked through the entrance check barriers. Got up the hill and visited all the 8 structures within an hour and 10 minutes, with several little water breaks and several photos at each spot.
By the time We finished and got back down the sun was getting hotter and more people were flowing in.
The climb was easy and the break after each structure made it enjoyable for the children too.

If you're under 25 you're lucky, - student or not.
And to the rule-makers: I would love to understand the logic of how a full time student (in Greece) over 25 has more money (to afford a pretty expensive entrance) than a under 25 year old person with a full time job and full salery. And in your opinion the student must have a lot more money than the under 25 years old person with a full salery because there isn't even a discount. Why do you think that?

We booked a 1.5 hour group tour with Get Your Guide which was a huge disappointment, the information delivered by our guide was muddled and rushed. It would have been better to read from our guidebook as we saw the sights on the way to the top.
We visited Athens in March, the weather was great but more importantly the volume of people was much more manageable to see the sights without huge crowds.
The Acropolis was one of the highlights of our holiday to Athens but maybe think about exploring yourself or with a private guide.

The Greek people have done an amazing job preserving and restoring much of the original structures here. NOTE: Restoration work is ongoing so be prepared for some ares to be closed off and construction cranes may be a challenge to omit from your photos. The site is simply amazing. The engineering skill used by the Greeks to create this place is incredible, especially given the era these structures were designed and built. NOTE: Crowds can be really bad so be prepared. The ascent to the Acropolis is steep and may not be suitable for everyone. Also, bring a jacket. The wind can be quite brisk up there even on a warm day.

Smelling the hot air, watching performances in Herodotus Theatre and having the Acropolis as a crown, looking up in hope. Hope for eternity and beauty. Do visit but also experience as an Athenian would; stroll down the many sokakia, eat a fish or meat ""pikilia"" (tapas plate) at Dioskouri, stroll in all laziness around Dionysiou Areopagitou, go to Psyri for a coffee that lasts for hours.

Greece,Alex J,Acropolis,5.0,"I will not attempt to describe the most important cultural site in the whole western world! Nothing that I write will do justice to this treasure of human civilisation. I will just give two small bits of advice: Firstly go to this place with a guide or join a highly regarded conducted tour. I was on a group tour, and we had a wonderful guide. He gave us an enormous amount of information, and regaled us with numerous anecdotes. You may go only once to this place in your life, don't try to save money by not using a guide! My second bit of advice: it is positively dangerous to go here with inappropriate footwear. The ground is very uneven, and there is a bit of climbing (and descending! coming down is more dangerous than going up!) I saw two people slip and fall. We went on a bright sunny day, so everything was dry. On a wet day, it would be dangerous even with good shoes. So take care!

Greece,Bandit-One,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis in Athens is more than just the Parthenon. There are several buildings, temples and theaters on this world-famous hill.

Of course the Parthenon stands out and is the most famous of the hilltop buildings of the Acropolis. But don't rush up there, there's lots else to see and wander around.

We came in through the south entrance close to the Acropolis Museum. A sunny day, no lines at at all at around 10.30am. A better choice than the main entrance.

It's a nice stroll going up to the Parthenon. Some really nice views on the way. And you will also pass the very impressive Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus, something you might miss out on, when you enter from the main gate.
The biggest crowds are just a the entrance to the top, around the Statue of Athena Promachos and Propylaea.

Once you're on top, you'll be able to really take in the amazing views of Athens. A very large town, suprisingly big. The Parthenon of course is the heart up here and an eye-catcher. But take your time to wander around and to visit the other sight. Most visitors spend maybe half an hour or so. Pic, Selfie....and they are on their way. It's a shame, because the whole area here is full of history and wonderful architecture. Even though hugely popular, it's well worth a visit. It's busy for a reason.

Greece,wendhmagz,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis is a must see for every visitor to Athens – it’s said to be the most important ancient site in the western world. If possible, go first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds. We went mid-afternoon on the day we arrived in Athens as we were leaving the city again early the next morning. It was not the best thing for us to do for when we approached the entrance to the site we were swamped by hundreds of tourist groups talking in very loud voices and pushing and shoving. So it’s better that you enter at the east entrance near the Theatre of Dionysis as tour groups don’t use this entrance.
The ancient temples on top of the hill are gradually being restored. The grandest is the Parthenon, dedicated to Athena Parthenos, goddess embodying the power and prestige of the city. Built in 438BC, it is the largest Doric temple ever completed in Greece and the only one built of white pentelic marble. Restoration of this magnificent structure is ongoing and unfortunately scaffolding is ever-present. Other temples are also undergoing facelifts and most of the original sculptures and friezes have been moved to the new Acropolis Museum and replaced with casts. Tour groups start arriving around 9am so if you can get there earlier you get a head-start. Wear sturdy shoes as the area around the site is uneven, stony and slippery.

Greece,Lakhbir Singh,Acropolis,5.0,"My father lived in Athens for 2 months back in the 70s and I was interested to visit the country first hand myself. I found my first visit spell-binding, very unique and grand, but the temple of the gods was derelict. What was obvious when I went there was the country was falling apart. Lots of grand old buildings graffitied with political slogans

My perspective of Greece was always a Euro football win in circa 2002, and bearded philosophical artistic people, like the ones I met on my degree, so was keen to meet the greeks in there own country.

The country much like downtown Rome has remanence of Byzantine empires and a legacy of greatness which was in the center of the greek people. I was fascinated by the things id heard from the city and went to the Acropolis on the second day.

How will the Plato book I received make sense, compared to the architecture - or the mythology I studied as a child? I was not disappointed this was the place the wrestlers, the gladiators, and the fighters.

It is an iron age fort, a palace to the kings and homer once spoke about this in nietczhes 'birth of tragedy', built to defend the royalty from invaders, it has strong pillars made from stone, a grand entrance and is very high up.

There were only a few other people there, so we took our time and wandered around the site, taking it all in. It was delightful! We actually managed to get some photos without other tourists in them! We saw the imposing Parthenon ahead of us (covered in scaffolding) and headed past the Temple of Athena Nike and on to the far side wall. Looking over, we had a perfect view of the Odeon (Theatre) of Herodes Atticus below. Continuing on, we saw the Theatre of Dionysus and the New Acropolis Museum below. The lookout at the very back provided a beautiful view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch, and the city below. We watched the sun set over the Parthenon and then made our way to the Erechtheion with its magnificent Caryatid statues. It was a truly magical experience!

The Parthenon is undergoing continuing renovations. Temple of Athena stood at the north side of the hill. The statues at the porch of Temple Erechtheum looked amazing.

It is a spectacular sight to see ... crowds were a minimum in mid March so no pre-booked tickets for us .. .just walked in.
I highly recommend the Rick Steves audio tour to give you a basic, light hearted and interesting background to what exactly you are looking at ... I am not a big history buff so didn't want too much information.
We went at 3 in the afternoon .. sunlight was perfect for photos .... Marble stones are very slippy so watch your step all around the area ...
1 hour was more than enough to walk around... it's not a very big area ...
A must visit on your next trip to Athens ..
As for the museum, we whipped around it very quickly .. it's just 5 euros in the winter... Fabulous building and display .. but too much for our interest ... if you are a student or interested in archeology, I imagine this would be like Disneyland for you... but for me it was not so captivating.

Greece,January,Acropolis,5.0,"Not sure why people would come to Athens and not bother with the Acropolis, unless they've seen it before. It truly is a marvel! I only wish that the construction was a lot further along so that I can see more of its previous splendor. However, what's left of it is still cool to see and experience.

I didn't research the venue before my visit but because of how truly great the structures were, it encouraged me to educate myself on the subject afterward. It made me wonder why the restoration was taking so long; why the roofs have all blown off; what the space was originally used for; and the list goes on.

As one of the main attractions of Athens, it makes me wonder why it closes so early (3pm). Even if it's for safety reasons (the grounds are very uneven), surely they can extend hours to 5pm. NOTE: My friend and I got there at 8am and had the place to ourselves for a solid hour until all the tour groups started coming in in droves.

If history or architecture is not your thing but you were dragged to the Acropolis by family, then at least enjoy the 360 degree view of Athens.

Greece,May R,Acropolis,4.0,"the Acropolis and acropolis museum are walking distance from plaka, sitting high up on a mountain in the middle of the city, this beautiful monument is a must see if you’re ever in Athens, even for a day. When traveling in February and March there is no need to book online skip the line tickets as it’s not so busy especially if you went early morning. The attraction opens up at 8:30 in the morning. And if you need a guide you can hire a lovely lady on spot at the attraction site. (Although she did ask for the hefty sum of 100 euros). We ended up getting the 30 euro tickets that included entry to multiple touristic attractions within the city, with the exception of the Athens museum and the Olympic stadium. I would highly recommend purchasing it if you’re doing the one day Athens tour.
At the top, the view of Athens is breath taking and you can even catch a glimpse of the temple of Zeus below.
I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes that have good grip on the ground as the steps are incredibly slippery since they are made out of marble. If with kids, pay extra attention as no fence around the edge.
There are security guards everywhere though.

No major queues when we were there in Feb and E10 seams a reasonable admission price. Plenty to see on top and views all over Athens on a clear day.",Feb 2020
Greece,lapatterson,Acropolis,5.0,"The site is well maintained with informative plaques and impressive ruins. The paths are uneven with many stairs but well maintained. In February the crowds were tolerable, you could get photos without extra people on them if you are patient.
The only cautions I share are lose dog that barked aggressively at people wanting to pass by and a staff person who was cranky at 4:30, wanting people to hurry out.
Overall this was an amazing site, would recommend it",Feb 2020
Greece,JednSasha,Acropolis,5.0,"Well if you have a passion for architecture or history you know you have to visit this site but you don't have to have those passions to visit the Acropolis, indeed travelling to Athens without visiting it seems a bit of a waste of holiday travel.

One of the most iconic buildings/sites in the World standing resplendent on a rocky outcrop in the centre of Athens it can be viewed for miles around, but get closer, walk in the steps of history.

The Acropolis is actually the rocky hill that dominates Athens on which stands the Parthenon or Temple of the Goddess of Athena, to say it is steeped in history is an understatement, completed in 438 BC.

The whole area is riddled with history and places of interest such as the Acropolis Museum the area is a 'Must See' attraction for all ages.

One of the stops with the ""stop on stop off buses"" and easily accessible to the whole area by buses.

Nearby you have the obvious tourist extras of cafés, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops.

Greece,Krishhere,Acropolis,5.0,"A few tips first. (1) Suggest you visit the Acropolis museum before visiting the Acropolis, to get a feel of the history of the ancient city. (2) Read up on the Acropolis online and download a map of the Acropolis on your mobile, before your visit. You don't need a tour guide. (3) if you are visiting Greece during summer like we did, keep in mind it is going to be very hot. Carry water and use sun cream. Proper walking shoes is a must since you have to climb stairs to reach the site. The climb is easy. No worries on that at all. (4) visit Acropolis in the evening, after 5.30 pm so that you can see the Parthenon lighted up. Also a good idea to escape the heat. (5) Buy a ticket online in advance, to beat the queue. Buy either a solo ticket or a combo ticket which covers Acropolis plus other historical sights of Athens

The visit to the Acropolis would take one and a half to two hours. Amazing to think how the Greek built a city on a hill, with such imposing structures with huge columns and beams, centuries ago

We decided to use the East entrance which is the less crowded and take the ancient Peripatos Way which goes around the Acropolis. This was a great way to see the grandiosity of the place, so many different details that you will never be aware if you just go directly to the top. It is also like going really back in time and win your chance to enter the citadel above.

Be prepared that many of the structures are in ruins - it is 2,500 years old after all! My favourite was the view down to the Herod Atticus Odeon - an hemispherical amphitheater intended to accommodate 5,000 people. While the Parthenon is the main attraction, there's also the impressive Propylaia columned structure that you walk through to get up to the top, and another smaller structure, called the Erechthelon, that reasonably intact. It's also a great place to get views of the city.",Feb 2020

The floor is also uneven so wear decent footwear! Walk around the base of the acropolis to see the hidden caves and the fountain. The views are great from the top.

Visiting during what is considered the off-season still drew quite a crowd, so I can only imagine how crowded it is in the summer. As the other reviews state, wear comfortable shoes because its quite a bit of walking/climbing and the terrain is uneven. The site is also very exposed to sunlight, so don’t forget a hat and/or sunscreen. Also, there are quite a few people outside of the park who will try to put bracelets on your arm for “free”. They are not free and it’s a really awkward situation. My advice is either say no and keep moving or plan on bringing a euro or two per bracelet (which are actually very cute).

Greece,Shush,Acropolis,5.0,"Our hotel was very handy for this visit so we just had an uphill stroll to the entrance. We purchased a combined ticket for 7 sites which cost 30 euros each - a great saving on summer prices but check if they are reduced for the winter season as a couple of the places do not need close inspection. We were approached by tour guide who wanted 100 euros for an hours talk a thought she did come down in price - feasible for a group but not just two of us. Wear non slip shoes and there are quite deep steps to the entrance although I think there is a lift. Stunning views and the Pantheon still gives a sense of awe. On reflection we wished we had visited the museum first as they show two interesting films which give background information. Information boards around the site and interesting to see the restoration. Luckily weather was perfect but imagine it is unbearably hot in summer.

Greece,EB1199,Acropolis,5.0,"This is the Acropolis, after all -- beginning of the western tradition in art and urban design. Not much more to day. The restoration since our first visit -- fifteen years ago -- has highlighted the elegance and beauty of this place and these buildings. Leave time to linger and watch the sun change the buildings. It is a bit of a hike up, but we are over 75 years old, took our time and enjoyed the hike up, the splendid buildings and the easy walk down.
Go early to avoid the crowds (not so bad in February), and DO NOT get vouchers in advance which you have to trade in for actual tickets at someplace other than the Acropolis itself. If you are early, there is not much wait to get tickets at the entrance -- we walked right up to the ticket booth at 10 am on a Thursday in February.

Greece,sudhamrs,Acropolis,5.0,"Going to Acropolis in the winter was a blessing. The weather was not cold at all, just a sweater and it was perfect. We went early in the morning just before the Acropolis opened so there were no crowds. Our Tour Manager mentioned that in summer there are line up to even get in and taking pics then becomes difficult for tourists.

Also with the crowds there are lots of pickpockets in summer so we had real relief.

Even though we were told that the climb is tough and difficult which really deterred me, I decided to go with the mindset that if I could not cope with the climb, I would get back and sit in the vehicle.

Everyone who is in Athens should definitely visit the Acropolis. It may seem just like pillars if you go without a guide and do not get the background of the place but the history is very interesting and the views are what you will not get from anywhere else in the city.

Enjoy your trip with this, walk slowly and make some stops along the way and for sure you will be fine and will be able to go up the hill.

Greece,Sohailisd15,Acropolis,5.0,"We visited the Acropolis in January i.e. during the off season time. There were a limited number of people and one could freely wander around the place. Also since it was cold we did not need a lot of water. The place is full of various ancient sites in which some the structure are there while in others its just stones and a history. The main part which is the Parthenon is under repairs however the restoration have been stopped since last year probably due to lack of funds. Since it sits on top of a hill there are various points to see Athens. There are guides who will charge you 30 euro per person for the tour , trust me it not worth it as everything is clearly marked and written down. It should take you a maximum of one and half hour to see the place completely provided there is no crowd. This is must see if you come to Athens

Easy walking around as it was a lovely temperature and there were no crowds. Saw all of the sights on the hill at a leisurely pace. The whole experience was really relaxed and the whole site is beautiful with incredible views across Athens to the sea. I don't know why people go in the summer. I think our experience would not have been as good later in the year. Wear shoes with good grip to feel secure and enjoy. It's one of the best places I've experienced on my travels.,Jan 2020
Greece,Russ Lacuata,Acropolis,5.0,The Acropolis is the most important ancient site in the Western world. It stand sentinel over Athens visible from almost everywhere within the city.

Greece,letsgomama,Acropolis,5.0,"I am mobility impaired. I thought the Acropolis would be one of places that would be off limits to me. We were smart enough to book the Viator full day Athens private tour, and our wonderful driver knew exactly where to take me and who to talk to. (There is a discount for disabled people and their one companion.) He took me as close as possible to the chair lift that goes to the elevator. Without that you are looking at what would for me have been an impossible climb up hundreds of rough uneven stone flights of steps. The lift is a platform that slowly ascends up the long stairway. Those stairs are shallow and doable if you can walk at all. When you get to the top of that you then are taken into an industrial cage elevator that ascends the vertical cliff. This elevator is NOT for the faint of heart; in fact I was asked in broken English if I had any heart problems. I am severely claustrophobic but this elevator, being an open gauge cage, did not bother me at all. It takes you in your chair slowly up the face of that cliff and when you roll out, facing the magnificent parthenon, and slowly roll past the 7 maidens of the temple, you will find you cannot catch your breath because of the spectacular scale and beauty before you. Pictures fail, words fail, nothing can prepare you for the spirit and aura of this place. The views are incredible- all of Athens, Lycabettus hill, churches and mosques, the entire Agora, Mars Hill, the far mountains, even the coast on a clear day. It was difficult to navigate up at the top- much of the terrain is very rough even for my sturdy chair. Even where you can navigate the chair, prepare to have your kidneys rattled. But I am so so so grateful to the extremely helpful and encouraging staff, my family, and my knowledgable driver for making this possible for me. It more than exceeded anything I could have imagined.

Make sure to prearrange or ask for that special lift if you have a disabled person in your group as climbing the rock can be tough for some.

the Erechtheion, and The Temple of Athena Nike just to name the most famous. And then imagining all the pieces missing, the sixth Caryatid waiting to come home and join the others in the Acropolis Museum, and The Old Temple which you can see outlines of, but can only imagine what it once looked like. As we were exploring a storm came in and washed us literally off the Acropolis, but it just added to our adventure.

Our last day in Greece, we went back in the morning, it was gray and dreary, but we took pictures that turned out to be amazingly beautiful. I am not a photographer but the light appears to have been perfect for the pictures. It actually snowed while we were at the top! Be prepared to walk, hike, scramble, and in some places climb a little, and it can be like walking on ice when it rains, but it is truly an awe inspiring site/sight.

There were lots of people there, even in mid-Winter, but the history and atmosphere transported us to a place where we hardly noticed them.

I suggest to visit the Acropolis early in the day when it is less crowded. When we were just about touring the place many people were there which was around noon. The normal price of admission is 20 euro (22+ usd depending on rate) per adult.

Simply amazing how this historic place has survived the times. There is continuous restoration going on.

Greece,Travelfromessex,Acropolis,3.0,"Oh dear, wanted to give it more and it of course remains a must see in Athens but there are some really quite simple things that could be done to improve the experience. Firstly, the route up from the stop of the hop on hop off bus is not signed at all and isn't easy to find without having to double back on yourself. We also thought it ironic that the disabled elevator seems itself to be poorly signed and up a considerable climb (unless we missed something).

There are around a dozen separate parts to the site and it would seem tailor made for an audioguide. There isn't one though and you have to make do with the static signs (in english and greek). A good suggestion on here was to download an 'unofficial' one beforehand but there really should be their own one, as seen after all at the Panathenaic stadium for example. As it was, we were pleased we'd taken some guidebook pages with to assist in interpreting things.

Even still, it's a tremendous place, particularly the Parthenon and the Temple of Dionysus.

We took amazing photos which will be treasured forever..... YES, YOU MUST SEE THIS - bucket list material, for sure.....
The rest of our stay (2 days) was disappointing to say the least - Athens is totally covered in graffiti EVERYWHERE! No real sense of an ancient city - apart from the odd ruin here and there (which looks like it just happens to be ‘blocked off’ and forgotten about)...... doing a hop on hop off bus tour on the 1st jan (as there was nothing open at all!) only depressed us to be honest - we were glad we got the highlight done in high spirits the day before!

Greece,aclayr,Acropolis,5.0,"We arrived shortly before opening to purchase tickets & were not surprised to see a line already formed. We utilized one of the side entrances though, so with only about 10 parties ahead of us, the line moved rather quickly. Once we entered & made our way around to the main entrance, we were met by hordes of people pushing their way up the steps. With our Rick Steves guide book in tow, we decided to take on the monument without a tour guide. (& I’m glad we went this route as being in a tour group just looked like a hassle.) We found it fairly easy to navigate around, & while there were informative plaques throughout, we opted for the descriptions in our book instead. The massive crane inside the main structure was an unfortunate eyesore, but I believe they are currently working on a preservation/restoration project. The views of the city were spectacular though. The ground was very uneven throughout & even slippery in some places, so be sure to wear appropriate shoes. I’d also recommend bringing water & patience as it warms up early in the morning & the number of clueless tourists is absurd.

Greece,Fell-O_TravellerUK,Acropolis,5.0,"If you go to the Acropolis then we highly recommend Rick Steves audio tour. You can download this for free and it is gives a great insight in to site.
If you just enter the site on your own there is very little information available as there are few boards - and having a guide book means you are looking down not up.

The tour lasts an hour, but you can pause it whenever you want to stroll around at your own pace.

It isnt too heavy going but still paints a great picture of just how amazing this would have been back in its heyday.

We can also that in December the crowds are much lighter which means you can enjoy the site more easily, especially if you get there for 9:00 when it opens.

As a final point, the Acropolis nearly always has works going on to maintain it, so dont be too disappointed if a crane gets in some pictures!

The acropolis is very inspiring. Sadly most of it has been rebuilt so it’s hard to tell but is old and male. But the story is almost 2000 years old so one can expect some weathering .

Greece,mel7155,Acropolis,3.0,"Admission fee during winter is €10 per person for above 5 if you are from a non EU country. Pretty expensive to see ruins that should have been better restored . Essentially it is an empty shell as the pollution brought about by the city gas decayed much of the structures more than the invasions, wars this site experienced . The Parthenon was a disgrace as being a super important site to the Western World, has a crane inside the structure that negates and blemishes the importance of the site. It is no wonder the Acropolis did not make it to the list of the new 7 wonders of the world due to the haphazard restoration the site has experienced . Good to visit but you will need to know the backstory of this place to better understand it .

Greece,Frank H,Acropolis,1.0,"On our shore excursion trip to and from Athen’s cruise port, we took bus, train, subway and walk to Acropolis.
1. A couple looks like from Morocco approached us with a widely opened map. We were also having a small map of how to get to the hill of Acropolis from a nearby Subway station. Since we took an opposite direction ( counterclockwise) we had to look around. A decently attired husband asked me something in English. I thought he was going to help me. Instead he put his body close to me, then his wife started to say something. My wife immediately pushed me aside away from the couple. I was saved from pickpocket.
2. On the way back we took a train from Acropolis STN. The train car gradually became full and just two stations before Marathon stadium (a big event at the stadium) it was so full as all pax bodies touched the others. When the train stopped one station before the stadium, my wife suddenly pulled my arm and got out of the car. I followed my wife and stood on the platform. Surprisingly, there was an old Greek (?) man standing by just next to me. I felt a bit strange, but I chased my wife who already inside of another car. I pulled my wife’s arm and brought her back in the same original car. There was the same old man next to me back in the car. Within a minute, a lady in front of us talked to me with Greek accent English (similar accent to my Greek student during my US college time) which somewhat made sense so I replied. Very soon the train stopped at the Marathon stadium - all crowded people got off. We two were left in the train soon arrived in the final destination and walked back to the cruise terminal. I became thirsty and picked up one beer can and tried to pay for the can of beer, I’d noticed, then, that my small coin holder from left hand side jean of front pocket is gone! A bit lucky it had only less than 20 euros. How smart the thief was amazingly. This was one of the funniest pickpocket experiences. The man had his hand in my jean pocket while I was standing at platform!

Better prepared for pickpocket! After this incident I attached a string for a coin holder.
Acropolis was the same condition of my previous visit a few months before the Athen Summer Olympics ant this place is for only one visit - 10 euros each. Note that washroom are available without entering the gate.

Only a couple of things worth mentioning, firstly that the ""real"" entrance to the gorge is actually 1k outside the village, and secondly, the taxi option if you want to return to your car at the top of the gorge is €20 for a vehicle (which we shared, which brought down the cost), and although this sounds expensive, it's actually a fair price as it's quite a long switchback ride back up the mountainside by road. I felt bad beating them down in price when I realised it wasn't a simple jaunt back up the gorge but a fair old hike!

It is a nice walk and very doable for beginner walkers as long as you have some decent shoes.

BUT! 2 warnings. The people in this area are the first Cretes we met that are truly tourist annoying. In the village you will see many signs ""entrance to gorge"" right next to a tavern. Do not stop, its a tourist trap. The real entrance is 1 km out of the village!

The second point is at the end, just get on the first taxi option available, they asked for 4 euros for a trip back up. We continued to the road and there they requested 15 euro for the both of us for the ""taxi"" uphill back to imbros.

It's about an 8km walk downhill from Imbros (if you're driving here from Chania you'll encounter lots of twisty roads, some through small villages and at times stuck behind other vehicles). There was nobody at the guard/information hut so we didn't pay the entry fee until we reached the other end - only 2.50 euro per person. The route is pretty easy to follow and it's just about impossible to diverge from the main track. At the bottom, exit onto the road to find some cafes or restaurants. We went to the Taverna Komitades for a drink and a snack and to use the restroom before hiking back up the gorge (you needn't pay again to go back up - just show your tickets). Although this was more cardio than coming down, we did it in less time as our footing was surer. Definitely recommend going both ways if you can.

When you finish there is a shack and an owner offering taxi rides back to the top and the car....we walked a little further to finish the hike and then had a cold drink in the taverna overlooking the bay ( I’d def recommend doing this as it feels like you finish the walk properly and also get great views over the bay).

Plenty to see on the way down and many photo opportunities.

Lots of different parts to gorge with some sunny, shade, pine tree cover but all wonderful to see. Make sure you are not running through and take time to look up.

3 hours with LOADS of photo stops and a couple of drink and snack sit downs.
Emerged to be immediately offered taxi back up to car and drink at cafe.

However I’m not sure it’s a good trade off as Imbros gorge is mostly the same all the way, walking a dry (in summer) river bed of pebbles and rocks between rocky walls. There are a couple of mildly interesting sights with a rock arch and a narrow part. We saw a few goats and butterflies, but they are not especially interesting or prevalent.

We saw hardly any other people, we were slightly after peak season.

The walk was not challenging for us, semi-fit middle-aged, except the need to watch your footing on all the rocks, which is quite tedious. It was hot but not unbearable. Real hiking boots would have been good, we only used trainers.

Although the scenery was amazing the walk was not easy. Loose stones and rocks made the walk quite difficult. You definitely need trainers or walking shoes if you are thinking of visiting Imbros.
We parked at Imbros next to a cafe for a small charge of 3.5€. A short 50m walk down brings you to the entrance of the gorge. Cost to enter was 2.5€ each. We asked if there was a charge for children and when we told them our youngest was 9, we were told the charge was from 8yrs up, surprise!
The walk took approximately 2.5 hours to cover the 4.2miles,where on exiting there is a fly and wasp ridden shack cafe where you can grab a much needed drink before taking your life into your own hands sat in the back of a pick up truck as the taxi back to Imbros at a cost of 5€ each.

Greece,Paula100,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Lovely walk through the gorge today with our 3 children (4,5 and 7). It was hard under foot and quite challenging for younger children. It’s mostly shaded so good for keeping out of direct sunlight. I would suggest parking at the closest point to the entrance at Imbros vice any of the tarverna’s in the town as you’ll save a 1km dusty walk in at the start. We got a taxi back for our family for 20 Euros from the first taverna on the way out of the gorge and by then our kids needed the rest!",Aug 2019
Greece,ProfBobUK,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We had a hire car (driving from Kavros in about 45mins) and our son decided not to do the walk so dropped us off at the starting point (a km on from Imbros village) and then drove on to pick us up in Komitades village. Before starting we ate in a taverna in Imbros village but the taverna near the official start point looked better. It took us two hours 45 minutes to get to the end of the official Gorge walk - we walked past the first two tavernas right at the end of the walk and went up to Georgios which has a great view over the sea and a friendly owner. The walk is beautiful and well worth while but is challenging as there is no ‘path’ just a dried river bed of loose uneven rocks and pebbles, that became quite hard on the ankles and knees even though we wore good quality hiking shoes. We started at 3pm and only met about 6 people on the way, so most of the time we were on our own in stunning countryside with just goats for extra company. You need to take a litre of water for each person to drink on the way as there’s no services on the walk. Take care as you walk - my wife had a slip on the stones and bruised her knee. I saw another review from two 60 yr olds that completed the walk in just over 2 hours - they must be pretty fit! Our group of three ranged from fairly to not so fit and we kept up a steady pace with a few photo and water stops to complete in two hours 45 mins - I’d allow three hours unless you’re a regular mountain track runner or Ironman. Note that the Gorge walk stops in Komitades village not in Hora Sfakion where we initially planned to end our walk. Luckily we had our son on hand in the hire car to pick us up from Georgios Taverna in Komitades. But even without our car and family ‘chauffeur’ it would have been easy to get back to the start - we were offered a lift twice as we walked from the end of the Gorge walk to Georgios taverna. There’s some great history with the Imbros Gorge from WW2 with Allied troops using it to escape advancing German soldiers - there’s a museum at the top before the start point and it added to our experience to know we were treading in historic footprints. We were pleased to have done this shorter Imbros Gorge walk than the 6 hour Somaria Gorge - after all; a beautiful Gorge for two and a bit hours is just as good as (maybe slightly better than ?) a beautiful Gorge for 6 hours!? Overall the Imbros Gorge was a memorable afternoon’s trek - we all felt a bit creaky at the end which made the beer taste even better than usual.

Greece,Joanna S,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Visited Imbros Gorge today and what a wonderful experience it was. We are two families with four children aged 11 and 14. The walk took 2.5 hours in total comfortably. All of us managed the walk without any problems other than tired legs for the kids. We finished the gorge and walked straight on to the village road passing the first taverna as we had read to avoid this one and man outside was a bit pushy. We visited a family taverna, straight on from the end of the gorge and across the road, over looking the sea. We all ate lovely Cretan food and took a ride back to the top of the gorge in a pick up truck with the taverna owner. The kids loved being in the back of a pick up truck and the ride cost 35 euros for the eight of us. It is not an easy route back and worth the money. We are grateful to previous trip advisor reviews for enabling us to take this trip independently and not pay the 35 euro per person price for an organised tour which really is not required if you have a car.

Greece,TJM,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"Rough Guides mentions this as an alternative to Samarian Gorge so we gave it a try. As you enter the village of Imbros from the North side there are some free parking spots on the right offered by the town, and a cafe who offers free parking (and bathrooms) so long as you promise to come back and eat in their cafe. There are other cafe's a bit further down the road with larger parking lots. And if you drive on through the village for about another 1/2km there seems to be a cafe right above the gorge ticket area which will cut down on the hike to the tollgate and the park entrance.

From Imbros its less than a km to the ticket booth. EUR 2.5 per person issued by the municipality of Sfakia for ""gorge sanitary services."" And it is indeed fairly clean, with garbage bins every km or so.

The gorge itself narrows in places, and opens out in others. It was relatively cool and mostly out of the sun, even on what was a 30 degrees plus day. The trail is quite rocky, so you are best wearing running or hiking shoes.

As you come to the end of the trail there is a small cafe who run minibuses back to Imbros. It is EUR 5 per person for a spot in the minibus, or you can charter the whole thing for EUR 25. If you pass by the cafe at the end of the trail, it looks like another 1/2km or so to come down to the village where there were several coaches / buses parked for organized tour groups, and there is another larger restaurant with signs saying they can organize transportation.

Greece,Jyrki,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Amazing 7+ kilometer walking trip in spectacular nature.

Visited as part of my holiday package and even though I'm well accustomed in trekking in nature, I still managed to pack a bit too much of stuff. Mainly water, because temperature hit over 30 degrees Celcius. Could have managed with two water bottles instead of three (0,75 liter ones).

Pack a good pair of walking shoes, the more of ankle support the better, because terrain is of loose rocks of all sizes, gravel and sand. Watch your step but enjoy the views. I snapped some (terrible =D ) pictures of vultures circling in thermals.

Nice experience and not too tough, even kids can do it. But respect the heat and sun and don't get sunburn ;)

Greece,Steve B,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"I went on day trip to the Imbros Gorge today arranged by Kyriakakis Travel (see separate Review) which - at Euros 18 per adult - was excellent value for money.

The price included collection and dropping off at your Hotel, the services of an experienced Guide and a 90 minute visit to the nearby coastal village of Sfakia. In our case, we entered the top end of the Gorge (far better to descend than ascend!) - after paying the Euros 2.50 entry fee (receipt needs to be retained and shown to the Entry Fee Office at the end of your hike) at 1100 hours.

Depending on one’s fitness levels (this is NOT a stroll in the Park!), how many times you stop, if you’re hiking in a group etc, the 8 Km trail should take anywhere from 90 - 180 minutes. My personal target was 2 hours which I’m glad to report I managed - despite wearing Crocs (not the recommended sports shoes or hiking boots) - to beat by 5 minutes!

That said, I would certainly wear sports shoes for the Samarian Gorge which is not only over twice as long but more difficult. Indeed, tackling the Imbros Gorge first is a very good way of testing one’s suitability for the more challenging Samarian one - for which I gather there are donkeys stationed within the first kilometre to return those hikers who are clearly not going to last the pace!

My only disappointment was not seeing more wildlife (particularly goats who are partial to sharing your lunch!) on the trail but that aside I found it a good - if somewhat tiring - experience and would encourage others to follow suit!!

Greece,Suparaz,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Did this walk on an organised coach trip from Chania , via GS Tours for 70 euros for two adults , starting at 09.30 with just over one hours travel and back about 17.30. Actual walk we did without making stops but just kept a steady stroll and it only takes 1.5 hours despite other people saying 2/3 hours that has to be with stops. This was where thousands of allied troops in WW2 escaped to boats evacuating them to Egypt on the South coast after walking mostly from the North coast and luckily the gorge is so narrow a lot of the way that German fighter planes could’nt shoot at them easily, so interesting from that point too.Would recommend as easy walk, but you could make it harder by walking the reverse way which would harder to do as mainly uphill.

Greece,Fania,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"My husband and I took the public bus from Chania in the morning and initially missed our exit (driver just didn’t stop - we should have been more clear about wanting to get off at Imbros) so we had to take the bus back from Chora Sfakion.

We had a nice meal at the entrance and set out around 12:30.

All in all it took us about 4 hours to reach the end where a little Café waits for you and a taxi service.

As city people with several chronic illnesses and cancer between us, I would say we were not physically prepared for this. I was wearing barefoot shoes which made this an interesting experience for sure. My feet are swollen and bruised and I have one blister but overall I would actually say that I expected them to be in a worse state. My body (mainly the legs of course) is a bit sore too.

We both love nature enough to get us through but we did struggle towards the end.

The hike itself is wonderful. It is very rocky and dry, you are essentially walking in an old dried out river bed. Smaller scree and pebbles are slippery but so are the larger boulders so you really have to watch your step.

We initially thought we’d be able to picknick on the way and have proper breaks but we pushed on with only very brief rests for a drink or some photos.

A little after half way you find a tiny hut for rests where a mule is stationed. There are no signs or indicators telling you how far to go (maybe we missed them).

Overall, definitely worth it but plan for a days rest after.

Barefoot shoes were ok if you’re used to it but with the expectable soreness after. Wearing shoes with full support would have allowed us to go a bit faster but that’s all, but no casual tourist brings full on hiking boots on holiday.

My wife and I are both in our mid 60's and found the Imbros Gorge a very manageable walk. We took it at an average pace and completed it in 2 hours and 5 minutes, including a few short stops to take a drink at intervals. We also took lots of photographs too, which might have cost us some time, but will provide us with lovely memories of a great day. We wore our Brooks running shoes, which were quite adequate for the conditions and we encountered no underfoot water at any stage. There is a nice restaurant at the end of the gorge where the buses await their passengers.

Greece,southerncross100,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We did this hike 2 days ago. We were on our way to the Samarian gorge when the bus turned around and went back to Chania. It turns out the ferry that takes you out back to Sfaria was cancelled due to winds and rough seas(better to find out before hand I guess). The ferry only operates once a day.
After researching some alternatives, we decided to hike Imbros. We thought the parking was free per previous reviews but apparently the parking lot we went to charges €1 per hour but if you buy something they will give you the credit. About 10 minutes down we had to pay a €2.50 per person entrance fee. Was a nice hike, many times walking on very rocky surface as you cross back and forth what would be the river bed after rains. At the end we were offered transport back up the hill for €20 for 4 persons. We waited a while and there ended up being about 7 hikers and they charged €5 per person and took us up in a mini van.

Greece,steviedownunda,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We did the walk from top to bottom towards end of May. The weather was fabulous & the track dry. It took about 2 hours 20 mins at a good pace. Running shoes will work but hiking shoes/boots are best. We caught up to a bus load of walkers so for a while it was a slow conga line. Isn’t it strange how some slow walkers won’t let you pass! It must not be great when it’s busy. The gorge was very deep & it would be great in the wet when the river is running but it would be very slippery as most rocks you tread on are already shinny when dry. Some hikers were going from bottom to top...I’ll bet many regretted that decision. The tavern at the end of the track (yellow one up the steps) has great views but average food & service. The so called taxi back to the car (quite a long long trip back up the mountain, don’t try & walk) was an old Ute arranged by the tavern at 25 euro for a 15min drive. We suspect we were ripped off but you have no other option & the driver has to do the return journey after all. They must make a killing in the high season.

After a short rest the family decided to climb back up. Descending and climbing took us both 1 hour. We enjoyed the 2 1/2 hours trip and stopped in the Taverna (with big car park). Very good Greek food, especially the starters to create mezze. ;-)
Last year we parked the car also here and we walked down completely to the small (first) taverna at the end of the Gorge.
From there we used the 4x4 taxi pickup truck to return (20 Euro and a fun ride) to the car park.
There are a lot of reviews about footwear: trainers will do, walking shoes are better.
Don’t worry, this Gorge can be finished by kids, parents, grandparents and goats.

I would not recommend this walk for the elderly or young children.

Fortunately, a local man brought us back to Imbros village where we had parked the car. €20 for the ride seemed reasonable; it’s quite a long way and then he had to return.

The ""taxi"" ride back up to your car, if you choose to park and hike, is really scary and you will probably sit in the bed of a pick-up with a driver who you just saw chug a beer.",Oct 2018
Greece,Relaxseeker037,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"The walk is approximately 8km (5miles approx.) in length. Your first decision is how to reach the start at Imbros which is situated on a high pass road. A hire car would be the obvious choice but if you would rather not drive then an organised tour is a good alternative and has the major advantage that your tour bus will meet you at the end rather than you retracing your steps up through the gorge or having the expense of a local taxi (often a pick-up truck) to ferry you back to your hire car.
The walk itself is a steady down hill descent but it has loose stones/rocks underfoot throughout so for the sake of the underside of your feet, we would strongly recommend the use of walking boots where the additional sole thickness will offer considerable protection from the constant uneven surface upon which you are walking. If you possess a walker’s pole then this will provide additional support as you make the impressive but straightforward descent. There is a loo facility of sorts about half way down although you would be wise to make a loo visit at the building where you purchase your ticket at the very start. You need to retain your ticket to be handed in as you exit the gorge at the bottom in order to allow those administrating the gorge to check that everyone is out at the end of the day. Walking at a very steady pace and taking numerous photos resulted in an approximate three hour walk. There is more than one eatery close to the exit. A most enjoyable and exhilarating morning’s walk which we were very pleased to have done.

Greece,Sylviane M,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"You walk down a beautiful gorge and that's the best bit. Took us 3 hours with photo stops and lunch break. The path was very rocky (wasn't last time I did the walk), decent shoes recommended. If you arrive by car and stop at the first car park on the right, you will be asked to pay 1 euro (no receipt) or to have a drink at the small taverna (which we did). If you stop at the large car park on the left, it is the larger taverna's car park and they will expect you to have a drink there. There is an entrance to the gorges further away if you want to avoid this. The return is trickier. Most buses are until mi-day and the last one leaves Hora Sfakion at 6.30pm. The local tavernas offer a ""taxi"" service (that is taking you in their car, no receipt), it was extremely unpleasant, people asking for 20-25 euros for 1-5 persons (it was 2 of us), telling us that it was the only option etc. There was still the bus to be honest. We started hitchhiking and the (foreign) woman who stopped got abuse from the locals. This was my most unpleasant experience in Crete in 20 years. There was a time when having a meal at the taverna was getting you a ride. Nowadays you are prayed upon in a rather agressive way. End of season was not helping I guess. So be prepared.

We found plenty of other free parking options in Imbros and its such a small place it will add maybe one minute to your walking time. The gorge itself is an amazing walk. At the far end I strongly recommend to carry on walking past the first taverna and head for the village of Komitadhes. The first taverna is still in the gorge and there are no views. If you'll walk only 5 minutes further down the path you will come to the village and be rewarded with stunning views of Crete's South coast. We stopped in Dionysis Tavernas which was very good. Every taverna in the village can organise a taxi back to Imbros. It cost us 5 euro each and takes about 15 minutes back to Imbros.

You can park closer to the entrance further down the road at another taverna.

Dont let the owners threaten you about the 'fact' that 'it is very far to the next taxi'. Not true! There are many other possibilities for hiring a taxi. Just walk on for a few hundred meters.

Greece,Claudia L,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Gorge tips: starting from the top (Imbros) much easier as it’s mainly downhill. The hike starts south of the village by a taverna and is signed ‘Main entrance to Imbros Gorge.’ (Note: there is another taverna with parking closer to the village signed ‘entrance to Imbros Gorge’ but it will add another 20 mins onto your hike.
Entrance to gorge is 2.5 Euros per person. Keep your ticket as they check at the other end.
The village at the end of the hike doesn’t have a lot going on. It’s 20 Euros for taxi back up - that seems to be the price per carload rather than per person. So whether 2 or 4 people, it’s 20.

Greece,DIDDYDOM,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Great walk and would recommend over the Samaria as it is shorter, easy to organise (transport etc) and cheaper.
Parking - if parking at the top, park in the first car park you come to ‘katinOrisma’ tavern I believe, this is the actual parking for the gorge (massive yellow signs also)
Cost - Parking, free. Enterance! €2.50 per person in 2018
Walk overview and difficulty - my Apple Watch logged 7.8km, and as quite a confident walker it took me around about 3 hours (including a few photo stops) I would allow for 4 hours one way to be safe. Underfoot, the surface is pebbles and rocks, not overly difficult to walk on but not the easiest - good shoes definitely recommended.
Return to car park - the first taverna you come to is a little shack of a pack (with the cutest puppies) they offer drinks and a ride back up to the top.. they have a little minivan with seatbelts etc and it cost €5 per person - cheap and worth the money.

Imbros town is further down if you walk past the above mentioned taverna, we did not walk to it but drove through and look a little dead and quite - not much to do or see you can probably get other €5 taxis down in the town but I did not see any, only saw the official taxis that would most likely cost about €25 given that it took us 20 plus mins to drive back to the car park.

I would not start at the bottom as although only gentle, the incline would mean that you would most likely be very exhausted by the end.

Kit list:
Plenty of water (no shops/water points on the walk)
Food (no shops on the walk)
Sturdy footwear, nothing too major but solid trainers not flip flops!
Camera
Hat
Sun cream
Fly repentant
Sensible clothing as limited shade on route

Suitability: most can enjoy this walk, but you need to be fully able, as it is not easy underfoot so any injuries will be exacerbated, no wheel chair access, children can easily do this but as above Make sure they are covered up well and have plenty of water.

Walk review: a must for anyone who wants to witness something natural, beautiful and steeped in history.

If you have any questions please let me know - this is less of a review and more of a guide as I found there was very limited clear information before I went on the walk.

Greece,Richard P,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"his is a relatively easy walk if you're used to hiking. I took poles with me but they're totally unnecessary. The poles did come in handy occasionally. The trail is about 1/4 dirt path, 1/4 groomed Trail and 50% dry riverbed. There is a taxi service at the bottom but there ought be a flat rate price for a full taxi/truck, seems like our trip was overpriced.",May 2018
Greece,Ruth C,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"For walkers who need a challenge then this is not the gorge for you, however, it is really pretty and a nice gentle walk to the coast. The entrance is well marked by a taverna however you can start from the Imbros itself. This was the only gorge apart from Samaria where we paid but it was only 2.5 euros per person. At the bottom of the gorge on the right is a family selling cold drinks who collect up a people carrier and take them back up the gorge for 5 euro per person. We heard it's 20 euro per car at the road, or you can catch the public bus back up or walk... it's perfectly possible to do this in under 3 hrs both ways.

Greece,skal65535,Imbros Gorge,2.0,"Not the best gorge around (prefer Aradhena): it wide and flat most of the time. And crowded.
Best is to start from the bottom (free parking at Komitades). Then walk the way up for ~4km and you'll see all there is to see: at ~1km, there's the wide arch. At 3.75km, there a very narrow passage with few twists (right after the tavern). Nice morning activity, good views, but that's it.
Note the historical aspect though (Allied troops retreat passage in 1941).
Entrance fee: 2.50euros. Keep you ticket to show at exit.

Greece,mjb98105,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We almost didn't go because of March review noting that the trail had deteriorated badly. We did the trail on April 18 as did many other people. We are 68 years old and my wife has an artificial knee. It took just over two hours and there were no sections that required scrambling. Yes, footing is uncertain because it is rocky, so look where you put your feet. Good shoes are a plus. We were pleased to have hiking poles for added stability but most people did not have them.",Apr 2018
Greece,peterbaker2018,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We walked the Imbros Gorge today and very much enjoyed the experience. We started at the Imbros end travelling down towards the village of Komitádhes. It is suggested that you wear a good pair of shoes/boots for the gorge walk as the walking is stony underfoot. It's also a good idea to take a hat, some water and food. Contrary to another review we found the entire gorge perfectly walkable as long as you're not expecting the terrain to be as smooth as a supermarket car park - if you are reasonably fit you will manage.

If you travel down the Gorge towards Komitádhes, you can also go onwards to the town of Hóra Sfakíon which is a further (approx) 4km walking distance from the end of Imbros Gorge. This town is well worth the visit and has the added bonus of return bus travel to Hania (if that is where you started your journey). It's not necessarily safe to trust the published bus times as we found that the last bus left well before the advertised time of 6:30pm.

Greece,Cretamania,Imbros Gorge,1.0,"Imbros used to be one of the prettiest and easiest gorges in Crete. However, recent heavy rain has brought down rocks and scree (some of the scree was still active in early March) in many places and washed away the path in others. What was a lovely 2 or 3 hour amble is now a 5 hour scramble for a person who is fit and used to walking.",Mar 2018
Greece,AJHUCK,Imbros Gorge,3.0,"I think we are spoiled from having lived in Colorado and hiking the rockies, but this was underwhelming. The trail is mostly rocky with not a lot of wildlife or amazing views. There were some neat parts like where the gorge narrows towards the end. It only took us about an hour to hike down. At the end you will get the locals trying to persuade you to pay to get a taxi (truck ride) back up. We chose to continue towards Hora Skafia (too far to walk on windy roads so needed a taxi which we found at a nearby taverna). Definitely recommend the trip over to Hora Skafia that was the highlight of our day. Beautiful turquoise water, little coves, nice waterfront village with shops and cafes. If you want to catch the bus from there back up to Imbros make sure you get it by 1:30 pm or it doesn't go again until 6:30 pm. (Otherwise you will pay 25 € for a taxi). Overall still a great day but we would have preferred Samaria Gorge if time wasn't a limiting factor.

It is walking on loose stones all the way! It was a day of trying not to slip on the stones, looking at where i am putting my feet and having to stop every now and then to remember to take it the views. I can not say how much easier it is as we only did this one, but it was a lot easier and quicker walking back up than the walk down.
Two days later and my legs are reminding me of skiing holidays, i would not do this walk agiain, but will definitely ski again.

Greece,ajhotspur,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Really enjoyable walk with some beautiful and stunning scenery yesterday. I cannot compare to Samaria, but for an easy but thoroughly enjoyable piece of Cretan scenery, here are some notes.

The cost is €2.50 per head
The length of the walk is variable!
At the top in Imbros, there are at least a handful of signs saying start of walk, but the start proper is at the most southerly point of the village. It is a very short walk from the nearest parking spot.
At the bottom of the walk, cars wait to taxi you away if you want or you have to walk a couple of hundred yards to the nearest taverna/parking spot.
Taxis are €5 per head if shared or €18 if you hire the whole taxi.
The core part of the walk is less than 4 miles and (with a 10 minute drink break and a good number of short stops for photos) walking down took less than 2 hours. Adding the bits at the top and bottom is what makes it variable. Oh and yesterday, there were a lot of people, so this probably made us walk quicker!
I would advise good walking shoes as there are lots of loose stones and a few bits of scrambling to be done, but didn't see anyone with lesser shoes twist an ankle.
Take water - even in October, especially in the stretch at the bottom, you are rarely walking in shade and it was hot.
Be polite! With people travelling both up and down, at some points you needed to give way to let others pass, it would be so much nicer if a thank you was given, in whatever language you are comfortable - it's the thought that counts.

Greece,CWT,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We chose to hike the Imbros Gorge instead of Samaria because the logistics were easier and it would not take the entire day. We arrived in Imbros at 9:30 am. If entering the village coming from Chania, you will see multiple signs for parking. The best spot is at the Porofarago taverna which is the main entrance to the gorge. We parked beside the Kalinorisma taverna which meant we just had to walk a little bit further. It was a very nice hike. It was easy going although you do have to watch your footing when walking on the loose stones (recommend running shoes). It took us two hours. We encountered less than a dozen other hikers and 3 goats. At the end of the trail, we just stopped at the first spot offering taxi rides. Because we wanted to share a ride back, we waited until other hikers came along. Four of us then took a pickup truck out of the gorge and then transferred to a car to take us back to Imbros. Cost was 5E a person. It’s an 18 km ride back to Imbros along a switchback road and the ride was part of the fun of the day.

Greece,George Tsampas,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"It is one of the easier gorges in Chania. You need about 2,30 hours to pass it. It has many interesting elements, particularly in the first half. You can find the entrance very easily.",May 2017
Greece,HundredWattBulb,Imbros Gorge,3.0,"Imbros Gorge is a medium length gorge not yet overrun by hikers. The tour of ~8 kilometers can be completed in roughly two hours with a small fee (2.50€ in 2017) at the entrance of the gorge. While the scenery is nice, it does not have any particular highlights apart of a stone arc and a narrow point of 1.60 meters with steep cliffs on both sides making for a beautiful view. Since the path is completely made of pebbles, you won't have much time for sightseeing anyway as you have to watch your every step. Sturdy shoes are recommended.

You can start the tour in Imbros, walking downwards, or at sea-level going upwards. At both starting points there are several taverns and parking spots, more so in Imbros. Be careful, parking is not free everywhere, sometimes depending on whether or not you eat in the tavern. No matter where you start, walking back through the gorge is the best option to get back to your starting point! Otherwise, returning becomes quite difficult. The distance on the road is ~14 kilometers. A public bus only comes two to three times a day, so carefully plan in advance and check for departure times. There is no bus stop at the southern entrance, you will have to walk to the closest town. The other lazy option is taking one the ""taxi services"" offered at nearly all taverns, at least at the southern entrance. Fees rank from 5 - 20something euros - the closer to the gorge exit the cheaper. No matter where you decide to book your taxi ride, in all cases it seems to be a private car with conditions ranging from ok to bad. Other hikers told us about about a ""taxi"" trip they took some time ago on the loading space of a pickup truck. So, as said before: plan ~5 hours for your trip and simply walk back through the gorge, it's the best option!

Greece,PhandEm,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We really enjoyed our walk through the Imbros Gorge. We were staying in Aptera near the north coast so it was an interesting, beautiful (and winding!) drive through the mountains to Imbros village at the head of the gorge. We parked in the Taverna Kalinorisma car park, which they are very happy for you to do. The lady there was very friendly and welcoming and it is a good place to eat when you get back. There is a path right there leading to the start of the gorge and it took us about 2 to 2.5 hours to walk to the village at the bottom. It is a delightful walk and very manageable for most people. I suggest getting a reasonably early start to avoid the main heat of the day (although much of the walk is in shade). After being messed around trying to find a taxi in the village at the bottom, we ended up taking the pickup that you can arrange with the small drinks place at the end of the gorge before you reach the village. I don't understand some of the negative comments about this service. It seemed perfectly fine (and inexpensive) to us and took us back to our car with no problems. The walk is a perfect preparation for the Samaria Gorge walk, which we did a few days later and which is much longer and more demanding (and generally on a grander scale), but Imbros Gorge is worth visiting in its own right.

Greece,Margrieta K,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"The good things of the Imbros Gorge (canyon) is that you can walk through this canyon all year around. Even in the winter season. The Imbros is less crowded than the Samaria Gorge, which also is a big advantage.

As the difference in hight is 500 meters, you can opt for walking up to Imbros too. We went down from Imbros, and took a 5 euro a person 'taxi' back to Imbros in one of the trucks, that is driving off and on for this aim.

The walk is about 7 km, keep your entrance ticket (2,50 a person), as you have to show it again at the exit. Half way there is little cabin, with a French toilet. No options to buy drinks in September, so advisable is to take water and some food with you.

Most of the time you will walk on the stones, but some times you need to climb a little. Wearing sneakers is okay, but walking shoes are preferable. We took two hours for the walk, and had 3 short breaks under way.

Greece,RatchetAce,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"I think the other reviews give a good flavour of what to expect. Firstly hire a car. Its wide roads with little traffic and Imbros (or Impros as it is on our Tom Tom) is easy to find. We started at 9am to avoid the heat and in September that meant that because of the steep sides of the gorge we didn't really see the sun until the bottom. We are early 50's and not fitness fanatics but walked (I had boots but my wide was in trainers) the gorge in 2 hours which in a way was a little disappointing. There is a good sized car park at the first entrance and a smaller (about 30 cars) parking area at the second entrance. There is also a Taverna at that entrance where everyone uses the loo. There is no water or loo on the way down so be prepared. Several taverna's at the bottom all of whom offer taxi rides. From what we saw they were all double cab pick ups so not taxi's as we would think of them. Unless you enjoy fairground rides make sure you sit inside - we did. I wouldn't want to be in the back where there were no seat belts. Its a very windy road and you are being thrown around at speed. Our driver never had two hands on the wheel despite there being many 180 degree corners. Enjoy!

Greece,Donna62Montreal,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"The gorge walk was lovely and not too difficult going from the northern entry point down to the South (the opposite would have been difficult in the heat). There were some spectacular views that I am very glad to have seen.

The ride back in the ""taxi"" (pick-up truck) has HORRIFIC !! The driver raced around the blind corners with blatant disregard for our lives! I asked him very politely, twice , to please slow down as we were all frightened. He sneered at us and went even faster, despite me being polite and asking in Greek. I would NEVER have gotten in had I known! We were trapped and afraid for our lives ! I considered calling the police afterwards but I was unsure how to proceed or if they would care. Hopefully the bus is better.

The restaurant/drink vendors at the end of the hike will tell you that you are paying 5 € for a taxi or a bus (I heard her say this to a group of four), but in fact it will probably be one of these pick-up trucks. They receive a commission for each full truck load (I saw the driver giving her a Euro).

One day many tourists will be killed -- don't be one of them ! Ensure you get the bus, or, if you are up to walking back, that would be another great option.

There is a little shack about half way through the walk where you can sit & eat what you've brought with you & distance markers too so you know how far you've gone. We saw goats on our walk, a small lizard & lots of wild fig trees. There are some very pretty areas to stop & take photos. Wear comfortable walking boots/ shoes. We went via a coach trip. There are toilets at a taverna as you get to the start & parking available if you drive there, but your have to walk back too if you need to collect your car from the same place, so i would recomnend doing this via a tour.

There is a taverna at the top of the Gorge and a loo. The entry cost was €2.50. It is a lovely walk along the old riverbed. We saw sheep and sure footed goats. We were glad we were wearing sturdy light weight walking shoes as it is very easy to trip, slip or fall. Shoes with a good grip are really important. We came across a couple who were really struggling wearing deck shoes. I'm also glad I bought my walking stick as it gave me extra balance though most managed fine without it. There is a taverna at the bottom and taxis. We met our coach at the taverna outside the Gorge - fantastic view of coastal plain below. Glad we did it but must confess I was glad to get onto less slippery ground (slippery because of the nature of the dry stony riverbed)

Greece,David P,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"First gorge walk abroad and what a great introduction. Much shorter than the neighbouring 16km Samaria Gorge at 5 miles or 8km. You are walking down a dry river bed so it’s going to contain rocks all the way so be prepared for that but can be done in normal trainers or even flip flops at a pinch. There is no water in the gorge so you need to take your own, there are toilets at the start and half way down with a rest area, just before the end are two tavernas and outside the end are 3 restaurants. There are rubbish bins along the route for you to use, please use them :-)

The scenery is just stunning all the way through and at the narrowest point, 1.6m, you can touch both sides of the gorge walls if your arms are long enough, mine were :-)

You start in the Imbros plateau, which is much lower than the Samaria Gorge, so the rate of descent is far easier than Samaria but don't be fooled, you can still easily slip on the rocks and injure yourself, take care.

It can be very hot in the gorge even though there is plenty of shade in places, you still need suntan cream though and the wind blows through some sections and can be welcome at times but it can also be an unwelcome hot wind near the end and with the rocks in full sun can feel like an oven at the end of the gorge.

Entry is €2.5, take the correct money and you need to keep your ticket to show at the exit or you pay again!

The Gorge is open all year unlike Samaria which is closed in winter due to flooding!

Take the time to enjoy the gorge, don’t run down it!

The scenery is amazing. At the narrowest point if you have long arms you can touch the walls on either side.

Imbros starts much lower than the Samaria Gorge so the rate of descent is much less than Samaria but you could still easily slip and injure yourself.

It can be very hot and still but at times the wind rips through some parts and can take you by surprise.

You do need to be relatively fit and should wear walking shoes. Walking poles are also useful. Good luck..

Greece,annewinponthir,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"If you don't fancy walking the Samaria Gorge, try the Imbros Gorge it is much easier to walk and much smaller in size than the Samaria Gorge at just over 8km.
My husband and I had a rented a car for our stay and decided to go to the Imbros Gorge. The scenery on the drive to the gorge with the mountains in the background was breathtaking.
We did not have a problem finding the Gorge as it was sign posted as we got closer to it. There was no problem with parking and there are toilets there if you need them before you enter the Gorge. The entrance to the Gorge is signposted, after walking a short distance through the ravine you will see a wooden hut where you pay an entrance fee of €2.50 each.
Imbros is easy to pass, it has no dangerous points, you can walk it without a guide and is ideal for families. Younger children may find it too long to walk as will those with mobility issues. You can see various caves and vegetation consisting of Cypress,Oak,Maple trees as well as other trees and some flowers. The Gorge itself was breathtaking. We also passed lots of goats along the way and saw female goats feeding their young. It took my husband and I three and a half hours to walk down, due to us taking so many pictures.
At the end of the Gorge you can get a taxi back to your car at the start of the Gorge, the cost is €5 euros each.
But be warned. My husband and I, plus an American couple didn't expect the ride back to our cars that we expected.
If you take a taxi from the Lady selling drinks, who you will come to first at the bottom on the Gorge and asks you if you want a taxi. Expect a hair raising journey including off road action without seat belts in a pickup truck, fortunately my husband and I were sat in the cab, the American couple were not so fortunate and sat in the back. We were taken off road to eventually a village, where we were asked to transfer into a car also without seat belts and taken the long way round, 20km back to our cars at speed, overtaking on bends and brough of hills with steep drops and no barriers. We assume the man who drove us was a member of her family and not a taxi driver. He went off road and the long way round not to be seen by the proper taxi drivers who were further along the bottom of the Gorge, where there are a couple of taverners.
So please be careful, we would not wish the experience we had on others.

Greece,Martynas G,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We had completed hike with 2 kids (6 and 10 years old). First of all - there is no point in paying any agency for this trip. Ticket officially costs 4 Euros, so think about it. 50 Euros for a car rent, and about 10 for coming back, plus 8 euros entrance, you have 68 euros for four persons instead of at least 45 per one person from agency. Car access is perfect - Imbros has many free parking places. they are starting to play game - ""leave a car ""for free"", but you need to buy something in tavern after you come back"". This is actually not nice thing because you pay gorge entrance fee anyway and come back to parking anyway. Gorge is about 8km, maybe more, cause it actually starts earlier in Imbros village. Comparing to 18km Samaria gorge that looks really terrible, I would say its not so much of a difference. why? because Imbros terrain is actually ""soft"" and that makes path harder to walk than Samaria, loose rock everywhere, you need to be very focused when you walk. I would say 8km of Imbros is something like 70% of Samaria's. Not fit enough people might feel that its quite slippery, not stable and exhausting. Positive - path is really nice, a lot of shades, trees, alternative path ways - really free exploration. No water sources in the path, but 2 liters was sufficient for 4 persons. I would say Samaria was something nice to complete, Imbros was something nice to view. When you come down - there is a first tavern that offers taxi services. we took a car for 15Euros for four and had a ride in a nice trunk of a car with open view, fast drive - kids just loved it. we also ;). I believe you can get something cheaper in the village, but we just saved time.
I strongly would not recommend starting gorge from the bottom- its a lot harder to walk, unless you're up to a challenge. Walking took 4.5hours for us with some stops, photo shoots, no rush.

Make sure you bring water because there is no place to purchase once you go into the gorge. The hike isn't extremely strenuous, but it's a rocky surface - so wear good shoes and be cautious if you are older or not in shape. We saw some goats during our hike and took many great pictures during the 2 1/2 hour hike. At the end, you can either hike back again (which is then uphill) or pay for a local guy to transport you back to the parking lot in his pick up. It cost us 30 euros for 8 people. We ended up having about 15 people total in the pickup truck as most of us were crammed into the back portion. The driver was taking hair pin curves at a pretty good speed - so if you don't like crazy drivers - beware. I had fun with the ride and tried not to think about how close we came to dying!!!

Greece,GoalieMarty,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a hiker and I don't particularly enjoy this type of activity. However, I am glad I did this walk. Here are some of my observations:
- Park at the second spot which is on the right side of the road if you are heading south, in front of Paragora tavern, about a kilometre after the first parking lot. This way, you are much closer to the entrance of the gorge.
- Bring plenty of water, wear good shoes (no flip flops here), don't forget your hat and sunscreen, and go early if you want to avoid the heat.
- I found that you constantly have to look down while walking to make sure of where you are stepping. Lots of loose rocks and uneven terrain.
- The scenery is beautiful and you have to stop often to take it all in, especially if you are looking down like I was while walking.
- It took us a little more than two and a half hours with plenty of stops to rest and take pictures.
- It was not too hard for our kids (14 and 11 years old). The youngest one was actually leading the way most of the time.
- Once you exit, there is a restaurant on the other side of the road. A gentleman drove us in his pick up truck, back to our starting point for 20 euros. We told him we like a smooth ride and he drove very gently.
- The road back is not that scary. Yes, many hairpin turns but the pavement is smooth and the road is wide enough. This new road was built 6 years ago. You do get very high in the mountain and the view is gorgeous.
Would I do this hike again? Probably not but I'm glad I did it.

We wound up carrying the younger kids, and listening to the older ones complain. For a minute there I thought it was just us (and our ""spoiled"" kids) but we passed many such scenes along the way. If it was 3-4km I think it would have been perfect but at 8km (with no water anywhere of course) - it was too much for such young ages....apart for that the view itself was fine. The ride back was terrifying - as is depicted by many people - but THAT the kids absolutely loved... go figure.

We did it at full speed (1.5 hour), but I recommend taking the time to breathe and look around. It is beautiful. We took the first black pick up truck (taxi) we saw at the end of the gorge and that was a mistake. The guy drove like a crazy person an was very rude. For my kids and husband who were sitting in the back, it was not a funny ride. I suggest to walk a little further at the end of the gorge and pick someone else.",Jun 2017

Greece,Julie C,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Lovely place with spectacular scenery, particularly where it narrows. We did the 8 km walk in 2.5 hours and I am not super fit or sure footed so we did not rush. You do need decent footwear, trainers minimum, not sandals, hiking boots preferred. We parked for free in the cafe at the top and used their toilet,. There is no charge but we did buy a drink as only fair. At the bottom of the gorge, there is another bar where you can get a drink and they order a taxi for you to take you back up to the car park. The taxi is an open pick up truck. If you are a large group or you share with other people, likely people will have to sit in the back of the truck with no seat belts and if you get the one we did ( black truck), the driver goes off road and then navigates hair pin bends with a steep drop down the side overtaking coaches and cars en route at an alarming speed. it is the scariest roller coaster ride you ever had and we laughed about it afterwards, but frankly it was dangerous, and sooner or later could end badly.for someone. If you have to go with him, at least be sure to all sit inside with sear belts and a roll bar..

It is fairly easy downhill hike and at the end it was easy to get transportation back to the starting point.

Greece,111robin,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"we wanted to go for a hike but not spend the whole day doing it so we decided to walk down the imbros gorge it took us 90 min. to get to the bottom and then we took a private taxi back to the top where we parked our car. the walk was enjoyable but I wish I had brought my walking stick with me but I did fine without it. you walk on a lot of rocks so you need sneakers or hiking boots to go down. the four of us wore sneakers and were fine.
at the base their is a group of people that will take you back up the mountain in their pickup truck and if you have multiple people some will have to sit in the back of the pickup. we did not do that because I wanted everyone to have seatbelts however, in hindsight my two older children would of loved that! we walked a little farther and got a car as a taxi it cost us 20 euro for the 4 of us.
the ride back up the mountain is on winding, curvy roads that overlook the water and you go up quite high. for me the drive was terrifying but the man driving the car noticed how frightened I was and slowed down. my husband and daughter loved the ride
you can hike back up as well if you want to as we saw people going up as well
I would say it is a fairly easy hike down
be careful when driving though as their were very cute goats everywhere in the roads and they did not have a care in the world

Greece,James F,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We drove ourselves to the Gorge. The start point is deceptive, as you enter Imbros you’ll see Gorge start signs and parking, if you park here you’ll have an extra 1km to walk to the Gorge start point. Drive through the village until to see a large yellow building and a sign stating “Main Entrance Imbros Gorge” – see photos. This takes you down to a small hut where you pay your €2.50 entrance fee. The walk is straight forward but over mainly loose ground. If you have ankle/knee/hip conditions, this may not be for you as once you’re on the route there’s no way out. At the half way point, there is a small refuge which was manned when we walked the route. At the bottom, there are plenty of places offering a white-knuckle ride back to your car for €5 (May 17). Although relatively short walk, you need to be prepared. Wear proper shoes and take plenty of water.

The ground is very rocky in some places so I recommend hiking shoes or good sneakers. Walking poles are not needed if you do not want them from other aspects. The trip is 8 km and takes about 2-2.5 hours. Get started early and you get a relatively shady and cool walk. The most spectacular is when but coming to the area where the walls are so tight that it is possible to touch both at the same time. Towards the end you come to a arch/ vault that can actually be missed if you go from the sea upwards.

At the end of the walk we found out that there is a taxi service available from one of the tavernas' at the bottom of the gorge back to your car (i.e. you dont have to walk back up the gorge). So, you dont have to go with a tour.",May 2017
Greece,Brenda A,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"My two friends and I decided to walk this gorge since Samaria was not yet open. One of our group decided to take the day off and it was probably a wise decision for her since her ankles are not strong. The walk was not difficult but it is rocky so footing can be a bit tricky. I hasten to say it is worth it! This ancient river bed is quite beautiful especially in the spring when we were there. It was not very busy either, but that was because it was not full tourist season. At the end of this lovely hike, there are a series of small cafes and most of them also offer a ride back to the top of the gorge where our car was parked. I think we chose the best one...but who knows? We had a tall refreshing glass of the freshest fresh orange juice I have ever had! ;). Then after we rested for a while with the family ( grandma, dad and son) we hopped in the Nissan pickup with the son driving and headed up a steep gravel road with a breathtaking view and onto the main road back to where we started. This ride was a definite highlight! The young man was personable and also a great driver. We could see the ocean and Frangokastelli far below. Thrilling and worth the euros we paid. Better than a bus!
I would recommend this hike, especially if you don't have time or physical stamina to do the longer Samaria gorge.

Greece,Nicola T,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We were in Crete just outside of tourist season and Samaria Gorge was closed. However, wanting to get out for a walk and see the fabulous famous gorges of Crete, we found Imbros. We drove down to Komitades and then took a taxi back up to Imbros. The road between these two towns is worth doing, even if you don't do the hike - it's a succession of switchbacks taking you down the mountain. Probably not for those who easily get car sick. The taxi cost us 25 euros for the four of us, which we thought wasn't a great deal, but we weren't really ready to spend a lot of time seeking out the best deal. The woman who took us in her car clearly needed the money more than we did, so we were fine with it. She dropped us off at the entrance to the gorge and we hiked down to the gatehouse where it was an EXTREMELY reasonable 2 euros each to do the hike. This money goes toward maintenance, garbage collection etc and having done it, we would have easily paid double this. The gorge is under 8 km long and with a 9 year old in tow, this was the perfect length. Keep your ticket that you get as there's a gatehouse at the bottom and they will want to stamp your ticket. Lots of people with kids were also walking up the gorge and I shouldn't think this is too taxing at all. About mid-way the gorge narrows to less than 2m wide, which is simply stunning and the wind howls through making it even more dramatic the day we did it. We were in running shoes and found the terrain easy to navigate, though there is obviously lots of cobble and loose gravel, which some can find a bit taxing on the feet and ankles. Highly recommend this trip. We walked at a steady pace, taking time to look around, take pictures and investigate the flora, fauna and the odd cave and it took us 3.25 hours.

It's fairly easy walking downhill and would take about 2 hours at a leisurely pace, through some stunning scenery and past the odd goat. There is a toilet just past half way and remember to keep your ticket for the exit. Just a metre wide in places with great photo opportunities, well worth a visit if you are near by.

Quite rough underfoot, but fine for trainers or walking sandals. At the bottom there are a couple of places to pick up transport back to the top. We got trapped in the first where they gave us free drinks and oranges while waiting for the 5 euro trip back. Waited 30mins and found out later that the next place had spaces sooner.

The trip up in the back of a pick up truck turned into a white knuckle ride with the driver chatting on his mobile while negotiating hair pin bends.

If you are driving to Imbros there is free car parking at a couple of tavernas in the viallage and these are ok particularly if you are likely to want to eat or drink when youreturn. However, the entry to the gorge proper is actually a short way south of the village at another lone taverna with parking across the road. Here is is a short descent to the ticket hut and the start.

We got the ""taxi"" back from one of the groups at the end of the gorge. For ""taxi"" read pickup truck - you will likely be sitting in the open truck bed holding on to the stranger next to you. Try to avoid wondering how many passengers they lose on the hairpin bends in the road back to Imbros.

The ""taxi"" takes @10 people per trip ; as we got to the bottom is left with full load. ABout 30 minutes later it left again full, this time with us aboard.

It isn't strenuous going from Imbros, but the ground is mostly loose stones with a little bit of scrambling. We were all in trainers and managed without problems, but walking boots would be better. Starting early is worth it to have the walk largely to yourselves and the local goats, as by 11am, it was getting noticeably busier. The gorge itself is spectacular in parts, with the narrowest points less than six feet across. At the time we did it, it was largely shady, but sunscreen and water are still necessary supplies.

Greece,Michael W,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"6 of us (13 - 61) went to Imbros Gorge today. We started early and arrived in Imbros village at 8.00am which meant that we walked the first hour in lovely cool weather. I would definitely recommend an early start both for the cool start and the quietness of the Gorge. One consequence of our early start was there was no-one around to pay -this might sound like an advantage but we were dissappinted as 2euros per person is a smal pice to pay for the upkeep of the Gorge. Would I recommend the walk to others? For those who enjoy walking, as I do the Gorge is a must do in Crete but if you are not a walker then you will probably not enjoy this either -especially if you wait until the day is hotter. Many reviewers talk about the fact that most of the route is over scree and this might affect what shoes should be worn. I would have preferred walking boots but was comfortable in tennis trainers and wouldn't recommend challenging your weight allowance with boots if this is your only walk. Half our group walked the gorge in 2 hours and the other half walked more slowly, taking lots of photos, and took just over 2 1/2 hours -none of us struggled with distance. At the end of the gorge the owner of the first snack area arrived as we did and took us back to Imbros in his pick up (definitely a recommended part of the experience) he charged us 25 euros but by going on a short way I think we could have got his cheaper. We rounded off our trip with a fresh orange juice at Impos Village Taverna which took a while as the owner squeezed the oranges manually but at 2euros per glass was excellent value. Al in all a great morning out and recommended to everyone who enjoys walking.

After another 10 minutes we got to the main road and got a taxi (shared) back to Imbros for a quick lunch. We caught the bus back to Chania at 13.55 (€6.50 each way) and arrived there at 15.25.

The taverna at the end of the gorge and the taverna in Imbros were quite confused about bus times /bus existence etc so check with the bus station as timetables change depending on season.

The walk was amazing - a lot of it is in the shade. There were lots of flowers, insects and a couple of goats en route and compared to Samaria it was very quiet and peaceful. We did it in trainers and most of it is on scree so although not technically difficult you do need to concentrate on your footing some of the time. Kids could easily manage it. There are no scary drop offs and you can't get lost.

Greece,John G,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We took the morning bus from Chania to Imbros, and the ticket seller offered us a return ticket from Chora Sfakion. After an hour or so, we reached the small village Imbros. Only one other couple went off. The entrance to the gorge was well posted, the fee 2 Euro per person, well spent money.
The walk is easy, but you need good shoes, since you walk partly on a dry river bed, meaning round and moving stones. We wore trainers, but some more support for the ankles would have been nice. And don't forget to stretch, our legs are not used to walking 8 kilometers downhills.
The sun was hidden behind the rocks for the first hour, so it was only after the halfway point we walked under the sun.
The walk is beautiful, with a fantastic variety of plants and many narrow and dramatic passages. Most of the time, we were alone.
At the end of the gorge the ""taxis"" (pickup trucks owned by local farmers) offer rides to Chora Sfakion on the coast, or back to Imbros for those who have cars. We choose to stay in the village Komitades at the bottom of the village for lunch and then take the bus to Chora Sfakion.
After a swim and a drink in Chora Sfakion we took the bus back to Chania. I counted to 22 coaches awaiting the crowds from the Samaria walk. And this was early June, so imagine how it will be in July/August! In the Imbros Gorge, we saw no more than 20 people.

Greece,Matt W,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"My wife and I enjoy walking in the UK and wanted to walk one of the gorges while in Crete. We looked at Samaria Gorge but decided we didn't want the whole day spent getting coaches and boats and get being back late, so decided to get in the hire and go to Imbros Gorge. Turned out to be a realty good option, with a good walk for 2 hrs, with lovely scenario and not busy - we saw people but you felt you were in the countryside and could enjoy the scenary. We parked at the taverna and at the end, got the 'taxi' back to the top. This was a pick up truck, but my wife sat inside and I joined some others in the back - it was fun drive back up the top, round the winding roads as you rose up from the coast. We thought it was a good alternative to Samaria as we were back at our resort near Chania with time to relax by the pool and enjoy the rest of the afternoon.

Butterflies led the way and goats with bells provided a soundtrack. Not too strenuous and suitable for us unprepared trainer-wearing folk. Don't recommend saddles though as there's quite a bit of loose and worn-smooth stone underfoot. Once at the exit a welcome sight of a fridge with refreshment and a taxi back to the top for €20. They were happy for us to split this with other hikers and said we could wait a while if we wanted to fill the pick up (it can handle 8). The ride back to the top in the back of an open truck was an experience not to be missed too!!

Greece,Louise B,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We chose Imbros as we didn't want the crowds of Samaria. We weren't disappointed. We started at the bottom of the Gorge as that was the easiest access from where we were staying. This also meant however far up the Gorge we walked, we had the same distance to come down. Walking up was relatively easy for us not-so-fit 50somethings. It took us 2 hours at a comfortable pace and we went to the top. Took a break at a taverna then started down. I in particular found the descent much, much harder and slower. Took me 3 hours. I seemed to feel every rock and pebble underfoot. The path is in many places the dry river bed, so one is walking on rocks and stones tumbled and smoothed by the fast flowing waters of late winter and early spring. I contemplated the walk through this at times very narrow gorge made 75 years earlier by the British, Australian and New Zealand soldiers in their efforts to escape from Crete. I was tired, they would have been battle-weary, hungry, possibly scared and unsure if ships would be waiting for them on the south coast. Sadly not all made it out.
If you possibly can, do this walk. It's very pretty even in late spring as many wildflowers are still blooming. Bring water, snacks, sunscreen and a hat.

To follow in the footsteps of the retreating Allies 75 years ago was quite a sobering experience. The gorge various over the course of some 8 Km from very easy going to special care needed. Good shoes are preferable but we did see some in hiking sandles who having little difficulty. Take a water bottle if in the height of summer, there are few water points to replenish. Often considered a better option than the Samaria if you don't feel confident of a more difficult hike. The Imbros is easy for most able hikers , we saw more than a few 70 - 80 year olds.

At the other site was not much happening. Too far to swim (you have to walk about 4km towards Chora Sfakion) so we decided to walk back and see the Gorge from a different angle. Instead you can take a taxi ride, €5,- pp. The hike is not hard and we walked late afternoon so it was not crowded. We saw more goats than people!",Jun 2016
Greece,Aino1234,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We enjoy our walking and felt comfortable that we could tackle Imbros gorge with confidence. We weren't disappointed. We parked at the top, starting at around 9am - beating tourist groups and also the heat of the day. This meant that the Gorge was significantly in shade during our walk down. The Gorge is full of different rock formations and colours, plenty of foliage too. Footing can be a challenge as there are loose rocks in many places, but the descent isn't very rapid so with good shoes and steady going, most are capable of walking it (in fact we were surprised as to the number of older and less physically active people who were walking the Gorge - but at their own pace).
We took 2 hours 15 minutes to walk down, stopping for lots of photos and enjoyment of the views. A coffee and a break near the end at one of 2 small ""huts"", we then turned around and walk back. Despite being uphill on the return, we took the same time (shows how much we stopped and took photos on the way down!). At the end, we felt invigorated and continued our journey on to Hora Sfakion. By the way, there are definitely no kiosks on the way, and the toilets are not a good option!
Our trek was more significant given it was almost exactly 75 years since the ANZACs trekked the Gorge to escape the Germans in WW2.

There is a war museum nearby and we would have stopped if we had more time. Their is history on British soldiers who marched through gorge to escape Nazis in WWII.

Plan your pick-up to avoid the ""pick-up truck"" taxi before the end of the trail.The guy charges 5 euro per person to go in an unsafe manner (no seatbelts, people packed in open truck bed) back to the start point.

Greece,amdgriggs,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"I led a walking holiday group down the Imbros Gorge last week and it was delightful. Very rocky underfoot but there's a clear path all the way with lots of engineered sections. Plenty of descent (2000 feet in just over 4 miles) but it's never taxing: don't underestimate though how long it'll take to pick your way down carefully. There's similar vegetation to the Samaria Gorge a few miles west, including Cretan pines, copious Jerusalem sage and other wild herbs and shrubs, and lots of dramatic dragon arums (lilies), plus a few vultures circling impressively between the cliffs overhead. This is a smaller scale gorge than Samaria of course, but still hugely impressive: it also feels very isolated and of course there are many fewer walkers than the near-constant stream in Samaria, despite the excellent cafes at top and bottom and readily available parking. A definite must-see, I'd say, if you've got time for more than one gorge and especially if some of you don't feel like the full and full-on Samaria experience. It's also a snip at 2 euros a head....

Greece,Peter S,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"The Imbros Gorge is to be preferred to the Samaria Gorge if you want an 'easier' walk, and you want to avoid the procession down the Samaria. It is not quite as spectacular, but is nevertheless spectacular enough in its own right to be worth doing. The only downside is the walk at the end along the road to catch the bus from either Hora Sfakia or the bottom of the road, back to Hania. You can of course use one of the many advertised 'taxis' at the end of the gorge, but these can be excessive in price. However, the whole cost of the trip is certainly cheaper than the Samaria trip - whether you get the local bus to Imbros for the start, and the same bus back to Hania, or whether you leave your car at Imbros, and get a taxi back to your car at the end.

Greece,Landfall38,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"C'mon folks, noone says the Imbros Gorge will be a ""experience of a lifetime"", so don't rate it as if it should be. It's a great way to get off the beach and get some exercise, see a very nice gorge (in some spots, even spectacular). Add to this, the gorge has a very special history (from WW II) which is important especially for those from Oz,NZ & the UK (as a Canadian, I am a little ashamed I knew so litle of this part of the war... there is an informative plaque about this in Chora Sfakio). Well worth our time!

We parked at the bottom and walked to the top of the gorge, which took us 1hr&55min. After chocolate bars and water at top, we headed back down (1hr&45min). All-in-all, 4 hours bottom-top-bottom. We're used to hiking, so it might take a little longer for some (but we are 60 yrs, so many could do it faster).

I agree that better shoes are needed for this rocky walk (trainers work, but you'll feel those rocks). There are multiple tavernas at each end; each builds its own entrance/exit to the Gorge pathway to try and entice you; each will arrang transport. Of course, there are the entrepreneurs who drive their pickup even closer trying to snag you before the end of the trail -- just remember, there's lots of chances/competition a few minutes further walk. (Note: off-season there are fewer, but still multiple, options. And way fewer tourists!)

The scenery and wild life are spectacular, with high cliff walks closing in to only a couple of metres apart in places. You can get back by "" taxi"", people are waiting at the end to get your trade!

Greece,Chocky1948,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"This is one of the more popular tourist attraction at the eastern end of Crete, consequently the tour buses come from Chania etc to drop off people at the top of the gorge in Imbros village to facilitate them walking down the gorge ( about 2 hours)
So, for peace and quiet go early....
The gorge itself is a natural access route from Imbros to the coast, there were stone paths constructed but mostly now disappeared, it's quite steep in places and stout footwear is a good idea as there are many very stony sections. There's a €2 entry fee at a ticket booth at the start ( top or bottom) and no smoking in the gorge.
The narrowest section is 1.6metres between vertical walls.
Take your time, enjoy the walk, it's not a race, appreciate the deafening silence.

Greece,londonanya,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"I found out about Imbros gorge on Thomson website and was really keen to do this walk. Due to low demand TUI doesn't offer this excursion to British tourists but organised for us to go with German group. Which was absolutely fine as we had a fantastic tri-lingual guide. The cost was about 60 Euro per person.

I think it is easier to do the walk as an organised tour, as our bus waited for us at the end. Those coming in their own cars can rent a taxi to take them back to Imbros village.

I was slightly apprehensive about it, being in my fifties and of average fitness (to put it nicely). But it was absolutely fine, took just over 2.5 hours and wasn't exhausting at all, even in 35 degrees heat. There were families there with young children doing the walk.

So go for it! If I could do it, anyone can do it. Just those with knee problems may find it difficult, as you only walk downhill and it puts a lot of strain on the knees. Good, sturdy footwear is essential; my trainers were destroyed literally at the finish line (thanks God not earlier) as you jump from stone to stone during most of the walk.

The scenery is breathtaking, like something from the ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Hobbit"". I could almost see Thorin and the dwarves walking and singing ""Far over the misty mountains cold""...

Greece,csolan,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"After debating whether to take a guided hiking tour of the White Mountains, we ended up opting to walk ourselves down Imbros Gorge instead. Even though we went to the gorge on the hottest day of our trip (95 F/ 35 C!), and the sun was totally scorching, arriving early enough in the morning provided cool shade under the towering rock walls and we remained relatively comfortable for most of the duration of the walk.

The path is quite rocky and though hiking shoes aren't really required, I walked in sneakers and could feel each pebble under foot. There are mountain goats hanging out on some parts of the paths and more butterflies than I have ever seen in one place! It took us, two reasonably fit people aged 29 & 32, about 2 1/2 hours to reach the bottom, though we were slowed down by my need to take pictures of the spectacular scenery.

The taverna at the top of the gorge lets you park for free if you agree to buy a drink or food when you return. The salads we had for lunch there were good, if not quite standard island fare. At the bottom of the gorge there is another little outpost where a couple women offered us drinks and fruit, and where we could wait in the shade for the ""taxi service"" back to the taverna. I use the term ""taxi"" loosely, as it was really just an old man with a pick-up truck. Everyone handed over 5 euro and climbed in the truck bed. It was mildly terrifying winding on super high mountain roads with children crouched in the back of the truck, but no one fell out and the driver did seem reasonably competent with navigating the roads. Overall, the gorge was really beautiful, a great experience and a nice 1/2 day trip from Chania.

If you go there by car, you will probably find goats on the road, so watch the road ! There is a large car park in Imbros, and the walk down to Komitades village took us two and a half hour, including photo and stops for drinking. In Komitades, you can find a lift up to Imbros for 5 € per passenger or 20 € per car. Be aware that driving is rallye style, and that you will spend most of the way on the wrong side of the double continuous line. Nevertheless, My wife was sitting by the driver and I was sitting (?) at the back of the pick up, and we felt reasonably safe as they perfectly know each turn of the road.

You may skip this by going on to a small restaurant in the direction of Sfakia and take the (more or less) direct entrance there. The gorge itself is very nice, beautiful and quiet (Samaria might be a bit more busy). During our visit, there were not so many hikers on the way, and you may find a donkey or even (for us) unknown flowers. Going back from the exit to Impros (and the other way) is organized in Greek style, i.e., you ask and someone may drive you with his pickup.

Best is to bring good shoes (like mountain boots or sports shoes). Not always easy to walk there with open shoes because of slippery stones and your feet get really durty because of dust 😊

Smoking isn't allowed in the gorge because of safety reasons & to preserve this area.

For little children, not always easy, parents might have to help them or carry them through some parts of the gorge.

Walk is about 2 hours, last part of the walk is with a lot of sun, so bring a hat and sunglasses with you. They also told us to bring around 1L of water per person, just to be sure 😊

Starting your walk with a pancake at the local café is always a good idea. You can also use the bathroom there before departure.

Greece,Spink11,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"Imbros Gorge is the gorge that the Commonwealth troops were evacuated along when retreating from the Germans during WW2. If you do the walk, remember the troops did this during the dark of night!

The route is relatively easy, not suited to those with walking difficulties...

Near by is a little private museum, well worth a visit, it filled with relics of the war,and is well worth stopping to visit. Many of the items are relics the owner and his father before have collected up from the immediate region, and this includes items found in the gorge.

Recommended footwear is trainers/walking boot, however we are fairly strong walkers and found trekking saddles ideal.

An entrance fee is payable, if the office at the entrance is um-manned, don't worry there is also one at the bottom where you can pay.

Most people travel from top to bottom of the gorge, but some do bottom to top also.

There is a donkey ambulance station 1/2 way down, this patient beast is you mode of extraction in the even to injury, so if you don't want to embarrassment yourself, take care and watch you step!!

Greece,AndreasBrok,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"I have crossed Imbros Gorge three times in the last four years. Why have I been there so many times? Because it is a great walk, a wonderful scenery from bare rock to small forests and really narrow crosses (the narrowest points are just 1.6m wide). There are not any hard crosses, you dont need special equipment (apart from good walking/trekking shoes) and it will take approximately 2.5 - 3 hours if you are reasonably fit (not an athlete but also not someone who has never walked more than 5 minutes). The trail is well marked and pretty straightforward. You dont need a guide. However especially during the hot summer days, be prepared to have plenty of water with you (I guess 1 to 2 litres would be a good scenario but not less). You can park your car at the entrance of the gorge in Imbros and when you reach the exit of the gorge in Kartsomatados, you can take a taxi or find someone from the village to take you back to your car (it is only a 15min drive, no worries). Alternatively, when I go with friends we leave one car at the entrance and one at the exit. :) Another great thing is that the exit of the gorge is on the way to Fragkokastello, where you can find some excellent beaches to have a swim and relax after the walk. No better way to end your day!

Greece,oksidor,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"According to some review sites, this is the second most popular gorge trek on Crete, yet not a very difficult one, so we decided to start with it to see how our 8-y.o. daughter will cope. She did fine, although got predictably tired at the end. Any grownup will do fine, the entire walk is about 8 km. The gorge is quite picturesque, it’s really a nice adventure and exercise. It’s quite safe although there are more than a few slippery rocks, so proper shoes are essential (at least do avoid anything loose and opt for thicker soles). Bringing some snacks and water is a good idea.

The logistics of the visit are less attractive though. Arriving at Impros, look for free parking or park on the curb as tavernas charge some for parking in their lots (not much though, 1 euro for 2 hours in our case or free if ordering food). Coming from North, skip the first entrance as it is just a taverna parking trap — you’ll only walk an extra kilometer or so to the actual entrance where you’ll pay the 2 euro admission fee. Opt for the “main” entrance instead. The best way to get back is to walk — not just because the trek is short enough, but because other options are limited and questionable. It’s either a bus that leaves at 11:00 and then at 18:30 only — AND you’ll have to walk an extra 6 km to get to its stop (unless the village businessmen meeting you at the end are lying) — so why not walk the much more beautiful gorge back (the best place to turn back is at the one of its kind natural gate that you won’t miss); or, it’s what they call a taxi. The rides are priced per person, at 5-6 euro depending on the number of passengers sharing a ride, and it’s just a grumpy local guy with his pickup truck. 2 passengers fitting inside should be fine, all others are out of luck: it’s going to be a bumpy, windy, cold and downright unsafe ride in the open back on a very winding mountain road. Some people in our bunch simply refused to pay for such “service”, to the driver’s fierce cursing.

Also coming from North, it’s worth making a short stop at a family-run war museum along the way.

A nice hike of 5 to 6 miles, not to difficult with some narrow cuts through the rock walls. It's all down hill. Unless you choose to walk back up you need to get a ride back to your car at the end. There is a store at the end that arranges rides. The cost is twenty euro for 1 or 2 people, 10 euro per group for 2 groups of 2 or 1, and 5 euroes per person for larger groups.

In addition, the gorge is ""family friendly"", chidlren 3-4 years of age can easily manage walking without any problems, and it is quite shady. On a hot summer or fall day, it is much cooler here than many other spots. What made this trip extra memorable was the taxi ride back to our car.

The hike itself is really not that strenuous, the path is, at least part of it, shaded by the vegetation and some parts are even like an ancient stone laid road. Wear good, comfortable shoes, bring water and a snack, fruit is always a good choice.

Greece,Roselle dFW,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We want to trek Aradena Gorge but we have kids (a 4-yo and a 10-yo) with us so we decided to have a trial walk first with Imbros Gorge yesterday. My hubby and children were wearing jogging shoes and I (because I forgot to bring mine) was wearing ankle socks in crocs sandals. Our children are used to trekking long and high (but that is in Norway) and we didn't know how they would react in this heat. We have packed sandwiches, fruits, juice and water and told the kids that it is going to be a picnic. We paid 2EUR each (even small kids are charged) for park fees and then started slow and my kids picked up sticks along the way which they periodically play as either light sabers or magician's wands, or whatever they fancy at a particular moment. We have frequent stops because we neither wanted to overstretch our daughter nor dehydrate her. Not even once had she asked her father to carry her but had asked once for us to have a quick stop because she is a ""little bit"" tired. We were lucky also since we began at 13:30 so the sun was already at an angle and wasn't directly above us. There were lots of shades, aside from the gorge having a lot of trees in it. Our girl tried to climb boulders and caves and at times had preferred passing through the dry riverbed than the trail. Midway, there is a makeshift toilet that trekkers could use and there are also lots of garbage cans along the stretch. I can say, Imbros Gorge is fantastic! It has a lot of very interesting details (flora, fauna, rock-types, walls, caves, overhangs, dry riverbed etc) and each one of them satisfies curiosities and inspires fantasies (at least for our children). The narrowest passage is 1.6 m (5.2 ft), which my children playfully dubbed as the ""Gate to Eternity"" during their Star Wars fantasy role-playing moment. Over all, this gorge is worth your time despite being just 8kms long and not as popular as the longer gorges. We reached the end of the trail at 17:15, 1hr and 15 min longer the recommended trekking time (by travel and hiking books) but I guess they didn't have a 4-year old in mind when they wrote that.

SIDE NOTES: At the end of the trail, there is a small kiosk there where we bought freshly-pressed orange juice and it was really delicious! The ""taxi"" available at that time is a silver Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up truck and the driver was a kind man. When we asked about the rate, he said 18EUR and explained that it would take him 40-45 minutes to drive us to Imbros town center and back again, but he tried to make it cheaper for us by trying to convince the other guy (who finished the trail the same time with us) to share the taxi, but the latter refused. The taxi driver was a careful and pleasant driver who made a couple of short stop for us just so my husband could take some nice panorama picture. The 18 EUR rate didn't really feel overpriced for us. But you have a choice to walk further and reach the town center and then either take taxi from there (which could charge cheaper, of course) or take the public bus. Some of the trekkers also preferred to trek back up. My crocs sandals were good enough for me although I could feel some of the sharp stones that I stepped on, but they didn't really bother me anyway.

Greece,TriciaSuffolk,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"We walked the gorge today - it took about 2 1/2 hours. I'd read the reviews here and was careful to wear walking trainers, set off early and take plenty of water. I didn't anticipate any problems as we're all fairly fit. We parked in the taverna at the top and had a very enjoyable first part to the walk. We didn't have to pay entrance as there was no-one in the kiosk. Butterflies everywhere, the smell of wild sage, ever changing scenery - widening and narrowing, a new vista at every turn, interesting old trees and plants, a fabulous stone arch . The goat herder hut was interesting but deserted, half way down.

But take care...you have to pick your way over loose stones all the way. I was being careful, but my foot slipped on one of the smooth rocks, and then got jammed beneath me as I fell heavily on it. I then limped down and it was very painful as it was so uneven. I was glad when after another hour or so, we came to the first little shaded terrace where a woman was offering taxi rides back to Imbros. We had to wait about half an hour.but she gave us orange to eat and we chatted. She said she believes that although the walk is much shorter than Samaria it is harder as it's so full of loose stones. It was 18 euros for the three of us up the switchback 18km to the top where we ate in the taverna. If you walk further down at the end of the gorge, as suggested in the guidebooks, to pick up a taxi it is quite a lot further.

Greece,Jacqui1983,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"Really enjoyed our walk through Imbros Gorge, beautiful scenery a very pleasurable experience.
Would recommend wearing trainers/walking boots as the terrain can be quite rough underfoot. We were dropped off at the top of the gorge and walked down it towards the sea, took us 2 hours at a brisk pace and we stopped to take quite a few pictures.
Would imagine it would take a bit longer if you started the walk at other end of the gorge and had to walk uphill.
Various rock formations and dramatic views. Plenty of greenery, wild flowers and herbs.
Half way through the walk we were slightly alarmed when we heard a loud bray as we rounded a corner, but not to worry it was a donkey tied up to a tree. Still not sure what he was doing there, he was a friendly fellow however.
As we continued our descent through the gorge we were met with a tribe of mountain goats, very noisy however as they were wearing bells around their necks. Also friendly fellows. Was a pleasant experience watching them climbing the trees to nibble the leaves/spring buds.
Overall the vistas were breath taking, defiantly worth a visit. Lovely Café at Komitades at the end of the walk and an excellent sea view. Thoroughly enjoyed a drink to quench ones thirst after the walk.
Just a note, toilets half way through the walk are a no no, simply a wooden shack and a hole in the ground, very smelly and unpleasant. Would suggest squatting behind a bush or waiting until you reach end of walk where there area few cafes with toilet facilities.

Greece,timaaeee,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"we chose this as it seemed a lot easier logistically than the Samara or Eirini gorges because it is easy to drive to from Chania (took about an hour, trail starts in Imbros on the road to Sfakion) and finishes by the same road so you can easily get a taxi back to your car.

It took us about 2h15 to do going downhill with a few short photo stops although we did seem to be going a bit quicker than most people. The path has lots of small rocks so you do need to be paying attention or you might slip and twist your ankle and so because you have to be watching your feet all the time it does take longer than it would if the terrain was easier. We did it at the end of April and the conditions were perfect, nice and sunny but not too hot. When we got to the end there were a couple of small restaurants and a couple of people offering us a taxi ride back for 5euros each if we were prepared to wait for a couple more people or for 18euros for just the two of us. We decided to walk on to Komitades to see what was there however there didn't seem to be much there (assuming we went to the right place?!) just lots of empty restaurants so we asked at one of them and got a taxi for 18euro - in restrospect we might as well have gone with the taxi at the trail end as we could have probably paired up with some other people.

The other option would be to walk the trail back to the car, if I was doing this I might be tempted to start at the top and just do the top half of the gorge to where it gets really narrow and then return - as this is the best bit and imo the bottom part of the gorge is nothing special and doing the whole trail back up would be quite hard work although saying that quite a few people were doing it.

On arrival we parked up in one of the many tavernas that offer access to the Gorge. If you are going to walk up the gorge (and there were many of all ages doing just this on the day we went), you will obviously have to park in Komitades which is located at the bottom of the gorge. The walk is pretty easy downhill although a god pair of shoes with grippy soles are essential. Do not attempt in flip flops or similar footwear!

The scenery as the gorge narrows is very pretty and verges on the dramatic in places. When we set out there was a coach load and a van of hikers setting off at the same time. The group soon gets stretched out however and before long you will find that you are pretty much on you own.

Take at least 2 litres of water with you, most probably more at the height of summer. It was a beautiful day when we went but as it was September, the heat lacked intensity.

Once you have passed through the gorge and assuming that you are not on an organised trip you will have to either walk back as some did, or get a taxi back to Imbros. I have seen differing advice on this so here is mine. There are some small tavernas offering refreshment and a taxi ride as you emerge from the gorge and about 1k before Komitades. There aim is to persuade 4 or more to share a ride back to the top for $5 each. If you can get this deal, take it! It's a good price and you will have fun scaring yourself to death in the back of a pick up being driven back up the mountain zig zag! The taxi in Komitades will be €20 which is ok if you can put a party of 4 together.

Overall a good trip that is worth doing. It only takes 2.30hrs to complete the walk downhill and that includes a few photo stops along the way.

Entrance fee €2 with 2 ticket checks along the way!

Greece,StuartVine,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"This could be a gorge for beginners, no scrambling, well marked path, and plenty of shade. You can easily walk both ways in half a day if you are relatively fit. If you want to do that it's probably best to park at the bottom of the gorge and walk up first. There are ticket kiosks at top and bottom and a nice guy who checks tickets around halfway.

Advice would be, as always, to wear decent footwear, we prefer boots because of the added ankle protection, and take a litre or more water per person if the weather is warm.

You can park at either and and just walk one way, there are tavernas at both ends where you can arrange a taxi (or pickup truck - men sit in the open back if full) to get back to your starting point.

Imbros is quite a pretty gorge and even in early September it was far from crowded, we met perhaps 20 people going both ways.

Greece,NicoStassen,Imbros Gorge,3.0,"We went to the Imbros Gorge, had our hotel in Platanaias.
From Platanaias, with a rental car, it takes about 1h20 to get to Imbros.
Left our car at the first Brasseria. Payed 2 Euro at the entry gate. Had a splendid walk through the gorge. Great views. Impressiv trees against the walles of the gorge. How is it possible that these trees can survive ? Met a few goats and sheep during our walk. The walke took us around 2 hours and was worth the journey. We loved it. Coming at the end of the walk, at the first taverne, we were asked if we wanted a taxi to go back and were adviced not to walk on. A local taxi brought us back to the brasseria and our car. A drive back, taking something like 20 minuts with an impressiv view on the Sea and the landscape.
We can only recommend to do the visit as well. Take good shoes and a bottle of water with you.

We had lightweight walking shoes which were fine. It was not busy and we saw groups walking both up and down. The only real suprise was the check on our tickets halfway down!

Greece,Heidi M,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"If you think Samaria will be too much this one is perfect for families provided you have walking boots/trainers. It took us about 3 hours with lots of stops. 2 adults and 7 and 10 year old. Parking at the top and walking down hill. Would recommend getting there early so you can walk in shade for majority of it. There are people offering taxi rides back up the hill for 5 euros each, well worth it and what a fun ride back up and over the mountains and hairpin bends! Just like a rollercoaster! really beautiful surroundings",Aug 2013
Greece,sanjivtx,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We originally wanted to hike Samaria but the schedule was not working out. One of us found this gorge and we hiked it. We were 4 adults and 5 kids and we started a little late (around 11AM). It was a beautiful hike but because of the heat, a little hard on the kids (we are talking very fit kids here).
It takes about an hour and change to get to the start of the hike from Rethymno and then it is about a 3 hour hike if you factor in stops and pictures. Look for tavernas at the end. If you eat at some of them the owner will drop you back to Imbros at a reduced price. We paid 20 euros for the 9 of us for the return in a Truck, with two of us sitting on the open flat bed!

Lovely breeze (July) and you feel in a different world
Take water- we only started to meet other walkers about 2k from the end (they were walking up, but we suspected not all the way)
We took the advice of other TripAdvisors and walked onto the village for refreshment
We then walked on to Hors Stakion - although on open road is all down hill- v little traffic
45mins and we were in the village / swim and beer and food at one of the several Tavernas

Greece,Merc9SLK,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"We walked the Gorge this morning, having parked at Imbros at the first taverna marking the gorges entrance. From this end there is a 1km walk to the actual entrance marked by a kiosk where you can purchase a book for 5 euros. Entrance is 2 euros per person. The 1km walk has large loose pebbles making the terrain uneasy underfoot even with good hiking shoes. We wore Merryl hiking shoes and were pleased we did.

The scenery is spectacular, didn't see any wildlife other than a donkey tethered up by the ticket check point. Some of the walk sees in my opinion sizeable steps down on large boulders then I'm only 5ft 1 so it is relative!

The walk is down hill from Imbros and could imagine a different experience if walking from the opposite end, up hill definitely more of a challenge.

Stopping for photos and water periodically we did the walk from Imbros including the extra km! in 2 hours 22.

Most exhilarating of all was at the end of the walk where there is shelter from the sun and a taxi ride back up the mountain - taxi as in 4x4 truck! 12 of us in this at the cost of 5 euro per person, we were sat in the open rear part of the vehicle thankfully next to the cab. 4 Canadians quickly bagged the interior seats to the cab. I'm scared of heights and found the cliff hugging road fun - probably because I had my back to the cliff side and was hugging the rear of the enclosed cab. Didn't like being crammed in like cattle in a pick up truck - the lady opposite kicked me a few times when trying to manoeuvre herself upright following the tight sweeping turns of the road.

Highly recommend this as a day out - continue to Hora Sfakion for lunch. Delightful little cove but park up the hill to avoid paying parking charges.

Out guide Manolis was very knowledgeable and friendly giving us loads of information about various plants and wildlife. He also took some good group photos and action shots which he emailed to us. The walk itself is reasonably easy but make sure you have good walking shoes or trainers as the floor is mainly made up of loose stones. Take plenty of water.

Greece,Booja-13,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"I am 77 and my wife is 70 so we wanted to walk a Gorge to enjoy rather than endure so we chose this one instead of Samaria. We took the bus from Chania bus station to Imbros Town, and stopped off at the taverna at the entrance to the Gorge for a coffee before starting out. We did a relaxing walk, glad it was downhill - although we did meet people walking up and met them later walking down. I think they had a different agenda to ours. The walk is basically on a river bed so there were pebbles, gravel and rocks with only a few sections of firm ground. The scenery was constantly changing from wooded slopes to vertical rock faces. Taking a steady pace with a few rest stops we took about 2.5 hours to walk the 8kms. The weather was warm but not hot fortunate. It rained for 5 minutes!. We were able to shelter under trees and rocks. At the end of the walk we stopped off for a rewarding beer. The Rough Guide suggested the 5km walk to Chora Sfakion to catch the bus to Chania but the rain came down heavily. We asked the taverna owner to taxi us there instead. It cost us 5 euro. We were glad we didn't attempt to walk to the village. The road was open and exposed with no path for pedestrians. Sfakion is wall to wall tavernas, mostly seafood and we had a very enjoyable meal in one. We took the bus back to Chania. Make sure you are at the front of the queue as the Samarian walkers all arrive for that bus too. All in all it was a enjoyable walking experience.

Greece,Olwyn H,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"Imbros gorge is user friendly, beginning with a gentle incline, not a precipice. Yes its rocky underfoot so boots or strong shoes are a must. May is the best month to see the wild flowers, especially the orchids. Also it will not be too hot for your two -three hour walk. Take water with you as the air is always very dry, but there is a tavern near the bottom if you cannot be bothered. Half way down you can touch both walls of the gorge at once! This route was used by Allied soldiers escaping from the German forces during WW2. If you close your eyes you can imagine them sneaking down, unseen by their foes, to the harbour at Hora Sfakion. At the end you will see cave swifts nesting in the overhanging cliffs, and don't forget the ever present goats.

There are interesting rock formations , caves and narrow canyons. The walk takes about 3-4 hours and there were children and older hikers older than us walking. We were tired at the end but the next day we were fine.We saw goats high up on the sides of the gorge. It was crowded at first but after the first mile (of 4) we had the gorge to ourselves.

Greece,phat_dawg_21,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We checked several websites to get an idea of what to expect. We found the best information on earthtrekkers, which suggested going from Fria to Oia, which gives you a bit more downhill walking than doing it the other way.

Traveling in that direction also gives you lots of views of Oia without turning around to see them.

The walk is a bit more than 10 kilometers, or about 6 miles. Several sites suggest you can do it in three hours if you don’t stop to take a lot of pictures, but who could do that? Most sites, and people at our hotel, suggested four to five hours as the norm.

We were dropped off in Fria at the Prehistoric Museum, had a cup of coffee at a nearby café, and then started walking west at 9:00.

At 1:00 we were at the Snack Shack, a little food and beverage stand where the trail merges with the road for a short time near the CSky Hotel. That is where we decided we had had enough and called for a car to take us back to the hotel.

We did not make the whole walk, but we did cover about 9 kilometers and we saw a lot of beautiful scenery and really enjoyed the experience.

Greece,Fergs85,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We set off from Imerovigli reasonably early, around 8.30 am, and keeping to a steady pace with a few short breaks at points of interest, arrived in Oia just before 11. This allowed enough time to see some of the town and its busy streets and shops, and then catch the bus back to Fira.
The walk is certainly spectacular, and generally safe and easy to negotiate – just one part of the path, just before and after you briefly join the road, is a little less secure underfoot. There are plenty of natural stopping points for you to take in the views, including three typically whitewashed churches, and a rock where you are advised to “save the camera and enjoy the view”!
The walk from Imerovigli to Fira adds no more than 30 minutes to the time needed to do the whole walk, and the path is consistently good quality underfoot.

Greece,ian,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"Fantastic views and a great sense of achievement on completing the walk.
We are a relatively fit couple in our 50’s ,and we did this on an October morning when the temp was about 20 c.
The walk out of Fira is very uphill and after 15 mins I was wondering whether this was going to be doable.
However with regular 2 minute rests we managed the initial steep incline.The next 4-5 km was still a bit up and down but not too taxing and the views great.There is a 20 min section where the path narrows and there is a sheer drop to the sea with no netting that might unnerve some people,although the walking wasn’t tricky if you watched your feet.
After the short stretch of road you turn left after a small cafe,for us the next 2 k or so was the toughest, it was up hill for what seemed like forever and certainly tested your fitness to the full.
Eventually you reach a small church casting welcome shade where you can rest for a bit.
Then it’s downhill into Oia-lovely but full of cruise passengers.
To find the picture spot with the 2 blue domes you have to walk to the far side of the town and turn left down an alley just past a church-we found it by chance following some other people.
Then back to the other side of town to find a taxi- which was not that straight forward,no real taxi rank.Flagged one down after 20 mins purely by chance.
In summary as others have said ,you do need a reasonable level of fitness to do the whole walk(12k and 4 hours including walking around Oia).You must have covered decent footwear.
I couldn’t have done this in the heat of summer,so bear that in mind if your not really fit.
Very glad to have done it ,well worth the effort,but I reiterate it is not an easy walk and it is impossible to bale out at certain points and there are very few taxi opportunities on route if you find it too much.

Greece,Deadelf,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I don't understand the attraction of the Fira to Imerovigli leg ... it's just a walking path through commercial developments. The real hike is from Imerovigli to Oia. I stayed in Imerovigli, so it was just lock the door and go. Or take the island bus to Imerovigli, walk one block towards the caldera and take a right.

I don't have anything to offer that you won't see elsewhere. Trail is of mixed quality and you'll need good shoes. The two snack shops might not be open. Take water with you. Expect wind and mostly sun although if you go in the morning, you'll have some shade. Easier to take the bus back from Oia. Do be careful because parts of it won't be accessible for medical aid.

A lovely way to see some other villages and nose in to some hotels. The walk is quite challenging in parts due to how steep it can be so if you have any mobility issues you will struggle. Terrain is a mix of gravel tracks, cobbles and smooth tiles. We did it in sandals which was doable, but next time I’d go for better ankle support as they were sore for a couple of days after!

Thankfully there’s a few places en route to get a drink, but there’s not much shade so be prepared to get hot and sweaty. It’s worth it though and I’m glad we did it, and when we looked back from Oia on the route we took I was proud of myself…..looks a lot further than 10k! One thing to be careful of…..getting the bus back. If I was to do it again, I’d bus to Oia and walk back to Fira. (We didn’t do this tho so not sure if it would be any different) The queue for the bus at about 5pm in Oia was horrendous. We couldn’t get on the bus despite turning up 10 mins early. Faced with waiting another 30mins for a bus we got a taxi with another couple (this was €35 for four of us). Santorini really needs to put more buses on. We got a car for a few days after this based on that experience, I’m not standing an hour in a bus queue after that hike.

Greece,Federico C,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"The hike is tough, but if you are used at hiking you will survive. It is no Himalayan climb. Assuming you are visiting Santorini in summer, the temperature is high. Start very early in the morning (you will also have the halleys of Fira all for yourself). Wear proper hiking shoes, cause the gravel in some parts is slippery.
I suggest to walk from Fira to Oia, then return by bus (they are frequent and fast).
At the end, I think the municipality of Santorini should invest more in this touristic asset. Other Cycladic islands have developed a lot their historic routes. With the breathtaking views, this trail is easily the most beautiful of all. Unfortunatley, the signposting is barely sufficient and the paving stones in the last part just before Oia are really deteriorated.

It is a long, steep and sometimes treacherous hike. Despite that, the scenery is unlike any you will see on any guided tour. Because you are going places that are not accessible by car, you should plan your hike accordingly. There are very few places for shade and places to purchase drinks or food are few and far between so be sure to have plenty of water with you. Also make sure you are wearing appropriate footwear. The paths were paved at one time, but now are nothing but rubble, making it easy to twist an ankle when you are walking. There were several times while we were hiking that my daughter and I were starting to question whether or not to turn back, but looking back now, I am so glad we didn't.

Best to go early in the morning or late in the evening as the midday heat would make it quite difficult. We did it from Fira to Oia. We got the 7.30am bus from Oia and started the walk at about 8.10am. The walk officially starts at the Atlantis hotel- turn right out of the bus station go straight on across the road and straight up to the hotel Atlantis. You then follow the path more or less keeping the water on your left for the entire journey. There are a few signs every now and then so it is easy enough to find your way. It is quite a mixed terrain so good footwear is a must. There is quite a climb in parts, so some level of fitness would certainly help. Bring plenty of water as most cafes won't be open early in the morning. There is a nice van about half way on one of the main roads- a welcome sight when we had run out of water. We had an ice cold Coke to revive us and replenished the water stocks. It took us about 2hrs 45mins to complete the hike, and it was nice and quiet at that hour of the morning.

The trail consists of pathways of concrete, cobblestone and at times dirt and gravel; and in one short spot (a few hundred meters); you are walking on the edge of a busy roadway. My wife and I are in our 50’s and quiet fit however at times we were challenged, take plenty of water / sunscreen and wear appropriate footwear and clothing (hats). When choosing which part of the day to walk, consider the rising and setting of the sun and that the walk is a moderate one. When planning, consider the distance of unpopulated areas as there will be no opportunity to purchase water or access ablutions. At the halfway point, there are a few donkeys to hire but these are of limited numbers. On the outskirts of Fira, my wife and I popped into a cafe, freshened up, then meandered our way into Fira then had a loooooooong lunch. We then caught the bus (under 2 Euro each) back to Oia.

Greece,Mark L,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,This trail goes from Fira to Oia along the edge of the caldera. The views are stunning and you go through all the towns on the way. We did it in good sandals. You don’t need hiking boots. Good activity for children over 8 so they can use up some energy and give you family time. Enjoyed it. Remember to start early like 8:30 to 9. You get great views coming into Oia.,May 2021
Greece,Natalie Ki,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,1.0,"THIS IS NOT AN EASY WALK no matter what promotion sites like SantoriniDave say! This is a DIFFICULT hike meant for people in a really good shape AND used to the terribly hot weather, BOTH! If you're from the north, consider the alternatives. I saw many unprepared people on the way, risking their health. At 11 AM the mountains between Imerovigli and Oia are already a hell, +24C in the forecast means +40C there due to black volcanic rocks which are as hot as an oven, this place will boil you alive.
1) DON'T walk all the way through, it's pointless and difficult.
2) START from Imerogvili (take a bus from Fira, it's 10 minutes, NOTE that the buses to Oia don't go to Imerogvili).
3) WALK from Imerogvili to the little white church Agios Markos and then back (or less), it will take you 1-1,5 hours and the road is good.
4) ALSO WALK from Fira to Firostefani or from Imerogvili to Firostefani if you want to see the white towns. In fact, the three of them are one town.
5) If you still want to go to Oia, TAKE a hat, a sunscreen, and plenty of water. THINK TWICE.
Again, I encourage you to not do that either than starting at 7-8 AM. It's not worth it, the views are totally the same all the way through, it's enough to walk just a bit. I'm in a very good shape and I've had a bad migraine seizure for the first time in my life after this terrible hike, it is steep all the way through and incredibly hot, I started at 9:30AM. It was good at first, then when I reached the black mountains after Agios Markos, it became a hell.

Greece,andrewolf79,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"Nice trail, well maintained and easy if you are a regular hiker... pretty demanding if you are not used to 5k+ walks and dont have the right shoes 🤷🏻‍♂️

We started from Fira the trail is on our resort doorstep so we had to do it.
Few pointers to enjoy the walk now that we done it...

Take cash as there are 3 bars on the way and they mostly tale cash!!
Water is a must depending on your need to drink
The whole length of the trail is exposed to the elements.. so a hat, suncream & buff are a good idea to have.
The only shelter beside 3 churches (today all locked up) are a few bars and a few caves.
To enjoy the walk you need to wear comfortable shoes, trainers are a must if u have hiking shoes no worries it will be a breeze.

Once in Oia you can find restaurant, bars shops to chill relax and recover... if you are too tired to walk back or you did too much shopping (like we did lol...😎😅) a taxi will only cost you €25 to get you back to Fira.

I've posted a few pix of the terrain to give you an idea

A bit dangerous in some areas - there was a particular section with a very narrow path, unstable ground and no fence. Not particularly difficult but wouldn't recommend it for young kids, elderly or those afraid of heights.

It took me 3 hours because I kept stopping for photos. Bring water and a cap and set off very early, I recommend 7am because there's no shade anywhere and it gets scorching early on, and you also want to explore Oia at the end. Wear comfy trainers please!! I saw people with sandals and I have zero idea how they handled it because it seems very dangerous and uncomfortable that way.

There is one area, about an hour from Fira that is quite loose under foot so you certainly need good foot ware. They seem to have it prepared for maintenance but there was no work being done when we walked it.

The Fira end is interesting for a few Churches etc, and there are a couple of other small Churches on the way to Oia, but it is mainly about the great views of the Caldera.

The path itself is easy to follow and is 11km long to Oia (that's what the signs said anyway). If visiting during the summer (we were last two weeks of July so very hot) then you need to leave early. We left Fira at 8:30am and got to Oia in 3 hours which included a few stops for rest and water.

Greece,jdc8mbc,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I had been here 48 years ago, before there was electricity on the Greek islands, before the construction of the funicular, before the inundation of cruise ships and crowds. Was horrified to see that we had to wait over an hour to board the funicular to Fira and saddened by how overrun the island was of tourists. Fortunately, hubby and I wanted to hike the 8+-mile trail from Fira to Oia and avoid the crowds. Because we were on a cruise ship, we could not get an early start. Our tender did not get to the port until way after 9:30 am and by the time we reached the start of the trail in Fira, it was past 11:00 am -- already too late and too warm for optimal hiking conditions -- but we persevered because we knew it was either now or never. It took us about 4 hours of hiking (we're senior citizens) before we found the bus stop in Oia. This was one of our top three highlights of our Greek adventure. The trail was not crowded once we got past Imerovigli. Wear sturdy walking shoes (paved, unpaved, rocky, cobblestoned paths), pack plenty of water, wear sunscreen and hat with wide rims.

Greece,gibraltarr,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We wanted a way to visit Santorini from a cruise ship (mid September, 2 pm to 10 pm) that would avoid the crowds. This was perfect. We actually ended up only hiking half way(out of Fira), the route was easy, but we could see that it was getting less built up, and that getting to Oia and back in daylight was not going to be possible. We had walked up the. Donkey steps and knew that going back down whilst not an issue in the daylight, would have been unwise in the dark.

So I really would recommend for the views, a low key and very easy way to spend your port time on Santorini. However the island is suffering from over-tourism. If you have always longed to visit Santorini, go as part of an island-hopping trip, a port stop does not do it justice.

I backpacked along and in the G.C. for 2 weeks, so I've got a pretty good idea about that. But this ... by the end of the hike, by the time we arrived in Oia ... its this. This 3 hour walk had the most breathtaking scenery i've ever had on a hike, in my 61 years. The perspectives and views are now seared into my mind.

We did it in the off-season, which is great to have it to yourself, but since the route is not that well marked in some spots, to not have others to follow due to the time of the year makes finding the trail a bit confusing and frustrating at times.

Greece,Bernadette D,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We hiked the 7+ mile trail from Fira to Oia on a mild Sunday morning in November. The beginning of the trail in Fira goes through some parking lots and alleys among hillside hotels, and although you could see the sea, the views were not what I expected. But once you get out of Fira the views from the trail are spectacular. There is a lot of up and down on the trail, some of the trail is quite high in the mountain, and there are portions that are loose gravel and rock. For a small part of the trail (close to Oia) you must hike along the road, which is a little scary. We were grateful for the cloud cover and 70 degree temps, and that in mid-November the trail wasn’t crowded. The hike was a highlight of our time in Santorini, but I cannot imagine what this hike would have been like during peak summer tourist season.

We hiked early November from Oia to Fira (after taking 30-minute bus ride to Oia).We found Oia to be silly crowded (yes, even in November) but after 5 minutes of walking towards Fira, the crowds disappeared. The trail was busier than we like for hiking, but not ""crowded"" (but likely crowded in July-August). Took us 3 hours from Oia. Trail condition is good-excellent, with no tricky or dangerous parts. At least running shoes recommended (no sandals or flip-flops) as trail is rocky. In off-season, there is no water available, no cantinas midway. It was sunny and very warm in November (so must be scorching in July-August) with little to no shade. Arriving Fira, we were back into crowds and tourist junk shops.

Greece,AussieLizzie,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I did the hike from Fira to Oia and caught the bus back to Fira at the end. The weather was glorious, the trail was spectacular and uncrowded and I loved every minute! It took me a little while to find the trail head (which is by the big church), but once I was on the path, it was easy to follow. There's a small section closer to Oia where you walk on the road, but the path picks up again after that. There's some gravely section also towards the end also, so I would recommend good walking shoes.",Oct 2019
Greece,Daniel J O,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"My wife and I enjoy long nature walks and it was obvious that we were looking forward to this hike when we visited Santorini. So we set off from our hotel by bus to the Fira Central Station at about 9.00am on 18th September 2019.

We then strolled to Firostefani for about 15 minutes to the start of the hike. Our first sight of the caldera was mind-boggling. You can never get tired of this view. We took so many pictures at the starting point.

We had read many reviews about the need to have proper shoes and drinking water and snacks and we came prepared.

The walk is really beautiful taking pictures every few metres and passing many hotels, houses, churches, restaurants and going up and down on smooth pavement and rough terrain. All this while enjoying the magnificent view of the caldera.

This is one of the best things we have ever done - and its free!!! When you plan to visit Oia from other parts of the island, we advise that you hike it there instead of taking the bus. We completed the hike in about 3 hours with many photo stops.

Please note that the section between Imerovigli and Oia can be very challenging if you are not fit - loose rocks, paths along the cliff edge, steep climbs and descents etc so you need to be very confident about your physical ability to complete the second half of this hike.

But we really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.

Greece,Mark P,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,Great walk through some of the beautiful towns on santorini with some amazing views of the caldera. Well worth wearing proper shoes as many parts of the trail are either rocky or uneven. While short in length it is mostly up and down with no shade so worth taking lots of water and avoided if not comfortably capable of walking 10 miles on the flat.,Oct 2019
Greece,Trelen,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"Whilst we always do a lot of walking on our holidays, we’re not really hikers but have recently been trying to incorporate one or two more outdoorsy walking activities rather than just stomping around the streets of various cities around the world. With this in mind we decided we would give the Fira to Oia hike a go. My husband isn’t great in the heat so we set off reasonably early, 8:30am and managed to get the first hour completed in the shadow of the hotels along the Caldera just before you reach the Agios Markos church.

After this point things start to get tougher and trainers are an absolute must at a minimum, if not hiking shoes. There are some precarious stretches of the trail with loose rocks/pebbles and a barbed wire fence to grab hold of to steady yourself!

The view is magnificent as you can imagine, especially at the top of the highest point, but after 2 hours you do start to long for the shade of Oia and the prospect of a cold drink and an ice cream.

We started at Firostefani and it took us under 3 hours to reach the centre of Oia, I can imagine in the baking heat of summer this would be much more strenuous than when we attempted it, so just make sure you head out early, wear correct footwear and take water and a hat. Glad we did it.

Greece,Steph P,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"I did this hike in 5 hours, including Skaros Rock. The scenery was stunning, and it was an excellent workout. I didn't need my map often given the number of other tourists heading in the same direction.

As a beginner in hiking, I found it challenging, especially with the variety of terrain and steeper sections. I had on a sturdy pair of running shoes and wished I had a light pair of hiking shoes or boots. I was behind a tour group of seniors who took things quite slow, and I needed to do the same. It's absolutely worth it! I recommend starting around 7/8 a.m. I left at 9 and it got very hot by midday which less enjoyable than the morning.

Greece,k2LoFlyaNZ,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"They tell us that the Fira - Oia walk has less uphill - well that way must be pretty hard! We suggest an early morning or late afternoon stint. This is hard slog at times - minimum three hours if you stop for photos and a drink or food. There are heaps of photo opportunities and absolutely gorgeous views to be had. Take water as there is only one stop after you leave the end of Fira and it can get damned hot. There is a long downhill, then uphill stretch after you leave Fira and halfway along there is a cafe - the road from here leads to a church on the top of the hill - you can view this and take photos but take the path back you came up, and go back and around the right hand side of the hill as the path on the left is very treacherous and loose.

Greece,jessyljung,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Hiking the path from Fira to Oia was a real highlight as it follows the Caldera and offers amazing views of the island. On the first stretch of the path, you'll walk through beautiful villages and then halfway through you'll be following a more traditional hiking path. Wear sportive shoes and clothes. Check out the Santorini Dave blog for useful information on how to complete this hike and nice lunch stops (we recommend Blue Note for the views and the quality food) on the way. We also visited Skaros rock, which adds another hour or so to the hike and involves climbing a lot of stairs. I would recommend it (even though we decided not to climb the rock itself as that didn't look entirely safe) as you get a great view of the island from here and as there's a hidden church in a scenic spot.

Greece,Crossman51,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"Quite an interesting gambol along the Santorini cliff tops. The path is easy to follow - rough in places easy walking in others can be steep up and down too. There are plenty watering holes to stop for food or refreshments along the route including a caravan on a road lay by and a small - obviously family owned and run - cafe both with a limited but chilled range of drinks. The pathway also takes you past several up market hotels/spas should you feel the urge but basically you take this path for the open views sweeping down the caldera to the blue waters and the horizon. You also pass an old chap with a few do nkeys for those that indulge in such a thing. Overall it is a very worthwhile walk with great views. It took us just over 3 hours which included two pit stops for beer , numerous photo calls and chats with fellow walkers. You do need to be able bodied and not breathless after a few flights of stairs but certainly not an athlete.

Greece,rickysmom,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"I did this hike last week. I am 60. I read plenty of reviews on Trip Advisor calling this a ""must do"" and ""relatively easy"". I wore trainers. Wish I had brought legit hiking boots. My ankles are not that strong and there were lots of uneven surfaces and loose rock. Also could have used my hiking poles. We started from Atlantis Hotel in Fira a little later than I would have liked, around 10:30 AM. It was extremely crowded at the start with all of the day trippers from the cruise ships but the crowd thinned out after Skaros Rock. We did not go out to Skaros rock because I was going slower than I anticipated. The inclines are much more frequent than others have mentioned and much steeper. For me anyway. I was much slower on the downhill parts. Spraining an ankle or worse was not on my agenda and it was really slippery. Whoever told Grecians that uneven rocky ""cobblestones"" were great to walk on? This would have been MUCH easier if the entire trail were unpaved. I'm glad I did this, but I wouldn't call it a ""not to miss"" experience. Bring water, wear sunscreen and go at your own pace. Our hotel was in Oia and I believe it took us a little over 4 hours. We did stop once for a Coke for which I paid a scandalous 3 euro. That probably added about 15 minutes to our travel time. Good luck. Once you get to Oia have a fabulous lunch. You've earned it. I am particularly happy that I did not choose a hotel in the other towns that would have had hikers like me walking past all day long.

Greece,Nathan C,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"So we walked the trail starting from Fira and started around 9am. I wish we had startrd earlier as it does get quiet warm out there. As others have stated, take plenty of water and wear good shoes with a grip. Wearing sandles on this walk is asking for trouble.

For experienced hikers this is not hard; however, if you rarely go for a walk then take a bus or taxi to Oia since there are a few steep inclines, tons of loose rock and volcanic pebbles and steep drop offs.

If you do this 6.5 mile hike you will definitely see amazing views that you would not otherwise see.

Greece,Archie_XX,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Starting at the Cable Car station in Fira you can walk to Oia along the edge of the Caldera with beautiful views. There are quite a few steps and a reasonable climb over a large hill nearing the end of the walk, but if you take your time and wear decent clothing and footwear, it should be within the capability of most mobile people. The walk is supposedly 6 miles, I am 60 years old and did it in just under three hours. Try to avoid the heat of the day, we started around 8 in the morning, arriving in Oia at 11 and had a good breakfast. The bus back to Fira was just under 2 Euros. There are great views to be had and there is great cameraderie with other walkers. You need to go prepared, take water with you as there are drinking places on the way, take a hat for the sun. Several pretty churches on some of the hills. Some of the ground is quite stony so don't try it in light shoes or flip flops.

Greece,Fábio L,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Great hike! Great views!

We actually weren't even planning on going hiking, so my girlfriend didn't even have any kind of walking-shoes with her. But the many reviews online convinced us. So we just went to a store (close to perissa) and we bought some sneakers for her (for like 10€ or something) the day before. (You can just google cheap clothing stores, that attend just tourist traps. 😁

We parked our car in Fira, caught a bus to Oia and from there we went back to Fira hiking.
There are a lot of free parking spots in Fira the morning, around 9am. When we arrived back at the car in Fira around 2pm, the parking place was super crowded and it would have been impossible to just park there. Anyway...

It's a great path that takes you through great mountain sights. Most of the track you have a great sight. At pretty much anytime you can stop to take a picture. It's beautiful. Well... Most of it... Take enough water though. We took one bottle (1,5L) for two people and it emptied pretty quickly. Luckily we had like a small cabin/store/cafe that sells water and stuff on the way (more or less on half of the way, where you walk along the street for about 5 or 10min). I'm not sure about the opening hours and all though.

The path itself wasn't hard. You don't really need a gps or anything, cause the path is pretty straight forward (we had our phones as emergency gps though). A few confusing spots came up towards imerovigli, but the trail is marked. Normally you can find painted marks on the ground to find the path or at least signs pointing towards Imerovigli.

Greece,Rosie-holidaylover,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"As we are staying in the town of Oia on the island of Thira, we did the walk starting from here and going through to Fira.

Knowing that it would be hot, we started out at 8am armed with sunscreen, hats, fruit and plenty of water (at least 1 litre each I would say and the maximum temperature was only 24 degrees today). We were also wearing good walking sandals.

Heading out of the main drag of Oia it is a bit hard to know where to turn off the road for the caldera walk - I couldn't see the exact turnoff on any of the maps that I consulted.

Look out for the market on your right called Perivolas - you will see a sign on the adjacent wall saying ""walking path to Fira 11 kms.""

Going up the first rise to the little church is quite tough and there are a few more steep climbs, but the views definitely do make it worth it - they are spectacular!

Just before the half way mark we arrived at Omma, an upmarket hotel on the edge of the caldera. As I was in need of a bathroom, we enquired if we could just order a coffee and we were told we could at the pool bar.

We ordered a double Greek coffee and a latte. The coffees took quite a long time to arrive (I would say at least 15-20 minutes) and, whilst we were enjoying the rest and the caldera views, we got a bit annoyed when another couple who had arrived at least five minutes after us received their coffee before us. When they came they were accompanied by glasses of water and four small biscuits. My latte was quite small and only tepid, but the Greek coffee was okay.

When I went to pay, they said my credit card was not working and I had to pay cash. I handed over a 10 euro note - I was very surprised when she said the bill was 13 euros. About another 5-10 minutes walk further on there is a taverna which I'm sure would have much more reasonable prices.

As you walk through Imerovigli, there are many more hotels, villas etc and this town blends into the outskirts of Fira.

If you are reasonably fit and agile, I would strongly recommend doing this walk - it is an experience I am sure you will remember for a long time.

Greece,cebchickie,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We took the less common, more uphill route from Oia to Fira, leaving from our hotel mid-morning and returning from Fira by bus after lunch. We wondered if the hike would live up to all of the reviews of ""amazing views"", but I can confirm is certainly does. Hiking south from Oia seemed to be a more uphill climb, with the steepest terrain contained in the first 1/4 of the hike, and more gradual inclines for the rest. Suggest a hat, sunscreen, LOTS of water, and NO flip-flops/sandals - comfortable athletic shoes are a must. We followed the trail using the AllTrails app, which I also recommend as there were few signs to direct us on the right path. Allow 3 hours for the hike. I do not recommend for anyone with any knee/hip issues or not in at least average physical condition.

We enjoyed lunch under the shaded patio at Mama Fira (great views, but dry chicken souvlaki), and then walked through Fira to the bus station. On our way, we found there is more of a ""main drag"" (for pedestrians only, no cars) further into Fira with lots of street food restaurants/ice cream/shops which we probably would have preferred, although there were no views of the Caldera from there. FYI - bus was $1.80/person, fully packed, and be aware that the later you arrive to the station, the fewer departure times there are per hour back to Oia.

One day we took a taxi to Fira and walked back to the hotel (Santorini Princess) which took over an hour. Then another day we took a taxi to Oia and walked back to the hotel, which took us 2 hours.

Both legs were manageable but definitely best to take appropriate footwear as the ground varied from gravel and large rocks and it very steep at times. Take water, a sun hat and sun creme.

It’s simply a stunning view from almost every part of the trek and well worth the sweat. There are a few beautiful churches dotted along the trail which are nice places to rest.

1. it is not well signposted at all, get into Fira and head to the cable car, then follow the cobbled path through the many shops (and people), this is the path!
2. keep the ocean on your left and you won't get lost. it isn't always obvious which way to go so don't be afraid to ask people along the way
3. wear running shoes or hiking shoes. i can't emphasize this enough, we saw lots of people in flip flops or similar - a disaster waiting to happen. The terrain is very uneven in places and very up and down
4. do not attempt unless you are reasonably fit and in good health. This is not a long walk it is a long hike. I am fit and active and it was not an easy 3 hours by any means. Some parts are easy and others are treacherous
5. pick a time of day when it is not as hot. we left at 3pm and arrived in Oia at 6pm, found a restaurant and had a long cool drink and watched the sunset! Oia is very busy so you should book a restaurant if you want a sunset view. we were lucky and found one with availability.

It took us 3 hours and we didn’t stop a lot for pictures or breaks. We had a 1.5 litre of water each and that was enough. The sun was not super hot at this time of day. For the most part the trails were easy to follow: there are little marker signs so you know where to go. Follow the coast for the most part and you will be fine. There is a small portion where you will have to walk on the road. As for difficulty it is easy but some uphill sections that are more intermediate.

Greece,RAnnDomized,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"One of my bucket list items while in Greece was to hike from Fira to Oia and I’m glad it did it. The views are great and while it’s not excessively strenuous, I work out and I found this hike to be tough at some points (mostly points involving me walking uphill!). If you’re in decent physical shape then you can do this hike - just go at your own pace. I did the hike in about 3 hours and based on my iPhone, I walked 14km. Your time will depend on how often you stop to rest and take photos etc.

A few tips:

1) Start early. I started at 7:30 and enjoyed a cool breeze for the majority of my hike (I was still hot though!). Any time after 8:30 is too late because you’re going to feel the heat a LOT more. Others have also suggested that starting later in the day is good as well. This will depend on whether or not you’re going to stay in Oià for the sunset. I didn’t.

2) Bring at least a 1.5L of water and a snack.

3) Do not be a moron and wear flip flops or Birkenstocks. There’s a portion of the trail that runs through Imerovigli that is ‘paved’ (flat cobblestone type of road) but it can be slippery. You’ll also go through portions of the trail that are dirt and gravel, or actual cobblestone which can make it hard on your legs. Wear hiking shoes, boots or runners that have decent grip.

4) Pay attention to the very small and very limited signs... these are not abundant. Just remember - the ocean should be on your left as you head toward Oià.

5) Bring a camera!

6) You can take the bus back from Oià for 1.80€. These run every 20 minutes but do remember that they are often on ‘Greek time’.

Don’t forget sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat!

Greece,vnn,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,3.0,"We started the Fira-Oia walk from Imerovigli. Nature is impressive. However, the walk was spoiled by the fact that long segments are along hotel arrays so that one ends up looking at the hotels and their hosts possibly in their rooms rather than the caldera. Also at least one segment with the stinking/annoying ""donkey droppings"" that characterize several sites of the island (e.g.: the stairs from Fira to the old harbour, the Oia-Ammudi one or the Perissa-Ancient Thira path). Given the fact that this is one of the most touristic attractions of the island, an effort to maintain the path beyond the hotels fronts should be made. Good shoes and good physical shape are recommended.",Aug 2019

Remember to take plenty of water and sun lotion. Waring a pair of good walking shoes is smart and necessary. Of course the views all long the hike are amazing. If you do decide to take the public bus back to Fira, make sure you do so at the bus terminal in Oia . We made the mistake of waiting at a bus stop just outside the town and stood around for more than an hour(bus schedule posted is not accurte for the weekend). We eventually took a privite van taxi with some other people who also gave up waiting. There was a bus passing by as we were ready to get on the taxi, but it was totally full.

From our apartment in Firastefani overlooking the caldera we could see Oia and the hike did not look that strenuous. But we had read that it gets very hot in the middle of the day so we brought 3 liters of water for 4 of us, plus wore sneakers, and caps and sunscreen. We started off at 8 AM when it was pleasant (in July). By 9:30 to 10 AM the sun was relentless and because it was still early we were lucky to be in the shade for the first half of the visit. We arrive at Oia around 11:30, it was very hot in the sun. The views were spectacular. There are some steep uphill areas. The path is well marked. We saw several people as we approached OIa heading in the oppositve direction who just had sandals and did not look prepared at all.
Note that going from Fira to OIa is less uphill than the other way around.

I walked the trail from Thira to Oia and it took me about 3.5 hours at a decent pace, stopping every now and again to take a few photos, drink some water and reapply sunscreen. I highly recommend the walk as the scenery is simply stunning and is a good way to get to Oia, then you can get the bus back. If you are going to take the walk please make sure that you have a reasonable level of fitness, are not suffering any injuries or illnesses, have plenty of water (I drank about four litres), have sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat. The surface starts of as pavement, which is deceiving as it changes to cobbled streets, loose gravel, large rocks and dirt. Therefore it is imperative you are wearing decent shoes (not flip flops or flimsy sandals). Also this walk is not suitable for small children or prams. It is advisable to walk it earlier in the morning or later on in the afternoon, to avoid the peak of the sun, as it does become very hot and there is limited shade along the way. This is a must do whilst on Santorini, just make sure you are prepared!

Bring plenty of water and cash for a snack at one of the couple snack stops. I had a beer at one and it was quite refreshing. This hike is not an easy one at this time of day. There is quite a bit of elevation change throughout the hike and the trail degrades in a few areas to make it more of a moderate hike. The trails through the villages are nice.

We often walk so it wasn’t too bad for us but if you’re not used to walking or have a mobility problems this isn’t the hike for you. We did have difficulty finding the path from Fira as it was closed but soon found another way. The walk has lovely views of the Caldera. There are a few cafes on the way but after Imerovigli there aren’t so bring plenty of water and if you are going to do the hike in the summer it is better to do it’s early in the morning due to the heat. The hike is a bit rocky on foot so bring walking boots or trainers. Part of the walk is on a main road and it’s best that you stop at the roadside cafe before going up the hill. It took us around 5 hours with a few stops for photos and stopping in cafes. I think this is a must thing to do if your a good hiker.

After Imervogili every kilometer it just gets worse. There is a chapel at the top of a steep hill, after which you are on a 2foot wide goat trail, pea gravel with thorny weeds, several hundred feet drop, and then it gets very steep. Despite the stunning Caldera views it's not safe for everyone. We decided as the wind howled it was not safe. Yes you can step around thorny weeds and the loose rock on the cliff edge ... but why? There is no nearby road if it gives way. No rescue spot nearby. This is not just a matter of being in shape, it's also a matter of safety. Good on those who fought the high winds and poor path condition. But for me this was suppose to be fun not unsafe.

Fortunately, other hikers were happy to help point the right direction. For those wondering about their ability to do the walk, our group of three were 67, 76 and 77 years old, all in good physical condition.

Greece,debstersa,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"We hiked this with our boys 15, 12. Firstly, know that getting to the start of the trail was very challenging. There were about 10 people along with us, all searching for the start of this. We all were asking people in town with not much help. The start that we found was closed. After several attempts going up and down stairs to find the beginning from a starting point - it was finally found! There are very small directional signs. Once we got on, the views are very pretty and pretty churches along the route ( I think 2). There are spots of slippery rocks, uphill, downhill. It is very doable- we are not in great shape or hikers. I thought we’d be so sore the next day, but we were not. It’s just long.

I did ask a few times “tell me why are we doing this again?”..... lol. You don’t need to hike this to see fabulous views... they are everywhere. I guess it’s a novelty to do and something for the kids.

We parked our car in Fira. Found a free parking lot at the edge of town near the bus stop that brings you back from Oia. We got there around 8am, but actually started around 9am after getting lost. Arrived in Oia at 12.

We did get lucky in Oia. Normally 6-7 cruise ships are there each day letting out hundreds of tourists. The day we were there, only 1 cruise shipped was docked during our time. It was still quite busy. Can’t imagine how crowded the streets would be with that many people.

We took Santorini Daves advice and actually took a transfer to Oia and hiked from there back to Santorini. It's tough getting cabs out there, so it was recommended to cab to Oia and hike back home rather than do the opposite. It worked for us!
The hike took us a total of 3 hours as we stopped midway at skaros rock which we highly recommend but beware it's not for the faint of heart. There are a lot of stairs and if you actually want to climb the rock its straight up. We got most of the way but decided against climbing to the top since it was a straight climb up and even scarier down. A lot of people decided against it. The rest of it was amazing and we recommend it for the views.
The hike is basically flat, so it's not as hard as the other hikes we did in Santorini.
You walk through a lot of the fancier hotels which is kinda fun and the views are stunning. There is very little shade, at least when we went, so wear a hat and bring a ton of water. We brought our hiking backpacks and filled both bladders. This was a life saver and we highly recommend it.

We started in Fira as that was where we were staying, but you can start in either town. Our hotel was actually located right on the “trail” however just beyond our hotel, the path had been damaged/closed off due to landslides that had occurred earlier in the spring. After a slight detour, we were back on the main path headed towards Oia. There were small signs marking the way, but they were often hard to see. Some sections were steep (climbing the Acropolis felt like nothing after doing this!), but it wasn’t dangerous at any point, & the views were so worth it. It took us a total of 3 hours from start to finish, including all water (& picture) breaks. We started around 10AM & it didn’t take long before it started warming up. I would definitely suggest bringing extra sunscreen (we both ended up a little sunburnt as we only applied sunscreen once, before leaving the hotel) & plenty of water as there really isn't anywhere to purchase any once you're in between towns. After spending some time in Oia, we opted to take a cab back to Fira, which I assume is what most people do. If you have limited time on the island &/or are on the fence about doing this, I would highly recommend reshuffling your schedule to squeeze it in – It’s definitely worth it!

We’re from Texas, so we didn’t think it was too hot - there was a nice breeze - but without the breeze, it could be. The only downside was when the terrain was less steady, I found myself looking down to watch my footing rather than enjoying the views around me. But, we did stop a lot to take it all end.

But the Views are breathtaking looking out at the ocean & cruise ships, down on the villas, towards Oia and then back towards Fira. You walk past wedding venues & we saw 3 in progress. Give yourself at least 3hrs to do the trail at a leisurely pace, & to stop for photos & admire the views. Wear good shoes, as a bit of trail is gravelly & stones are quite loose. So easy to follow the signs. You can do it yourself or pay & get a guided walk. You can also do 1/2 the trail & get the public bus the rest of the way to Oia.

Many will volunteer the help without even asking! Very few markings. A couple of new hotels have been built over the trail. The trail surface is a combination of everything possible. Wear decent shoes, no flip flops! And be prepared for heat and sun. I think that in the morning the preferred direction would be westbound (sun at your back), and the reverse for later in the day. Great views of the caldera, for free! Any where along the trail for sunset views, but be careful to be done before dark. It would be dangerous without light.

You will walk approximately 8 miles (though they say it’s only 12k) through some towns, hotel resorts on the cliffs, hiking paths of cobble stone, rocks and volcanic ash. Up and down several steep climbs (no not mountain climbing, just some steep “hills”). Unforgettable views of the Caldera. I’m not in super great shape, but was plenty fine doing this trip - definitely wear sneakers/tennis shoes with some tread, leave early in the morning (by 8am) to avoid the afternoon sun and heat. Bring 2 bottles of water and slather yourself with sunscreen and a hat. Be prepared with your camera for some ultimate shots of Santorini! And YES - you’ll walk the whole way over and through the hills in photo 2 all the way to Oia. ENJOY!

Greece,Katiek957,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"it is 11km. We did it in the middle of the day (like idiots). It was a bit hard to get started as a section was blocked off between Fira and Firastefani but we figured it out. Once you get going its one trail and you can't get lost. There are two sections with a big hill climb that is gravel and rocky (with some donkey droppings mixed in). But there are some great views and its good exercise. Just don't do it in the middle of the day like we did - there is 0 shade. The hike is about 3 hours, plus any extra stops you take.",Jun 2019
Greece,dashark12,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,Its funny to me as I hiked and or ran portions of this trail that there were view points since the entire hike is a view point. Best time to do this trail is early morning ( I would go at 6:45 am) or just after sunset. The trail is very rocky and uneven and not much in elevation change.,May 2019
Greece,bonnie_ds,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We are a family of 4 - 2 adults 2 children. Children are very fit, parents are not so :D. Together we hiked from Fira to Oia. On the way we met many families, never lost our way and even found a white large dog we named snowy who accompanied us for part of the journey. Many people thought he was our dog cause he would pause and wait for us to catch up.. Below are some tips.

1. Start early. Cannot stress this more. We started an 8:00 am. The 3.5 hour hike took us 4.5 hours.

2. PAce yourself. It's not a race, our goal was to make it. Enjoy the scenery.

3. Ask often. A simple Kalimera and some key words helped us with the locals who pointed us in the right direction several times, and one of them even had us follow him.

4. It's easy to get lost the only downside is you walk more but can get back on track.

5. Most of the hike was hot but breezy which helped. But there is one long stretch nearer the end where there is absolutely no breeze and it's all up hill. So carry water, frozen if possible.

6. We took a taxi back to Fira 30E because the bus didnt stop since it was too full.

Have fun, you can do it.

Greece,Liz L,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This is a stunning walk along the ridge of the caldera side of Santorini. Fira and Oia were way too touristy and overrun with people from the cruise ships for me to want to hang out in, so this walk was perfect for checking out the towns but not having to stay here. From Fira to Oia it took me 4 hours even with a diversion in Firostefani (part of the path washed out), and frequent stops for photos at a leisurely pace including some wrong turns. In some spots it can be confusing, but google maps was pretty helpful to navigate and there will be other people walking the trail- most from the South to North direction. There are frequent buses between Fira and Oia, so if you walk from Fira to Oia you can take the bus to or from either town- there were also taxis at the bus stops. I had a rental car because I stayed in Perissa so I just drove to Oia early, scored a parking spot at the bus stop and hopped on the bus back to Fira to begin my walk (I had dinner reservations in Oia). As others have said, its not a difficult walk, though there is some uneven pavement and some scree out of town closer to Oia- I wore vibrams, but sneakers or hiking sandals are fine. You just need to be able to walk several hours. Wear a hat and bring some water because you are completely exposed to the sun.

Mid point there are donkeys / horses to take you up not sure how far but they said to Oia. Some paths of the walk are actually on the road so just have to walk in a single file.

Greece,Simran,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"A great tough walk and way to see Santorini for 2 moderately fit people. The walk from Fira to Imerovigli was the easiest part. Lots of uphill from there towards Oia.

Took us about 5 hours as we detoured to climb Skaros Rock at Imerovigli - which was totally worth the detour and lots of photo breaks (to catch our breath). We left Fira at about 9.30am - leave earlier if possible so that you don't get caught in the midday sun at the highest points towards Oia.

Wearing proper shoes is recommended (walking shoes / trainers will be sufficient) as there are some slippery paths though we did see people attempting the walk with flip flops and even sundresses on. It's pretty breezy so a sunburn might be underestimated - lots of sunscreen is recommended. Pee before leaving - no toilets on the way and bring enough water. There was only one shop along the way.

All in all, glad we did this walk. We treated ourselves to some great Gyros in Oia after :)

Greece,Scottygirl,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I am a 62 year old woman who is not terribly fit other than long beach walks. I did this walk with my husband who is younger. The walk from Fira to Oia was on my ""to do"" list and I was pretty apprehensive about it. We were staying in Imerovigli and planned to walk from there to Oia only but once we walked to the very end of Oia (to the very tip) we decided to bus back to Fira and complete the entire walk that way... call me crazy but I'm so glad we did the full distance :)

Luckily we had a day with a little breeze to cool us and we didn't need any toilet stops - just as well as there were none on the way. We had just done quite a bit of walking while in Rome and found this walk to be pretty easy all things considered - clearly I am not too bad at hills after all. We let many people pass us as I wasn't in a rush but we still did the walk from Imerovigli to the start of Oia in around 2 hours. I must admit that when we got to the top of the last hill and spotted Oia I was pretty relieved.

Anyway, it was well worth it and we enjoyed every part of it.

The walk can be challenging in some parts so good walking shoes and a decent amount of water required. There are no toilets once you pass the villages.

We did the trip twice, the first time we walked from Fira to Oia, then explored Oia and got the bus back. The 2nd time we decided to walk both ways with just a stop for coffee in Oia. The walk is not difficult, there is just one area just where there is a lot of loose gravel stones, where you need to be careful. There is also a 200 metre stretch where you have to walk on the road and need to be careful. Of course you need to wear reasonable shoes, training shoes are ok, you don't need walking boots. There are a only a couple of places to get refreshments, so take plenty of water. The views are stunning, not just across the caldera but also looking inland to the east coast. You should allow about 2.5 hours one way and 5.5 hours if you want to walk both ways.

Greece,peterharrison38,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"After researching the Fira to Oia hiking trail, and reading a number of reviews, my wife and I decided, with some trepidation to undertake the walk. At this point I should say that we are both 60+, but we walk a minimum of 4.5km daily, lead a physically active life style and are physically fitter than most of our friends. Having read, depending upon which review you look at that, that the time taken is generally 2 - 5 hours and the Fira to Oia direction is easier than the Oia to Fira walk which we were doing, with a return on the local bus KTEL bus line.

We agreed therefore that an hour or so into the walk we would reassess our progress. So with broad brim hats, sun screen, a litre of water, appropriate footwear and a spirit of adventure in our hearts we departed Oia at 9.30am. We walked consistently, stopping to take numerous photos and had a 5 minute break for a can of soft drink which we purchased from a small stall holder at about the half way mark. Without any exhaustion, rushing, just simply enjoying the experience we finished one hour and fifty-five minutes after we had begun!

The track is generally in good condition, has a couple of high hills, but is a must for anyone with an average level of fitness. We would probably suggest that children under 10 or 11 give it a miss, not because they couldn’t do it, but simply because they would find it boring. So if you are tired of the people watching, or looking for lunch spots, do this walk, it was the high point of our stay and another wonderful opportunity to take some incredible photos.

Not very easy with kids and elders, as the hike gets steep at various points. Definitely a must to carry loads of water and might get tiresome during peak summer sun. Follow the sign boards after the cable car station, else you might hit dead ends at a couple of points. It does get away from the caldera at a few points along the hike.

It takes you along the caldera cliff and through the villages of Fira, Firostefani, Imerovigli, and Oia.The trail from Fira to Oia is just under 10.5km (6.5 miles). Part of the path is similar to a sidewalk, parts are cobblestone, and parts are a dirt path. There is a good climb in both directions. We(My wife, 12 year old daughter and me)Planned to start the walk from our villa at Firostefani at 7.30 am, but started at 8.00. It was a perfect day for a hike - not too sunny with nice winds.

Greece,AKo,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I forget how I found this trail info, but if in Santorini and have the time, highly recommend. We stayed in Oia, so we took the public bus to Fira (cost 1.80 Euro and the public buses look like a tour bus!). The bus schedule lists times at the major stops, so be prepared to wait (and don't try and get on a school bus like we almost did! OOPS). Get off at the Fira bus terminal stop - I think almost everyone got off so it's hard to miss the stop.

Anyway, this ""hike"" is easy to moderate, with pathways, pavement, dirt, rocks, definite uphills, and uneven steps. Our parents were with us and they definitely would not have made this hike - they are not hikers and they don't like long walks! Nothing technical, don't need hiking poles, but recommend closed-toed shoes (hiking boots may be a bit too much, I did it in water shoes - although slightly uncomfortable with the rocks, totally do-able). We were in a time crunch, but with the wait for the bus, one detour (the pathway was closed in Fira due to a small landslide), we started at 7:20 and got back to the hotel by 10:30 AM. The actual hike took us about 2.5 hours - of course we stopped for photos but didn't take the side pathways to other places - although if we had time would be worth it.

We did it from Fira to Oia because the guide I printed recommended that (and I didn't want to get lost - although in hindsight it would have been hard to get lost). It would have been possible to hike to Fira and then back, but again time crunch!

You can hire a guide, but using Google maps as a back up and finding a good step by step guide on the internet, this is totally worth it.

Bring a hat, sunglasses, sunblock, water and snacks - the small stores may not be open depending on the time and day you hike. Also I would try to go early in the day - it would have been super hot if we did it in the early afternoon.

We actually didn't end up making it all the way to Oia during our hike although we did visit the next day. I do recommend wearing some comfortable shoes. Not sure if we were off the trail but all of sudden it was pretty rocky/sandy and my shoe choice was definitely not ideal. Make sure you stop a ton to take in the views!

It is best to start early before it gets too hot, we started at around 9am. This was one of our favourite things we did while we were in Santorini, the views are stunning. The walk took us about 4 hours which included stopping for a drink in Imerovigli and stopping to take photos. I would recommend stopping here as there isn’t anywhere else to stop between here & Oia. I would say that you need a good level of fitness as there is a lot of uphill walking at the start, you will also need good walking shoes or trainers as it is slippery in parts. I would also recommend taking lots of drinking water & sun cream with you.

Now, the actual terrain can get very rocky and gravel-y at times, and sometimes the incline and decline gets steep. That being said, my friends and I were wearing dresses and sandals as we hiked it and we survived, but I almost fell once. I would at least recommend wearing tennis shoes!

It’s very busy at the start but most people turn around once they get to the outskirts of Thera and it becomes a little quieter. It involves a lot of ups and downhill walking but is reasonably easy to do for those having a good fitness level. The path is mostly paved however the section after Profitis Ialias church to Panagia church is either road walking or unmade (and a bit rubbly) and you have to watch your footing. We felt that walking from Thera to Oia seemed the best way to do the walk as there are less inclines and better views.

There has been a landslip on the way to Fira and we got a bit lost trying to find a way round. We ended up walking into town via the road. It’s an easy walk with great views, many restaurants and some shops on the way. Going to Oia was a much longer walk, taking us about 2 1/2 hours. Again great views, but take water as there is nowhere on route to buy any once you leave Imerovigli. Beware of the slippery slope just past the church - quite hard going, especially as we had sandals on. Much of the walk isn’t paved, so wear trainers! The route takes you along a busy road for a little way, but then it’s back onto the track by a little roadside cafe. Quite hilly, but as you keep stopping to look at the view, it’s not strenuous. If you come from Oia to Imerovigli, stop at the Iloperta cafe/bar, for a cold drink and lovely view.

The trail itself is easy to follow. There are some parts of the trail that are slippery with loose rocks, There are two hills to hike over along the way giving you great views of the island.

Greece,DNARules,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We did this hike after taking the local bus from Oia to Fira and then hiking back to Oia. It's well worth the effort, but it could be a challenge for some people, especially in the extreme heat of the summer. It can also be a bit challenging to find the start of the hike in Fira, but basically, if you just keep heading towards Oia (north) and west, through Fira and the other towns along the way, you will find your way. A couple of the hills could be tough. This is not a simple stroll or walk. The views are great!",May 2019
Greece,HannaP79,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"It took us about 4 hours, because we had to take so many pictures! The lenght is about 10km. Part of it was roads and stairs and part of it was gravel path.

Greece,Allen L,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This is a lovely walk, one that we took starting from Imerovigli (where we were staying). In order to catch morning light and avoid crowds we struck off at 7 am, just shortly after sunrise. What a great choice that was! We we're 2 hours into the walk before we saw another hiker in the path.

Our walk took over 3 hours because we took many stops for photo opportunities, watch cruise ships arriving, and just generally soak in the fabulous views. There were a modest amount of up and down-hill elevation changes, and the path varies from cobblestones to loose volcanic rock to highway (one section only). Before departure we read quite a good review on SantoriniDave dot com and it proved quite accurate. The only place we found a bit confusing was entering Oia, after walking by a few newer resort developments we entered the parking lot of an industrial plant (a water facility?) and the trail was no longer evident. We stayed to the right of the building and then found the trail again to the left after that, and it eventually dead-ends at a main road. At that point we turned left again and headed deeper into town.

Whatever you do, carry water (there were no snack shops or other convenience shoos open on the way) and wear good shoes! Open shoes like sandals or flip flops will get filled full of stones on several sections.

Once in Oia we walked throughout the town and found we had conveniently arrived just after the shops had opened but before most of the tourist traffic. However, we didn't leave Oia on the bus until after lunch and by then the town was jammed with people.

In total we covered 13 km from start to finish before jumping on the bus, but the trail itself was more like 8 or 9 km from Imerovigli.

Greece,ericaaispuroregan,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This is an absolutely amazing hike with so many wonderful views! However, proceed with caution if you want to do the entire hike from Fira to Oia! From Fira to Imerovigli, the hike is not bad. There are plenty of stops along the way and the towns are not too far from one another. However, when you pass Imerovigli and you start heading towards Oia, that is basically the point of no return. That is a very big stretch and if you injure yourself (like I did) there was no turning back and I was forced to continue on. If you hike a lot, then this will probably be fine but if you do not, I would recommend do parts of the hike and the other parts taking the bus. If you do decide to do the whole thing (which is amazing and I am proud I did it), make sure to bring the proper equipment and clothing (i.e. good shoes, proper clothing, and lots of water). Highly recommend walking sticks if you have them. Your knees will thank you.

Greece,Kensingtonfoodiegirl,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We started our hike in Imerovigli and ended it at Ammoudi Bay/Port in Oia. We had such a good time and highly recommend doing this walk.

We checked the time on google beforehand and we beat it. :) You can make an exercise out of it or walk slowly, up to you. Great photo opportunities with stunning views.

At no point did I feel unsafe. You just need to walk a bit more carefully on the gravel, otherwise an easy walk. The hills can be a bit challenging, but if you take breaks and take some water, nearly everyone should be able to do it.

Treat yourself with a great lunch or dinner at Ammoudi Bay or have an ice-cream at Lolita in Oia. Delicious! Try the orange sorbet, so yummy. If you're too exhausted, then don't take the steps down to Ammoudi Bay. I believe there are taxis or buses.

Greece,GabriellaBrondani,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"A great way to see the best views of the Caldera, from different angles, by foot. We struggled to find the starting point/signs for the hike in Fira, but when we did eventually find the signs it wasn't difficult to navigate the route. We did the hike in Spring time which made it very pleasant weather-wise. If you are hiking it in peak summer make sure you take a lot of water with you, but try not overload with water because there didn't look to be any toilets along the way! There were a handful of uphills which were tough and a few patches with loose sand/stones which made it tricky, but for the most part the hike was manageable. You can do the hike in reverse (Oia to Fira) but personally the route from Fira to Oia seems like a better way to go. Once we got to Oia, we grabbed a bite to eat and then caught a public bus back to Fira (for 1.80 Euro each and took 30 minutes).

Greece,harryrob429,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"My wife and I were staying in Imerovigli and decided to walk to Fira and back to our hotel. In a fit of madness we thought that we would
continue the walk to Oia, as it was described as ‘easy.’ Well the initial stretch from Imerovigli was quite easy, as we passed some high class property whilst enjoying the sea view. However, further along the walk the path got quite slippy due to the loose lava chippings, so we spent most of our time on our backsides. Also, some of the steps on the pathway were slightly too high for a person with short legs like me.
However, we did it and gave ourselves a pat on our dusty backs!

If you like walking and/or scenery and can happily walk for 3 hours with a coffee or beer stop half way then it's for you.
It's really easy to follow the trail, wear sensible trainers or walking boots and dream of the beer or icer cream you'll get in overpriced Oia on your arrival!

Greece,Jaimie,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We chose Santorini specifically for the 6.5-mile hike from Fira to Oia. Most websites say it takes 2.5 hours but it took us just under 4 hours, traveling with people ages 26, 32, and 62. We did stop to take photos along the way, and parts of the path were closed for construction projects/repairs. Get clear instructions about which direction to take when you check in so you don’t spend the first part of the hike “getting lost.” The vista is worth the uphill climb. There are two big “hills” to overcome, and the path is loose gravel, but be prepared and take your time. It’s not a paved trail but a mixtures of terrains that isn’t clearly marked, but any path you take will be beautiful. The views of nature and classic Greek villages is worth it! This was one of the best things we did in Greece. Arrive in Oia before sunset, and bring your own water. There aren’t restrooms along the way, so plan accordingly.

Greece,Emer J,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I hiked this alone in March, had a perfect day for it! Took about 3.5 hours to get to Oia (once i eventually found my way out of Fira...) and it was well worth the trouble. The views were spectacular, and the sense of achievement when i got to Oia was awesome! I’m not a super experienced hiker, but i’m in reasonable shape, am cautious, and take my time when i need to.
HOWEVER... It’s not as easy as i had heard. There’s one point in particular where i made a poor choice... at one point, a bit over half way through i think, the trail splits. From Fira side, if you take the right trail you have an easier path, with a slightly less spectacular view of the lowlands, rather than the Caldera. At least that’s what i found out after... i took the left trail and found it extremely tricky. More than a few expletives were used... the path was super narrow, riddled with gullys and seemed to be entirely composed of loose red volcanic rocks. Was glad when i got to the bottom...
Going up the next hill I found a bit tricky also, quite a lot of loose rocks and stones.
My advice to novice hikers for this trail: bring a backpack with plenty of water and some snacks, if you have hiking poles, use them, and wear boots. I would definitely not have made it through in sneakers (even if my feet did feel like lead by the end).
And enjoy it! One of the most spectacular views i’ve experiences on a hike, it was stunning.

- Surface varies from sidewalk to cobblestone to dirt and gravel, flip flops not good

We were told by locals not to do this hike after sunset and after doing it, we surely understand why. I would also not recommend the entire hike for elderly or young children.

So we opted for a milder version, taking it in the trail from Fira to Imerovigli areas, enjoying obviously amazing views of the sea/caldera, still quite hilly in parts, still need super good shoes/water and best to do early am/late afternoon so not to bake in the heat but so worth the experience.

Do bring plenty of water and maybe a snack, there are few places of respite along the way. Be sure to stop in the beautiful family churches along the way if they are open, the elders are happy to share their history and art with you.

When you get close to Oia, it's easier to see that the islands in the center of the water on the west side are in the center of the crater created by a massive volcanic eruption thousands of years ago and the circle of islands or cyclotic islands of which Santorini is one of many. You also get to see the beautiful color and architecture representative of the island. The only downside can be the strong winds from the north this time of year.

We are not ""real"" hikers and don't do this accept when we travel so we learn as we go. Be sure to pack plenty of water although there are some options to buy water at along the way but they are not always open. We were there in the middle of October so not so busy. After we did the walk, we looked around, got a bite to eat and then took the bus back to Oia. It costs 2 euros per person. I got a chuckle because when i went to check in on facebook about the hike, it only populated Fira to Oia, not the other way around. This then peaked my curiosity and I checked Trip Advisor only to find most people do it from Fira to Oia. OH well, we are from Seattle so we are accustomed to being salmon and swimming up stream. ha ha. So the bottom line is it's a little more difficult of a hike/walk from Oia to Fira and more downhill doing the other way around.

Greece,suea1,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This was one of the most beautiful days ever! My daughter and I started early in the morning from Fira and, as most other people say, we had lots of water, sun screen, and hats. We used Santorini Dave's photos as a scavenger hunt! His description and directions are superb, on his web site. At the second small café, just after the bit on the road I stepped wrong and sustained a hairline fracture in my foot. So the hardest part of the hike was painful. But that did not make it unbearable, and I finished the hike! Very proud of us. This is absolutely not to be missed! Just try not to break your foot in the process!

Greece,kvankuren,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I could say exactly what has already been described as an incredible walk with amazing views. And this walk from Fira to Oia is so much more...it's a walking trail on the inside of the caldera and offers a unique perspective of the geology of the island and old volcano.

There are incredible views of both sides, one side is extremely steep while the other side is only moderately sloped representing the outside of the caldera with it's volcanic ash deposits. Inside the caldera is represented with classic cinder deposits, where you can't see this anywhere else on the island. As you get closer to Oia, check out the random basalt dike that pushed up through the ash / cinder deposits. This is a memory maker, be sensible and keep hydrated.

Greece,daveanddee H,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We began the walk mid-morning on the caldera path just behind our hotel in Firostefani. Climbing up through the village of Imerovigli on a cobbled path and then continuing on rougher tracks, the destination of Oia was tantalisingly in sight throughout - although further away than it appeared!
The views were absolutely stunning from the rim over the caldera. At this time of year the temperature was pleasant for walking and although gravelly in parts, the terrain wasn’t too difficult wearing trainers or light walking shoes. There is a short section of road before the uphill stretch on the final approach.
The taking of far too many photos slowed us down considerably but we arrived in a very chic Oia - looking somewhat dishevelled - in the early afternoon, feeling that this was one of the most scenic walks we have ever done.
Highly recommended!

Greece,DavidZ267,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"We hiked from Imerovigli not fira. Make sure you bring plenty of water and sturdy shoes. We use hiking sticks which was a plus. You can buy water on the way so if you did not bring enough you can supplement it.you know by the first church that you encounter with a blue down there's two ways to go forward the one past the church is much more strenuous and difficult hike one before the church skirts around the hill and seems somewhat easier we found out the hard way. You should be in good shape and be able to complete a fairly long hike like this even from Imerovigli it is approximately 4 miles.also note that the father quoted is to the outskirts of oia you're not going to stop there so you have to go another mile to get to the end of the oia.as a special added bonus when you get to the end of the year you can walk down 272 steps to get to amoudi Bay. It is fun but you do have to dodge the donkeys on the way up and down.here's another good tip when everybody congregates on the hill to watch the sunset walk down the steps a little bit it's much less crowded

Greece,aquablue,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"Let me preface by stating I'm in my mid 60s, live in Florida (all flat land) and was alone. I had read numerous reviews so knew mostly what to expect. I tried to get an early start however I had to rely on the bus schedule from Kamai beach, where I was staying. Also took a while to find the beginning of the trail, so 9:30 was my start time. The first third of the trail, though climbing many stairs, was actually enjoyable with gorgeous views and structured walkways. Then past Skaros rock ( which I didn't hike), it began to get more challenging. The structured walkways had disappeared and the elevations seemed non stop. The highest point of the hike was both beautiful (on the ocean side) and intimidating (when looking down on the roadway ). The last third was quite cumbersome. There was loose gravel on the steep decline on a very narrow part of the trail, making for a hazardous situation, particularly if you're on your own. I took extreme measures descending, taking my time. Luckily I had a folding walking stick that I travel with. It sure came in handy:-). Then after walking the road for about 10 minutes, there was more treachery of steep inclines and many rocks. During this section, there is a man offering donkey rides for this final uphill part. I didn't bite however many do. Then it's down hill, the remainder of the way, still with loose gravel until you get to the outskirts of the town. On my way into town, there was a rock imbedded in the street that I didn't see.. I banged the heck out of my big toe when I tripped. Took awhile to revover. Again, happy for the walking stick.
As I was walking into town, I saw the bus back to Fira. I was tempted, however didn't make sense to not visit Oia. So glad I did...such a beautiful place. I rewarded myself with a delicious spaghetti meal and glass of cold wine. I had drank 1 and half litres of water on the trail, and it wasn't that hot. There were some wonderful breezes that day.
Am I glad I did the hike. Yes! There was a sense of achievement and the views were gorgeous. On my flight home, I sat on the left side of the plane and took beautiful photos of the trail from the air.

I saw some girls in sandals and flip flops very bad idea to be going up and down a mountain with the wrong shoes. The great thing about doing this by yourself is you can go at your own pace, stop when you want, take photos when you want. I had the most fun ever and I am beyond happy I did it.

The path is better marked going from Fira to Oia - but coming the other way you have more choices to make and a few we made were wrong. Bring lots of water, take your time and wear good shoes - the sights are lovely. Fira itself was jammed with tourists. We heard they plan to limit ships and that's probably wise. It was simply too crowded to be enjoyed so I'm glad we opted for the hike instead and knocked it off my bucket list.

Greece,Andrea T,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,2.0,"Since this was rated so highly as something to do in Santorini, I convinced my friend to do this on our vacation. Based on reviews, it seemed like everyone did this hike and it was THE thing to do. Unfortunately, this is the second time I have been misled by reviews of hikes. (Check out my review on the Pathway of the Gods hike in Italy from 2013). Are there great views? YES. Are these views you can see in other ways? Absolutely. Also, as we found out later when we told people we did this, we learned that 1) NO, everyone doesn't do this on their vacation in Santorini and 2) NO, it is not the best way to get great views of the island.

For reference, we did the whole hike, starting in Fira, stopping for a late lunch in Imerovigli and then on to Oia. It took us about 5 hours total - this includes our lunch break plus the numerous stops for photos and rest. (The altitude certainly affected my ability to consistently go uphill without stopping a few times.)

So, I want to set some things straight and give a a review for those, like me, who like to try this kind of activity, but would never be mistaken for an actual hiker.

1) This is NOT mostly flat as some reviews have claimed. Starting in Fira, you walk up just to get through the city. Then to Imerovigli, it's another uphill climb. After this, you have 2 rather large hills to get through before the final descent into to Oia. The last hill is the steepest both up and down.

2) The big issue may not be that you have so much upward hiking, but that there are few breaks in the incline. You start going up and hope that around a bend, there will be at least a short plateau, but mostly it just continues to go up. You are LITERALLY climbing the hills to the top in order to get to the other side where you can finally go down. This is NOT a trail going along side the hills.

3) The trail is definitely a mix of cobblestones, town streets, and loose gravel. For the most part, the trail is wide, but there are a few sections after Imerovigli where the path is quite narrow - one section on the second to last hill, I affectionately refer to as ""The Red Trail of Death"" because it is a steep decline of red dirt and loose gravel. Good times!

If after this you still want to do it, awesome. I don't regret it at all (but I'm now not allowed to suggest hikes on vacation every again) and have a few good stories to tell.

Godspeed.

Greece,Zed_Travels,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We decided to do the hike from Oia (where we were staying) to Fira. Please note, both my wife and I are not very athletic people and were definitely not in great shape for this hike.

This hike was a lot of fun. The views are beautiful, and because the island is so windy, you are able to stay cool for the majority of the hike, even at noon. This hike is primarily on dirt paths / cobble stone roads. The entire path is either up or down hill, I'd recommend you look up the elevations of the towns to get a rough idea of how tall the hills are. Wear appropriate hiking shoes because you can definitely hurt your feet on the stone / dirt roads. There were quite a few people on the trail, and we never felt unsafe due to the road conditions or people. There are two spots where you walk for a bit on the main road. One near Oia which is pretty short, and one in between Oia and Imerovigli which is a bit longer, but still not terrible.

The hike has stunning views of the caldera and surrounding towns. I'd recommend taking a few spots along the hiking trail and marking them on your map, to ensure your going the right way and understand how far you've gone. Bring plenty of water and a few snacks with you as there are some stretches of this hike that you can't get supplies on.

I'd consider us pretty skilled hikers but with photo stops, water breaks, etc 4 hours seemed the fastest we could do. The views are wonderful throughout, and you get to experience a lot of different types of terrain on the hike. Definitely loose gravel at times and some steeper parts. There is a section where you are walking on the road - with smaller groups this would feel a but more scary. The second half of the hike is pretty desolate compared to the first. I would definitely recommend for the views, and the accomplishment of completing an 11km (6 mile) hike. Bring water, wear a hat, re-apply sunscreen, and a snack would have been nice to have. People were in flip flops, but I'd definitely recommend gym shoes. Also - if it's wasn't so hot we would have probably been able to do amoudi bay on the same day.

Greece,welshcornishbird,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Having looked at other reviews and recommendations, we got on the bus from Perissa to Fira at about 9am.
We had a little wander around Fira, took a look at the steps down to the Port, then asked for directions to the start of the trail.
A good proportion of the walk is on almost pavement like track alongside the cliff edge hotels. The views are fantastic and we stopped lots of times to take photos. For me, it sometimes felt a little intrusive on these hotels as you are literally walking next to the edge of their infinity pools etc.

We also walked around Skaros Rock as it seemed a shame to be there and not do it. Parts of this were a little ‘sketchy’ in places, and we didn’t even bother to try to climb the last bit up to the top of the rock, for fear of not being able to get back down again. Not suitable for kids under about 14 I would say for that part.
Between the villages I didn’t see anywhere to use the loo, I may not have looked hard enough mind. There is a small taverna type place on top of the hill out of Imerovigli but you couldn’t use the toilet unless you bought food! There was a loo of some description next to the church of St. Antonios, but it was expectedly filthy and I couldn’t bear to use it! Both the church and Skaros Rock were worth a visit for sure, but the steps back up were a killer in the heat and probably added a good hour or even more on to our walk.
There is a section of the walk which is up and down on sort of scree type soil with loose rocks, and I personally found this section quite tough in the heat (I’m a fairly fit 45 year old, play football!). We stopped and started on this section quite a bit, though any excuse for a photo stop.
By the time we got to Oia, we felt quite grubby and dirty and out of place with all the immaculately dressed crowds off the ships. Oia is stunning for photos but I wouldn’t want to stay there.
This is a fabulous walk. Would definitely recommend it. Wear decent trainers/walking shoes, take your time, sunscreen and lots of water! We drank over 6 litres!

The Fira portion of the hike is mostly businesses anyway. This shortened our hike slightly but really just got us started right on the path.

It’s hilly, rocky, and hot! Wear appropriate shoes, bring water (they sell water somewhat along the way too but definitely bring your own). There is a good portion of the hike in which you are climbing uphill in a desolate part of the island in the heat so you don’t want to be without water!!

Finish your hike in Ammoudi Bay at the bottom of Oia. You’ll take what feels like a million steps to the bottom. There are many seafood restaurants on the water you can eat at! You can also go swimming and rock jumping which is very refreshing after your hike!

Just know that you have to climb back up the stairs when you are done!

The hike took about 3 hours total-but we stopped a lot for pictures.

Greece,loudini56,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We started early to beat not only the crowds but also the hottest parts of the day. Walking past the quaint little B & B’s, shops and Taverna’s was nice enough but looking into the amazing views of the Caldera was just incredible. Every time we stopped was another amazing photo op. My wife and I are not really serious hikers so we turned around after Imerovigli. We finished up just as the hoards from the cruise ships in port for the day were arriving. A truly magnificent walk.",Sep 2018
Greece,Rainxiaor,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"My husband and I (avid hikers) took everyone's advice to go early in the morning to escape the heat and crowds. As we were staying in Oia, it was well worth it to take an early bus down to Fira (starting point) and hike back to Oia.

The trail is not well marked in the towns, but other hikers and locals can easily help point you in the right direction. The parts through Fira and Imerovigli are basically walking alongside hotels facing the caldera on the cliff's edge. After that the trail actually begins in earnest and it is a peaceful solitude between you, the ocean, and the unreal caldera views.

While not a strenuous hike, be sure to bring water and wear appropriate sun protection (there's basically no shade once you leave the towns) and sturdy shoes (loose gravel and dirt for most of the trail). There are no rest stops or restrooms. The pretty little church at the 2/3 point to Oia is a popular stop for many and a good photo op. Enjoy and don't rush it!

It does take a few hours and it is better to leave earlier in the morning but it is well worth the time and well worth the effort. You are constantly seeing breathtaking views and scenic overlooks. Before you embark on this hike, be sure that you have plenty of water and comfortable walking/hiking shoes. The areas in the towns of Fira and Oia are cobblestone and the in between parts are a mix of dirt and gravel, so proper footwear will make it easier.

Greece,distantdreamer,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Have to confess we cheated a bit on this one as didn't think I was up to doing it in one go, so did it in two parts on different days! We caught a bus from Oia to Imerovigli. Several others got off the bus here and we were all looking for a way to get on to the main walking path which was not clear. We ended up asking at a hotel and they kindly let us walk through their dining room which was next to the path! The scenery is absolutely fabulous all the way along to Fira. It is quite built up with all the white buildings and beautiful views everywhere you look. Took us around an hour with plenty of stops for photos. After stopping for a quick drink at Fira we headed back on the bus. The next day we started quite early from Oia and did the rest of the walk which was beautiful but quite different from the previous day. Definitely needed trainers on as very uneven in places. Absolutely stunning and thoroughly enjoyed both sections. Highly recommended!

An absolute must if you’re visiting the island. We completed it in our trail running shoes - do not forget water, although there are plenty places to stop off en route.

We strongly recommend leaving Oia or Fira EARLY in the morning! We left at 630am as the sun was rising and were so thankful as we missed the heat of the day and it was perfect.
It took us 2.5hrs to get to Fira with stops for photos and water breaks along the way.
The trek is not for the faint of heart as there are some heavily rocky areas and steep inclines in some spots. Wear good walking shoes as the pebbles and rocks are pretty uneven. Take plenty of water too. Even early in the morning gets warm and you’ll work up a sweat on the trip.

Greece,Christine D,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,My family traveled to Greece in August. We hiked from Oia to Fira. We started early before 8:00 AM so we would finish before the heat. There were 7 in our group and we completed the hike in 3 hours. We stopped briefly for breakfast along the route. The route is easy to follow and the views are amazing. If you are active and don't mind walking on different types of terrain then this is a must while visiting Santorini.,Aug 2018
Greece,Gilbert Gerber,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This is an absolutely amazing walk.

Walking all the way from Fira to Oia does take around 3-5 hours or so, obviously depending on how fast you walk. It is a fabulous walk and a must do if you are on the island.

We took our 6 & 9 year old with us on the hike. It is not really a difficult walk and if you stop along the way, it can be a really nice all day activity. Buses run in all directions if you would like to go back.

95% of the walk is pretty straight forward, but there is a very short stretch about 1.5 hours from Oia where bad weather battered the hill-path, shortly before you have to walk along the main road (with the main traffic) for a few 100 meters. It was not really an issue, but worth mentioning.

The scenery is absolutely fabulous from Fira all the way along to Imerovigli. This is classic Santorini coastline where you see all the white buildings. This part takes around an hour minimum unless you walk around the small island called ""Skaros Rock"".Skaros Rock is worth the effort, if not on the same day on another day. Give yourself another 30 minutes or so minimum to enjoy the views from and around Skaros Rock. The walk from Imerovigli to Oia will take another 2 hours. After Imerovigli the walk becomes much less built-up.This part is beautiful also, with two remote churches along the way. Once you get close to Oia the white building scenery starts again, ridiculously cool and amazing!

So much to see and do along the way! Have fun!

We met very few people, which was a plus comparing to crowds in Fira and Oiá. If you decide to go in August make sure you start early in the morning.

It should be a pretty easy hike if you are reasonably fit. Takes about 2,5-4h depending on pace. Bring water! Go early in the morning or as we did, in the evening. We went from Fira around 5pm and reached Oia some time before 8. It was hot but totally manageble.

If you are doing it in a hot month then definitely set off very early. We ended up doing it in the middle of the day and it was so hot, some of the people found it extremely difficult due to the heat.

The views are amazing and in my eyes totally worth it but if you’re thinking of taking people who aren’t very fit I would think again as there were a few occasions I think people hated us for suggesting it haha!

All in all it took around 3 hours but we stopped a couple of times. Take a lot of water and sun screen, a hat and make sure you are in trainers as there a few steep sections.

Plan on 3.5 hrs for the whole hike to Oia or you can hike out and back from Fira at your own pace. Don't miss this trail for a private sunset and then dine in one of the small villages along the way.

A lot the uphill parts of this trail were very difficult for us, due to the heat. A few times, we thought about turning back or trying to get a cab, but were in too remote of an area at that part. I am surprised that all these people have said they hiked in flip-flops- DO NOT HIKE IN FLIP FLOPS!!! I wore hiking sandals and was glad I did, there were some parts that were gravelly and steep and could have been slippery in flip-flops. Make sure you bring plenty of water and sunscreen.

Greece,Valerie N,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I had in my head that I would do this hike before I came to Santorini, and I’m glad I had researched it and did it. The island itself is overrun with tourists, so it’s hard to enjoy the towns of Fira and Oia...however beautiful they are.

I was staying just outside of Fira so opted to hike from Fira to Oia, but you can do it the other way round too, of course. Just be aware if doing it in reverse that it will have much steeper inclines. I started from Fira at 3:30, it was still quite hot at that time and in hindsight it probably would have been better starting and hour later. But it was ok. The path is well posted, basically just stay as left as you can and you’ll not miss the path of the caldera. It’s an amazingly beautiful walk that you’ll never forget. I really hope that everyone visiting Santorini has the opportunity and health to do the 9-10km walk. I managed to get to Oia at 6:15, just in time for the 6:20 bus back to Fira.

Tips: take more than one big bottle of water, I had one and drank it all wishing I had more. There aren’t really any toilets along the way that I saw. Make sure to stop at the Church on top of the big hill...can’t remember the name but the old man will probably drag you in by the arm and show you how the eyes of the...Jesus?... picture move as you move. Highlight of my hike meeting him!

Have fun!

Greece,Lvutotravel,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I was expecting to meet a lot of hikers but surprisingly met maybe 8 .
This is such a beautiful and serene hike . I cannot stress this enough . Wear good shoes and hike 3 to 3 -1/2 hrs . The view is stunning and no matter what - pics just don’t capture what ypur experience .
So if you plan it right you have lunch in Fira and hike slow and easy to oia and spend the evening at Oia for the sunset and have dinner and you can take the local bus back to Fira .
We stayed at Imirovigil so we hiked the same afternoon we reached Santorini and watched sunset and had dinner at Oia and the next day hiked from Imirovigil to fira and did the steps as well .

But overall a must do when in Santorini.,Aug 2018
Greece,Ivona K,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"That about sums it up but here's some more tips:
We started at about 9.45 and it took us about 4 hrs with lot's of pictures.
The heat was not really a problem as there was a lovely breeze.
The path that's outside the towns is either rocky or dirt so unless you have sturdy sandals that you walk off road in, wear proper shoes. There's lot's of ups and downs.
To get some lovely views with luxury hotels start from Fira and stay on the left.
Somewhere closish to Oia there was an opportunity to go up the last big hill on a donkey so we did - a memorable experience! 10 euro per person but if there's 4-5 people it's worth negotiating.
Generally always stay on the left - but look ahead to where the path is going as there are a couple of dead end short paths that fork to the left - just look to see which way the trail continues.
There are 2 or 3 spots where you walk along the road for a couple of hundred meters.
Surprisingly despite doing this in mega high season there were very few people on the trail - outside the towns especially. This is probably the best way to experience Santorini and most of the time you have the stunning views all to yourself.
And the satisfaction at the end of the hike is yet another reason to do it!

Read many reviews saying this and that... We had running shoes and took us around 40minutes to go and come back on the trail to Oia, climbed to the top and took a few pics then climbed back down. The climbing of the last part itself isn't anything difficult (my opinion) and it's worth it! After we had back to the trail and walked by the cliffs with some amazing views... choosing shoes over slippers/flip-flops was a good idea, was much more comfortable this way. Anyways we reached Oia in less then 2 hours and we stopped many times for pics, drinking water etc. Really recommend to bring at least 2 bottles(1,5l) of water, if you go with kids bring even more, maybe some snacks as well. By the time we reached Oia it was really hot and people started to move around the narrow streets of Oia, which are nice but when crowded... not so much fun. Anyways we did some pics and took a public bus for 1.8€ each to Imerovigli where we parked. It's really worth to do even if you are not a big fan of hikes! :)

Greece,DaveandJennaN,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We started at 9am at the end of July. This is a party City and starting early is huge! No getting stuck behind loads of tourists, easier to get the famous spot photos without people butting in.
Bring lots of water, most of the hike there is no shade. It’s beautiful, but it’s no walk in the park, it is an up and down and around hike that you will be happy you did and happy to be done with by time you get to Oia.
In the middle, between Imerovigli and Oia there was a nameless cafe on the path that we went to use the restroom (WC) and as courtesy planned on buying a drink there...so we bought a lemon juice...the last was so rude, when we were done with the juice she said “6 Euros”. I should have taken a picture of this tiny cup of water with lemon that needed sugar to be drinkable for 6 frickin euros!! We paid her and asked to use the WC and with a smirk she says “not working, some tourist flushed paper down it”. I observed a sign that said “Do not apply sunscreen here” and “We do not sell water only”. We got ripped off by this lady who survives on the tourist she clearly seems to hate, so don’t do the mistake we did by paying her and her sorry cafe a visit.
After two large hills we finally reached Oia and had a nice lunch.
To get back to Fira, you can go to the bus stop that runs approximately every 15 minutes for 1,80 euros (the only decently priced thing in Santorini)
In a nutshell:
*leave by 9am
*dont go to the shi**y cafe on the path (dirt path in middle, bit near anything else)
*bring plenty of water
*take bus back for 1,80 euro (they collect payment on the bus, no drinks allowed)

Greece,Ono O,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"I read all of the reviews here on TripAdvisor about this hike, and decided to give it a try. It was a little harder and longer that I had anticipated, and some of the trail is slippery due to a section that goes over shale. There are a number of long ups and downs, and no shade at all. If you want to try the hike, do go early in the day, wear sturdy shoes, bring water, and wear a hat. I liked the part of the trail the most that was closest to Fira, and do agree that walking toward Oia from Fira has more downhill than the other direction. I was very happy when we arrived in Oia after about 3.5 hours, and were able to find a shady restaurant for lunch as I was hot and tired. After lunch, we grabbed a public bus back to where we started in Fira. Am I glad that I did the hike - yes. Would I do it again - no.

Greece,Katy B,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I completed the hike along with two other friends. None of us are hikers, but we were all able to complete it. I am generally more comfortable in sandals, but I really recommend wearing closed-toe sneakers, as there are donkey droppings at intervals in the trail. We go there at about 6:30am in July, and at least in the summer, I would not recommend getting there any later than that. It was so peaceful with so few people on the trail, and it was not unbearably hot--but it was definitely warming up toward the end. Instead of starting at Fira, it was recommended that we instead begin at Imerovigli. This was an EXCELLENT choice. Imerovigli is near enough to Fira, but the portion between them is a fairly steep uphill incline for the start of a hike. Additionally, it's good to know that there is a solid uphill chunk shortly before Oia, but it results in a beautiful view! Going so early also meant a chance to visit Oia and take in all the beautiful sights before the tourists woke up and descended. Breakfast in Oia was a great treat after as well. A beautiful and memorable experience.

There is also a public toilet on the road between Firostefani and Imerovigli villages.

Greece,Julieanne_kay89,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This was the most incredible and rewarding experience of my ten days in Greece, which included visiting Athens, Santorini, Naxos and Mykonos. It was a special experience for all the reasons other people mention, and I personally found myself in moments of awe and appreciation of nature's beauty.

We started the hike at Atlantis Hotel, in Fira, at 10:40 am. We ate a hearty breakfast and we packed sunscreen, water, some nuts and snacks, for the route. We stopped every hour or so to reapply sunscreen (bring a towel to dry off in between - the sweat renders it less effective), and to sip some water when we found some shade. The hike itself is not very difficult, with proper footwear and a hat, but the heat makes it challenging about halfway through.

It is easy to venture off the Caldera route into the town of Imerovigli, which is what happened to us, but the lovely Greek locals are so helpful to guide you back on track. When we arrived in Oia, we walked down the steps to the Ammoudi Bay (avoiding donkey poop the whole way down) and we had a tremendous lunch in the bay - A+ idea, worth it. With our detour and giving ourselves the time to stop and appreciate the marvellous views, this hike took us about 4 hours in total. Don't miss out on this experience, it was priceless.

The hardest part of the trail is between Oia and Finika’s village, so it get easier as you walk further and get more tired. Bring lots of water, although there was quite a few places to buy water along the way, especially after Finika so don’t worry. Please wear real running shoes or you will regret it. Have fun, wear a hat and sunscreen!",Jul 2018
Greece,Douglas T,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We took the less conventional route of Oia to Fira as we were staying in the former. It is probably a little easier to get lost this way, with few signs to reorientate yourself. In general you want to stick as close to the water as often as you can. Strongly recommend asking someone if in doubt! Lots of websites have maps of the walk too which was helpful to have a copy of on the phone.

Highly recommend leaving early in summer (we left at 8am) and taking plenty of water as it was scorching by the time we reached Fira. We did detour the Skaros rock on the way too which added another 45mins.

It was nice doing it in the order we went as we got to Fira for an early lunch!

Greece,vosl,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We cheated and started the hike at Imerogli as from here it is a 3.5km downhill walk to the cable car.

What we didn’t do was pack enough sun tan cream or water or wear the right shoes.

By the end of the walk in blistering38 deg plus temperatures we were shattered. We intended catching the local bus back to Oia but finding the bus stop was more difficult than expected and taxis are scarce. Both can be found around the village square of Fira.

Taxis can be found at most hotels.

Beautiful walk but be prepared for conditions.

Many blue domed churches along the routes

There are plenty of places to buy water and food along the track but very little in the way of shade and the cobbles are killers if you don’t have walking shoes

Greece,IsabelTPE,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"It is not an easy trek, more like a moderate one to walk ups and downs from Fira to Oia. You will pass the busiest street of Fira, then, accompanied by the donkey dumps, all the way up to pretty and fancy cafes and bars, villas on different mountain steeps. Walking on the mountain ranges to see sometimes panoramic views of the ocean and mountains from another angle is awesome, not to mention the different Greek styles of Villas and resorts. Passing by them with the look of tourists relaxing by the pool or watching them get tanned is an unique bizarre experience to a trekker.
The good and broad view of the ocean is rewarding. To see the blue dome and iconic view of Oia is rewarding, too.
To the end of Oia, there were some cafes with good sea views and you should definitely go inside one of them to get stuffed coz u must feel hungry after a three-hour long trek.
If you can't make same way trekking back to Fira, walk back to the big church, go down and wait for the bus at the square to go back to Fira. The fee is 1.8€ per person, bus always packed with tourists in hot sightseeing seasons.

My husband I did a roundtrip hike and while Oia to Fira was beautiful, you definitely do not get the same views as from Fira to Oia. The trail is easy to follow. I would definitely recommend hiking or tennis shoes and plenty of water if you leave later in the day like we did. Oia to Fira took us almost 3 hours, with plenty of stops for photos. The hike back was about 2-1/2 hours, again with more photo stops. There are a few small cafes in between where you can get water if needed, but they are cash only so make sure you have a few euros on you for that. Definitely a great day seeing the island!

Greece,Globalista11,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I'm an experienced hiker, but I'm not fast; I take my time, wander, take pictures, etc. I LOVED this hike!I I think it's one of the best things to do in Santorini. You feel like you're walking on the very top of the island because you can see ocean views on either side. The hiking trail cuts through the different towns, so you can easily stop and have a drink or something to eat as you go along. I would recommend starting as early as possible. You can probably walk from Fira to Oia in a few hours if you are fast and don't stop, but if you want to enjoy the journey, you should give yourself 4-6 hours. There's a stretch as you get closer to Oia that is a bit rough and rugged, so you want to make sure that you're not stuck there at the end of the day. Otherwise -- ENJOY!

As it passes through the main villages on the Caldera rim, one sees much of the outstanding photo views printed in magazines about Santorini.

Greece,mirgoh,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"My family of four decided to go for the much faved hike around the Caldera from Fira/Imerovigli to Oia after reading so many positive review on TA. We set off from Imerovigli at around 10am and took us about 3 hours to reach Ammoudi Bay, Oia at around 1pm. We took it at a very enjoyable pace under a very windy and clear beautiful blue sky. Weather: Hot windy June summer: It is strongly recommended you use lots of sunblock or wear a hat/cap and bring enough drinking water to keep yourself hydrated. Terrain Difficulty: Overall 8/10 for those seldom exercise, but if u take your time and pace yourself well... you should be alright. Some part of the caldera is really ‘up and down’ some very steep (you will know what I mean when you are there yourself) and bald terrain, hence it would be a challenge for some with young children or walking difficulties. Tip: Please visit your loo before you start your journey as toilet break available would be ‘far and few in between’. Satisfaction level: Absolutely 100% when you completed it and look at all those awesome caldera photos you have taken! Enjoy your hike!

Some portions are slippery and/or rocky and/or steep... in a word: challenging. As long as you wear good shoes, carry water and a hat during sunny days you will just be fine. The first part of the hike out of Fira requires some attention to follow the right trail. Then the direction is easy.

We did it with my family (including teenage kids) before sunset as we wanted to watch the sun set in Oia. So Oia was the goal... It turned out that our hike was more pleasant than the ultra crowded Oia. We came back by Taxi.

We've split it in 2 parts to avoid too much walking uphill, as we're not experienced hikers :

We first started at Imerovigli and walked up to Oia, which took us a bit more than 2 hours, including several photo stops. We did it at 5 PM to avoid the heat.

The next day, we walked down from Imerovigli to Fira, which was beautiful as well, plus we were facing the good direction, seeing Fira appearing during the hike. It would have taken us about 30 minutes if we hadn't stopped so often. We also did a tiny detour to see the 3 bells of Fira.

Just have some decent shoes and some water. All we needed was 2 x 300ml bottles.

Upon arrival in Oia we got a wel deserved cold drink & then caught a taxi back to Fira.

Walking shoes/trainers (not sandals or flip flops) are a MUST as parts are steep and stoney. The volcanic rock makes it quite slippery in places but probably half the trail at the Fira end is on properly made paths. Take the diversion route to visit Skaros rock - definitely worth the additional walk.

Getting out of Fira was difficult as it is not well marked! We made a big wrong turn and ended up hiking down then back up extremely steep steps! After Fira it is easier to follow the path! Many parts are challenging and have steep inclines that most people will find difficult! I am a young athlete and I was completely exhausted and sore after this walk! The views were fantastic and there are many great photo opportunities. When we got to Oia we weren’t really sure what to do, we walked around for a bit then caught a bus back.

I almost wonder whether catching the shuttle over to Oia and then hiking back might have been a better choice however Oia would not have been opened when we got there. Our 12 year old did it without complaint, although i am sure she wanted to. Take a lot of water, you will need it. Wear cool clothing and plenty of sunscreen. Saying that, if you can do it and you have the stamina it is so rewarding as you just get to see the island in such an amazing way. We still sit on our balcony in Fira and look out and can't believe we did it. Go early or late...surprised there are some parts of the track they haven't fixed, but apart from that it all makes it part of the adventure.

It's fairly straight forward through Fira into Imerovigli but after the villas the path gets a bit tricky in places but nothing major. Make sure you wear trainers or boots. Flip flops/sandals are not really suitable.

The views are amazing and there are plenty of viewpoints and opportunities for photos along the way. As ever, take plenty of water and snacks etc.

It’s possible to just walk a part of it, and then catch the bus. Still, it’s hard.

Be sure you take water with you. You can buy in some places along the way, but there are several quilometres where there is nothing, just sun and a path to walk. I did it in middle June, and it was really really hot, there are no shades. Go early in the morning!!

It was a bit difficult to determine if we were actually on the trail, which we picked up near the cable cars in Fira. We just followed a path on the outermost part of town until we eventually saw signs pointing to Oia. Good shoes and water are a must. Until you start the main ascent, there is very little breeze. Even at 9am, it was pretty hot outside. Once you get past Imerovigli, the path definitely becomes more of a trail. The last 3 miles or so are on relatively loose gravel, or slippery volcanic cobblestone. If you're not wearing proper footwear, it's going to make for an unnecessarily difficult hike. Otherwise, it's a pretty straightforward trail with usual congestion at the best photo spots.

The walk took me about three hours thirty minuets with stopping to take photo's of the stunning views along the way.

As experienced hikers, my wife and I found this to be an unusual hike—much of it is on city streets, highway shoulders and even access roads behind resorts—but the unifying theme is sticking close to the caldera’s rim and views. With many trail signs and fellow hikers, it’s generally easy to find your way, except perhaps getting through Fira (when in doubt, choose streets going up). Take other’s advice and start early to avoid the full force of the Mediterranean sun as well as the crowds that jam the towns by late morning. I’d recommend good athletic shoes, water, and maybe a small towel, particularly if you start late, because you are going to sweat. The true trail sections are not technically challenging, but some have loose gravel. We paused often to take pictures and took a brief stop for a drink at a roadside stand, and our hike took about 3 hours.

Much of this hike is at an incline and there are spots with loose gravel which make it challenging to take bigger steps. If you make this hike expect to get very dusty, sweaty, and wear plenty of sunblock and bring extra to reapply as you will sweat off a lot of it. Having lots of water is also a necessity. We brought about 4 bottles each which ended up being enough. This was definitely a challenge and we are in pretty good shape and are frequently active. I am very happy I did it because it is so beautiful.

The walk gets harder in between Imerovigli and Oia (in my opinion) as there is not as much in terms of town to see and the terrain is a little bit more difficult. I would suggest wearing sneakers as there are a lot of rocky parts and downhill parts as well. The views are incredible and its a great way to see a lot of the island as well! We then walked around Oia, went down to the Ammoudi Bay for lunch (and some jumping into the water) and somehow had enough energy to walk back up (that was the hardest part though, it is steep!).

If you start in Oia-- take the main path parallel to the road east toward Fira (some of the time you'll have to actually walk along the road).

Greece,Yanversusnature,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"My husband and I took this hike in mid-May at approximately 11am in the morning. We actually started in Imerovigli (we took a cab ride there from our hotel) instead of starting in Fira. The hike was really incredible. You walk along the caldera for a majority of the hike, which allows you to take amazing pictures of the sea, Oia and other parts of the countryside. We were only in Santorini for 2.5 days', so this, in my opinion, was a great way to get to see more of what the island looked like (aside from just seeing Oia and Thira).

The hike itself is a little challenging, as the trail is unpaved and can be a bit steep at times. However, I did the hike in flats and I saw a 5 year do the same hike as us, so if you're not elderly and/or don't have ambulation issues, you should be fine. The hike took us about 3 hours because we took a lot of stops to take pictures. I would advise taking water, sunscreen and a hat because there is very little shade along the hike. I would imagine that later in the summer, you'd want to leave earlier in the morning to avoid walking during the hottest part of the day. About midway through the hike, there is a little stand where a couple sells beer, coffee, wine and snacks at a very reasonable price.

This hike was one of the highlights of my time in Santorini. We got a lot of incredible pictures and it was nice to burn some calories after consuming so much delicious feta and mousaka throughout our time in Greece. :)

Greece,ktnc2015,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,3.0,"Please pause at sign pointing left to Sharos Rock. We took a sharp right into town, instead of going more straight and then slightly to the right. After walking through town, we found ourselves on a busy highway with trucks and buses coming at us with NO walking area. My husband pointed out that we were on a suicide walk and we retraced our steps (30 min.) to the Sharos Rock sign where we made mistake. Then decided we were too tired after wasting and hour in town and asking 3 or 4 locals for help getting on the trail- only one of them knew about the trail and the others looked at us like we were crazy to be walking to Oia. It probably is a good walk but signage is poor to nonexistent so we were disappointed and wished we'd used our energy hiking to Byzantine castle ruins.

Greece,Foodie171632,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,We left at 9am in May and the weather was perfect! We started in Fira and as soon as we got to the trail a random dog joined us. He followed us the whole time! Stopping occasionally to try to catch a bird or get some shade but he would catch up. We lost him when we got to the first hotel in Oia. We found a place to get more water and then went to the top Gyro place. It is not on the main road and far from the hiking trail but all of a sudden HERE COMES THE DOG! And he lays right next to our table and falls asleep. We did leave him there and our waiter said he comes every day but still... That may have been the best part of the hike because it was so funny. But the views were fantastic.,May 2018
Greece,Grace G,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I was pretty hesitant about the hike as I'm 16 wks pregnant and like most pregnant women I tend to err on the wrong side. But I've always been a keen hiker (not super fit or anything, I just love walking and enjoying the views). So I convinced my hubby to hike the supposedly 2h10m hike.

We hiked from Fira to Oia as most people suggested (less uphill path) and it took us about 3.5hrs to get there, including plenty breaks and pic time. The views were well worth the steps. To be honest, I felt totally fine after the whole hike. The hardest part was the heat (27C but felt like 33!) so make sure you bring at least 1.5ltr per person and sunscreen to reapply midway through.

There are no public toilets on the way unless you stop by a Cafe for food /drinks (water doesn't count). Note though the caldera view cafes charge an arm and a leg for drinks. We ended up paying €32 for coffee and smoothie! 😅 having said all that, even as a pregnant lady I didn't need to go to toilet during the whole journey!

Greece,lrules,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We did the hike with our 7 year old and it was wonderful. You get a very different look at Santorini than from the sailboats and the hotels and its as pretty as a postcard.

We walked from Oia to Fira since we were staying in Oia and I felt that was a better direction to take as the uphill portions are relatively gentle compared to the sharp incline between Fira and Imerovigli. Walking shoes or sneakers are essential as the ground is uneven and rocky in places.

We started at 8 AM and ended at 11:30 in Fira with a stop for breakfast in Imerovigli.

At a casual pace with stops for water and photos, it was an easy, gorgeous 3.5 hour hike from the center of Fira to the center of Oia. Totally worth it! Don’t wait till the afternoon.

Greece,mom2781,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"We started out at 10 am from Fira and took a very long time to reach Oia in part cos we needed to stop for drinks and photographs along the way. All in all it was nearly 5 hours. First part is easy as you are walking through towns but once you get past the drinks stop at the side of the road, it gets gravelly and covered shoes are the best option. Having said that our kids survived with their sandals. We stopped along the way to get two drinks from a cafe but I would advise to bring your own water to the maximum extent possible as it is a long uphill climb towards the last stretch towards Oia.",Jun 2018
Greece,Mary P,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Most important if you're on a cruise ship, make sure to disembark on the earliest tender available or shortly after so you can avoid the congestion going up the cable car. We had heard stories that it can cost you a lot of time. Things went very smooth for us but our alternative would have been to catch a local boat to Oia and hike the trail the opposite way. If you walk from Oia to Fira you walk facing sun and we found in Greece many stores open later so we were afraid if we took the boat early we would be waiting around. If you ride the cable cars up as you come out of the station take your first right and you will be on the trail. We started the walk before 8 am and we witnessed the village awaken. From people sweeping steps to those enjoying a cup of coffee on many of the villas amazing porches. Many parts of the trail runs through the middle of the villages so you are surrounded by all the gorgeous architecture of Santorini including some of the very upscale resorts. We found it to be a moderate walk. It isn't all paved, there are some sections that are gravel, dirt and short area of loose lava rocks. It took us close to 3 hours to reach Oia taking pictures along the way. (6.2 miles) After exploring the beautiful Village of Oia for a few hours we rode the local bus back to Fira for approximately 2€
If you don't plan on hiking the 500 steps back down to the ship make sure you leave in plenty of time so you can can ride the cable car back as the lines can get long. We actually enjoyed walking the stairs down which is the same path the donkeys go. There are several cafes and stores along the first part of the stairs. Opted not to walk up as we wanted to get a head start on hike. Do this hike...you won't regret it!

Greece,frostnm,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This hike was beautiful! It is worth the 3 hr hike. Bring water! There are multiple shops along the way that you can buy water. But it would be best to have your own and buy more if you run out. Start your hike early because it gets really hot. There is not many shady spots along the way to get out of the sun. Don’t forget sunscreen. We went on a windy day which was nice because for part of the hike the wind works to keep you cool.

Do not make the mistake we did and wear sandals. I didn’t read any TripAdvisor reviews before heading out. We just thought it was the paved path the entire way like it was by our hotel... oops. We managed fine in sandals but would have preferred tennis shoes or hiking shoes. The path is sometimes gravel and rough terrain. You hike up and down hill multiple times before you get the oia

Greece,sunshinel0ri65,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I'm a hiker so I had to do this and I did the whole thing wearing flip-flops. We started out at 10:00am and I encourage you to start early as well. Bring lots of water. There are a couple of places along the route that you can stop and buy water for a couple of euros but you don't want to be without water before getting to these places. As far as rating the difficulty of this hike, I would say this is a moderate hike. There is nothing difficult about it to me but like I said, I'm a hiker.

Leaving Oia heading towards Fira it seemed mostly uphill so obviously coming back it was the opposite. Yes, I said coming back. Apparently most people walk only one way and then take a bus back. Quitters! ;) Come on, be bold and brave and do the whole thing round trip. All total it is 13.6 miles. The other people who post and say this takes only 2 hours must have been smoking crack is all I have to say! :) I'm in shape, an avid runner and hiker and unless you're running this you will NOT do it in 2 hours. If you're like me and want to stop and take pictures and trust me you will want to stop and take pictures then you won't be doing this in that time frame. Heading from Fira back or out, whichever your case may be is a slow process. The trail is not marked and the town is stinking crowded and you do have to meander through the town and try to keep yourself with the sea on your left. People say the trail is marked...well, hmmm...yes and no. There are a few trail markers and mostly it is pretty basic. It's when you get to the towns that you have to remember to keep the sea completely on your left or right, whichever direction you are going. We left from Oia and when we finally got to Fira we ate lunch before heading back. The cruise ships were obviously in port so the streets in Fira WERE CROWDED so getting back out of town took a bit of maneuvering. All total it took us 6.5 hours round trip but that was stopping to take lots of photos and lunch too. There are loose rocks in many places and it's quite dusty. I wouldn't advise taking little kids as the climb up is steep and I would think they would get quite fatigued. But you simply must do this!

Greece,MCRsgp,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Walkedfrom oia to Fira . That is one walk that you have to be totally prepared for. From Oia the first 3 4 Km is ALL uphill and steep too. You need hiking or trail walking shoes as the the path is largely gravel and large and medium size rocks. It was tough going and not meant for the less fit or those looking for a casual walk. The views are gorgeous though and a Photographers dream. It is much easier once you hit imerogivli and the short walk to Fira is crowded , flattish and pleasant.Overall it's much better to walk from Fira to Oia as it is mainly downhill that way.",May 2018

The path is in good condition from fira to imerovigli, but more gravel from there to oia. Bring walking poles if you feel the need, and camera to take pictures. Recommend the public pool at the end of oia center, to swim, relax and get refreshments after a beautiful journey.",May 2018
Greece,Cat N,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This was on my “must do” list because I enjoy doing more physical and outdoorsy activities rather than stay in the city the entire time.

To preface this review, I had visited Oia prior to the sunrise to get photos of the area without people obstructing views and whatnot. As you can imagine, I was in Oia by 6am. After roaming Oia for an hour or so taking photos, I drove to Fira and began my hike.

I would advise reading through “Santorini Dave’s” hiking from Fira to Oia guide as it provides great information about where to start, tips, advice, etc. (just do a quick internet search). But a brief summary, I started at the square where Hotel Atlantis is and just began walking north. It wasn’t difficult to figure out the route but I will admit I wandered down the wrong path several times—it happens to the best of us!

Of note, I didn’t walk to Skaros Rock because I was exhausted and I did not want to use all my energy so early on (I personally had a cruise right after the hike that would last about 6-7 hours). Will have to do it next time I’m in Santorini!

There is a little part of the trail where you do have to walk on the motorway for a bit. You will be safe if you pay extra attention to your surroundings. The cars and whatnot are very familiar with avoiding pedestrians but still, walk in a single file line along the way and it’ll be fine. Once you see the donkeys on a little hill, go up that hill and go right to get back on the trail.

In terms of difficulty, I was able to do it with barely any sleep and I would say I’m in moderate physical shape. I started at 8:15a and reached Oia just before 11a (less than 3 hours, including my mistakes I made on the trail). It was particularly windy that day so the heat was not bad at all. There are many sections of the trail that are very rocky so wear sensible shoes! I cannot imagine doing the hike in the middle of the day, it will be too hot and miserable for you to enjoy the scenery along the way. Going early or late in the day would be best, especially with the upcoming summer months. The trail when I went was pretty empty which I enjoyed. Nothing is open along the way if you go early so bring your snacks and water with you (at least 1.).

Took the public bus back to Fira and all was well in the world.

Overall, this hike shouldn’t be missed out on! You will feel a huge sense of accomplishment when you look back periodically on the trail to see how far you’ve gone. It made me feel better and pushed me to finish. It was a great physical activity that comes highly recommended from someone who loves being outside.

Greece,Adam K,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"An approx. 11km hike from Fira to Oia (or other way round) that along with the sunset was the highlight of my time here. It is my no means the easiest of hiking trails with a variety of surfaces and also quite an undulating trail. It took me approx 3hrs to do with stopping for photos along the way. I think 3-4hrs is a realistic timeframe to complete it, not sure how people could do it or enjoy it in 2hrs.

I started from Fira and then once in Oia had lunch and caught the bus back (busses were crowded and difficult to get on). It was recommended that you get a bus to the other town and then hike your way back to your starting point (ie where you are staying). This was because busses are quieter in the morning. Having done the hike I should have followed this advice.

Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and a hat and wear good walking shoes. Even starting early it gets hot and there is no cover, you are completely exposed to the elements. It was 30 degrees by the time I finished. If hiking from Fira there is a few small villages in the first third of the hike to stop and have a rest/eat, after that it’s largely a hiking trail. There are great views along the way over the caldera.

Overall it was an enjoyable hike and if you pace yourself then you will be fine. Due to the constant incline/declines and surface changes it’s not the easiest of trails but most people with a moderate level of fitness should be able to complete it (taking it at your own pace). At times especially when going through some of the villages the trail can be a bit difficult to follow however keep an eye out for other hikers or locals who will be able to assist if that happens.

Greece,Kim M,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"We hiked from Fira to Oia like the reviews suggested. It was uphill on rough and assorted terrain most of the way. I started to wonder if those that posted saying it was easier going this way rather than Oia to Fira were pulling a prank on everyone or if they have hiked both ways. (I'm sure no one has done that!) The people going the opposite directions definitely had downhill most of the way. Definitely wear heavy duty sneakers or hiking shoes because there are lots of hard rocks on the path and thin soled shoes don't do well. By the time we got to Oia, it took us 5 hours and I had no idea how anyone could do it in 2-3 hours unless they walked super fast and never stopped. (Then what's the point if you don't explore and take pics?) Also I didn't see the excitement over Oia when Fira and Imergovigli were just as nice. Basically we felt like we accomplished a monumental feat when we were done and crossed a vast area of Santorini which made us feel good. No more walking the rest of our trip!

If you don't enjoy hiking, this is an arduous, hot, dry, and boring walk along the coast with no bathrooms, and beautiful views all along the way. We started from Oia in the morning. Had a little trouble finding the trailhead, but the locals are more than happy to point you in the right direction. The trail isn't well marked along the way, especially when it passes through the various villages along the way. But normally there are other hikers whom you can see in the distance and figure out from that where the trail goes, and if you get turned around, just ask someone. Take a liter of water per person, and wear comfortable shoes. Sun block too. It took us about 3 hours. Made it to Fira in time for lunch and ice cream, then caught the bus back to Oia. Be careful of the various plants along the way. Many have thorns. The wife brushed up against some plant (her ankle) while exploring off-trail, and it immediately resulted in a localized rash that bothered her for a couple of days. If you have limited time in Oia/Fira, then there are probably better things to do. If you have multiple days there like we did, then it's a good activity to fill up a half-day (pro tip: put some water, beer/wine, in the fridge at your hotel/cave house the night prior, and have some bread/cheese/olives/snacks/etc... there as well. When you get back that afternoon, you'll be tired...we just sat on the veranda and rested our feet while taking in the spectacular view and having some drinks/snacks...awesome).

There is a lot of gravel and loose rocks along the way so you need to watch your footing. One of our favorite parts was a dog that walked us a good part of the way up the steepest section. When we stopped, she stopped. We had breakfast in Fira at the end. We were a little tired and sweaty but everyone was glad we did the hike.

The hike through Fira, Firostefani and then Imerovigli were the best parts to me, because you can see the different towns. We didn't veer off to Skaros Rock, but were told that it is beautiful and worth the extra trip. Once you leave Imerovigli, there is a strip of luxury hotels that are fun to see. After that it's pretty much a dirt path, with a short walk (not bad) along the main road. LOTS of hills and stairs - up and down. My husband and I are in pretty decent shape and we found the last 1/3 of the hike to be challenging.
The views are very breathtaking, and something you will remember forever! With that said, it's a pretty long hike - it took us about 4 hrs (10 am - 2 pm) at a normal pace with a lot of photo stops, and 2 stops (15-30 mins/stop) to rest/get a drink. We were glad that we did it, but can't say that we'd do it again. We were hoping to explore Oia, but found that we were too hot, tired and hungry to explore much.

Greece,camid71,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"As many reviewers has said, this is a must do hike. The views are breathtaking and it is not a difficult hike.

My friend and I started from Karterados (at our hotel) and hiked to Oia through Fira. We started around 7:45 am and ended in Oia around noon. We honestly should have started a bit earlier as the most difficult part of the hike is near the end, as you approach Oia and I would have preferred it to be a bit less hot. I would say starting at 7 would be ideal.

We did hike to Skaros Rock and I have to admit it was my favourite part of the whole hike, simply because of the views and the quiet early in the morning. I also enjoyed walking through the hotels just past Skaros Rock, as they were pretty and not too busy at this time of year.

The few churches on the hike were unique and the one that could be entered, Ekklisia Profitis Ilias, has an interior with some paintings and candles that shouldn’t be missed.

Bring some snacks, such as apples, bananas, and/or crackers and a 1.5L bottle of water per person. It is nice to refuel every so often.

Once you get to Oia, I recommend heading to the end of it through town to the stairs down to Amoudi Bay. Once you hit the restaurants at the bottom, turn left and continue through the rocks to the pier-like area where you can swim. The water is so clear and is cool, a refreshing way to end the hike! You can even cliff jump from the little island if you wish.

Loved this hike very much, it is a bit challenging due to the uphill nature but not difficult. Good for the muscles :)

Greece,starla729,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I hiked this trail with a group - about 6.5 miles. It took us around 4.5 hours as we took many stops to rest and take pictures. I could not stop taking pictures the whole time! The views are absolutely breath taking! The hike is not super intense, but still wear good hiking shoes because some of the path is rocky and not paved. There were definitely a few hills to hike up but the views were 100% worth it. We hiked in the afternoon around 2:30-3pm so get to Oia for sunset. In April, the sun wasn’t too bad or intense (65-70 degrees F) to be out in the afternoon hours. I hear in the summer, the temperatures get much hotter. Regardless wear sunscreen because there is no shade on this hike. The hike follows the caldera the whole time, and it’s a great view of the ocean, the island, and the quintessential white houses built on the cliffs. You do hike through a few other villages which are nice to see. Overall, I think it’s well worth the time to go on this hike. As I walked, I felt like I was seeing the Santorini you see in the pictures. We did not hike back though - took a bus. It was great to see Oia, which was a busy town (seemed busier than Fira). We did see the Oia sunset, but it was packed with people trying to do the same thing so be aware that you will be sharing the moment with many other people.

Greece,Hanno,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,This is an absolute must do hike that is more like an easy walk but has stunning scenery. You won't stop taking pictures. What an incredible and unique island and the best way to experience it is on this hike.,Apr 2018
Greece,Samer Abi-Khalil,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"The path is too long, specially if you want to admire the beauty of the caldera and the view of the sea, stop to take pictures... so you can consider about 4 to 5 hours to walk all the path in that rhythm. It is exhaustive, but it deserves it, because you can never see such a wonderful view of the sea and the islands... if you want to make a short walk, think about the part of Imerovigli, It's the best part of the path, and then you can take a taxi or a bus to go to Fira or Oia and walk there. Think of it, the best view ever in Santorini is from Imerovigli, far more than other sites in the island.",Apr 2018
Greece,PracticalVacationer,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"The essentials: hike from Fira to Oia; bus back. Reasons: 1) the sun is always on your back 2) slower rise, faster descent 3) the bus travels on the inside lane, so less white knuckles as opposed to the outside lane where the sheer drop is just below if the bus misses a hairpin turn on the narrow road. When: 1) ideally early in the morning before it gets too hot 2) how early will depend upon whether you are doing this in April versus August and whether you are taking the vigorous 2.5 hours or leisurely 4 hours. We started at 9:30 am in April for the leisurely pace and by 12 noon, it was hot. Our cousin did a medium pace in July and he said it was miserable. How to join and stay on the trail: from Fira, it is well developed with essentially concrete as you wind your way through all the developed buildings and many points of entry; not really a trail but a pedestrian alley. It becomes a more defined concrete path as you leave Fira and enter Firostefani. The first hint of this being a trail is between Firostefani and Imerovigli, where the path becomes uneven stones for a short stretch. You know you have arrived in Imerovigli when you see the first church thus far that is on the left. This is Agios Nikolaos. You should also know that there are no labels as to name of town, buildings or even the trail. Most laborers working outdoors if asked for directions will say, ""speak no English"". As you are passing through Imerovigli, the only challenge throughout the entire trail will be remembering to turn left into Agios Georgios. There is then a Y fork, left into church, and right to continue. If you miss this part, you can still rejoin the trail, but there is a little detour. The remainder of the trail is intuitive, as it begins to establish itself as the main walking path. There is the diversion to Skaros rock shortly after the church if you take the left of another Y fork. As you leave Imerovigli, the path begins to be more like a hiking trail. Uneven ground and pebbly or sandy surfaces; more up and downs and less level surfaces. When you are 2/3 of the way there, the last major ascent is to Agios Panagia. If the sight of this exhausts you, thanks be to God, there is a man with a herd of donkeys who will tell you - 10 Euros to monastry in 25 minutes by donkey, then walk down to Oia in 10 minutes. In Oia, reward yourself with a nice meal. Catch the bus which stops just outside the Tourist Information office, or as the staff inside will tell you, at the invisible bus stop. The published schedule notes buses every 20 minutes, but I have only seen it once an hour and at the top of the hour. There is a conductor on board who will provide change for the 1,80 Euro fare back. You can stop at various stops along the way if you do not want to travel all the way back to Fira. What to bring: 1) wear comfortable clothes 2) shoes with firm soles for the eventual uneven terrain. 3) lots of water 4) lots of sunsreen on your neck where the sun is beating down.

Greece,nycshine1,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"My teenage son and I did this hike with its gorgeous views and varied scenery. We started in Fira at about 4:45 pm and arrived in Oia around 7:30 pm before sunset in early April. We dithered in certain places where we took photos or weren't sure where the path was, so I was a little surprised that we made it to Oia in less than 3 hours -- a little tired and quite hungry.

What I enjoyed most was the varied nature of the trail and the scenery. There were graveled, sandy portions, paved portions, cobblestone streets in villages, landscaped areas in front of fancy hotels and spas, rocky inclines and descents, portions where we literally walked next to the busy road, remote areas where no one else could be seen for some time, etc. There was even a small portion where someone had clearly just mopped and swept and then used the brooms to block hikers from dirtying the walkway (we walked along the adjacent ""curb"" instead). There were several blue-domed churches, numerous wildflowers, rock sculptures left by other hikers, and of course the incomparable caldera views along the way, too.

Signage was rare, so when we encountered a parking lot or road, it wasn't always clear where to go. Just kept towards the sea. On occasion, we saw red arrows on the ground to point the way. I've posted photos of the 3 markers I did see.

Definitely wear shoes with good grips.

We took the bus in Oia back to Fira (roughly 2 Euros each). It leaves every hour, with the last one leaving some time after 9 pm. The bus is crowded, so it may be best not to plan to get the last one as I am not sure how many buses the island runs.

Greece,Daron C,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"A beautiful coastal walk that we started from Thira all the way to Ola. We are not hikers but decided to give this a go. The trails starts in This a and passes through the next town Firostefani which is just as pretty. . There are one or two reasonable inclines to negotiate but nothing to difficult. This takes about 30 minutes. As you pass the next village of Imerovigi there is a cafe near to a church on the cliff pass. This is about halfway through the walk so take refreshment and restroom stop. The views are all stunning from here around the cliffs edge but as you pass the church on the hill you have two options. There is a walkway that runs along parallel to the road which looks easier but we took the coastal path which gradually becomes more broken with Shingle and as a result more challenging. You will eventually reach the roadside so follow for about 700 metres until you reach the man with the donkeys. This is where it gets harder as the terrain deepens and the track becomes more broken. You can get on a donkey if you wish to take you up as we found it hard going as we tired. When you reach the summit to another church Ola lays in front of you and the scenery is reward enough. Although a beer or ice cream is definitely worth holding out for. This took us just over 4 hours to complete on a day that' was not to hot but be prepared with athletic / good boots and water. The 2nd half of the hike I would not recommend for children 12yrs or below. Good luck

Greece,NiccofromNJ,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"There are plenty of good reviews on this , but I want to write this from the perspective of a 50 year old couple; one semi athletic, the other minimally athletic. This is a beautiful hike that should not be missed. There are perspectives of the island and caldera you can get no other way. We took the hike in the beginning of April. Here are my tips:

Take it from Fira to Oia; It more downhill in that direction and you will culminate with better views and more natural landscape.

Go early in morning: Even in 60F (16C) degree weather, the sun gets very warm. Bring sunscreen and water.

Wear footwear with gripping soles; not just comfortable. The hike is not technically difficult at all, but there are areas of loose gravel and smooth flat sneakers are not going to be helpful. Clothing should be in layers.

With a few rest and photo stops it took us 3 hrs; we kept a steady, but not fast pace. Times will vary, but it makes sense to leave between 8-9AM and arrive between 11-12; Lunch and refreshments are a strong incentive.

Happy hiking!

Greece,HoraceBo,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"The hike and the 11 km distance are definitely worth the view and the experience. Just as all the other posts say, bring water, comfortable shoes and not so much weight. Interesting fact, for the people coming from Oia as we did it is more challenging as it goes uphill rather than for those who are coming from For a to Oia which is easier. There are some places that go up and down but it is easier to come from For a to Oia than to go from Oia to For a. Anyways, you can always take the bus to either cities once you finish the circuit for 1.80 euros per person and the bus leaves both towns every 30 mins.
I was only sorry to see how it is an attraction that needs maintenance and also to be cleaned as I had to pick some of the garbage on my way to Fira. I love hiking but I hate it when people don't use the trash cans. You couldn't find any here but there is no need to throw the garbage anywhere.

So 3 hours if you just want to hike it and not take any stops. We enjoyed every bit of the hike, beginning middle and end. Make sure to take lots of water since many places may not be open that time of the year. But in our view the hike itself was the highlight of our time in Santorini.

You just need to come prepared with water, snacks, and comfortable shoes. This is specially important during off season as not very many stores are open along the way. Happy hiking...",Mar 2018
Greece,Vanessa N,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"We are a couple in our 30s who consider ourselves lazy hikers, though we do rock climb and go on the occasional backpacking trips. We weren't sure what to expect as reviews seemed to range from it being very easy to very hard, taking anywhere from 2.5 hrs to 6 hrs. Some said the trail was fine, others said it wasn't. As such, I'll just lay out our facts and you can decide for yourselves.

The hike was in mid march. The weather cloudy, around 16oC, and pretty windy.

We caught the 1st bus from Oia to Fira at 7:30am (1.60€ per person). Arrived in Fira by 8am, and started hiking immediately from the bus terminal back towards Oia. (Walked to Hotel Atlantis as suggested by SantoriniDave).

It took us 2.5 hrs to complete the hike without the Skaros detour, and not taking an inordinate amount of photos.

We felt the hike was pretty straightforward and easy. Only place it might be confusing is in Fira, and we just went with the general rule of going ""Up"" and sticking to the caldera view. Everywhere else there's red signs or red arrows on the ground.

Weather was perfect since it wasn't scorching hot or too cold, though I was afraid of losing my hat at times. It did get significantly sunnier by the time we reached Fira. This may contribute to our good pace. I can imagine it would be much harder if it was hot.

Zero facilities available in mid March. Everything was closed or under construction. Even in the towns. We brought our own snacks, so we were fine. Could also be due to doing the hike early in the day.

Off season also meant we were the only ones on the trail which was great.

To address comments about dangerous paths, etc. Hiking shoes are a definite recommendation, as there is a lot of uneven pavement/cobblestones/rocks to deal with. Sandals could be doable, but probably quite uncomfortable and you would have to be pretty mindful of where you're putting your feet. The section with the volcanic skree was actually fine, even on our particularly windy day. It is mildly exposed, but, there's a low retaining wall on the inside of the trail if you're really that worried. That particular path was also decently wide, at least wide enough for passing, though it may be tight. A bit steep coming out of that section, but then it's no longer exposed and if you slide with it, it's not too bad.

Views were beautiful, but as another reviewer commented, the best parts are at the beginning and the end... take that as you will.

Overall our opinion was that it was a very nice morning exercise. Not THE most amazing hike ever in the world, but a nice one with consistently good scenery throughout and an interesting variety of trail. Also lots of stray dogs would follow us for short periods. Not a bad thing. We'd recommend doing it.

Hope this helps!

Greece,Sunny Philip,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Santorini Island is a great place to visit. It is an experience. The best way to see it is to walk the track from Fira to as far as you can go along the path. Take your time to explore every little passage in and out of the many buildings, going down and up. The view from each little corner is different but each one better than the other.
I took the bus from Fira to Oia and walked to the spot were the famous postcard photos were taken. The view of the three domed church is spectacular. Then I walked along to the tip of the island and back to were the bus let me off. There is a view every which way you turn. I found going in the off season (March) just great. There was just a handful of people. The place was not empty, though. It was nice and cool and I found it easier to walk in that mild weather. Most shops were closed. I did not mind, I wanted to see the natural beauty. Went by ferry and flew back - best way to do it, in my opinion.

During the hike, both my husband and me were laughing over how many reviewers had made it seemed easy. It’s definitely not. Certain parts were slippery, and I can’t imagine those who wore flip flops. I definitely needed the help of my husband during a slope down on loose red gravel else I’ll be crawling my way down. And we half slipped and half walked down the trail. The wind was very strong and It makes the trek more treacherous. Each step has to be taken carefully. Take note too that as we went in March, the off peak season, none of the pit stops were opened and we just have to keep going and there’s no chance of dropping out as there won’t be taxis around. But the sense of achievement we felt was immense. We did not regret it as if we had driven, the night drive back from oia to Firá would have been dark and winding.

Greece,Michael T,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,3.0,A bit crazy as we are (attempting this with a 1-year old) - we went on the hike between Thira - Oía but discovered the trail to be broken in parts midway through. The strong winds caught up with us too... nevertheless the views seen from the trail are spectacular! Choose your day wisely and everything will be amazing!,Feb 2018
Greece,Mark,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"There is a reason this is the number one thing to do in Santorini. This hike provides a little bit of everything, but it is not suited for everyone. The views are breathtaking. The trail is diverse in both its scenery and nature. I refer to the city as Thera but you may see it spelled Fira. Either way it's the same place.

1. Distance - This trail is roughly 6 miles one-way with mild elevation gains. The only difficult part in terms of climbing will be the volcanic portion near the end which is a bit steeper. You should give yourself at least three hours to get there.

2. Location - The trail is poorly marked when leaving Thera. If you take the gondola up from the water you will begin by heading north through the town. Hotel Atlantis seems to be the recognized starting point. You do not want to follow the vehicle road, and this is where you will end up if using Google Maps or another GPS service. The stone walkways of Thera quickly disappear and you will find yourself out in the open at the edge of the caldera. There are a few small towns along the way, and some of them have markers pointing you in the right direction. Once you discover the trail navigation is simple as Oia will be off in the distance. I would not worry about getting lost, the adventure is a big part of this experience.

3. Bathrooms - There are no public facilities along the trail. Some restaurants may allow use but I would not take advantage of that unless it's really needed. If you are there in the off season most of those businesses are closed.

4. Water - I was unable to find any water fountains along the route. You may encounter a vendor or two, but be safe and bring a good sized bottle with you. The trail can be hot and windy.

5. Solar Protection - There is very little shade on this trail. It would be suggested to wear a hat, and either long sleeves of some SPF 15 plus sunscreen. Three hours unprotected will be plenty of time for a bad burn.

6. Footwear & Trail Quality - The trail is paved in the beginning, gravel in the middle, and rocky towards the end. Comfortable shoes are a must with hiking boots being preferred. Unless you have some sort of fancy four wheel drive stroller I wouldn't recommend bringing one. Towards the end of the trail there is a short climb up a volcanic hill, be careful with your footing here. Your ankles will thank you.

7. Return Trip - A bus runs from Oia to Thera on the hour if you do not wish to walk back. The cost is only a few Euros and you can purchase a ticket on the bus cash only. The return ride takes about 30 minutes and will get you right back where you started. A note to cruise passengers - do not attempt to take a last minute bus and expect to make it. The bus we took was a standard air conditioned coach that held about 60 people. The line to get on contained maybe 120 individuals and when the door opened it was a free for all. There are taxis if needed, but considering road conditions and traffic you should err on the side of caution and leave a little early.

I would recommend this trail to anyone with a sense of adventure, a little time, and a good camera. There are tons of wonderful views, flowers in bloom, photogenic churches, and interesting architecture. Take your time and enjoy the scenery.

Happy hiking.

Greece,thebrightstuff22,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Beautiful! I’ll start off saying you will see the most amazing views, get a full Santorini experience, and a great workout ... but be prepared with water, snacks, sneakers, sunscreen, and your athletic ability.

We were traveling near the end of June so we knew it would be hot but it was a scorcher. Plan on leaving from fira by 7-730am. We planned on leaving at 8am but missed the bus from our hotel at Volcano View Hotel to Fira where the trail starts so we walked the 2 miles to the start and didn’t end up beginning the trail until 9/915. My husband and I are in above average shape and we live in a city, exercise, walk everywhere, so we were not unprepared.

Santorini Dave’s blog said you can do this in flip flops this is absolutely untrue. There are lack of signs, rough uneven ground and steep hills with gravel/stones at some points.

When leaving Fira you will see the beautiful hotels and restaurants built vertically into the cliff, the donkeys on the steps, and the most amazing views. Between Fira, imorovigli and oia there is mostly desert and you will not see many people passing by. You will see a beautiful old church, more views, and a few local stands. There is a hard and easy side but we took the hard side which was a steep uphill and downhill climb.

I would suggest stopping to explore skaros rock and the ruins while on the trail and exploring that area. You can walk around and climb it too!

Upon arriving in oia you will be sweating, so there are multiple places for water and gelato! Yum yum! We waked down all the steps to Amoudi Bay for lunch. From Amoudi Bay you can walk all the way to the left past the bay (climbing over the cliffs) to a little beach area for a refreshing swim and to jump off of a cliff. By the end of this walk you will want to jump in the water.

I would highly recommend loading up on at least 5-6 bottles of water and bringing sunscreen and a snack before leaving Fira because there will not be anywhere on the way including bathrooms. Between the two of us on a 90 degree day we arrived in oia around 130pm and were pooped!

Greece,Miss Danielle,Tsambika Beach,4.0,"Get there early has the beach does get very busy. Ideal for everyone, there is water sports, massage, shops, restaurants and parking.

The beach is beautiful, the sand is so soft. The sea is crystal clear, we tried to snorkel but unfortunately we didn’t see any fish. But it was still fun. The sea is lovely and warm, and you can go out quite far. There is sun beds available at a charge, but they’re so comfy.

100% recommend a visit.

Greece,Jessica K,Tsambika Beach,3.0,"This beach is large and Sandy with easy, free parking right on the beach. However, the sand is course and it's very windy. When the wind blows from the West, the sand hits and whips you. My kids got cuts on this beach. Views are obstructed by ugly, inflatable water park things. It is ten euros for an hour. My kids loved it but it wasn't a relaxing, beautiful beach. There are nicer, secluded places. The Nude beach is on the far end and there is a partition so you can't see the naked ppl. But from a distance, they looked like they were having more fun over there!",Aug 2021

The shore shelves away gently so it’s safer for children.
Several cafes which play music, and a shop selling inflatable beach gear etc right at the entrance only. Bouncy castle activity in the sea looked good. Some activities like paragliding (?) behind a boat.
Lots of showers and changing cabins along the beach, the one next to the paragliding rental place has a mirror!
Toilets 50 cents. Boardwalks so you don’t have to walk in the sand all the time.

Greece,David D,Tsambika Beach,4.0,"Tuesday 27th October and we paid a rather fleeting visit to this beach.

Tsambika is one of the most popular beachs which is located on the east coast of the island.  It lies 26 kilometres (just over 16 miles) from Rhodes town between Kolymbia and Stegna beaches.

The fine golden sand stretches 800 metres (half a mile) along the coast.

Surprisingly it was rather busy when we visited here, despite the lateness of the holiday season. This definitely the beach for watersports enthusiasts. Sun loungers and umbrellas were available on the beach.

There were a number of bars and restaurants at the beach, with a large free car park on the beach.

It is possible to get to this beach on public transport, bus stop 11 is at the beach.

Water sports if needed and plenty of deck chairs along the beach to choose from

The beach is sandy and the water is clear and doesn’t drop off too deep. A nice spot but not secluded as I can imagine in peak season this is a tourist hotspot and very busy

Greece,Marion P,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"We have 2 young boys: one year old and almost four. This is our favourite beach. Yes there is a bit of a gap quickly into the sea so you need to keep a close eye on little ones who can’t swim yet, but there are so many positives. The sand is beautiful and regularly cleaned, the water is crystal clear, the mountains around are gorgeous and the showers on the beach are numerous and clean. We never stayed there more than a couple of hours so we haven’t been to the toilets there so can’t comment on that. However you have at least 3 tavernas on the way to the beach including with plenty of toys for young children, and in the shade. Our favourite is Taverna Edem where the owner Stella is just wonderful especially with the children. So we have made a stop there either before on after the beach for food/ snacks/ drinks/ toilets.
A fantastic beach and highly recommended!

Greece,Stevein,Tsambika Beach,3.0,"The beach itself is great, long wind-swept sand and generally clean. The bar/ restaurant and the northern end is great and the one in the middle is average.

The sea is clean and they have a full selection of water sports.

The downsides are that the car park is sand, up to 6 inches deep so careful where you park, the toilets are not good which can be an issue with kids and the big one for me is the killer... the sea bed shelves very quickly from 6 inches to 3 feet deep, within 10 feet of the waters edge so relaxing with a young one playing near you is impossible. Within 10 seconds of hitting the waterline they’d be under water if you’re not alert - we don’t ever leave ours obviously but it makes it unsuitable for youngsters

Everything was still open in late October managed to get food and drinks easy enough. Fed the goats that come down to the beach. The boats that come nearby do pump out loud music but it’s not a distraction.

Greece,Chibby8481,Tsambika Beach,3.0,"We intended to spend the day at the beach, having arrived about 10am. We are here right at then end of the season so it is quieter, I can imagine it gets very busy here in peak season.

Scenery wise, it’s beautiful; the surrounding cliffs, greenery, beautifully coloured sea which is very calm. The sand is dark brown and sadly, covered in rubbish, particularly cigarette ends. We have a one year old son who with one scoop of the sand, found a condom. Not the best start for us and ruined it really. Not family friendly in that respect and we wouldn’t return, we were constantly taking rubbish off him.

There are plenty of sun beds but again, is this due to October end of season. We got a cabana, but wonder if this part of the reason for the condoms nearby. It cost €30 for the cabana and a sun bed next to it, perfect for our son to snooze in whilst protected from the sun. The gentlemen who took payment for the beds was very friendly.

There are a number of different food outlets on the beach and as you drive in. Toilet facilities which you pay for on the beach.

To the right of the beach (as you approach it), are powerboat facilities with inflatables. In a previous life I would be wanting to go in these, but with my son the constant blaring of rubbish music from the boats was just annoying and ruining the peace of the place.

Only the first meter in the water shows some small stones, the rest is nice sand. Water is wide and low for many meters, but is not as warm as Agathi beach. The sunbeds and umbrellas are rather expensive here (€ 15) but include a safe with a waterproof electronic key. The bed boxes are even more expensive with € 30 (incl. safe).
There is a variety of water sports available like papasailing, boat rental (starting at €60 for an hour) and much more.

Our base is in Kolimbia which is a five minute drive to the fabulous Tsambika beach.
It’s well organised with a number of beach bar/ restaurants which makes it ideal for a whole beach day .
There are public toilets along the back of the car Parking area which runs the length of the beach so there’s plenty of spaces.
The Naturist section is excellent with its own beach bar. The people that run it also act as the “naturist police” keeping away the dreaded textiles who wonder along for a perv. As do one or two of the regular naturists who are quick to point out that this is a nude only beach.
It’s quite amazing that they can’t read the numerous signs that are quite clearly posted to that effect.🤦🏻‍♂️ Having said all that over the course of a day it probably only happens less than a dozen times.
Even husband and wife couples were politely ushered back where they came from.
And there is also an obvious line not to cross over into our little naturist haven.
The only downside to the naturist area is that it would be fantastic if they could extend it about a hundred yards more, but we’ve had no trouble finding space as it’s not crowded and the car is parked about 100 yards behind us. Happy days.

Greece,Meccy1969,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"Huge sandy beach with many beds & umbrellas @ 10 euros for 2. If you want beds on the front row by the sea you need to be there reasonably early but there were always other beds available somewhere on the beach. Brilliant place for families due to gently shelving sea & soft sand but be warned the sand does get hot hot hot! Inflatable fun for the kids as well as usual water sports from water skying to para sailing. plenty of choice of tavernas, a shop & loads of free parking. Can recommend La Plaz for food & drinks & the old guy walking up & down the beach with fresh doughnuts!
The snorkeling near the rocks by the Greek fag is good, though the sea is freezing there for some reason. Whilst this beach won't suit everyone it is great for those looking for somewhere with great facilities & safe seas.

But:
- very crowded, many many sunbeds very close one to another , so do not expect intimacy at all
- there are no wooden decks up to the first line of sunbeds but until last row, so be prepared to burn your toes
- in the middle part of the beach there are some plastic inflatable things..which are huge and occupy a large part of the sea
- few toilets, very far away, in the parking lot

Greece,ScentAurora,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"The nudist part of Tsambika beach is located at the end of the main beach. There is parking right behind and you can take off your clothes and go directly to this section. There is a fence on the beach that separates the textile and nudist section and there is a warning on this fence that this section of the beach is nudist.
The beach and the sea are sandy. Since the sea does not deepen immediately, it is quite suitable for beach and sea games. There is a tavern in this part of the beach. The beach staff warn the walkers from the textile lover to return as soon as they pass the fence. In this way, they prevent uncomfortable people from disturbing the beach users. Prices in the tavern are reasonable. no need to wear beach clothes to go to the tavern.
This year we noticed that the textile section of the beach is gradually approaching this section. The inflatable playground, which was further afield last year, has become very close this year.

There was free wi-fi. The only complaint is that it ends up only being a short excursion of about 2-1.2 hours because of the travel time. You barely have time to relax before it's time to go again.

We walked to the middle bit of the beach and had no issue with noise. The beach has sun loungers with parasols that are reasonably priced, good if you need some shade and respite from the sun; but if you do overheat the sea is incredibly refreshing. There are tavernas on the beach so you can get food and drink. There's also an inflatable playground at one end of the beach, water sports down the other end so there is fun to be had for thrill seekers and young ones. But you can just sit back and relax more importantly, that's what we have been doing.

The beach is sandy and apart for a few stones/pebbles on entering the sea, it was great. Lots of food and beverage choices but nothing really special other than a few cold Mythos.

We explained our situation and were very quickly put at ease by the young men who were running this attraction. We were not worried about going up in the air, we were only concerned on how we were going to get on the boat, which was also very quickly put right. What a fantastic time we had, we went right out into the next door bay where there was more wind and the boat ride itself was thrilling. We were then harnessed up and before we knew it, we were soaring high into the air. One of the lads on the boat took pictures of us and we were able to purchase the chip on our return. We had a wonderful time and would recommend it to anyone, even those of a nervous disposition as at no time did we feel we were out of our depth, thanks to the kind attention of the lads who took us up. When we came down, we had lunch on the beach at Marias beach taverna which we also recommend.

There are a variety of beach kantines all with their own identity and in charge of their own sunbeds.
The hospitality, food and general setting of the kantines never fails to please us.
Sunbeds are nicely spaced out so that you don't feel like a beach sardine.
For the kids, young and old, there's a play area set in the sea with inflatables to climb on and jump off.
You pay a fee to access the facilities and from what we've seen it has staff working in the play area.
Other activities are available for the more adventurous visitors such as paragliding behind a boat

We had a really good time here!!
The highlight for me was the little cocktail bar to the right hand side of the beach, nearest the painted flag on the rocks, that guy def knows his cocktails!!! So thankful of that as our hotel ones were shocking. His prices were excellent too!
Watersports here are FAB! We had such a fun packed day doing the water playground, crazy couch ride etc
Visited with family and friends, we had kids ranging from 7,8,10 and 17 yrs old.

There are a few places to get a drink and something to eat which are all reasonably priced. It also wasn't too busy when we arrived which was good.

Lots of beds with parasol @ €10 . 3 or 4 taverna along the beach, a little pricey but still nice. You are permitted to take your own food and drink though. A small shop selling beach stuff and ice cream and another selling soft drinks and fresh fruit. Water sports are at one end and are limited so they don't spoil the swimming area.

Greece,Robert S,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"We visited several beaches in Rhodes and we found Tsambika far the best in all aspects.
It's half-way between Rhodes town and Lindos (cca. 25 km from both), it's wide with enough sun beds (it's hard to find sun beds in popular smaller beaches), it has good facilities but the best of all is its deep fine sand (which we couldn't find anywhere else).

Greece,Rebecca,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"My partner and I spent most of our days during a 10 day trip to Rhodes at the sandy beach of Tsampika. The beach is beautiful and accessible by bus and car (parking is free). There are at least 3 restaurants/bars on the beach with a few shops too set just behind the beach. There seemed to be occasional mini music festival take place on the beach too on one of the evenings.

Umbrella + 2 sun loungers are €10 per day. The beach seemed clean and the water lovely, calm and clear. There is also water sports operating from one end of the beach called ‘Dimitris’ by the large rock with a Greek flag painted on to it. We found renting a boat from this organisation very nice to see more of the coast line and it was competitively priced (€50 per hour). Overall, the beach is such a blissful and relaxing day out.

Greece,turnerfamily01,Tsambika Beach,1.0,"Lovely beach but avoid Dimitries water sports at all cost, they are situated at the furthest north point of the beach.
Hired a boat for 4 hours at a cost of 160euros which was reasonably priced, but on our return we were informed that we had damaged the propeller which was untrue, the owner them proceed to demand 120 euros with the threat of contact the police if we refused to pay, we felt intimidated with no option to pay the owner.

Greece,KAEandE,Tsambika Beach,4.0,"Our 2nd visit to this beach (1st one 4 years ago) it's located 3 or 4 KM off the main Rhodes Town - Lindos road. Would be easy to miss the turn off, though it is signed, as the road doesn't look like it leads anywhere. Follow the road and eventually the beach appears with extensive free parking, on rough ground but OK.

It's a long stretch of sand backed by several taverna's, several toilet blocks (pay for use), showers, changing cabins, plenty of sun lounger concessions (Euro 10 for 2 and parasol) and water sports sections.

The sea is warm and shallow for a fair way out, no rocks or nasty surprises. Motorised water sports are within designated areas, we never saw anything that looked dangerous to bathers. We took a walk to, I think its the northern end of the beach (there's a Greek flag painted on a huge rock), where it gets a bit more rocky and where there are no sun lounger concessions. Quiet and nice for people who don't want to use the sun loungers. Plenty of space for ball games etc. even in high season.

Think this rates as a firm favourite with local people and its easy to see why. Typical friendly and relaxed Greek atmosphere. Would certainly visit again.

Greece,carne,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"An amazing sandy beach that stretches for almost half a mile.
Most people congregate at the first car park they come to but drive down the beach a bit and the water sports are all cheaper.
If you fancy parasailiing or any other type of watersport, they have and not too expensive either. They also have inflatable assault courses in the water and for 15 euros you can get an all day pass to this, great if you are with kids. It is a nice change from a pebble beach but is very busy. Sun beds are the same standard 5 euros as they are elsewhere and the beach bars are average priced.

There were free toilets and free parking available.

There is a water inflatable obstacle course or kids costing £15 for half a day and other water sports available also.

The beach is accessible by car or bus. The bus drops you right outside and does two drop offs and picks ups per day.

This isn’t a large beach but there are lots of beach bars where you can get food (most of these quite commercialised). We ate lunch at the Tsmabika tavern which was more of a restaurant with good food.

There is shower and changing room
Also several restaurants and bars so the beach is really nice organized.

Greece,LALL777,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"We travelled from Rhodes town and was heading towards Lindos but we decided to stop off at Tsambika Beach on-route first. We used the coach departing from the Rhodes town KTEL bus station leaving at 09:00 am (there is also a 11:00am bus), single tickets were 3.9€.
On arrival we were met with a beautiful soft sandy clean beach with crystal clear water. Sunbed/ umbrella hire was 5€ each. There is a large car park which is free located close by. The water is quite shallow for quite a distance out making it ideal for families to enjoy. There are ample places to eat and drink and toilet facilities available. Word of caution, the sand on the beach gets really hot, so wear suitable footwear.

This location is ideally suited for people with the use of cars. Note: there was no buses leaving from the beach stop going to Lindos only one bus going to Rhodes at 16:20. We caught the bus to Lindos in the evening, this requires a 2.5km walk up a steep path. This would lead you to the main road where all the bus stops are located. I did this walk earlier as part of my journey, as I visited the Monastery Tsambika earlier in the day. We were fortunate enough to get a lift, in which a couple in a taxi kindly offered to drop us off at the top on the main road. We enjoyed our visit to this area of Rhodes.

It might look crowded and like any other sand beach, but you'll find no better on this island for sure! No matter how packed it looks, there's more than enough space between sunbeds and you'll rarely find it in here. It has all you need to spend the whole day on Tsambika, and we've spent two whole days and one half! After seeing other beaches we kept on coming back here.

Gorgeous and properly policed and controlled. Lovely two guys provide sunbeds and brolley for 10 euro and you can buy fruit bowls, water melon, hot and cold coffee, crisps and all cold drinks.

I know it’s very early in the year but the beaches are already covered with plastic bottles , We collected 8carrier bags of bottles from one beach!

Greece,lumpy1956,Tsambika Beach,3.0,"We passed this Beach on several occasions whilst touring the Island by Car, One day we decided,""Let's have a look"" It was the day after we had a BIG rainstorm the night before. The Sandy area behind the beach had turned into a Quicksand-like material..Good job we were in the Car, You'd have NEVER walked through it......It was A sunny day, with a light Breeze, a few people had arrived early, But were leaving again.....There, in my opinion, are FAR TOO MANY Beachfront Eateries, which spoil the look of a truly lovely Beach...And the rubbish that was blowing around the area, was enough for me to say....No, another day when they have tidied up a bit??? Very large area, VERY commercial too...But then again, it's up to you?? Nice Beach, But loud Music blasting in your ears all day from the many Eateries??? NOT my thing, We/I like life a bit more sedate, But each to their own, On a really hot day, I expect this Beach to be WELL packed out...Go early.

Greece,Costas V,Tsambika Beach,4.0,"This beach is extending quite a bit, offering clear waters at good temperature, generally crowded nevertheless. This beach is not what it used to be, especially after watersport toys were added in three spots. There is a rather large parking area, often occupied, especially during weekendsn while the beach is often crowded. Coffee shops and restautrants exist in the area. On the other hand finding smoked cigarettes buried in the sand, even beer cans and sausage wrappings is -sadly - not seldom. The case is nevertheless reversable provided the beach is given a bit more care",Sep 2017
Greece,VeraPlaya4849,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"This is a true beach with pure golden sand and not a pebble in sight. The beach slopes gently into the sea and you have to walk a fair way out before it get deep and the sea is so warm it’s heaven. Lots of Beach tavernas with a vast choice of different food on offer. Sun beds and umbrellas were €10 for the day.

If you want to be alone and go au natural then turn right as you get to the beach and go as far as possible and you come to the naturist section but beware if you try and go on there with a costume the bar owner will chase you off, but to be fair the naturist section is tiny compared to the size of the beach so they deserve their own space.

The best place in Rhodes for sunbathing without a doubt.

Cafes showers toilets sun beds to hire they all there which makes it great for families. Beautiful bay - also has a nude beach if that's your thing.

Top marks for the 'beach shack guy' who CHASES OFF any 'clothed strollers..... it's naked or take a hike! Saw him in action three times during our stay - respect!
There're a not overly a lot of people (Sept. Sunday aĺ day) and there's a LOT of space between sunbeds and you can move them as much as you like, to chase the Sun or the shade. There's a big free parking right behind the beach, you literally park your car and step into the sands, pretty convenient for hot days!
No long hot hiking over scrub & tracks to find it either; on a bus route, use taxi or car it is that easy - Tsambika, it is trully a gem!

The price is the same, 10eur for 2 beds and umbrella, and if you come late in the afternoon, it's 5eur, which is pretty cool if you're a beach explorer. We were exploring other beaches until 5pm and then coming back to Tsambika, it is trully a gem!
...and you HAVE to try gyros at Margarita's!!! It's the best pita gyros we've found on the whole island! A small nice bar on the beach, nona Margarita makes her wonderful domestic greek cuisine gems, gyros is huge and incredibly tasty!
Tsambika is one of little reasons why we'd go back to Rhodes island. A place to go and feel utopian. ♡

Greece,MichaelSverige,Tsambika Beach,3.0,"This could be the best beach on Rhodes, but it has been completely ruined by the floating waterlands that they put there. Set in a nice environment, without hotels, and with very calm water it has all the ingredients for a world class beach, but now looks more like a two-bit tivoli. It is a shame that they are allowed to ruin one of the few pristine beaches of Rhodes like that.

More or less all pictures shown of Tsambika are old pictures or winter pictures, it does not look like on the pictures any more.

Apart from this there is plenty of room for parking, 10-15 tavernas serving anything from medioker to really good food. Toilets along the beach vary from very good to disgusting. Find your spot and try the 2-3 closest tavernas and toilets.

Use a car to get here, there are buses, but few and far apart. 1-2 kilometers from the main road.

The only genuine part left is the nudist beach at the right end with a driftwood shack serving cold beer and coffee.

Plenty of places to eat, beach shacks all along the length of the bay. Was very, very crowded so come early to grab a lounger in a good spot. Last bus to Kolymbia is 16:00 and they pack them in like sardines! but its only a short journey so not a problem.

Greece,ViktorRus1966,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"If you come to Rhodes with a small child, you must bring it to the beach of tsambika. But you also get the incredible pleasure. I never thought it was possible to obtain such a pleasure just stepping foot on the bottom of the sea.
The bottom is sandy and it's not just sand, it's like a nice carpet of sand . Not a single pebble, a completely flat bottom - just a grain of sand to a grain of sand. Very beautiful view from the beach of the sea , majestic rocks on the right and on the left , the beach itself is large and spacious .
And again I will say about the children : this beach on a fairly large stretch from the shore is very shallow and you can not worry for their child even if the child is very small or even if the child does not know how to swim. It's too shallow, there are no waves, there is warm water. It's just a toy beach like a children's story. The adult is a very nice dip in the children's feelings.
Definitely recommend a visit. But I warn you : two days when we were there, one day on the beach there was water. It was uncomfortable because it was impossible to wash off the sand under the shower after bathing. The Greeks said that they had some kind of accident, but that didn't help. This somewhat spoiled the experience. But in our second visit everything was fine.
Well, the price of rent : rent two sunbeds and an umbrella cost 10 euros. On the beach there are many cafes , the usual price.

They have a little slide out in the water, and some sun beds for rent. We had our own blanket with us, so we didn't try the sun beds out.

Water was clean, had some small school of fish here and there and there was no wind at all. Kinda quiet and some small waves. The kids enjoyed being able to walk far out in the water without it getting too deep.

It's not the best beach we've been to, but it was a lot nicer than the stones beach in Kolympia by Mikri Polo resort. Worth a trip at least once, cost for the taxi one way was €15

Greece,Wendy F,Tsambika Beach,4.0,"We discovered this beach on our last visit to Rhodes in 2009 and we're keen to revisit this year. It is just a beautiful with a long sandy beach and calm sea which is shallow for a long way, making it perfect for children and those not so confident swimmers. The cafes are welcoming, the sun beds are comfortable and, for €10, good value as there are no charges for car parking. The witbit water park looks fun and the many watersports on offer are very popular. We do have one big concern, however, when walking along the timeline we noticed lots of what we first thought to be shells. On closer examination we found that these are thousands of small plastic beads - things which are polluting our seas and damaging marine life. We would have given the beach a 5star rating but for the beads and the fact that there are not very many bins for people to dispose of their rubbish. We take ours home but not everyone will do this, adding to the pollution problem.

It's a fair distance from the main road so most access this by car. Plenty of car parking spaces. We drove a fair way down and chose the beds in front of Billy's Place. €10 euros for 2 beds with good cushions and a brolly. Beach was clean and the sea was calm and not too cold and was gently shelving so great for young families. Had lunch at the bar ... chicken gyros for €3 which was delicious. You will notice there are several toilets in the car parking area along with showers. Some water sports and inflatables along the beach. Can't think of any negatives.

Everything about this beach is perfect; the location is great, parking spaces are very convenient, few coffee shops and restaurants near by and there are two cliffs on either side which prevent it from being too windy and wavy.

Greece,Bryan T,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"Lying on my sun bed right next to the sea outside the La Plaz cantina.
Chose this beach based on Trip Advisor reviews & we are well pleased.
Difficult to get to unless you have a car but once there you can park right next to the beach at the cantina of your choice where sunbeds can be rented & all have free wifi that works right down to the sea.
Sandy Beach shelves gently into a calm sea.
Buy a Hugh donut from the local seller - you won't be disappointed!!!
La Plaz cantina staff very friendly & not at all pushy. Their cafe frappe is delicious.
There are plenty of different water sports available although we just chilled & people watched.
Definitely a beach to revisit.......thanks again Trip Advisor!!!

Greece,familyof2uk,Tsambika Beach,4.0,"If you've hired a car then this is probably the best beach in rhodes, as in, amenities, size and activities.
In may this beach is reasonably peaceful, but i imagine in the summer months it gets very busy. However, that being the case, there are several beach bar/restaurants running the entire stretch, that are reasonably priced, selling the standard holiday food, nothing fancy.
There are four watersport points with a variety of jetski, banna boats, parasailing and watersking/wake boarding.
Jetski 40e for 15 mins
Parasailing: 35e single, 60e double.
Waterskiing and wakeboarding 35e
Banana boat and similar between 12e and 25e.
Funny circular motorboat: 50e/hour
Paddle boards 15e/hour.

Theres free parking, toilets and beachside shower points at various points the whole length if the beach.

Two sunbeds with an umbrella costs 10e in total.

Most, if not all, of the beach bars have wifi, some free, some free when you make a purchase. We found the wifi signal still available right up to the sea edge.

The sea has a shallow bed that gently steepens, so you can walk out quite far before it gets deep.

The location is surrounded by the beautiful backdrop of tsambika hills.

Having spent our holiday travelling around rhodes we found this beach was the best of the larger beaches with the most amenities. However there are plenty of smaller and quieter beaches dotted around rhodes.

Sunbeds are 5 euros all day & some fabulous little tavernas doing some great Greek food. We ate at La Plaz & had the best Chicken Gyros & Pork Souvlaki we've ever eaten (how do they get the pitta bread to be soooo fluffy???). Beers served in frosted glasses too - oooooh!

Will definitely return, a fab little place (but watch your factor 15 - the sea breeze is quite deceptive!)

Meille sattui valitettavan kovatuulinen päivä joten pöllyävä hiekka hieman vesitti kokemusta. Rannalla tuolit varjoineen (vuokra 10e) mutta toki rantapyyhkeenkin kanssa pärjää. Rannalla pari myyntikojua ja muutama pieni ravintola. Rannalla myös vesiurheilua tarjoava yritys. Autolla pääsee perille saakka.

A nice beach with alot finer sand than many other beaches along the east coast of Rhodes. We happened to visit on a very windy day and the fine sand spoiled the experience a bit. Beach chairs available for rent (10e). There was a few beach stores and a couple of resteraunts. Accessable by car al the way to the beach. A watersport business also at the beach.

Altough the restaurant in the middle of the beach was a disaster, even for a simple beach bar. Rude staff, no service and there is no prices for anything unless you ask. The waitress basically made the prices up when we asked for the check (10 euro for a poor gyros plate) and the same with the drinks. So if you have something to drink or eat - ask for the price but dont expect service minded staff.

My wife liked Lindos beach more - it's smaller, more romantic and more sheltered. Both have soft golden sand and shallow waters that are great for kids. Tsambika beach is quite long and wide though, hence probably better in peak season. Also it's much easier to access and one can drive down or get a bus all the way to the beach. Water is crystal clear emerald green and the cliffs provide a great backdrop. We saw some young kids trying out kayaking and paddle boarding in the shallow waters without much worries for the parents, great location for that! A must-visit if travelling to Rhodes.

All the necessary stuff is there: showers and toilets, snack tavernas, water sports (still open in early October), easy bus access if you don't have a car, even a nudist area beyond the tavernas.

Two watersports areas, but small, cordoned off and not at all busy. On arriving in the car park, turn right and drive as far as the last taverna - less busy.

The wind made it impossible to sunbathe there as sand kept flying, so that's a bit annoying. We decided to head back to the Hotel which is a 2 minute drive from the beach and went to the Hotel's beach instead, and it was as usual, perfect.

The beach is large, sandy, and with a long 'walk' into the sea (so safe for small kids also) so even while it was crowded, there's enough 'personal' space for everyone in the sea.

This beach might be good for small children because it's sandy and not so deep. However water was not so clear as I expected. In fact water itself was much clear in Elli beach in Rhodes town.

But it was nice place to visit if you have time.There was a couple of nice bar restaurant on the beach to have lunch or drinks. It was quite crowded in mid-July.

Greece,Emma W,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"After sweltering on Lindos Beach we investigated various other beaches and our favourite by far is Tsambika Beach. It has everything for a family - a great stretch of sand with changing rooms dotted all the way along, showers, good eating places that are all spaced equally along the beach with really good prices, some with music some not so you can take your pick and every kind of water sport you could want.

They also have two giant inflatable water playgrounds in the sea for the kids (and adults if that's your thing) at what we thought was great value at 10 Euros per kid for the full day. We used the one by Tsambiki Sports who are brilliant and they supervise the play area all day with a guy in the water so you don't need to be with them. This place will keep your kids fully entertained all day and you don't feel like it's all on top of each other. I would stress this is in the sea, some bits quite far out so kids must be able to swim properly and be big enough to climb up onto the large inflatables - we're not talking small kids here unless you are with them.

Sunday afternoon one of the bars had a DJ playing and the place was rocking but there are more quieter places further along if that's not your thing however, I'd stress it's not like that everyday!

This beach is really well planned/organised and has a great feel about it - as a family we'd really recommend it.

Greece,Renato C,Tsambika Beach,3.0,"We came to Tsambika in the early morning after visiting the monastery. There were very few people so we chose a spot for once away from the sunbeds and umbrellas that you can rent. We went all the way to the left side of the beach looking at the sea (so basically near the big rock colored with the Greece flag).

The water was clean and the sun was very hot but it was enjoyable although not the best beaches we got to experience in Rhodes. That is until the wind picked up, it was so strong it would lash the sand in our face and eyes and got it basically everywhere. Our umbrella was utterly destroyed and I had to chase my t-shirt for 100 meters.

We decided to just leave because it was too much. I thought it was an exceptional day but my aunt lives in Greece since 15 years and she told us that the empty part of the beach is always like that. Where the wind is calmer is where you can rent the sunbeds and umbrellas.

If you consider that it isn't the nicedst beach or sea you could have, it wasn't really worth it to us. This is why I gave it a three star mark.

Just near the beach there is a small and modest, yet rather famous Tsambika Monastery, known by its baby miracles: if you want a baby, you should go upstairs and ask Maria for help) The most exciting thing - somehow it works!:)) I know one girl who got pregnant after visiting this place!

The beach is everything people say pure golden sand and clear blue warm sea, (heaven) small shop and cafes line the beach and most important not expensive.

The water though is heavenly, very gentle waves, ideal for a baby to take their first dip.
I'm not a huge fan of big beaches and was off put when I saw the number of cars parked, in reality it doesn't feel overcrowded at all and was much nicer than I expected.

Lots of beach cafe's with reasonable prices. Play area for kids in the water and all kind of water sports. There are sunbeds all over the beach so you really need to pay that 10€ for two beds and one umbrella. The sand is a little on the rough side. Not as fine as expected. It was also quite dirty.

However, on my latest trip this June, I saw big inflated water game gadgets placed in the water, though this provides some sort of entertainment for kids and a bit of extra cash for 'I have no idea who' ..these plastic monsters have made the beach look like a water park, it has lost its natural charm and beauty for which I take the pain of the 30 minute drive from town.

Great beach for couples, families, kids and also has a selection of mini-marts, restaurants, and water activities to take part in.",Jul 2016
Greece,Svetlana N,Tsambika Beach,2.0,"In our search for the actual sandy beach on Rhodes island, as in *SAND* throughout, under the lounging chairs and the sea, Tsambika Beach was recommended as one such all-sand-sandy beach on the island. Unlike many others for which you will be told they're sandy but discover they really aren't, Tsambika Beach is the actual sandy beach, the only one we could find driving around the island.

Unfortunately, it is situated at the bottom of a hellhole, where the heat and humidity are entirely unbearable. When the heat in Rhodes town gets around 36C, it's around 50C at the Tsambika beach. Add 10-20 degrees Celsius to the Rhodes town temperature, and around 20-30% more humidity and you'll know right away how pleasant Tsambika is at the time.

By 11 AM sand gets so hot you can't walk barefooted from your lounging chair to the sea, or you'll burn your feet. Literally.

The landscape around it is entirely barren - nothing can grow and survive such heavy, humid heat and hot winds, like fan blowing in your face all the time. I would go in for a swim, come out with my hair soaking wet and had it hot-wind-dried - completely and thoroughly dry - in less than few minutes. Wish hair salons were able to replicate Tsambika's blow drying speed.

Water is lovely, luxuriously so, but you burn there too and the cooling down effect doesn't last. The moment you get out of the water you are enveloped in that heavy oppressive heat again and feel like you should go back and stay under water for the rest of the day.

There is no natural shade anywhere around. You only get beach umbrellas at 10 euros per couple, and you burn under them at almost the same rate as if you didn't pay for it. All the lounging chairs you rent for the day are no more than 10 cm off the ground, so the angry heat is bellowing at you from all sides, including below and under.

By the time you figure out you must get away quickly if you want to live (which, for us, came after approx. 1 and 1/2 hours, you realize there is no place you can hide: the slapdash coffee shops along the beach are bloody tents and cardboard houses with no AC, not even a ventilator. They are for stewing collapsing tourists and charging them heftily for each ounce of water they may get. The staff belonging to those places is there to squeeze as much money out of you as possible, not to make you feel comfortable and good. You get this strong feeling they really wouldn't care if you do collapse in front of their feet, unless few cents fall out of your pocket while collapsing.

We hastily jumped back to our rented car and had to drive for about 5 km to get to a hotel with AC inside to rehydrate, get some juice and catch air - inside, of course, with the AC going on full speed.

I assume Tsambika is a great beach to go to in October or November, but not before. We were there in June and the heat and humidity were unbearable. Bearing in mind July, August and September are Rhodes' hottest and most humid months, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to Tscambika at that time.

2 beds + sun umbrella cost € 10. Normal price for a popular sandy beach like this one. You park your car at the beach so very close by. Mini market, restaurants, it's all there.

The only down side we experienced was the wind. It was very windy the day we went, and we got sand all over. And I mean everywhere, up to your eyes and ears. Only go when it's not that windy.

Tip: go as far to the left as you can. On the right there is a nudist beach and it's just overly crowded in the middle.

There is definitely loads of space and many choices as to where to eat and drink. There is also a waterpark -type of play area with inflatable walkways and balls etc for the more agile. These would be for the older kids and adults I think. I hear a day pass is 10 euros. There's plenty of parking as well but do find one of the few trees to park under to avoid the vehicle turning into a sauna while you sun yourself on the beach. There are WCs along the stretch of road that goes along the beach but the facilities are not very well maintained. Strong stomach, your own alcohol wipes plus loo roll recommended. There are a number of tabernas along the road leading from the main road to the beach side, too.

Greece,Steve E,Tsambika Beach,5.0,"OK we went just outside the season at the end of October but we had a stunning few days on Rhodes. Not one drop of rain 22-28 degrees. Most of the main resorts are grinding to a halt BUT may be this is the best time. Tsambika was the best of a number of brilliant beaches, but this beach beats Lindos in my book. Soft golden sand, Excellent clear water for snorkling. Quite a few beach bars (none of which were open because their season is closed) and we had a great lunch just up the track at Edem Restaurant where we were served by a really sweet multi-lingual lady. There's a nudist end to the beach if you go right as you arrive. Obviously that's taken quite seriously as the sign on the little shack bar seemed to suggest it was serving only naturists. I imagine your experience might be different in the high season but as beaches go this is one of the best.

Greece,Lordshillroadrunner,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"The monastery lies at the top of a very large hill. Takes around 15 minutes to walk up there and the views are well worth it with lots of vantage points on the way. Had a good old chat with the man selling paintings outside of the monastery about a stray puppy (puppy was found a home during my stay), and then went inside to be greeted very warmly by one of the monks. My attire was suitable so no need for extra scarves or layers to be borrowed. Of course the paintings, mosaics and ornamental trappings of the place were superb but I loved looking at the plant specimens even more. The gardens are beautiful. Went inside the church and museum. A strange exhibit is a huge glass case containing the skeleton of something with very big bones. Afterwards I read online that this was the remains of a sea creature?

The place is so calm, peaceful and breathtakingly beautiful. Not so many visitors so plenty of time and space to have a good look around.

Beautiful cove for swimming, or just enjoying the view and taking photographs.

It's a 20 minute walk up to the monastery from here, and although it is possible to drive up further, it's a very narrow road controlled by traffic lights, so unless you have mobility problems I would suggest taking on the walk and enjoy the view as you go!

The monastery is lovely, we sat for a few minutes of quiet reflection and took the opportunity to light a candle, (donation invited). There is also a small museum which was fascinating, great collection if liturgical vestments, religious artworks and prayer books, some from the 15th century. Amazing collection with I imagine lots of stories to tell. Well worth a visit. There is also a lovely gift shop selling honey, and religious memorabilia as well as Corfu guide books in English and most other common languages.

There is a traffic light system up the hill as very narrow. We parked easily (midday on a Sunday in September) and there didn’t seem to be any parking charge... We walked the last stretch up the hill (there are some lovely donkeys to look at) and reached the monastery. There is a cafe at the top, with a nice selection of food/drink and amazing views. We spent some time taking photos before entering the monastery. I was offered a shawl on entry as my shoulders were bare (shawls and skirts were available to borrow). There is no obligation to pay anything, but a collection tin at the entrance should you like to make a donation. Definitely worth a visit, very ornate decorations inside the rooms and church, with a small museum too. There were lots of cats wandering about and you are welcome to take photos in all areas. The monastery is open every day 7am - 1pm and then again from 3pm - 8pm (this was on the plaque outside so presuming this is year round).

Greece,Peachy,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"To get to the monastery, you have to walk up a rather steep hill, so this may be one to miss if you struggle with mobility and have no car access.

The monastery is also closed between 2 and 3pm, we arrived at 2, but simply ate at the neighbouring cafe whilst we waited.

You are required to have your shoulders and knees covered, but if you do not have anything appropriate they will provide you with clothes to slip on over the top.

Once inside, the monastery gives off a peaceful, spiritual energy. The gardens are well cared for, and there are many cats to be found. The small museum was interesting, as was the old room for making olive oil.

I particularly liked seeing the church. We were able to light a candle and I prayed briefly. The one disappointing thing I found was young tourists taking selfies near the altar etc, which personally I find inappropriate and disrespectful. It can also get very crowded if there are a lot of people. We weren't there for peak time over summer, so it wasn't too bad, but I could imagine it being difficult if there were a lot of people.

But all in all, still completely worth the visit. There is no fee, but we both made a contribution to their donation pot.

Not too far from the monastery, there are also a few donkeys - we saw a young one with two adult ones and they were very cute.

Very cool how it is kind of built into the top of the hill - there are different levels and definitely steps. And of course, that means the views were stunning. If you're in the area it's worth a stop if you like to see religious sites and churches.",May 2019
Greece,Baiasu H,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"To get to the monastery you have 2 variants on foot from the car park or car. For those with car and moto attention that runs on a single wire at the base of the traffic light that works. The monastery is beautiful with its charm. The church is surrounded by flower gardens, in the inner courtyard you find a museum that houses church clothes, old icons and worship products. There is a souvenir shop and another one selling wine, olive oil, etc. with the product label in the monastery. In this shop you can see an olive crusher. It is a warm and beautiful place to visit",Jul 2019
Greece,ABroner,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"You can “hike” up the small hill that’s paved or drive up. We drove. :) There are 2.5 small parking lots at the top and it saves those of us who are a bit handicapped some energy. Just be careful because the huge tour buses also drive up and they will block you in.
Once up there it’s beautiful! The views, the church, everything! There’s a small restaurant at the top as well.
Before you go in, they will give you a cover if they determine that you need one. I had read that so I wasn’t surprised but they were a bit stinky and it was a bit off putting to me. I realized that other women had their own scarves so if you have one, bring it! Then you don’t have to give a tip to smell and wear theirs.

Greece,Emma,Paleokastritsa Monastery,1.0,"Woman in front had exact same length of shorts (she was 3xolder than me) yet I was given a smelly dusty old thing to put over myself, I refused. Toilets dirty and man gives you a section of loo roll as there's no loo roll in the toilets.",Jul 2019
Greece,Marina P,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"A beautiful place to visit and a nice change from the typical touristy joys. The architecture of the church (Greek Orthodox) is different from Catholic and Protestant churches.

There is an old olive oil press in the building that now serves as a souvenir store, and it's a bit of a pity that there was no information about it.

The walk up the hill only took us 10 minutes and was much less steep than the path from Liapades village to the sea. The monastery is supposed to be closed between 13 and 15, and it did not feel crowded at the second half of the day. There is a small cafe next to the monastery, with the same great views, friendly service and a bit pricey drinks.

Greece,MarieMooni,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"Beautiful place!

The monastery is on a hill. You can walk to the top (15-20 min) or drive. There are two free parking lots on the hill - one small on the top and another, larger, lower. A lot of people park near the stop light (another large free parking lot).

This place attracts a lot of tourist, so you should visit it early in the morning or evening if you want to avoid them.

Also, we saw a lot of cats on the hill.

Greece,SusanG1953,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"We drove over to Paleokastritsa from Liapades about 8:30 in the morning and parked in the large lot at the foot of the hill (just to the right when you see the stop light). It was a 10-15 minute walk to the top with wonderful views along the way. (The parking lot at the top is tiny.) We arrived before any tour buses so were able to go into the chapel, museum, gift shop, wine and food shop, and grounds without other guests. The monastery is really a lovely place, well tended. We also walked up behind the restaurant to look at all the animals--goats, chickens, cows--tended by the monks. We also walked over to the look-out (but the path is very narrow). By the time we descended the hill (2 hrs later), the parking lot was filled to capacity with busses (on a Tuesday in early May). The rest of Paleokastritsa seemed to be places to stay and places to eat, with a few stretches of beach.

Greece,mike007,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"Paleokastritsa is a beautiful resort area with much visual character and the history surrounding the ancient rock Kolovri located off the very rugged, rocky coastline.
The resort is located some 16 miles 27 kms. north west of Corfu town. The roads become very windy up and down once in the area showing spectacular views en route to Paleokastritsa bay. The resort and monastery are popular tourist attractions, visited by coach tours and car alike.
The monastery is close by at a high elevation with beautiful views around and down to the beach and bay. The museum and gift shop were open for religious items, also local brews, olive oil and handmade crafts. The monastery was interesting to walk through the different levels, private quarters for the monks and encountering a few cats and dogs en route and observing the spectacular views. A monk was at the entrance to receive voluntary donations as there was no charge to enter. I definitely recommend making it a day trip to discover the history of the area, enjoy water sports, relax, take a swim or a boat trip.

Greece,Willow,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"In the summer months this peaceful place is quite literally over-run with coach-loads of tourists who are bussed in from all parts of the island to make this part of the Paleokastritsa experience. And it is an experience, but one that is better had at the beginning or end of each part of the day i.e. before 9.30 am, just after 3 when it reopens for the afternoon or just before 7 which gives an hour before it closes at 8pm, and when the quiet beauty of the place isn’t compromised.
We were over-awed by the chapel, and found both the views and the gardens inspiring. It gives a welcome rest from the busyness of holidaying, and am opportunity to contemplate our place in the world whatever one’s beliefs.

It was such a peaceful place to experience - cats snoozing in plant pots and pretty flowers and plants everywhere. I liked the church - it was very decorative but for me, I appreciated being able to experience this calming environment - even if for just a short while.

There was a tiny museum inside, as seen on photos... i was fascinating to look at specially if you're Catholic. The church was closed during our visit so we did not get to see it. After the museum, there's a tiny gift shop... we bought 2 souvenirs which is €25 each.. then we went to the market the same day and found the same items for only around €10... but it was fine...

Today we did an extensive fill day tour of the Island which included a visit to the Paleokastritsa Monastry - located at the top of a hill giving panoramic views of the impressive surrounding coastline. Entrance is based on a voluntary donation and - with all visits to places of worship - girls/women need to cover up their legs & shoulders.

The Monastry is larger than one would expect and - in addition to some interesting relics in the Museum - there is an interesting shop selling local products. Whilst I didn’t see too many monks during our visit, there were no shortage of resident cats - including one fast asleep in one of the larger flower pots!!

You will still be able to admire the beautiful grounds of the monastery and the views over the blue and turquoise colored sea below, in Paleokatstritsa. Once inside, you can light a candle, for a small donation. On the way driving down from the monastery, we were getting ready to round a corner, and were shocked to see a herd of goat approaching us.

The Monastery is perched on the top of the hill with a fairly gentle climb up, not too exacting but you need to be aware of cars and taxis going up and down quite frequently, there are no pavements. Splendid views await and the monastery itself is interesting, especially the church/chapel. We tagged on the back of a cruise ship group so got a free potted history and description of the most interesting items. We visited in late April and was not that crowded, just the one cruise ship group of around 20.

The monk seated at the gate, presumably checking that people were properly dressed for the monastery as there is no entrance charge, turned out to be quite a jovial soul and when some brave chap from the tour group, American of course, asked for a selfie with him he obliged willingly and then was quite chatty afterwards with ourselves and thanked us for visiting.

Be aware that the monastery closes from around 1300 to 1500 (best to check exact times before your visit).

The monastery itself is small, but typical of its type and beautifully and elaborately decorated.
And this is no museum. As we watched on a couple arrived, babe in arms, for a christening which was immediately conducted, with little fanfare, oblivious to respectful, but delighted tourists watching on.
Everywhere you look in and around this small site there are beautiful pictures to be taken, of the grounds, the monastery and the views from its walls.
But beware if wandering in from the beach - in line with the church's beliefs, shoulders and legs must be covered up, provoking hilarity and some bonus fun holiday snaps of tourists, straight from the beach below, forced to dress up in old shawls to enforce their modesty.

Greece,CPaM68,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"Built on the top of a hill with a stunning view of the coast, the location and surroundings are truly gorgeous. Beautiful flowers, vines, and plants cover the buildings and archways. If you like cats, you won’t be disappointed, since there are cats everywhere in and around the monastery. The visit to the monastery is free, but when you go into the chapel, you are encouraged to donate. There is a dress code to enter the chapel, and it may be for the entire location, so check it out before you go. There is also a small museum and gift shop if you want to buy some reproduction icons, olives, or olive oil which is made right there in the shop. Even though this is a tourist attraction, it is also a functioning monastery which was established in the 13th century and still home to a small number of monks. There is also a well and according to local legend, any person who throws coins into the well will come back to the island for another visit. It is a beautiful and picturesque place that is well worth the visit.

Greece,achin27,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"We had a hire car so decided to take a trip to see the monastery.
The monastery is on top of a hill & the road is windy. We were glad we didn't decide to park down the bottom & walk up, although not majorly steep, was still long enough to the top. However you can go at your own pace, take photos on the way, but be careful of cars driving up.
A lot of the coaches seem to stop at the bottom, but we did see a few coaches up the top so I would suggest you check with tour agents before booking it if you do not fancy a hike up to see the monastery.
Up top there's a restaurant so can quench your thirst from the hike.
If driving there is a small parking just before the last turn in the road towards the monastery & restaurant area.
At the entrance, if you want a souvenir photo for €2 then stop & let the photographer take you picture. You can buy near the toilets at the end.
The toilets cost 50cents to use.
You can't walk around all the monastery, but the church is very quaint & picturesque. You can buy candles to light & say a prayer. There's also seat to just sit & take in the calm atmosphere.
If you do go into the monastery please remember to cover knees & shoulders. If you forget that have scarves at the entrance that you can use.
There's lots of photo opportunities as well.
There is a small museum, an olive mill & 2 little shops. One after the museum where you can get items like guide books, religious fridge magnets, etc. The other selling more local souvenirs like Corfu shaped ouzo, local soaps, cooking spices, etc.

Lots of cats taken in by the monks. There is a photographer at the main door so you can buy a €2 postcard style photo of yourself if you wish. We visited as part of a Thomson trip around Corfu so we're able to get the bus up I suspect it would be rather steep to visit on foot. Women are expected to cover their knees & shoulders so wearing a t shirt & longer shorts is recommended although they do provide skirts & shawls just in case,Sep 2017
Greece,Hannah T,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"This little monastery is such a lovely place to go whilst in Corfu. You can either walk or drive up the steep hill to where it is. (I do recommend walking as there isn't much parking) Once up at the top there is an amazing view and a little walk if you want to venture out to the furthest view point.
When visiting the monastery women have to be dress respectful and have there shoulders and knees covered. However don't worry if you don't as the do provide homemade elastic skirts and shawls if needed which you can give back at the end. I definitely recommend seeing the chapel! It will take you breath away and the gardens as well! Definitely a trip that needs to be done in Corfu!

So many beautiful and interesting things to see. Small donation to light a candle and a small gift shop. A wishing well. This visit was the highlight of my day to paleokastitso. Well worth it . We bought some of the olive oil that is made there and it is delicious.
Note for paleokastritso: we visited this place on a bus trip for the day, as beautiful as it is we find the buses take you to places to just spend more and more money.

The monastery is accessible by car by a traffic light controlled system, but we decided to walk up to make the most of the views (and to wear the kids out!) but i wouldn't recommend it to elderly or very unfit!

Once at the top, there is a taverna with panoramic views and of course the monastery. We visited in April so it wasn't too busy which was nice as we could walk around not fret about the kids. The architecture is lovely and typically Greek. The church is also beautiful... remember to take some change for a donation as they trust a candle into your hand. We were happy to donate as everyone very friendly and welcoming. You need to dress respectfully to go in the church - i.e. shoulders covered.

There is also a gift shop but we didn't visit because of the kids!

Once outside we had an ice cream from the taverna and enjoyed the view!

If you visit here, don't forget to pop into the aquarium at the bottom of the hill - the staff are really informative and they've got some cool fish and reptiles that you can meet face to face!

Also nice tavernas as the bottom... highly recommend Niko's... very friendly and great food.

Beautiful views from within the grounds and if you like cats and kittens then you will be fine as plenty of them.

We always go when in Corfu as we like to light a candle to our loved ones who are no longer with us and its a lovely, peaceful place to do this.

One tip, wear some footwear with some grip as floors inside and out are very slippery especially if they have been watering the plants.

Also, women visitors are asked by the monks to cover up and they supply throws to put over shoulders etc.

Has a museum and a gift shop. There is also a cafe outside the monastery.

We find the beat time to visit is early morning or late afternoon as gets busy with coach parties etc.

Greece,ITRT,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"The monastery is home to 8 Greek Orthodox Monks who graciously welcome visitors by offering tours of the grounds and the museum located within the monastery. Masses are offered at specified times. Even if you are not “into” churches and monasteries, the fantastic views of the Ionian Sea and bays from this monastery are worth your time and visit. This is a working monastery and the monks play a role in the everyday life of the locals. A bonus of your visit will be the tasting of their olive oil which is available to purchase. In the courtyard, there are plants and they afford the visitor a respite from the summer heat. When visiting, remember women have to have their shoulders covered and short shorts are not proper attire. Highly recommend visiting the monastery and grounds. Note: The monks are not to be photographed.

Traditionally any ladies who visit the monistery must have there legs and shoulders covered so a variety of Cloths are available to borrow.
When you've completed your visit there is a nice Taverna oppersite for a cool drink and something to eat.

Greece,Ann H,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"We drove over from our vacation rental and parked at the bottom of the hill. It was a somewhat steep walk up to the monastery. There is no ""fee"" to enter but the monks do ask for a contribution. Lovely buildings with stunning views of the sea, but the small museum did not contain much written information. For example, the case with whale bones did not say where they were found, nor when they were found. Left us curious about their significance. A brochure with information about the monastery would have been helpful. There is a small gift shop on site as well as a tasting room where you can sample the olive oils made by the monks. The monastery closes from 1-3 so be sure to factor that into your planning and dress respectfully - long pants, or skirts for ladies and covered shoulders..

Greece,happilyretired_12,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"We walked up to the Monastery, which took about ten minutes with photo stops to take in the beautiful scenery. It is a steady climb but there is shade from the trees. On reaching the entrance my wife was offered a skirt and shawl to cover knees and shoulders. There didn't appear to be a set charge although others have written that they had to pay 2 euros. The gentleman just asked to pay what we could afford. As we walked under the arch the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees due to the trees and shrubs. A beautiful oasis of colour and scents. There was some delicious herby smells as we started the tour then as we walked further into the grounds the colour of the Bougainvillea was spectacular. Again the temperature dropped even further, it was cool and calming. We saw the area that had been used to produce the olive oil, along with a small museum and shop. Also in the praying area we were sold candles. We lit some for our departed friends and family. The decoration and artifacts on display meant that we ended up spending a lot longer than expected looking around.
Our only feedback was that the toilets were locked and the neighbouring restaurant was not happy with visitors to the Monastery using their facilities.

In my opinion, it is not done to stand on the altar of a church if you are not one of the priests or lean against icons listening to a loud talking tour guide, while elderly Greeks try to fight their way in the church and practice their faith.

So much so that the people wanting to leave couldn't get out, and no one could get in. So a jostling stand off ensued. That was it for us, we retired to the cafe out side and enjoyed a drink and the magnicient views. 30 minutes later all the coaches had gone and we were then able to enjoy the site properly.

Greece,Thomas s,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"I've just been on my first of many excursions with vlasseros and what can I say....
Absolutely exceptional value for money with outstanding service.
Me and my girlfriend paid 12euros each for a days coach trip which consisted of the following...
-a pick up from the heart of canal d amour and taken to the kum qaut distillery. here we learnt a little about the distilling process, but best of all we got to sample most of thier products.
-after the distillery we then headed to the sacred monastery of Paleokastritsa where we where free to roam around the beautiful religious building and also admire the amazing views from the surrounding mountains.
-we then headed down to the shore of Paleokastritsa where we were free to roam across the many beautiful beaches, coves and shops for 3 hours.
-when our 3 hours was up, the coach then headed up through the narrow village streets (cannot praise the driver enough for his incredible driving skills) to a fantastic cafe at the peak of Bella vista which did not disappoint. The coffee and baklava was exquisite and the view of the West side of the island from the cafe balcony was breathtaking.
-moving on from Bella vista, we then made a short pit stop to the local open air market, where local produce could be extensively sampled and purchased before heading back to sidari.

I must apologise because I cannot remember the drivers name, but he was extremely knowledgeable, spoke fantastic English and gave a very detailed commentary throughout the 8 hour excursion.

Based on this trip cannot emphasis enough how much I would recommend vlasseros. The Mercedes coach was kept to an exemplary standard and overall value for money was exceptional. Thanks a lot for a great day trip.

Greece,grahamcarter61,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"It seems to us that Greek monks had it all worked out, building their monasteries in stunning locations and putting up the cutest buildings - which is never more true than at Paleokastritsa. We would have paid to visit this place, but it was free. If you are visiting Corfu (in which case you will probably visit the seaside haven of Paleokastritsa anyway) then check out the monastery, which is above the town. Our main tip is to park in the large car park by the beach and walk up to the monastery, thus avoiding the car parking lottery at the top. Some reviewers have suggested this is only for those who are ""very fit"", but unless you have mobility problems, the climb is relatively easy for all ages, and is partly in shade. Also, ""busy"" is more accurate than ""crowded"", as some have suggested, as visitors move through at a steady rate. For some reason, ladies (but not men) have to cover their knees and shoulders to enter, but skirts and shawls are provided for free at the entrance.

Walked around to church small gardens stunk of cat wee. Was a bit fed up now. Walked in church tiny old woman thrust candle in hand then gestured to collection box. Luckily i had someone i needed to light candle for. No atmosphere in church that was rather sad as normally i love old building. Loads of rude tourists not covering up. It does have some fine wooden seats and ornate ceiling. Out of there to a pretty poor museum. I know i am English and expect the whole world to teanslate for me but seriously a bit more translation on items and more people would actually stop and see. Old bibles beautiful. Press room ?????? Not sure as no info on walls but you could buy marmalade. If i had had to walk up the beautiful winding road to get to this church i would of been annoyed. Its a place you could miss very easily.

Greece,JTB,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"Came upon this by accident whilst driving around but so glad we did. The views from the top are beautiful. Free to enter, it was well worth a look around but ladies with bare knees and shoulders will be provided with skirts and shawls to cover up. Men, however, don't have to cover up!

The cafe/bar alongside the monastery has lovely views to sit and enjoy some refreshments.",Jun 2016
Greece,Bob T,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"On a previous visit to Corfu we were not too impressed, but the tour we took to this Monastery was really good value. We saw some beautiful scenery and our guide was excellent, explaining in simple terms the rather convoluted history of this island. The monastery itself stands at the top of a small peninsula, being accessed by a hair-raising coach ride up a very twisty road. The building is very picturesque, particularly when the bearded monks are wandering about, and there is an abundance of plants and flowers all around. The free museum is briefly interesting, and the shop is fine if you want to buy some reproduction icons. Merite un detour!

Greece,prat2007chett,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"We took a day trip to Paleokastritsa.on the Bella Vista tour. The Byzantine Monastery is at the top of a small incline but the coach parks at the bottom. The courtyard is quite stunning and gives a real feel of Monastic life of years hence. There are lovely terraces and shady spots and there is also a museum here. A visit was also made to the Kumquat distillery for liquere tasting and a demonstration tape which was very interesting.. We then were taken down to the village for lunch and a swim, and to watch local sea life. On then to the village of Lacons where the streets are so narrow you have to be impressed with the skills of the driver, on to Makrades for a little open air market. A really great day out and all for 15 euros.

Greece,highlifeManchester,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"Well worth a visit on top of a hill overlooking the sea with far reaching views over the 5 bays.

Greece,Julie S,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"A wonderful place to visit.
Don't be scared of the walk up from the main road in Paleo as it is quite gentle: it took our family inc two children under 10yrs about 10mins to walk, and we did stop for a photo opportunity on the way too.
The views from the top are really lovely, especially if you walk past the geese (on your right as you reach the monetary), as you have a wonderful view of one of the beaches below.
There is a cafe at the top that serves slush-type drinks which are perfect in the heat.
Please remember that this is a religious place, and The customs of the monks still must be observed, whether you believe them or not. Shoulders, legs and head should be covered when you go into the church. At the entrance you can hire a scarf for a donation if you are not covered up. Inside the small church you can light a candle; again for a donation.
There is also a small shop, museum and examples of very old olive presses.
Definitely worth a visit.

On the lower level, the garden has arches of flowers throughout. There is a chapel and a courtyard on the upper level as well as the monks' living quarters . The living quarters are not accessible to tourists.

Greece,Jenny B,Paleokastritsa Monastery,2.0,"Having been to Corfu before, I booked a shore excursion to Paleokastritsa as I was sure that my friend (who had never been to Greece) would be amazed by the views of all 6 bays from the hillside. It appears that all the cruise shore excursions go to this monastery but the really best views are from Bella Vista, so make sure you ask if the coach goes there. The views from the monastery are very much second best, and it seems that cruise ships bank on their passengers not being aware that much better views can be seen a bit higher up the hill. Our coach drove through Paleokastritsa, not stopping for any photos, so anyone on the wrong side of the bus, or in an aisle seat, stands no chance of getting a picture. A service was on at the monastery, so 4 groups of tourists were milling around outside awaiting their turn going through a museum of minimal interest. Our guide even told people to pop in to have a look while the service was going on: utterly disrespectful. So if you really want the best views, book a taxi to take you to Bella Vista and save money.

outside there are toilets and a restaurant/bar again with great views,if you see the cannon,take the gate on the right and down the rocky path-this will take you up to the shrine on the rocky headland and more great views,or,take the road beyond the café, walking past the ducks and peacocks to another photo opportunity by the large cross.

Greece,Drives,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"Despite being to Kerkyra a number of times, we had not visited this Monastery. It is well worth a visit to appreciate the history of the area. The history of the Monastery, the church within it and the church internal walls and ceiling are a photographer's delight. There is also a very detailed history of the Monastery and its associated olive oil making processes on show. Together with the amazing views of Paleokastritsa, the beautiful waters surrounding the area and the restaurants, particularly the one next to the boat cruises to the caves, it is well worth a visit. To get to the Monastery, you can drive a car or take a bus, however, there is a 150 metre walk up a reasonable incline from the carpark. There are lots of steps to negotiate within the Monastery and of course there is a need to dress appropriately for a place of worship. When we were there a couple of people did not take off their hats as they entered.

Greece,Milikas,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"To visit the monastery in Paleokastritsa dedicated to Panagia (the Virgin Mary) on Friday Easter we preferred to have a 3 km walk starting from the Paleo Inn Hotel instead of driving up the winding road and wait at the traffic lights for a long time (two vehicles cannot meet in some places), which wasn`t a bad idea at all considering the large tour groups expected to come there by bus on this occasion. Getting to the monastery which was built on top of a green hill took us about an hour walk via a road giving a stunning view of the bays in Paleokastritsa and the sea. At the entrance an inspirational quote from the Bible said:""Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty"". The monastery was built in 1228 on two levels. At the lower level we found the monastery old olive oil mill, which became a souvenir shop selling extra virgin olive oil, soap, wine and sweets produced by the monks. The church was on the upper level and so were the bell tower and the well in the center of the inner courtyard. The place, dressed in Bougainvillea, where the white Zantedeschia flowers in Spring is a heavenly garden, which I strongly recommend you to pay a visit. Right beside the entrance to the monastery there`s a view point where the amateurs of selfies or photos have to stay in line. Paleokastritsa Monastery is open daily from the beginning of April to the end of October between 7:00 - 13:00 and 15:00 - 20:00. Admission is free.

Greece,Adi552,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"Overlooking the rugged west coast the monastery of Paleokastritsa is perched on the very top of the mountain. As one enters they are met with a feeling of peace and serenity. Throw a coin in the wishing well, the proceeds of which go to charity. Stroll through the manicured gardens which are amass with beautiful flowers and foliage and cats lazing around looking very content with the care given to them by the priests.

Take time to reflect in the gilded chapel and if so inclined light a candle and take in the beautiful murals.

A walk around the grounds will present you with some of the most spectacular views of Paleokastritsa. The shop within the monastery sells icons, souvenirs and postcards for those who wish to have a memento. This truly has to be one of the most beautiful places in Corfu. It is however crowded during the tourist season. I was blessed to have been able to see it in autumn.

Me and my fiancee were in Paleokastritsa in hotel close to the monastery so it wasn't problem for us, but first time gates were closed. Its beautiful place, on the top of the mountain. There is a museum (free access), garden, and quite lot of cats :) There is a special path to the viewpoint under the cross, there is nice view on the bay, you can take there an amazing photos.

The church itself is small and absololutely stunning with many icons dating back several centuries. Whilst maintaining respect, you can take photographs inside the church. Tours from all over the island stop at the monastery so visits are time restricted if you take a coach trip. Most trips allow you 30 minutes to look around and this is because of minimum parking for coaches. Do buy the photograph which you will have taken as you enter the monastery as a lovely momento of your visit. The photographs are available on a board just outside the entrance and are well worth the 4 euros. Toilet facilities are available and are immaculately clean and modern. Enjoy.

In this respect we were not at all disappointed. What was unexpected were the massive tour buses muscling their way around the narrow twisted mountain roads, pushing autos and taxicabs alike out of their path. It was pretty wild and exciting, especially when we got to the top and had find a place to park! A friend was driving and deserves a medal for not scraping the rental even once. The rental agent showed us all the scrapes from previous rental drivers. The monastery was serene and cool amidst all the crowds. We walked through the quiet portals, passing all the kitties along the way. We then walked the path out along the ridge to see the beautiful scenery below us. It was a very different and unexpected experience. Personally, it was the drive! No entry fee required. We learned of a great place to eat nearby called Taverna To Steki.

The museum is very interesting and the whole place has a lovely serenity about it, definitely worth a visit but I would recommend that you go for opening in the morning as by lunch it is very, very busy.",Sep 2015

Greece,MickeyThePikey,Paleokastritsa Monastery,2.0,"The only positives about this place are the views, the architecture and that its free to get in.

Its far too busy with coach load after coach load of tourists being dumped off and loads of people selling cheap souvenirs.

The monks ""rescue"" cats, but they don't extend any charity toward them other than giving them a place to stay - We witnessed them being fed with food unsuitable for cats. Also, if you are going to have so many cats around the place, how about putting a few cat trays down? The whole place REEKED of cat urine.

The location is superb, we drove up and I could imagine it would be quite a steep walk if on foot. The photographic points for the surrounding area are terrific.

Greece,Yoav K,Paleokastritsa Monastery,2.0,After a very difficult driving up the mountain on the worst roads I ever saw we reached the monastery.The truth is that the monastery was not the objective of climbing the mountain by car. It was closed an no sign of anybody to ask what is going on. So if you wish to visit it find out before hand when is open and actually if it is worth the effort.But in reality you will climb the mountain for the panoramic view of part of the island and not for the monastery.Do the climb and don't be disappointed about the monastery.Outside the monastery I saw no restaurant.,Sep 2015

Paleokastritsa has very pretty bays but you climb in the car up to the Monastery, there is ample parking just outside the gate. Lovely views from the top, and don't forget you will need to cover your shoulders and arms to enter the Monastery although covers will be provided if you need to borrow anything.

There is no charge to enter, no charge for the shawl, no charge to walk the grounds, and no charge to enjoy the magnificent views that can only be seen from these grounds.

Greece,FamilyVonTrapp6,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"Visited here while staying in Paleokastritsa. Faced with the fairly steep walk up the hill to get there, our children were reluctant to visit to say the least. However, once we got there, they were asking to visit again during our holiday, hence we went twice. Beautiful setting and gardens. Peaceful and lovely to sit in the shade and take it all in. Not keen on the taking of photos as you go in and then try to sell them to you on the way out - that is far too commercial and not at all in keeping with the spiritual and contemplative nature of the monastery. All the other little shops/stalls are fine but this I felt was a step too far. It was very interesting - it would be good if the museum could have some more information on the items in there.

Greece,StellaKapranos,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"If you go to Paleokastritsa beach, you must visit an Ortodox monastery. Being Ortodox ourselves, this was also a spiritual place to us, a place to pray, not just visit it as turists. It is surrounded by olive trees and the whole atmospere is somehow holy...

Greece,Steven D,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"Absolutely beautiful and historic. Amazing art and the location is awe isnpiring and gorgeous. Monastery's are know for some of the best land/locations in all the world; this Monastery is no different. Located on a promontory above the sea of azure blue is the backdrop for this religious outpost. White painted stone work surrounded by bright pink Bougainvillea puncuate the beauty. This monastery boasts some very delicious olive oil that is bottled on site. Buy a bottle and bring it home. Delisious and fruity. Price is very good too at $10 Euro for the large 750ml bottle(when I was there), a very good value for such a rich and delicious souvenir. You can tell the place has become a tourist trap when they snap your photo as you enter and then try and sell you a copy as you leave...too bad, too commercial at this point.

The Monastery is full of cats too!
The main chapel is beautiful and full of icons and lovely chandeliers. You can light a candle for a small contribution if you wish to say a little prayer.

Greece,mully124,Paleokastritsa Monastery,3.0,"The Monastery of Virgin Mary of Paleokastritsa is located 25 kilometers outside of the City of Corfu. This majestic monastery is home to 8 Greek Orthodox Monks who receive guidance from Bishop Efthimios Thouis. They conduct traditional masses, provide generous hospitality, and offer regular tours of the grounds and museum located within. visiting tourist will find magical qualities throughout the grounds and breathtaking scenery at every turn. All who share in the experience of the monastery seem to depart in hesitance and with hope for timely return.
The name of the Monastery Paleokastritsa is derived from a local phrase “Paleokastritissa”. This phrase was applied to the temple of Virgin Mary in the 15th century when a historic document, written on the 7th of August 1497, was recovered that referenced the temple as a “Paleokastro”. The word translates into “old castle” indicating the existence of a previous fortress constructed on the grounds pre-dating the present structures. The ruins of the castle no longer exist. In their place stands what is now the present structures that comprise the Monastery of Virgin Mary of Paleokastritsa.

One coach there when we arrived and it was easy to bypass crowd having introductory talk. Tiny church with little light and no flash permitted plus cool pleasant gardens, small museum and olive oil mill and shop with assortment of copy icons, postcards etc. Pleasant cafeteria with stunning views but for some reason electricity and water not turned on until 10.00 am so some items unavailable and no water to wash hands and flush toilets. Short walk up slope leads to tiny cemetery for previous monks then on to clifftop views, stunning. Very worthwhile, unmissable if staying in resort. By tome we left about 11,00 it was heaving, packed with coach parties so early is best and told evenings quieter too.

The monastery is small, with pleasant gardens and beautiful views, but with at least three groups of tourists the area may become very crowded. As a part of excursion, the visit was fine, but I would not go there on my own. To have a guide is fine, but it would be better if one was not too overzealous religiously – too many details on saints, icons, etc. becomes boring very fast.

Actually surprised to find so many vehicles and buses up there, and had to search for a parking space.Also surprised to find so many vendors on the walk up selling jewellery,art-work and touting tickets....but hey,that's business acumen I guess.
Just had a peek in the monastery as partner wasn't appropriately dressed and it was quite busy too.Wish we'd come at a quieter period to be honest.
However,had a wander in the delightful gardens, a cool drink in the cafe teetering on the cliff edge, and a thoroughly enjoyable stroll past the caged mini-zoo with preening peacocks,ducks,geese and other birds.At the end of this walkway is a perfect photographic viewpoint overlooking Paleo and it's famed aquamarine waters - not to be missed!

Greece,Ozfamily2014,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"We hired a taxi for 2 hours from the cruise terminal. The driver proceeded to take us up the mountain to Paleokastritsa Monastery stopping for many photo opportunities along the way. This Byzantine monastery dates back to the 13th century and was quite beautiful with colourful flowers blooming, terracotta pots and cats in the courtyard. There is also a small museum with holy books and other relics. There is no entry fee but you can make a donation especially if you light a candle. Prime position with amazing sea views. There were lots of coaches and taxis when we visited.",Jul 2014

If you have the luck to find the plants flourishing – it is a real splendor. Also the seaside view (from the cliff) is astonishing. You can buy different thing over there and also you can hear some interesting things about the history of monastery. If you are in Corfu – it’s a must visiting.",Jul 2014
Greece,K J,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"It's a bit of a walk up to the monastery but there are also coach loads of tourists going up in the buses so you have to be very careful when walking. The monastery is beautiful very peaceful despite all the tourists visiting on the day we went. You have to have your shoulders covered and they provide a scarf if you don't have one. The inside of the church is very beautiful and you can light a candle if you wish there is no charge for entry but you can make a donation. The gardens around the church are beautiful and the views from the cliff side are stunning. If staying or visiting Paleokastritsa i would recommend a visit to the Monastery and remember your camera.

Greece,blackisler2,Paleokastritsa Monastery,3.0,"Can't understand why so many reviews rave about the monastery - because they feel they have to? We visited (a family of 4) and were met by some random guy who said it was ok to go in. All you do is go up a few steps to a garden area with a number of closed doors (obviously the monks residence) then we went into where three monks were praying (they didn't look too impressed to see us) and all was very creepy (nothing serene or tranquil about it). There were lots of cats being fed and place was smelly. There was a woman sitting on a chair in the courtyard - no idea who or what her place was there. Felt a bit like stepford wives - my husband couldn't get out quick enough. I meditate but this place just made me feel creeped out and wondering what went on behind the closed doors......

Greece,Ionn,Paleokastritsa Monastery,3.0,"Very nice scenery, we took many nice pictures. However monks did not let us enter the church, because they didn't approve the amount of money we dropped in the bank for the mandatory candles. Of course they could not give us our money back either, as they couldn't know how much we actually dropped in the bank. Obviously a lose-lose situation for us. And it looks worse considering that they melt the candle and sell it again, minimizing their cost.
On top of this, is kind of impressive how much all these cats look starved. Wonder what they make with all the tourists' money.

I suggest to visit the monastery, but don't bother interacting with monks and workers too much. Also most of the products they sell (Wine, lemonchelo, honey, etc) can be found in the island's supermarkets in much lower prices; support the local community instead of the church's big pockets.

Even our driver was surprised and managed to persuade the monk at the door to let us in for a few minutes but by that point the other monks we shutting every door and herding everyone out.

We saw lots of cats which myself and my children enjoyed seeing .Outside the church bit I remembered to stop taking photos out of respect from something I read in a guide book but some people carried on. It was nice to be able to light a candle and sit and reflect. It wasn't too busy when we went but I am surprised they let coach loads in.

Beautiful place, magnificent views (and don't forget to do the path to St. Nicholas' Hill), grapes on the trellises, bougainvillea and the smell of basil everywhere, the church itself is small but beautiful. There is also an old oil press to visit and a small but very interesting (free museum) which shouldn't be missed.
I took my time strolling up to the monastery in the mid-day August heat - it wasn't too bad and got to stop and enjoy the views on the way.",Aug 2014
Greece,arborfieldman,Paleokastritsa Monastery,5.0,"What an amazing contrast between the commercialised beach/restaurant area at the foot of the mound and the calm tranquillity of the monastery at the top. Luckily you can drive up as the steep climb in the heat would not be that pleasant, although if going as a penitent sinner you should probably walk up. The road has a traffic light system to ensure you don't meet someone going the other way; lucky as negotiating the bends and looking at the view and changing gear on your hire car would all be too risky if you also had to think about meeting someone head on. After walking past the stalls selling tat you arrive at the gate to the monastery and into a completely different world. The buildings themselves would be attractive but some hand or hands have planted bougainvillea, ferns and numerous other plants all over the place with a very skilled eye for colour and garden design. As a result there are photo opportunities around every corner from the covered walkway past the olive oil press, up the steps to the famous gate with its three bells and into the courtyard. At the end of it you should feel more relaxed, calm and maybe even a bit spiritual. Unlike other reviewers I only saw one cat (perhaps they have had a cull ;-) so don't go if you just want to take lots of cute cat pics to post on your facebook page!

There is an aide on the way in giving out sarongs for all ladies to cover shoulders and legs and you can give him a euro or two on the way out for his trouble. There is a little museum room with paintings on wall, the centre of which is dominated by a glass case of whale bones. There is also a olive press room but nothing is really labelled clearly so we just had a quick walk round here. The gardens outside are lovely, lots of flowers and foliage....and cats!!

The church had the most beautiful painted celling and old paintings. I particularly liked the little museum where they had the bones of a whale and lots of old clothing, scriptures and furniture the monks used to use. They seem to be a little sanctuary for the local cats and their kittens, they were adorable. Very worth while little excursion.

Greece,PandYUk,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"The walk up the hill, though steepish, is not particularly long or arduous and the Monastery is a lovely place to visit - if you go off-season and early or late. If not, it tends to get swamped by coach loads of trippers and all sense of the peace of the place can be lost.
Assuming you arrive before the coaches do, the Monastery has the spiritual quality you would expect, along with some stunning views out to sea, and pleasant walks through the surrounding grounds. The chapel has artwork and silver ornamentation, the external walkways are full of flowers and herbs - and there are dozens of cats [cute if you like cats].The souvenir shop isn't extortionate though the cafe might be to some.
Perhaps makes sense to go earlyish then walk back down to the bay for a stroll and an early lunch in one of the tavernas overlooking the sea - though if you walk further to the next bay you'll find good food at cheaper prices.

An old lady opened the monastery for me and signed to show me how to light a candle and plant it in the sand. You can donate what ever you want, it goes to help the upkeep of the monastery.

Fussing the three dogs at the top of the hill was our main pastime whilst waiting. One of the dogs was a puppy, approx 4 months old, lovely black fluffy thing. Anyway, 3pm arrived, and 4 priests duly congregated outside the monastery. The young black puppy approached one of the priests, and which point he kicked it! Hard enough for it to tumble over several times. I was disgusted and I think they realised! They all thought it funny and proceeded to laugh at the event. I didn't go inside the monastery. What a hypocrite! So much for the puppy being one of god's creatures! Disgusting man! I will never go back!

Greece,duck8to,Paleokastritsa Monastery,4.0,"The Byzantine Monastery of the Virgin Mary (Panagra) was founded in 1228 AD and lies 25 km or 16 miles northwest of Corfu. The 4 miles leading to the monastery are lush with olive trees, narrow, steep and winding at times but this is why there are so many spectacular views. It's an active monastery presided over by Bishop Efthimious Thouis and 8 Greek Orthodox monks. The monks keep their routine despite the tourist crowds.and conduct traditional masses at regularly scheduled times. The monks welcome all irregardless of their beliefs. The grounds have well kept colorful gardens which offer photo opportunities. Since the monastery sits atop a mountain the views of the sea and surrounding area are spectacular. A small but very interesting museum is free and displays jewel-encrusted silver bound bible, Icons (Dormition of the virgin Mary), St. George and the Dragon and a carved wooden piece depicting the Tree of Life. There is also a prehistoric skeleton of a mammoth. The gift shop sells olive oil made by the monks as well as wine and other gifts. An added threat are the wonderful family run travernas nearby.

Greece,Ivan Kinsmam,Church of Saint Dimitrios - Patron of Thessaloniki,4.0,"I woukd not include Thessaloniki o8n 9my tour agenda.

The town resembles an Italian Rimini i.e. an industrial moden town full of parked cars and traffic. Apart from a half-decent Roman ruin and the seafront tower, this is the only site worth visiting.

The oldest church in Greece, it incorporates some Roman pillars and waa also a mosque during Ottoman rule. A merchant - who traded with Venice - bribed the Turks to let Christians secretly use a side chapel in the church for one hour every Sunday, and his remains lie in the church.

The remains of St Dimitrios were only returned 8 years ago and are now much venerated.

So, overall an impressive interior makes up for the lack of other atttractions. The city even spent EUR 13 million on a new Town Hall which looks like a square block.

Greece,Carol A S,Church of Saint Dimitrios - Patron of Thessaloniki,5.0,"The Church of Saint Demetrius (a.k.a. Hagios Demetrios) is dedicated to Saint Demetrius, the patron saint of Thessaloniki (formerly the second largest city of the Byzantine Empire). Demetrius was a Christian Roman soldier who was imprisoned in a Roman bath formerly on this site. He was executed in 306 by order of Emperor Galerius (who persecuted many early Christians). The bath was replaced by a church in the early 4th century, which was replaced by a larger, three-aisled basilica about a century later. The basilica was replaced by a five-aisled basilica in 629–634 (appearing much as it is today). St. Demetrius' martyrdom site is now a large crypt underneath the church. His remains are in a beautiful wood and silver reliquary (called a ciborium). The basilica has six mosaics from the 7th century depicting St. Demetrius with church officials and with children. Thessaloniki became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1430, and in 1493 Bayezid II converted the church into the Kasımiye Camii (mosque), plastering over the frescoes and mosaics. In 1913 the basilica reverted to a Christian church after the Greek conquest. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 destroyed the roof and upper walls of the basilica, which was restored in the 1940s by Greek and Nazi German authorities. Artifacts from archaeological excavations in the 1930s and 1940s appear in a small museum inside the church's crypt. The Church of Saint Demetrius was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. The church is open from 6am-10pm every day (the crypt is open 8am-2pm Wed-Mon). There is no entry fee, although a donation is gratefully appreciated.

There are still fragments of earlier mosaics that have survived the big fire in 1917 which our excellent guide Yanni took the trouble of pointing out. There is a small structure on the left aisle too where the faithful pray and pay their respects to the patron saint of Thessaloniki - Dimitrios. At the end of this aisle is a silver casket containing relics. Too bad we didn't have time to visit the crypt.

Dimitrios, or Sfantul Mare Mucenic Dimitrie) is one of the most important Orthodox Christian saints and the patron saint of the city, since the times when Thessaloniki was the second city of Byzantine Empire. The Church of Agios Dimitrios was built on top of the Roman Bath where, according to the tradition, the saint was imprisoned and martyred. So, for a Christian, visiting this church has also a very spiritual dimension.

The building is quite impressive and the crypt is amazing. Be sure you visit it, is not very well signaled. It is right under the transept and the entrance is on the right side.

The entrance is free but you may want to check the opening hours. Also, some reading before visiting can add a lot to the experience.

Greece,Asiyah Noemi K,Church of Saint Dimitrios - Patron of Thessaloniki,5.0,"Church of Agios Dimitrios is a beautiful monumental church, located in the very heart of Thessaloniki. The church is beautiful both from the outside and from the inside. Inside it is richly decorated with spectacular Byzantine mosaics. The history of the church and Saint Demetrius is extremely interesting.
Saint Demetrius or Agios Dimitrios, (208 AD-303 AD) is the patron saint of Thessaloniki. He was the son of a wealthy military commander of Thessaloniki and received a good education as a child. He also joined the army and became an officer. When he was young, he decided to secretly baptized Christian, something forbidden those years.
When his father died, the Roman Emperor Maximian ordered him to chase and kill the Christians of Thessaloniki. Dimitrios refused to do so and revealed his faith. He was asked to change his religious beliefs but refused once again and expressed his disgust for idolatry. Therefore, he was put to prison, was tortured and died for his God. Before he died, he donated all his wealth to the poor. His bravery and sacrifice made him an Orthodox saint. Later years people built a small church on the martyrdom of Agios Dimitrios. Over the years the church has become magnificent and significant.
The Ottomans made Agios Dimitrios a mosque, and plastered over frescoes that were again revealed after the 1913 Greek reconquest. While the city's devastating fire of 1917 was very damaging, five 8th-century mosaics survive, spanning the altar.
The martyrdom site is now an underground crypt. The Crypt and underground site is especially interesting place. Saint Dimitrios relics occupy a silver reliquary inside.
His grave was said to be miraculous and thousands of pilgrims were coming every year to pay their honors.
What to say, magnificent.

Greece,Ioannis K,Church of Saint Dimitrios - Patron of Thessaloniki,4.0,"Repeatedly gutted by fires, the church eventually was reconstructed as a five-aisled basilica in 629–634. This was the surviving form of the church much as it is today.
The church had an unusual shrine called the ciborium, a hexagonal, roofed structure at one side of the nave. It was made of silver. Unusually, it did not hold any physical relics of the saint. The ciborium seems to have been a symbolic tomb. It was rebuilt at least once.Nave with rests of applicated light and dark fields of the arches
The basilica is famous for six extant mosaic panels, dated to the period between the latest reconstruction and the inauguration of the Iconoclastic policies in 730. These mosaics, depicting St. Demetrius with officials responsible for the restoration and with children, represent rare examples of art surviving from the Dark Age that followed Justinian's death. An inscription below one of the images glorifies heaven for saving the people of Saloniki from a pagan Slavic raid in 612.
Other magnificent mosaics, recorded as covering the church interior, were lost either during the four centuries when it functioned as a mosque (1493–1912) or in the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 that destroyed much of the city. It also destroyed the roof and upper walls of the church. Following the Great Fire of 1917, it took decades to restore the church. Archeological excavations conducted in the 1930s and 1940s revealed interesting artifacts that may be seen in a museum situated inside the church's crypt. The excavations also uncovered the ruins of a Roman bath, where St. Demetrius was said to have been held prisoner and executed. A Roman well was also discovered. Scholars believe this is where soldiers dropped the body of St. Demetrius after his execution. After restoration, the church was reconsecrated in 1949.

First of all, it's an outstanding place for pilgrims from all over the world. Millions of people come every year to the tomb of Saint Dimitrios where his body is emanating Miro and a fantastic fragrance. For me, as an orthodox Christian is the most important part.

Besides religious reasons, there are many other reasons to visit the church. It would be very nice for people interested in history, Greek culture, architecture, and why not, the modern life of Greeks.

The celebration of S. Dimitrios is on the 26th of October. If you have the possibility to join this HOLIDAY (yes, the entire city of Thessaloniki is celebrating) you will definitely be impressed by this huge event!

As I said in another review it is recommended that you read some history of the place before ypu actually make the visit.
Inside you can pray at Saint Dimitrios and put some candles for the people you are praying.
If you like history you may like the six mosaic panels, which still exist before the 8th century.
Under the church there are some catacombs, which were in the beginning some roman bath. Later in the name of Saint Dimitrios it was made the first church in the beginning of the 4th century.
The first small church was pater replaced by a bigger one. The church was destroyed and rebuilt more times because of the historical condition. Anyway you can learn its history by simply visiting it.
If you visit for the church for its history of for religious reasons, I believe you'll enjoy the place.

It doesn’t have the same pompousness as some of the Catholic churches we have seen; on the other hand, upon closer inspection, you do see what great care went into the decoration of the church.

A lot of the more decorative elements are hidden in nooks and crannies, which makes walking around a nice, peaceful experience.

What was also a special experience is to visit the crypt, so in case it is open, do take a gander, as it contains some relics from the 4th/5th century.

The present-day restored form of the church – which was destroyed almost completely in the fire of 1917 – is the result of extensive restoration works that began in 1918 and ended in 1948.
The tomb of the saint is located in the NW corner, where it was believed to have stood in the Early-Christian era. The church, dedicated to the patron saint of Thessaloniki, is a pilgrim church and is primarily renowned for its mosaics that survived the great fire of 1917. Eleven votive mosaics of the 5th, 7th and 9th century are preserved at the two pillars of the sanctuary and at the western wall of the central aisle.

It is accessible bt taxi or bus and if you are game you can walk there from the city centre which is what we did on this trip. It is well worth the walk.

This whole area is just beautiful! Above the water and under it!!

But.. this is no “hidden gem”, it is very crowded! There were barely any spots to sit of lay down, and that while we were quite late in the season. It only started to be a little less crowded when the sun started to get low.

(You can rent sunbeds from the taverna above but you have to be lucky because it very busy). Take a snorkelling mask with you for sure :)",Aug 2021
Greece,Elena A,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"The beach is amazing! You can sit at the beach bar and enjoy a magical view. Swimming here is not the easiest thing to do, specially if there are waves but from one side is a bit easier and totally worth it! One of the best spots of Zakynthos.",Aug 2021
Greece,David D,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"Wednesday 21st July and we visited this very remote beach. It is situated in an inlet along the western coast of the Island, Agios Leon is nearby.

It is in such a picturesque setting flanked on either side by rugged coastline with mountains as a backdrop all surrounding crystal clear blue seas.

As well as swimming it us a popular spot for snorkeling and diving.

Think it would be more accurate to call this a swimming lagoon rather than a beach, as there is no beach.

There are some sunbeds available for hire this are dotted around on ledges and concrete platforms along the headland. Space is really at a premium here and people  can be found spread out on their towels all over the place, it was really busy.

We did climb down the man-made stone steps to a concrete platform where people were launching themselves from into the beautiful blue waters below. For the more adventurous they were climbing up on to the rocks and diving & jumping into the sea.

There is a Taverna which rents out sunbeds and there is also Scuba Diving Centre.

Greece,Losha K,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"NOTE: please go early to experience the beauty this place has to offer! Me and my girlfriend went by quad early in the morning (around 9:00) and the drive there was long but very beautiful. Upon arrival we could chose nice sun-beds for €5 pp. At this time there were not many people so it was really quiet and peaceful! Via a small rock path down you can reach the water (take some rock shoes with you, it’s better than bare feet). The water was simply astonishing, very clear and blue and there were nice caves and clean rocks. We went with diving gear and to see the most the Porto Limnionas has to offer I really recommend doing the same. There were beautiful fishes and the raw underwater nature was breathtaking. Around 12:00 the masses of people started coming and it became too busy.
I definitely recommend this for everyone!

The view is amazing and the water crystal clear. It is possible to hire masks and snorkels if you don’t take your own. It does get busy - even off season - we arrived around 11am and had a reasonable choice of places to sit... people arrived at lunchtime and were disappointed. We spent a whole day here and enjoyed chilling on comfy loungers with lots of shade. The staff are keeping everything super-clean and washing each bed down when a guest leaves. The walk down to the water has been made easy with steps! Definitely recommend wearing swim shoes and if you don’t have any pick some up in one of the tourist shops for around €6. There’s ‘at sunbed’ service and the taverna serves reasonably priced, tasty food.

Greece,Gabriela,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"I can say that this beach is the most beautiful place in Zakhyntos in my opinion. The beach is terraced by the length of a sunbed, the shade made by the umbrellas is reinforced by pines tree planted very often on each level. The view over the sea is invaluable, and the clear water washing the rocks invites you to jump in . In the mountains that border the water there are many caves with smooth access for the curious and for the daring ones there are also some crevices to explore. the price of two sunbeds with table and parasol is 8 €, drinks and food are ordered separately. To the cautious I confess that the staff wears protective masks and the sunbeds are cleaned with disinfectant. There is also a tavern with typical Greek food, tasty at an affordable price. But I will write a separate opinion about the tavern. For now, I'm talking about the beach and the water; I can almost say that I came to Zakintos a second time to get to this wonderful place. Wearing special water shoes, my husband and the children walked on the rocks and ""picked"" sea salt. I think you understand that I like this place more than the 5 stars I can give it 😃 To the beauty of the place I can add the road through the mountain villages and then leave behind the villages covering the last kilometers on the tops of the mountains small vegetation specific to heights . Live long, Enjoy life !!!

Get there early as beds fill up fast, after 11 am you may well have a long wait. Cove is good for strong swimmers as water is quite deep.

Greece,angusM25,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"This stunning rocky cove falls away to clear turquoise water and is a favourite location for snorkelling.

It is however a steep walk down to the cove and once there, difficult access the sea; many seemed to have difficulties getting out of the water because of the slimy rocks, and a few suffered minor grazes and scrapes.

This is a place unsuitable for those with even minor mobility restrictions.

At the taverna overlooking the sea, the sharing plate was excellent value and enough for two to enjoy as a lunch.

With a monopoly on this site, the taverna could make so much more of the attraction with some attention to the sea access, some hand rails and making the lounger area more sophisticated.

There are loungers and parasols for hire and for those who do not wish to eat at the taverna, a beach bar area where snacks and drinks can be taken away.

Come early as the car park and taverna are very popular.

On the top there is a small taverna with several sunbeds and umbrellas, often very busy during summer time. The water is not properly calm because the current from NNW in open sea but a jump is always possible for everyone able to swim as the bottom starts from 5 meters. There is no sand, only a rock platform to jump from and sometimes it is not very easy to climb back: sea shoes or small fins are strictly recommended. The very clean and transparent water is crossed by fresh water from underground aquifers which cause several thermoclines very cold. In August the water temperature was around 25 and 27 °C.

We got directly in the water with the snorkel mask, but there wasn't much to see as the water was blury because all of the sun protection in it.

Greece,Cris1963,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"I am the kind of guy who doesn't take five-stars reviews at face value. In this case I would recommend, don't take the 1-star reviews at face value, or you may miss a good place.
This place is a small cove, flanked by steep rocks, with clear, green-and-blue water: all in all a great place for swimming. It's also good for snorkeling: the sea bottom is nothing special but you can see fishes.
You can certainly find coves as good as this one, and less crowded, if you have a boat and navigate the coast a little; if you haven't one, this is probably as good as it gets on Zakynthos.
Now, let's come to the minus points:
It's crowded. Yes. As any other beautiful place on a Greek island in full summer. If you know what to expect, no minus point. If you look for quiet, solitary places, it's not for you.
You will probably have to park your car at the road side. Yes, but the road only leads to this beach, so there is no through traffic, no problem.
The road is dangerous. Not really. Narrow, windy and in bad condition yes, like most other roads on the island. Again, it's a Greek island, you know what to expect.
Additional information:
The public is made of young people for a good part. Lively, but not disturbing.
Access to the sea is obviously difficult, it's a rocky cove. Water is deep, and the combination is not ideal for small children. I am still pondering if the taverna owners should build small platforms and stairs to access the water, since the taverna building spoils the natural spot already. I'm not sure - and perhaps doing such things is outright forbidden. However my 10-year old son, a good swimmer, spent the whole day in the water and had to be dragged out with promises of ice-creams. As well, it may not be ideal for older people.
I found the water pleasantly chill, other friends found it outright cold.
If you want to stay comfortable you can rent sunbeds at the taverna, they are nice and under sunshades.
The taverna is well kept and is ok for an ice cream or a slice of cake. However don't waste your time and eat a full meal there, because the level of their cuisine is tourist fast-food.

Greece,Andrew,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"To get to this beach, you will need a car. The route to this beach is stunning and a bit scary. It is narrow, very steep with lots of twists and turns. The sea is in a lovely blue colour. You will know when you are near because you will see cars parked in parallel by the side of the road which also makes it very difficult to pass especially when there is another car coming. There is a car park but it will full, hence parking by the side of the road. We did try to find a parking space but it meant a long walk and where we would have parked, it didn’t look that safe so we decided to pass and go on to the next beach which is less than 1 mile away. I can only image it must be good with so many people wanting to go. My advice is to get there early to ensure you get a parking space.

Greece,Laurenlo,Porto Limnionas Beach,1.0,"Not at all what I expected, but stunning all the same. There is no beach or spots to really sunbathe other than large concrete slabs above the water that are very uncomfortable to lie on (bring cushions if you can!). If you're just looking to swim then you will love it as the water is incredibly clear and beautiful for pictures. There are caves to snorkel in and explore.

If you're looking for a day spent sunbathing, you can rent the sunbeds at the top near the restaurant but they cost 5 euro for one or 4 euro for two for the day (up until 19h30). They are quite far up and its a bit of a trek to get down to the water again along a rocky hilltop so it's not ideal for quick dips in-between sunbathing.

Having been here myself and paid for the sunbeds, I'd recommend stopping by here for a swim and a snorkel and then heading onwards to Porto Roxa to relax on the free sunbeds and day beds overlooking the ocean. There is also a jumping board here where you can dive into the water. Much better value for money!

****Porto Limnionas also closes at 19h30 so its NOT a place to watch the sunset unfortunately.

It is quite a long drive off the main road on narrow lanes to get to this beach.

You have to drive down this narrow winding road to get there. There are two options to experience this cove ...either relaxing ""resort style"" with a taverna, sun beds and waiters catering to your needs or going it your own and finding a spot either on top of a couple of abandoned buildings or on the rocks themselves, not very relaxing. you cannot bring your own food. be very careful getting out of the water, some of the smooth rocks are slippery

It was very busy, noisy with no space to sit and relax. Also, it was also very difficult to find a parking space as the road is very narrow. This is not an organised beach (or a beach) so you will be walking (or seating) on rocks with only a small area covered with cement that you can actually lay down.

Got there about 9:30 am, probably was the first person swimming in blue crystal waters of Porto Limnionas that morning. It took me nearly an hour to get there from Tsilivi, it is worth it. Could spend there a whole day as there are sunbeds on territory of tavern facing the sea, snacks and drinks are served there as well.
A couple of small caves are hidden in the sea.
I was impressed with Porto Limnionas.",Sep 2018

The staff from taverna are really the opposite of greek people. They are rude and the first thing they told you when you arrive is “sunbed are 4 or 5€ each, you are not allowed with your drinks or food and we close at 7”. Hey...wait? What? Pfff usually greek people are very friendly and welcomes you everytime. NOT HERE.",Sep 2018
Greece,John T,Porto Limnionas Beach,1.0,"Such a shame. This spot used to be beautiful and relaxing. Unfortunately. It’s all about money making now. If you come here come early. The staff run around with walkie talkies and make sure everyone pays 4 Euro per sun bed. All they want if your money. They are keen to go on and on about you not being allowed to take your own food or drink. The sea is difficult to get In to. It’s now rammed with other tourists who are selfish and spread out all over the steps headed down. The restaurant isn’t cheap. Plus the quicker you sit down they quicker the staff hover to get you to finish.

We won’t be coming here again. It’s no longer a beautiful relaxing spot it once was.

Greece,Helen M,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"This is a must see trip when you go to this island. The view and water here is phenomenal! I must admit knowing the island very well the road can be very tricky and you must be a very good driver to make this trip. It's also about a 3-40 min drive from the city center. I highly doubt buses go there, I did not see any during our time there.
It does NOT have a sandy beach and if you want to go in the water you have to jump off the rocks to get in and climb the rocks to get out - so not ideal for low level swimmers.
There is one restaurant on sight and it was PHENOMENAL! Read the review about the restaurant - under restaurant review.

Greece,JoseNCL,Porto Limnionas Beach,2.0,"Personally, didn’t find this anything special. Super dangerous road, super tiny place - no where free to sit or lay a towel. People stay either in the tavern deck chair on platforms which are well arranged but always full, or they stay uncomfortably on roofs of old buildings and platforms- unsafe and disgusting. Crystal clear water although getting in and out is a pain as you have to climb rocks or jump from old concrete platforms. The cove is pretty and it certainly deserves to be better arranged including safe ways to enter/leave the water and safe road access. As with most coves in the island - better to visit in a fresher quieter day to enjoy the tavern food and views rather than attempt to go for swimming or catching the sun.

Greece,abamf,Porto Limnionas Beach,3.0,"Drove from Laganas to this beach because of the hype. The route a road into this from Laganas is a nightmare. Google maps does a fantastic job but there are some points where you drive through tiny alleys. Also the last few miles are on a scary super snakey road with some pretty big drops a few feet away. Im a pretty confident driver (I drive in all countries) but this was pretty tense. Also the brakes started to smell by the endm that's how knarly it is. (although it was a fiat tipo). The path down to the ""beach"" is also quite steep and nasty. I wasn't worried about us falling but there wad a big guy behind me who was struggling and if he went he would've wiped us out as well. Once we made it down to the bottom it was packed ith absolutely nowhere to put towels maybe on a quite day you could grab somewhere flat to lay your towel but that's about it. So the water itself is lovely and clear but then there are loads of places like this in Zante. We found the water here quite cold compared with all others places we swam. WE stayed for a quick snorkel and then decided it wasn't really worth the hassle. There is a café/bar at the top in the car park but it was full and the guy on the door trying to manage the waiting times and slots was a moron and I coild tell that it would be at least 30 mins before we would get seated. On the way out we took the road to the left. Although it was longer it was a lot safer. My view, I wouldn't bother in silly season and its still only a maybe in the quite season. If you really want to swim in beautiful water then hire a boat for the day from Keri for 100 euros and drive out to the lighthouse there are loads of amazing coves with only a few boats in each one with fantastic snorkelling.

Greece,Kelvin T,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"With a car hired for a couple of days this was one of our first destinations to visit. Bit of a twisting, steep, narrow road to get there but was worth it, parking can be tight and you have to be creative sometimes. There are loungers/parasols to hire but we followed the steps down to the cove and found a place to leave our stuff while we got changed into swimming gear. The water is so blue and inviting we could not wait to get in. Water was very refreshing, clear, deep but calm. Super fun snorkelling around the cove, lots of fish to see. As you swim out a bit the water does get noticeably colder but was very pleasant on such a hot day. There is not much shade down here and the Sun was strong so best to visit once you have a base tan but it is a really inspiring place and worth venturing out to. Great little Taverna here as well.

You might want to wear good walking shoes or even better if you have swimming shoes, beacause the way to the water is very steep and rocky and there is no proper stairs. Good place to learn snorkling, beacause you can reach the bottom at the left end of the bay. I think you can even buy/rent snorkling equipment from there.

There's a taverna at the top of the cliffs and steps leading down to old boat houses which double as sun lounges now! The steps are pretty precarious but it's well worth the 'climb' down to the bay.
As with most of the west coast of Zakynthos the water is a beautiful azure blue and so clear you feel you can touch the bottom despite the depth.
We were out of peak season so it was pretty quiet but judging by the taverna's size and sunbed area, this place would seem to be pretty busy at times in the summer

We stayed for an hour or so just to soak in the views and take a couple of snaps and then went on to Porto Roxa which was nowhere as lovely as this little cove

Greece,MrDantes,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"One of the better views in the island. The best photos and videos happen between 10:00 and 14:00, because earlier and later the cliffs throw shadow over the water. The water is clean and is awesome to go in with a mask. There are nice cliffs to jump from, but beware of underwater cliffs too. There are some basic steps created over the rocks so you can go down from the restaurant to the water, but could be a bit difficult for people who have trouble walking.

The restaurant's staff is very helpful and gave us info about stuff in the menu and advice for our scooter bike :) I recommend this place to people who like diving from cliffs.

People recommended for us another beautiful place that is right behind the rocks to the South. If you are good at swimming, you will have no problem going to that heaven.

Another reminder: Some rocks are sharp, so carry some swimming shoes with you.

Greece,Bob B,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"We have been coming to Zante for about 12 years but had never come across Limnionas before. It was recommended to us by our Greek host so when we had a car for the day we made a point of finding it. Although it is safe with care, the road to the port/beach is not for the faint-hearted being narrow with tight bends and steep drops, however, everyone we encountered drove sensibly and with care.
Parking is tight at the site but there is an overspill area to the right which you might have to look out for as it isn't obvious at first.
The cafe/restaurant at the top of the walk down is very good indeed with a variety of dishes from a variety of Greek bread with very tasty topping to full meals. They do emphasize they are a restaurant and don't provide toasties etc. but we still found sufficient light bites and fries to suit us.
The walk down to the cove from the restaurant is steep and would not really suit the elderly or people with walking difficulties. Once down at the rocky shore it is easy to get into the water to swim in a lovely setting.
Views from the top of Limnionas are beautiful and the whole area is just wonderfully typical Zante. It's a must see!

Greece,Rosalind_87,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"Very scenic place which is great for swimming. The cove is quite big and the water is deep but was calm whilst we were there. There are caves and little coves to explore especially if you enjoy snorkelling. The cove itself is quite a steep walk down from the car park and the Tavern, people with restricted mobility might struggle.

There is a Tavern at the top which has a car park and has luxury sunbeds. These get taken very quickly and therefore getting there early is a must. The sunbeds vary in price (we paid 8 euros for two). They are also quite strict about bringing your own drinks or food. The sunbeds that we managed to get had an amazing view looking out over the cove and sea. We also ate at the Tavern which was quite nice. Porto Limnionas is a definitely a place that you could stay all day if you desired.

Greece,Marianna K,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"No words about those wonderful waters, you can't avoid falling in love with them... It's really worth it to stay all day long and enjoy the sea and the sun. Sunbeds are very value-for-money (3€/sunbed, ok prices for coffee and beverages, stay from early in the morning till 19.00), but the restaurant over the beach unfortunately has worsened its quality over time (I am zakynthian and I've been visiting this place since I was a child, the food was much better back then).
In conclusion, if you are looking for crystal clear waters and a little bit of adventure plus a relaxing nap under the trees, Porto Limnionas is a must in Zakynthos!

Beautiful blue waters to cool you off after the trip out, a wonderful restaurant with friendly staff at the top. We only stayed a few hours and for us that was perfect.

Greece,Evren34,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"This is a very nice place to spend time before noon. The water was beautiful. It's a bit tricky to enter the water from the rocks but it's manageable, even for kids. There has been waves in the sea after noon, so best before noon time, possibly early in the morning to avoid the crowd. There is only one restaurant, which also rents sun beds but their number is limited, so if you have an umbrella, it's a good idea to take it with you. There are no showers. The food served in the restaurant is good but a bit expensive (we paid €100 for 4 adults and two kids). Overall, it's definitely worth visiting, especially if you love swimming in crystal clear waters.

Greece,MattB,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"We're current holidaying in Zante and decided to visit Limnionas and it didn't disappoint!!
It's a beautiful little cove! But be aware that's exactly what it is- a rocky cove so there's no beach to lounge on. However there is a lovely taverna there which owns lots of Sunbeds on the Rocky hillside, and at 6 Euro for two it is very well priced. The taverna is reasonably priced too- we had a 3 course meal (3 of us) for 50 euro's.

Main tip- get there early as it does get very busy as the day goes on and if you don't have sunbeds it could get uncomfortable (especially if you have young children). We arrived about 11.30am and were quite lucky to get 2 sunbeds.
It is well worth the trip though- very scenic, water beautiful, and brilliant for snorkelling (even though there's not a fantastic array of fish, but then there isn't really anywhere in the Mediterranean that compares to places like the Red Sea etc).

Would recommend beach shoes, it's gets very slippery on the rocks. And if you don't fancy swimming all the time, take a pool inflatable with, and you can float for hours 😀. The water is really deep, so you aren't able to stand. Not recommended for children. Steep climb up to restaurant and loungers, and no place for them to play. There is restaurant on site with toilets, and lounger service for both food and drinks. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Zante.

Greece,Emce02,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"We had a very restful day at Porto Limnionas. Suggest you arrive early to secure parking and sunbeds in a place that you would like to be. We were there on a very hot day so it was good to be under a tree that kept us in shade all day. This is not a place for young children or for the very aged or infirm. The walk down to the water is steep and rocky. Getting into the water is tricky - it is slippery on the rocks and it is more of a slide and splash type of entry - well at least for me it was! Water, I think, is slightly colder than the other beaches we went to. It is, however a lovely spot to have a rest. You cannot take food or drink with you as the tavern owns the beach. They don't appear to mind you having water. Throughout the day they come around to offer drinks, food and ice creams etc. They take your order, bring your order back to you and then you pay. It is lovely. For lunch and or dinner you can go up to the restaurant. Fish is not cheap but it was fresh and beautifully cooked. We enjoyed our meal and there are lots of things to eat that range in price. The only negative was the manager who appeared to be n a constant state of agitation and yelling at the calm and efficient waiters who seemed to never stop. His demeanor impinged on the quietness and feeling of calm and rest. Fortunately once we had enjoyed our meal we could return to our sunbeds.

Greece,K8teep9,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"We took a drive here to visit, and it's surely a beautiful cove with crystal clear waters. However, we got there at around mid-day and the place was already heaving with people, no sun beds spare and very little space to set up a camp on the rocks. The restaurant was busy and seemed a little chaotic, the waiters there seemed friendly enough though. We didn't try the food but had a quick drink before setting off to find somewhere we could leave our belongings for a quick swim.
The water is deep and cold but that was quite welcome considering the soaring temperature. It's not a place for young children at all, I'd consider it pretty unsafe for those who aren't steady on their feet.
I'd definitely go again and arrive early, possibly by 9am in order to find a sun bed as it did look a comfortable terrace with lovely views.

Greece,Flavio B,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"Ok. I went from Akrotiri to Porto Limnionas by bike. It took me 3 hours and it was really worthy!
Allow me to make a clear separation here:
The place itself: the nature is fantastic! you can swimm to a little cavern and back without a problem. Some people do snorkeling because on the bottom there are some nice little fish. The sorroundings are amazing and there is nothing I can really complain.

Porto Limnionas Tavern is a different story!
First everything is overpriced because there is no other option there. You need to fight or wait for a very long time to get and rent a long chaise. There is no proper place to leave you junk, specially if you are not by car.
The food is nothing exceptional... barely good. I ordered a Suvlaki and got something else. Salad was not good and service not really friendly, specially those in charge ofthe long chaises. In this case I advise to bring your own food and find a nice spot to eat it.
If you go by bike, be sure you have a nice physical condition and at least 6 liters of water with you. :-D The views are unique and extremely peaceful.

Best thing about it is u can sit under the umbrellas and over look the Porto Limnionas it's a view alright . Bonus is there parking and a restaurant here to have lunch and it's great. Must visit them both u won't regret it.,Jul 2016

Greece,jar0996,Porto Limnionas Beach,1.0,"We ate at the restaurant and the food was superb with fantastic views. Spent over 50 euros.

The time was approaching 15:30 so we decided to sit on the sun beds to watch the sunset. A girl came up and stated that we had to pay for the beds. We declined as it was late so sat on a wall while some friends went down to look at the sea. Again the girl came over and stated that I wasn't allowed to sit on the wall as I hadn't paid for sun beds.

So what started off as a nice day turned into a hellish day. Will not be returning.

Greece,stretch,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"A real surprise! Someone recommended we visit it to see the sea from this side, but we were not ready for the breathtaking view and scenery.

After a steep decent you see greeted with a lovely piece of beach/sea that you can swim in, sunbeds, and a restaurant offering great food with a spectacular view!!

This is, without a doubt, a must see on your visit to Zakynthos. I do recommend that you rage enough cash with, because of the remote location paying with a card does not always work as this depends on a flimsy internet connection.

Greece,Lorripop,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"We stayed at Alykes and hired a car for a few days. The lady at the hire place recommended several places to visit, including Limnionas.
The drive down is a bit scary with very narrow roads in places and sheer drops! But, it's well worth the effort, it's beautiful. Stunning clear, turquoise blue water and quite warm for swimming, apart from in & near the caves. There are steep cliffs all around and it's a little tricky getting in and out of the water, but ok if you're careful. I'm not a strong swimmer but so glad I went in. There are plenty of sunbeds for hire around the taverna if you want to sunbathe in comfort, otherwise there are concreted areas near the water.
We ate at the taverna with wonderful views out to sea, although we only wanted a snack and there weren't many small dishes to choose from. The pork souvlaki we had was very nice though and reasonably priced.

Greece,Liandy,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"We drove here following a recommendation from a friend. Road directions are notoriously absent in Zante, so after finally finding the turn off, we set off down a bumpy road. Came to a junction and chose to turn left, fortunately. After 5 minutes driving, we wondered if we were wasting our time because we couldn't see the sight we were expecting. We drove down a narrow, steep, very windy road and then 'bam' there was this beautiful cove. The Greeks have certainly made the most of the location and sunbeds and shades have been arranged very prettily down the cliffs. The taverna at the top has outstanding views and is surprisingly competitively priced. Go visit and take your swimsuits. You won't be disappointed.

First, the water color is spectacular - various shades of blue, aqua and cyan.
Second, the high cliffs add a dramatic backdrop.
Finally, the caves offer some adventure.

You have a restaurant with everything there and the prices are more than ok. The food is quite good, especially the grilled octopus . The location is remote and kind of wild.

Steep walk down to rock shelves and no really easy access into the water unless walk round to far end where there is a small pebbly beach from which you could walk into the water. Not good if you are not keen on seaweed which gathers at this point. Unlike Porto Roxa, you can stand up in the water at one end. Beautiful crystal clear waters and great for swimming however it was too crowded on the 3 occasions we visited so didn't stay but went on to the equally delightful, in fact better, beach of Porto Roxa.

Greece,Manodraka,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"The water is extremly clear, with shades of crystal blue. It is a bit cold, because of the currents coming from the small caves. There are a lot of small fish swimming near you, but nothing very impressive.
You definitely need snorkeling glasses if you want to explore the water and water shoes, as the sea entrance is very rocky and slippery.
There's not allowed with food or drinks from the outside, but as we didn't have sunbeds, i saw nobody checking if we ate or drank something. Sunbeds were 3 € each. You can also find good places to sit on rocks. It's not that bad.
Not suitable for small children, especially if they cannot swimm because the water is very deep.
As a conclusion, i would recommend to visit this place a day from your holiday, but not more, only if you really don't have a problem with climbing the rocks.

There are a few sun beds, but I expect you'd have to get there really early for those.

Greece,Dave M,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"This is effectively a lagoon, in fact it's really an inlet not a beach. The sea is a wonderful blue sapphire blue and when it's calm, it's like glass.

The restaurant is always nice and they have improved the facilities over the years by creating terraces amongst the rock faces, where they have provided sun beds.

I guess progress is inevitable and the taverna has to be a viable business, but the 'secret' is out now and it was so busy when we visited it was difficult to get a parking space, far less a sun bed.

- like outdoor activities
- like diving and snorkeling experience - though water is COLD

Clear blue sea, perfect for snorkeling.
Beach shoes would be great as it is rocky getting in, although there is a platform. Amazing views.",Jun 2016
Greece,Daria B,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,We were a little bit skeptical about this beach because we used to sandy beaches where the entrance to the water is gradual. Here there are rocks and you jump to the deep water right away... But this what made it so special for us. It is just a piece of paradise. There are also caves you can swim in. But take into account that the water is really cold (colder than other beaches we visited in Zakynthos) and also the rocks to access the water are slippery so be careful.,Jul 2016
Greece,Driha C,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,We went to the beach in the morning so we found plenty of sun-beds to choose. That was good because not all if them are providing good shade during the day. The water is very clear and look fantastic. Pretty good for snorkeling with some caves to visit. Not so many fish though but nevertheless we had a very pleasant day here.,Jul 2016
Greece,lancashirescott,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"The North West & West coast has some good spots for snorkelling, no sandy beaches like the rest of Zakynthos, but just a tad quieter for it.

Porto Limnionas is quite popular there are quite a few sunbed loungers with various amounts of shade, we arrived and there where only a few loungers left. From where you park its a bit of a obstacle course down to the crystal clear inlet with make shift concrete steps over the natural rock strata, some parts are a bit rough and not the safest but if careful should be ok.

The inlet is very deep and perfect for snorkelling, with the odd little cave.

Getting to Porto Lim is quite easy just head for Agios Leon on the well trodden main road, if you arrive from the north its sign posted to the right, but there is also a second road further on opposite the garage. If coming from the south then there is a tight little road opposite the garage that will take you to Porto Roxa and just before here there is a right turn that will take you to Port Lim, its a tad longer but you can take a peek at Roxa first, which in my opinion is better.

Greece,cliffpclark,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"Depending on where you are on the island this can be quite a trek to get to. But well worth it. We were based in tsilivi and hired beach buggys from Theo rentals ( see Steve at the Planos office , he'll do you a good deal and has excellent knowledge of the best places) it's the second time that we've visited this lagoon. The approach down hill is something else. The taverna is good for food and a well earned beer. Access down to the sea is a bit tricky, decent footwear a must. I recommend the water shoes, cheap enough to buy here and discard if you want. Plenty of parking space and once you've walked towards the lagoon and taverna you'll be so inspired you just gotta jump in that water

Greece,dougymorgan,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"Came upon this after link on our road map. Never too sure what you may find at the end of the road but this was georgeous! Aquamarine sea in the cove and great view from the taverna. Sunbeds available at the top near the taverna for €2.50 each under parasols. Access to the water is down steep steps and path (need footwear). Getting in to the water is marginally easier than getting out, but then I'm not as young as I was!
It was lunch so we had a shared Greek salad, carafe of white wine, lovely bread with a dip and some fries which was more than adequate and reasonable price considering the position. Would love to go in the evening and see the sunset but it was a bit far from where we were staying and over mountain roads. A must go to place for you water babies. The water was crystal clear and a lovely refreshing temperature and shelters from any roughness. Great for snorkelling.

Greece,Lindsay T,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"This is such a lovely bay, off the beaten track but still get s very busy, unsurprisingly. The bay is down a steep rock and reachable by several paths, with varying degrees of difficulty. It is great to swim in but very deep from the outset. The views and caves and overall atmosphere is great. I enjoyed it more in May than September as it was less busy
There is one taverna, who you have to walk through to get to the beach. It is reasonably priced with decent food, although not a wide selection. They also offer sunbed hire at 2.50 each. They are comfortable and clean.
It is a great place to go to for a visit and to see a different aspect of the island. I would say that you need to be fairly mobile and fit for the steps and paths and it did seem to attract a fair few posers in September.

Greece,Emilie B,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"We came here on our way from Keri to Skinari. The water is extremely fresh and there is a bit of an undercurrent (it is more physically demanding than it looks, but this may have been because we had been driving, walking and snorkelling all day so were a bit worn out). It is great for snorkelling, with lots of little caves to explore. Although it looked really busy when we first arrived, there are so many little coves to swim to that you can still find place to snorkel without others there. There is one Taverna which is a little pricey, but it has great views.
Overall, we did prefer other coves that we stopped at (like Karakonissi and Porto Roxa), as they were a lot less busy, but this may have been because we went to Limnionas in the afternoon- next time we are going to try it in the morning to see if thats better.

We loved our Zante seemed to be filled with tiny little hidden coves and this one is definitely the most beautiful.

Fully equipped for a long stay beach. Sun loungers located on the several terraces equipped umbrellas, or simply just under the trees given you even better shadow all day. Access to the sitting area is very simple and secure. I recommend be there no later 10 am because after 12am will be really difficult to find some free bad under umbrella. If you anyway get late, you may always asking to sign you for a free seat in the local tavern/restaurant.

Local restaurant has good selection of the fresh high quality seafood and drinks. There is a big parking also here. This is really great place for snorkelin. A lot of mysterious caves just wait for you discover. I saw and visit practically all Zante's beaches and this one for me is the first & best one & most beautiful of all of them. Moreover this beauty is the one only at Zante your be able to reach by car with no doubts.

The road to this bay starts somewhere on the middle of the Agios Leon village (use GPS because there is no many road signs) or ask locals if you miss.

Despite the fact the sea will reachable just from the rocks or jumping to all this around is quite safe. There stairs is suitable for any age. Please note that time there runs really fast, so you may plan your stay here all day with no doubts.

You need a vehicle to get here, it's literally in the middle of nowhere.

Arrived just too late (10:30) to get a sun bed but camped under a tree instead. Suspect it will be quieter mid week. Water not too cold at all and surprisingly gets warmer as you dive down !

Greece,Jabulani63,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"Porto Limnionas is breathtakingly beautiful. It was extremely hot on the day that we visited, at first we just stood, mesmerized by the sight. We then sat under cover at the Taverna & enjoyed the views, ambiance & cold-drinks. Thereafter, we wandered down to the water, initially my 12yr old daughter was a little nervous to jump in as other's were doing but I'm experienced swimmer & could see that the water was calm & that she would be fine with me. We held hands & jumped in from a ledge...the icy water was sublimely refreshing & we stayed in for ages.
I would not recommend this for really young children.
There is a little beach where one could paddle & swim with little one's, but it takes a clamber over rocky path to get to it. It's advisable to take shoes suitable for sharp rocks.

Greece,Mark B,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,We arrived at 9.30am 2 couples beat us to the coves beach other than that it was heaven. Waters crystal clear many fish around to spot whilst snorkeling although access to the water is a little hazardous (very slippy rocks). If you are early enough and have it to yourself then you will be very happy. I drove by a few days later around 1.00pm and you would be lucky to get in the water there were so many people there. Road down to the cove is very steep and windy so be careful driving. .....well worth a visit,Aug 2015

Greece,Matvl,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"This beach is wonderful; but not in the way you probably expect. There is not much beach really, some old boat houses and a few patches of rocks; a few rows of terraces with loungers (E2.50 per day). To get to the water the paths are concrete or rocky so swimming shoes are good to take.

Do go early if you want some shade. This is not a great beach for young kids as there are no shallow areas. But it is magnificent, and the swimming is super. A nice taverna with great views for a meal - definitely worth a visit.

My advice is to hire a quad / car / scooter.... The water is beautiful crystal clear with caves shallow calm water or deep parts to jump from rocks ... Not a place to bring extremely young children as it has lots of high ledges and it's more adult with bar service deck chairs lived this place spent all day there did not want to leave the restaurant up too is good too...,Jul 2015
Greece,Necef,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"It's a place with aqua water which made us feel we're in a dream. Never seen this like water before ( when we visit this place we havent visited navaggio/shipwreck yet )
This place has very few sunbeds and umbrellas, If you like to have a place you need to go a bit early.But ıf you're late don't be upset, you can find you a place at the rocky area as well.
Real nature experience with beautiful sea.
There is only one tavern. Which food was nice but without a good service. But to be honest in that hot weather we accept this situation, it should be very difficult to work like that much crowded and hot place. Credit card is not excepted as most of the place in Zakinthos.

Greece,georgeandjane,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"You drive for 20 minutes from the main road, along a minor road that ambles through the bare scrub. It's hard to imagine finding anything at the end of the road, till you take a final turn and find a car park in front of a taverna. Step out of the car, look down and you'll find a gorgeous tiny bay surrounded by white cliffs. That's when you'll want to reach for your camera - although our cameras didn't do it justice. Somehow photos fail to capture the beauty of this little spot.

Walk down the steps/gritty slope (careful, it's tricky!) and you'll find yourself on a sort of rocky platform, from where you can either jump in or wade in on the rocks.

The water is quite cold here, but it's crystal clear and deep. Snorkel along the rocky sides or into the small caves, although there are not many fish to see.

The taverna provides sunbeds up the hill, which had filled up by the time we were leaving. But I recommend that you get there early and enjoy a swim before too many people turn up.

Greece,Ken C,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,"There's almost no sand on this ""beach""! Rather, it's a small inlet carved in the rock. The islanders have built plateaus upon which they've installed lounge chairs, and stairs to get down to the water.

You can swim in the beautiful aqua and blue coloured water, down the inlet and into smallish caves in the area.

Breataking scenery...just be sure to take a powerful enough car, as the hill to get to the port is a 10% incline, so our under-powered rental car almost didn't make it back out!

We found the water to be ice cold but it is incredibly beautiful. Sunbed hire is 2.50 Euros per day and there is waiter service to the beds from the restaurant above.

Greece,Caroline084,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"This place is fabulous. Well worth spending the best part of the day here.

I would recommend arriving around lunchtime, booking a couple of sunbeds with umbrella cover from the Taverna (they are scattered across rocky terraces), maybe having a light lunch on the sunbeds - there are menus on the beds for you.

Then head down to the cove with your snorkel. I agree that you can't exactly call this a beach, but if you snorkel you will be happy here.

When you have exhausted yourself in the water and laying on the sunbeds take a table in the Taverna. Make sure you sit on the balcony veranda from where you can watch the most beautiful sunset whilst sipping on your coffee.

There isn't a beach of any sort whatsoever and there are a lot of rock/stones/large pebble to negotiate before you enter the crystal clear water. Jelly shoes is a must.

Beautiful and rocky with heavily weathered limestone/carbonate scenery, crystal clear blue water and teeming with fish which seemed to be attracted by the warm hydrothermal waters rising through the seabed creating bath like temperatures to swim in.

Not the best place for sunbathers, but for those looking for something off the beaten track and seclusion it's a must. But don't tell too many people as it would be shame to spoil it by overcrowding and littering, inevitable with places that become too popular. Keep it to yourself and enjoy its beauty.

Even though we were the only swimmers at this time of the day, the most of the beach was already in a shade and it was pity since the water was so clear, it would have been nice to snorkel there in a sunshine. If you go, take snorkels as this is the ideal place to use it! I wouldn't rate this beach as a number 1 attraction on the island but I can see it could be very nice to snorkel there when its out of shade.

Told about this place by a local boat trip rep who has lived in Zakynthos for years. It's a little ofd the beaten track and not part of any tours, but it is 100% worth it!
We got there by quad bike-about an hour or so from Kalamaki. A little sloppy jumping in. Water is safe. Plenty of children swimming with parents-just your common sense! Only regret is that we didn't take snorkelling gear-there are caves and a secluded 'lake' area across from the taverna side.
The food in the taverna was really nice-choose the typical Greek food and you won't go wrong. Not sure why you would choose any different in Greece anyway! Really good value for money-we shared a HUGE Greek salad, fried zucchini balls, traditional Greek bread with tomatoes, olives, and basil, tzatziki and drinks-less than €20.
Gorgeous place-a real feeling of finding somewhere really special.

There is no sand beach, you jump into the water right from the rocks, which makes it even more fun. The path is quite steep but if my 82-year old granny managed to get there, everyone can :) Great place for snorkeling, you can swim into a cave but the water is freezing.",Sep 2013
Greece,Mandi f,Porto Limnionas Beach,5.0,Visit Porto Liminos every year! Not a place for beach lovers as guess what ..... Not Beach! More a rocky cove with a few sun beds at top and then a climb down and up again to some fab diving rocks! Crystal blue waters! Not for the faint hearted or novice swimmer.

Lovely views and wild flowers on the way, in May. Arrived at this absolute gem of a place. No beach but swimming off the rocks ( I got in with no problems and I'm 64 with bad knees!). The water in this sheltered cove with white chalk cliffs, and some caves, is the most extraordinary aquamarine colour. You can stretch a towel out on the rocky ledges, or take a sunbed with umbrella on one of the grass terraces above the rocks. The taverna is lovely, and you might see the sunset. We just had ouzos and mezzo so can't comment further on the food. The waiter (young with pony tail) who served us spoke perfect English, almost without accent, just learned he told us from TV!

The pharmacy 5 metres from the entrance was closed, they require you to walk 10 minutes to another pharmacy who knows where. We decided to skip this.

We bought combo tickets online and avoided ticket booths.,Sep 2021
Greece,Brun066,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"The Archaeological Museum in Heraklion has always been, together with the main excavation areas, the place of excellence for the knowledge of the Minoan civilization. The fresco of men and women performing evolutions on the bull, the ""prince of lilies"", the cup-bearer, the mysterious Phaistos disc, the sculpture of the bull with golden horns, and many other masterpieces, have long been unforgettable pieces of Museum (and as such I remembered them well from my first visit, in August 2002).
But now the new location of the museum and above all the new organization of it make it even more valuable. Not only the Minoan civilization, but what preceded and followed it in Crete, up to the end of the classical world, is admirably illustrated and supported by works of great interest. It is therefore in fact now the ""Museum of Crete"" par excellence, in which the Minoan story appears to be the highest point of an overall history of this island, for centuries the western outpost of the most advanced civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East.
If before the recent renovation the Museum was already unmissable for what it contained, now it is also because it allows you to verify the high level of the approach that by this renewed museum the contemporary Greek cultural world has practiced towards this sublime island and its history.

Greece,DinglishGirl,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"It's true that a visit to the Palace of Knossos is enhanced if you come here beforehand. As a lot of the artifacts from the Palace ended up here, it provides a lot of context to what would otherwise be a load of stones.

There are a lot of artifacts, and it can feel a bit overwhelming by the end, but if you take your time and pick out a few different things in each room your visit is great.",Sep 2021
Greece,Azure29,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,3.0,"The museum was fascinating. Obviously there was a lot of focus on the Minoan civilisation and I was amazed at the number of very ancient artifacts that have been accumulated in the museum, covering many different aspects of life. The museum was well organised into different historical periods. The content of this museum makes it a must to visit if you are interested in ancient history.

Our first attempt to visit this place was pretty frustrating. It was about 11:20 am and there was a big queue to get in that went around the corner of the building. We got to the front only to be told that they needed to see our Covid vaccination certificate and passport! There was no indication (no signs outside for example) stating this. We queued for 25 minutes in the midday heat only to be turned away at the entrance because we didn’t have our vaccination certificates or passports with us! I can’t believe how strict they were - even more than actually getting into the country!

We came back the day afterwards with all the required documentation determined to go because we’d bought tickets already at the historical site of Knossos. Luckily the tickets were valid for two days.

One good thing about the museum is that it is open until fairly late. At the time of writing this, the museum closed at 20:00 during the weekdays. We decided to go there at 17:00 and there were no queues outside and only a few people in the museum. We took our time and really enjoyed our visit.

Our initial experience was not very good but with some adjustments, it turned out to be worth it. I would advise people to bring all your documents with you no matter how ridiculous it seems. I would also advise either to go there early or better still late on to avoid the peak tourist periods.

Greece,Georgia F,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"Dont miss the upper floor with the fresques, they really painted a picture of what the palaces would have looked like. We bought the double ticket an visited the museum after Knossos, which I am grateful for, because they complement eachother (and I believe we missed the longest queues due to this), for example we got to see the bathtubs that our guide at knossos explained were used to bury the people in, and the museum had these with the scelletons in the featal position, so everything we were told at knossos we get to see at the museum. The collections really show how advanced everything was. I easpecially enjoyed that pottery, crockery, teacups and jewelly from thousands of years ago might very well be something designed and made by an artisan today. Very friendly staff, took a little while to get in as they make sure everyone kept distance, but once inside it worked very well as you could spend time at the exhibits you most wanted to see and skip past others, walk back etc.

We went half way through the exhibit and we wanted to get back to the entrance to grab a drink (they make you store your back pack at the entrance) and the lady was utterly ""annoyed"" that i had the audacity to ask for my backpack. Another example of how rude are the staff: we were looking at an exhibit ( NOT TOUCHING THE GLASS) and all of a sudden a curator starting shouting angrily in greek at us.

Greece,GeeCee68,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,4.0,"Good museum with a simple layout focusing on displaying as many of the Minoan (and later) artifacts as possible. I'd say its aimed at adults, not a lot for kids to see or do. Not a lot of interpretive art or reconstruction, you are left to visit Knossos for that.

In mid August the museum was batching visitors, so we had a 20-30 minute wait to get in. If you drive there best of luck finding parking...that was super stressful. Take a tour instead.

Finally if you are from the UK go to the Ashmolean in Oxford, there is a good collection of Arthur Evans pieces there.

The security guards clearly did not want the children there and constantly reprimanded them for making a noise or for pointing a finger at a glass case and, heaven forbid, had the audacity to actually touch the glass. My children weren't even particularly boisterous and were mainly taking an interest in what they were seeing.

They had a large amount of artefacts, and I agree with other posts that the museum was well lit, air conditioned and all the plaques were written in English as well as Greek. The rooms did get a bit ""samey"" after a while though.

Greece,Harolnick,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"For antiquarians, the Athens museum should be the best. But I personally was thrilled more by the massive Heraklion Museum--and be prepared to spend at least three hours here--for several reasons. First, Knossos, well worth a visit, was pretty-well Disney-ed up 110 years ago by the well-meaning British archaeologist..The real stuff is here, in the floor after floor of cases. Second, the Minoan civilization four-thousand years ago, made trade, not war. Little is actually know (Chris Moorey's recent book gives a nice picture of them). Yet from this museum, they seem to have been a lively, music-making industrious people, somewhat like the Etruscans. All of this is shown in this museum right n the historical center of the town. After Knossos, giving a sanitised fantasy picture of the massive massive site, the reality here is overwhelming

But I bet the really awesome stuff went to London with Evans. So to sum up the experience. This place is clean and well maintained but I agree with what others have said about the staff. There is a bored, rude and sulking staff member in EVERY room. I felt like I was being spied on the entire time, and when I pointed to the recreated wood model of Knossos, I had my hand over the rope. Thought I invaded Europe by the response. Can only imagine if it had been an “Actual “ artifact instead of a wooden model. No smiles, no hellos... just a staff that hates tourist and their jobs. I’m sure they deal with a great many rude tourist, but I was visiting with my 12 year old that was excited for the adventure. He was ready to go when the crypt keepers uncomfortably stared at you. I’m sure it is a cultural thing and they are trying their best to do a job to secure the valuable artifacts. But 75% was recreations and models. Mostly pots and funeral casks. Nothing fantastic. If I had to do it again, I would skip this museum and just watch a Minoan video on YouTube.

They have sculptures of athletes doing acrobatics and feats of strength and skill! There are bronze cauldrons, basins, colorful glasses, ivory carvings, metal and natural jewelry, gold, silver bronze tools and jewelry, intricately carved artifacts, alabaster, rock crystal, gypsum and lime vessels. Words written into stone that are still untranslated, delicately carved precious stones and stamps, friezes, and sculptures.

We loved seeing the artifacts in this museum! It is usually open 8-8 but 10-8 on Tuesdays. There is no parking for this museum, we found a spot on the street a few blocks away. Our visit was 1.5 hours before closing on Thursday October 24th and there were very few people there. No photos allowed.

Be sure to allot a full morning or afternoon. Take your time. Read and gaze. Their gift shop is disappointing but across the street is a tiny souvenir shop that announces Museum Replicas and they have wonderful artifacts. The lovely owner is NOT pushy and her husband makes all the replica pottery (for most of Crete) and her sister in law makes replica paintings.

You have to be keen on archaeology to appreciate the finds - I went twice as i was so impressed with the quality of the exhibits.

I went before visiting Knossos and I think that is a good way round - I was a bit disapointed in Knossos [too much concrete] - you can get a discounted ticket which covers both sites but if you are a senior it is cheaper to get two separate tickets.

Sometimes after three or four hours I get museum overload and have to have time to process. There is so much in the museum starting with Minoan and going through Greek and Roman history that I would suggest doing it in pieces if you have time. Also, before you go to Knossos, where many of the artifacts were found I really recommend that you look at the frescos on the second floor that came from there. The explanations will help when you visit the site. We looked at them before we went to the site and again when we came back. We spent about 11 hours in the museum, but I do need to admit that I am a retired history professor and our friends are philosophers. We came to Crete in the first place because my husband had been fascinated with Minoan culture since he was an undergraduate. Go and enjoy.

Unlike Knossos, which was quite disappointimg with its deceiving restoration works, the Archeological museum was great. It gives precise historical background of the Minoan and later Greek civilisation and the exhibited artefacts were really insightful. Some of these included The Phaistos Disk, some very famous frescos etc. There are some interactive sections with further readings too. I would highly recommend going to the museum first and then visiting Knossos, so that you can get a sense of the historical background in advance (and also try to ignore the misleading restorations at the palace).

Greece,Ciaoyoga,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"We purchased a joint Knossos and archeological museum ticket so we didn’t have to queue to buy one. We did have to queue to have our bags scanned, which was a bit frustrating (one scanner and LOTS of people waiting). Once inside there is a cloakroom if you don’t want to carry around a bag or coat. The museum ground floor is packed with Minoan finds. So much pottery, jewellery, weapons etc. If you like history you will love this place. On the top floor there are reconstructions of frescoes from Knossos. They are beautiful. There is something for everyone here. It does get busy with coach loads of tourists. Be patient, they soon shuffle off and leave you to take that special photo (some items can not be photographed, there are signs). As usual there were few toilets for the ladies, so there was a queue for that.

I was entranced by the selection of pottery, small seals,statuary and other relics in this museum. I found it well curated, with good English descriptions. If you are interested in all the minutiae of ancient Minoan life, you will be entranced by the hundreds of tiny carved seals.

The museum is a modern facility with plenty of space to see the huge number of exhibits from through the ages. It’s the only place to see the original wall frescoes from Knossos too. You get a very clear view of Cretan life through the ages especially in Minoan times.

Do it with a guide or on your own, there are explanations in English in every display case. The visit will take about two hours or so if you look at everything.

Make a significant saving by buying the combo ticket for Knossos too!

Greece,Ian C,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"There can’t be many places that cover the consequences and artefacts of such a long period of human history, or of so many different epochs and cultures.

This museum really is everything you might expect and more and, whether or not you also make a parallel visit to Knossos or Phaistos (which ideally if course you should) is somewhere that you just have to visit if you’re in Crete for anything longer than about half a day.

Two minor niggles about our visit - the cafe was closed (pretty much abandoned actually). If this happens to you and you need to eat complain by the exit and you’ll get a one hour pass-out to grab something and return - but it’s not publicised.

The other problem was that rooms XV to XXIV (15 to 24) on the first floor were closed for some sort of (unexplained) work - so the disc of Phaistos wasn’t viewable. This may not be a big deal overall, but there was nothing to warn you when you paid to go in.

Overall it’s an exceptional place (the Bauhaus building is amazing as well) - go!

Greece,joebobs1,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"I've been to many museums all over Europe, and this would easily be in my list of must sees. It is a treasure trove of finds from Knossos and other sites. The preservation of some artefacts is extraordinary, beautiful statues that pre-date almost all other finds outside of Egypt, miniatures of excellent quality, a collection of domestic and other items that bring history to life. My particular favourites included the beautiful vases with lots of detail.

The museum has good facilities, it's small to mid-sized, has a small shop, and you can get a ticket that includes access to Knossos. I was a bit disappointed with Knossos (you can see my review there), but this museum is where Knossos really comes to life. All the annotations are in Greek and English, the staff are multi-lingual and very helpful. The displays were very well-maintained, and there's something here to interest everyone. The items they have are attention-grabbing, if you've got disinterested kids who you want to excite about history, this would be a good place. Also, if you're interested in design, there are so many beautiful items here it could almost be a gallery rather than a museum.

And last but certainly not least, this museum is the home of the Linear A and B tablets. For anyone interested in language and linguistics, this is a site of pilgrimage. You can see some of the oldest texts in history here. I always find it exceptionally moving to read ancient texts, like there's a voice stretched out over thousands of years, and suddenly you feel the gap between yourself and someone who died centuries before there was even a Roman Empire, is not so great.

This ought to be a really easy thing to mend.
The cafe inside was shut when we were there, so we had to ask at the entrance gate to be allowed out to get some lunch and back in again. Not a problem.
We were warned about parking in Heraklion so parked at the port (3 euros), but in fact when we were there (a Sunday) there was lots of free parking nearby. There is also a small car park (4 euros but nobody collecting money) just below the museum on Leif. Ikarou.

For those who enjoy old pottery and tools/jewelry, the other lower rooms are nice as well. The upstairs had the original frescos, which are mostly small pieces and re-drawn to make it easier to see what they are depicting. These were also quite interesting. The only downfall was the fact that the only room open on the top floor was the fresco room. All of the others were ""not open to the public"". I would highly recommend visiting this museum. I believe that the tickets are 8-10 euros.",Aug 2019

Greece,Paul,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,1.0,"We visited today with our 2 children who are 8 and 10 years of age.

The children entered with a sense of excitement as they are familiar with Greek myths and eager to find out more.

However, the staff were so incredibly rude and intrusive that we feel that it ruined our experience.

To give some examples, no-one said ‘hello’, smiled or welcomed us and it soon became apparent that staff were almost tracking the children waiting for them to get too close to an artefact before scolding them.

Unfortunately, my son put his hand on the protective glass to view something and a member of staff bounded over to tell him off as if he had committed a crime. He clearly felt dejected by this and no longer wanted to stay. I understand that children need to refrain from doing this, but it was the glass and not the artefact itself and children tend to do this. Given a polite reminder, he would have remembered not to do this again. Moreover, it could have been an opportunity for the staff member to engage with him regarding the object that he was interested in.

I later picked up my daughter to show her the inside of another artefact and a member of staff rudely told me that I had picked her up too close to the pottery. This again, felt like an incredible over-reaction as we were not in any danger of touching it at all. I told her this but she began to argue with me in front of everyone else in the museum which, as you can imagine, felt quite ignominious and very unnecessary. She was very confrontational and unreasonable. When I told her that ‘it was her subjective opinion that we were too close, but in reality, we were no-where near’, she told me that I was wrong and to express my opinions in the visitors book if I had anything to say on this.

As you might imagine, my children, my wife and I felt quite ill-at ease by this point. I feel quite stunned to have been treated like this.

Museums and their staff have an opportunity to engage and inspire young people. This planned visit could have been a rich, interactive experience - that they would have cherished. However, it clearly was not. Given our experience today, my advice would be, if you have children and want them to be inspired by history, this is not, unfortunately, the place to go to.

Hopefully, others’ experience will be better than ours.

1. Our baby screamed thrice. A ground floor female staff with long curly hair in the 2nd or 3rd room loudly shushed her, repeatedly. She embarrassed us. She marched up to me the mum (in personal space with a pungent cigarette odour) while I was trying to go feed my baby to tell us to "" take her out, calm her down as she is disturbing other customers!"". She proceeded to lecture how to mother my hungry baby. She was condescending and contradicting herself when challenged.

2. In a further ground floor room, our baby's babbles/noises were shushed again. My baby shushed her back which was HILARIOUS!
Upper floor, Frescoes, a male staff marched up to my older child who was helping by pushing the pram saying we will crash it in to the glass and trigger alarms. I reassures him that would not happen. Other tourists were shocked at his assumed accusations and were consoling us.

3. Least baby-friendly place ever. No baby changing facilities for males/ single fathers either. Inspite of these select insensitive staff discriminating against young lives, it is worth a visit if you feel confident enough to challenge them although they managed to successfully ruin our visit from England.

Greece,SuffolkDan,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,2.0,"The horrible part of me laughed when I read the recent review entitled ‘what a load of pots.’ Clearly a cultural philistine, thought I, as we sallied forth to this highly lauded museum.
But sadly the reviewer was spot on - room after room of pottery and pots. And quite a lot of jewellery.
That said, it’s not only this museum that believes that all it needs to be is a collection of ancient cultural artifacts behind glass with accompanying labels.
There are some amazing exhibits, not least the ivory bull- leaper, but in fact so is the pottery and jewellery, if only there was an attempt at context and explanation.
Much of the pottery wouldn’t look out of place in a modern pottery ( ceramics) studio. How, 4,000 years ago did they manage to craft and fire such complex work, barely bettered today? Where is the attempt at explanation? How about a modern- day potter attempt and explain the work? There’s plenty of space.
And the jewellery is magnificent- fine and ornate. Try comparing it to the modern stuff over the road, 4,000 years hence. So what tools might they have used, how did they achieve such a level of complexity and detail? How was the work set and linked? Again, maybe a video or jeweller- in person?

Also, as magnificent as it all is, why is the human form generally portrayed in such basic ( or non-realist) form, and in paintings often in 2D?

The kids were bored.

Greece,westphal1942,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,3.0,"I visited the Heraklion Archeological Museum the first time several years ago when it was housed in a small buiding. You would go in through one gallery and exit through the other. The exhibition only included a few sample pieces and, of course, the most outstanding ones, like the snake-goddesses, the bull-leaping frescoes, the bull jumper, the golden bee pendent, the phaistos disc, the bull-head vase, the eagle, several clay toys, and a few clay angels,among other pieces. The item descriptions and explanations were succinct, straight to the point, and informative.

Since then, I have visited the museum in its new building on two other occasions and I have been overwhelmed by the number of items in so many rooms, but have spent time searching for the most notable pieces so that I could enjoy their beauty and eventually discover some that I had not noticed before. Unfortunately the fascination of doing this was totally destroyed during my last visit in August 2019. First, I attempted to go into the left-most room on the first floor because of a particular piece I wanted to see, but one of the guards stopped me and told me I had to enter the exhibit through another room! I found this idiotic but I followed her instructions. While in the exhibition, I was repeatedly distracted by the loud voices of the many tour guides who lead big groups of tourists as flocks of sheep through the museum. A real pest. As if this was not enough, I couldn't find some of the pieces that I wanted to see. So, I asked some guards. They had no idea of their location, although one said that they had to be in the rooms on the second floor, which were closed to the public. He was not sure, however...

Definitely, the old small version of the museum was better since one could gain a good appreciation and understanding of the objects on display, their history and their significance, without being overwhelmed by their number --in fact so many that you end up not seeing any.

Aesthetically, the old exhibition was very elegant too. It was a real pleasure to enjoy the objects on display not only because of their inherent beauty but also because of the artistic manner in which they were displayed, something definitely missing in many of the current vitrines. A real pitty.

Very good spacing around the displays so you only feel overwhelmed when an Italian tour group with a shouting guide come through. But there are enough rooms to avoid barking Italians.

The only surprise was the lack of commercialism. There was no restaurant open, and the gift shop was sparse. So that the nearby shops did a good trade.

This is a museum which has the great pieces of gold jewelry from a people believed to have been the actual Atlanteans, the Minoans.

Here you can find the beautiful frescos that depicted the colorful life that Minoans led. The museum is small but has a wealth of artifacts worthy of two hours of your time. I prefer the afternoon when the crowds are smaller during the summer peak time.

I don't know if the museum's personnel went to some basic training, or even if they want to work there, but I could see the same aggressive and humiliating behavior with multiple visitors today. The museum content is really interesting, if the management can work on some basic personnel training would be great, I visited other museums around Greece and I never had any bad experience at all, I'd assume this is a real ""bad"" exception.

So much was dug up out of Crete rulers’ tombs from 5000 BC, and it’s on display here, in very good condition with easy to read descriptions. The sophistication of Crete’s culture at the time of Egypt and China comes to life as you tour this museum. Unlike the Acropolis Museum, here many items are whole, not just a few fragments with a sketch of the rest. There is a model of the Knossos Palace, which helps provide an image of the whole setting. Given that Knossos Palace is fairly incomplete, it’s easier to understand if you go to the museum first. If you only have time for one, tour this museum instead of Knossos.

Greece,2012sunilmumbai,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"I had purchased a combined ticket for the Knossos archaeological site and the museum. I was not aware about what exactly was exhibited in this museum and hence very pleasantly surprised.

There are around 25 rooms, chronologically arranged, in which there are exhibits of the Minoan civilisation, as well as others, so beautifully arranged. The display is of an international standard and the captions for the room as well as for the display are excellent. It is sad that one section of the exhibit is closed because there is a shortage of staff to be on duty especially during the high season.
Do not miss this museum under any circumstances

Greece,Paula Y,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,3.0,"We visited Crete for the first time this year and had high hopes of this museum; it had been hyped to the skies. As I'd recently finished a museum skills course, I was also very interested to see how things were done in a country other than my own. And there were some beautiful and interesting exhibits; the jewellery in particular was stunning and it was good to see some of the frescoes from the Knossos complex.

The usual advice if you don't know much about the history of Crete is to visit this museum first and then go on to Knossos, but we chose to do it the other way round since we had reasonable knowledge already.

Unfortunately at the time we visited the museum it was absolutely packed to the rafters with tour groups who were either utterly oblivious to those of us there as individuals or even actually hostile; one man kicked my friend's stick from under her deliberately (luckily she is quite stable when standing still, otherwise, on all that marble, it would not have been pretty). All I can say for myself is, I'm glad I'm small and slight and able to slip through tiny spaces. There were times when I contemplated ducking under the cases, and I'm not kidding.

We had booked our (small) backpacks in at the free cloakroom and given how many times I almost got whacked in the face by other people's luggage I was a little surprised it isn't compulsory. With the exception of the very nice ladies in the cloakroom, I actually felt as if most of the staff would rather the visitors simply weren't there.

My friend, who is a real history buff, was also a little disappointed with some of the translations - in the statues room, shouldn't ""Pluto"" be ""Hades""? Certainly in the original Greek that's what it said, and there are differences between the two. After all, that three headed dog is a bit of a giveaway....

I'm glad I've been to this museum but I don't think I'd visit again. To be honest we'd had a better time the day before, and were made to feel much more welcome, at the much smaller museum in Rethymno.

So all in all, sadly, a bit of a disappointment, not in terms of the exhibits themselves, but with regards to everything else.

Greece,Paul S,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"My wife and I were truly in awe of what is on show at this amazing museum. Every item is unique and not one is duplicated. From beautiful Minoan relics 3000BC which make you wonder how they could produce such items given this was the Bronze Age! The layout is excellent and moves you from room to room and different times during the history of early Crete. Gold jewellery so fine it defied belief as was some of the ""shell"" pottery so named since it is so thin. How did they carve out a great chunk of Obsidian which is volcanic glass? There is no natural source of metal in Crete of any kind. The Minoans, who were a great sailing nation, had to go to Cyprus (a derivative of the name for copper) for Copper and Greece for Tin. These two when combined created Bronze and the Minoans became masters of using this metal.
You should plan on spending about 3 hours here; you will be totally wrapped up in this culture the time will fly by!

Greece,higgybear67,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"Personally I would say this was the best museum I have ever been to. Truly I am amazed.The ancient Minoan artefacts are as stunning as anything you'd see in a museum of 20th century art. Even if you're not particularly interested in history or archaeology, I'd suggest approaching the objects as art exhibits in their own right. The colours and designs on the pots are stunning. Not to even mention the more unique objects such as the stone libation cup carved in the shape of a bull's head, or the fragmentary Minoan frescoes. The Greek and Roman statues and carvings are equally interesting. If you're planning a visit to Knossos as well, I'd recommend a visit to the museum first just so that you have a greater appreciation of some of the objects that were found here. Incidentally, entrance to the museum is 15 euros, as is entrance to Knossos (€30 in total). At both sites, however, you can buy a combined ticket for €16, which is valid for three days.

I finally talked them into letting us in after I politely insisted that there was no way we could view the entire museum without taking a break for lunch and there was nowhere in the museum to buy lunch because the cafe was closed.

Anytime you go near anything to look at it they stand as close as possible and it is extremely uncomfortable. I saw a small child coughing on the way round and one of the staff actually shushed them.

Maybe it was just a bad day and something had been broken so they were extra vidulent but it was a very uncomfortable experience.

I was so unlucky that I meet inside the museum four guides. Two of them were ok - Polish and English - they were using microphones and headphones - usual standard in the museum but the two others - Italian and German were so loud that I was not able to focus reading the descriptions. It was as loud as in the pub - literally. I asked three guards in three different rooms to do something, but they did nothing. The funniest part was a discussion with one guard - she told me that the guides have to be loud as the whole group should hear them - comme on! I tried to be faster/slower, but the Italian guide was that loud that I could listen to her very well three rooms ahead.
It was really below the standard. The most tiring three hours in the museum in my life - Italian and German people were speaking so loud that I was not able to enjoy. I think everything is on the security cameras, so my version can be verified.

Moreover, 2/3 of the upper level of the museum is closed, but the price of the ticket is still the same ...

The Minoan era collection is mostly of grave goods and, because these personal possessions and offerings were carefully buried, they are in outstanding condition. The decoration of the pottery and artistry of the jewellery is stunning, particularly when you consider most of them were created around 3-4000 years ago.

The palace wall murals are mostly interpretations based on the data available from significantly damaged fragments.

The cafe was closed the day we visited, if it had been open, we would have had something to eat and got a second wind to see some more.

For the average customer I can see much of the display falling into the boring category. Little attention has been given to providing the contextual stuff (visuals, interactives, reconstructions) you'd find even in a provincial museum with a truly modern take on presentation. I suppose you could always join one of the expensive guided tours on their whistle-stop tours of the best bits. Then again, they seem to spout the same flawed (tourist-friendly) explanations of the exhibits that were invented by Arthur Evans over 100 years ago: (the Parisian! - what's that got to do with bronze age Crete?) Having said that, and with fair recognition of the importance of this collection and Cretan pride in it, the place doesn't have to managed like some kind of shrine. Being told to hush when museum guides are shouting their scripts with impunity is a bit weird. Go if you have to but visit Knossos or Phaestos themselves for a more historical experience.

A joint ticket (valid for three days) is available for both entrance to the Archaeological Museum and the Minoan Palace at Knossos.

Greece,apars0n,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"23 years since my last visit to the museum and (being older and possibly wiser) my decision to re-visit was a good one.
The museum is amazing and the number of exhibits, both large and small, overwhelming and breathtaking, allowing you to appreciate the unbelievable artistry and workmanship of the Minoan civilisation, in particular (when we were living in caves and banging rocks together!).
I spent over 3 hours in wonder and awe.
There are excellent descriptions in English and photography (without flash) is possible.
5 euros entrance until the end of March, 10 euros after, although the combined ticket with Knossos (usually 15 euros on its own) is a bargain 16 euros, if you intend visiting both (within 3 days).
A must-do in Heraklion.

You can also learn about the Minoan diet and writing system, and how we have learned what we know about them. The visit was the perfect complement to Knossos.

Greece,themistocles k,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"Heraklion (or more accurately, Heracleon) has an excellent museum, unlike anything you can find on the planet. It houses the best exchibition of Minoan art. The Minoans, at their peak, generated culture that still feels contemporary, and influenced abstract art (Picasso and the cubic movement) almost 3,000 years after. Some of the exhibits are 7,000 years old, providing an actual time travelling experience. The detail in some of the small jewellery is astonishing and, logically, they could only have been created with the aid of magnifying glass. The wings in the famous golden art craft of a bee were put together using a battery, a remarkable feat for the time, but not as remarkable as the aesthetic value of the collection. While there, don't forget to observe the marble cross, the religious symbol of the Minoans, which was much later adopted by christianity; the lovely statues of angels that decorated the graves at around 700 BC and are strongly remininiscent of Rafael; the wonderful coin collection that spans several millennia. Photography is allowed, so you can feel the joy and the admiration for years to come!

The Museum in some dozen galleries depicts the evolution of the Minoan civilization culminating in fine artistic jewelry, housewares, frescoes and other artwork.

Very interesting 'Kamares ware' pottery style I've never seen before. Also the fresco styles are unique, somewhat Egyptian-influenced. I didnt know bull-jumping was a sport! I saw the full much-larger Athens Museum a few days before this one, so the later Greek/Roman era stuff was redundant for me. Museum is not large, can easily get through it in 2 hours.

Greece,geckopoo,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"This is an absolute must-visit location when in Crete. So glad we took time to see it after our visit to Knossos, it gave a much much better perspective of the Minoan civilization. Very impressive collection of artefacts, all real and authentic (not reconstructed as in Knossos), and well-curated too! I really appreciated the information provided in the displays, very interesting, insightful and accessible. The quality of the artefacts are stunning and shows the exquisite craftsmanship of a lost civilization – hard to imagine that these items existed thousands of years ago! All the iconic Minoan treasures are here: the Faience figurines of the Snake Goddess, the stunning bull’s head rhyton, the Linear-A tablets, the bull-leaping frescoes, oh my!

We had a combination ticket for Knossos and the museum so it was good value. On hindsight, we could have just spent more time here instead of Knossos, there is so much to see here in more comfortable surrounds (airconditioning + good toilets). We could have easily spent 2+ hours here. A tour guide is not really necessary, you can just wander around at your own pace, the exhibits are logically arranged and very easy to follow. We had our iPads which allowed us to google any information we needed on any item that caught our interest.

This museum would rank as one of the best archeological museums I’ve ever been (after the British Museum, the Met and the Louvre), if not for a few niggles: the museum shop was a little bit too upmarket and pricey, and there are no water fountains or café inside, we had to go out of the museum and buy water from a street kiosk outside and then go through security again to resume our visit. Nevertheless, it is definitely a must-see in Crete. Highly recommended.

Greece,10sman2017,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"We were on a short holiday in Crete and decided that we would like to take a day trip to Heraklion and the Palace of Knossos, We found a tour by Sparrow Travel, which suited us as it picked us up and dropped us off near to our hotel. We paid a combined ticket for the Archaeological Museum and entrance to Knossos, which was free for our daughters, who are students and under 18. Our tour guide, although extremely knowledgeable, was rather dry in her delivery and quite slow, so we ended up missing out on seeing a whole floor of the museum. There are literally thousands of incredible ancient Minoan items, displayed with clear descriptions of where they fit into history. It was really interesting to learn how forward thinking and civilised the Minoans were, over 3000 years BC. The designs on the pots and in jewellery are particularly interesting. I will return again to this museum, but I don't think a guide is totally necessary.

Greece,traveloften028,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,4.0,Spent the day touring the palace of Knossos and also this museum. They really go hand in hand as most of the artifacts here come from Knossos. I would actually stop here first if you have a choice and if you can get a good tour guide it is a major plus. Mostly pottery and that sort of thing but fascinating and very very old. I believe the Minoans were the first known civilization in Europe.,Oct 2018
Greece,Nina Zee,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"I went on a Sunday after going to the Palace of Knossos. I ended up being free entry. The courtyard was beautiful: columns, shaded with trees and lots of places to sit. A great place to sit and chill out before or after a visit to the museum.
You do have to go through a little security check on the way in but nothing huge. There is a free coat / bag check, which is nice.
There are plaques under everything in English and Greek and it is well lit.
I was disappointed because there was not much in the gift shop but there are a lot of great shops across the street where you can buy replica mosaic tiles of the major pieces and statues. I highly recommend Irida!

Everything is well-thought-out and you move through the museum in chronological order, which helps you to build on what you learn and do so progressively. Took 2 hours to go through all the rooms (2 floors); I took lots of pics. A small section of museum does not allow photos however. Lighting is good - not too much or too little. There are written explanations almost everywhere and the people who watch the rooms know a lot. This was time well spent.",Oct 2018
Greece,mid214,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"An incredible wealth of artifacts and information about the past. One could spend much more than 2-3 hours here, but I found that 3 hours was the maximum amount of time before I was so exhausted that i couldn't take in any more (and I did not read every sign or look closely at every exhibit.)

There is so much to learn. It raised many questions for me as to how a civilization as advanced as the Minoans could emerge, develop, flourish, and then cease to exist, much as has happened with later civilizations, e.g., the Myceneans, the ""Greeks,"", and then the Romans, as well as others in other parts of the world. How long will the current ""Western"" civilization last?

Scaling roofs and jumping up and down to see if it was stable to walk on. Aside, the views were spectacular and there was enough signage around to learn about the castle.

Thankfully we were successful on our return visit.

We climbed the well worn stone steps, was going to count them but kept getting distracted by the wonderful scenery and the size of the Castle.

There is no admission fee to enter the Castle.

Would definitely recommend wearing sturdy footwear here, the steps are a bit uneven as is  the inside of the Castle.

Once at the top visitors are treated to some incredible views of the surrounding area and along the coastline.

Visitors are also able to visit the small but beautiful Church of Saint Panteleimon. There is the ruins of another old Church nearby.

A walk around the parapets/battlements is an ideal way to enjoy the views.

Already the drive to the castle is great - a scenic road with beautiful views of the coast and the castle.
For the castle itself, you have to take a short, but steep walk from the foot of the hill up to the top of the rock - and then you can see the old ruins of this hospitaller fortress and great views over the coastal landscape.

There's also a small shop with cafe and restrooms at the foot of the hill.

Besides that: a short visit to the village of Monolithos nearby is also a good choice. It's also known for the small shops with honey and other local specialties.

Wear shoes with a good grip, the stone steps up to and inside the castle have been worn extremely smooth over the years and are very slippery in places, Mrs senior management almost went a cropper coming down. Entrance is free and remember if you want to go inside the little monastery, dress respectfully. While you are in Monolithos, Look out for the signs to the beach at Fourni its a drive down, down, down long and winding road (like something off top gear, unfortunately I had a Micra and not a McLaren). Its worth the drive the beach at Fourni is lovely we vegged out for a couple of hours with only a couple of other people, it was like it was our own private beach, so much more relaxed than the other side of Rhodes. There is a little kiosk just on the bend in the road where you park for the castle, you can get drinks, souvenirs, ice creams here, so don't worry if you find yourselves short of water or snacks for the beach. I've attached some photos for you to cruise before you go visit. If your in Rhodes, hire a car and go visit the south and west of the island, its greener, cooler from the prevailing wind.

Greece,Richard W,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"This is a lovely, free attraction with great views but although it is billed as a castle, there really isn’t much of a castle left.

There’s a set of stairs to reach the site, these aren’t particularly tasking - my wife is six months pregnant and managed fine - and although you are high up there isn’t a risk of falling to your death on the ascent.

At the top you are rewarded with wonderful views looking out to the sea, it almost seemed the sky and sea merged the day we visited.

As others have said, safety at the site isn’t top notch - there are unprotected sheer drops and you can clamber all over the site. There is literally no one else around, so if you’re visiting with children or suffer vertigo, go steady.

All in all a nice free site. It’s about 30 minutes from Lindos if you cut across the isle.

Greece,Gabrielė G,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"We visited this place with a one year old baby. It was nice to spend a half-hour there and to take pictures. Parking is close to the castle, but there are only stairway leading to the top, so no wheels could be used to get there.

Greece,Irena R,Monolithos Castle,5.0,It's the only medieval castle which has not been occupied as far as I read. What remains is pretty much ruins - the outer walls and there's also a small church / chapel inside. You have to be careful while climbing up because the stone stairs are so worn that they are very slippery. The view is breathtaking though.,Jun 2018

Manolithos Castle is located about half a mile from the village itself on cliffs at the edge of the sea.

The drive down the east coast is quite beautiful with many ocean vistas and winding mountain roads through evergreen forests. Parking at the castle is plentiful and free.

Greece,stomp2905,Monolithos Castle,4.0,Been to rhodes lots of times and Monolithos or at least seen it from on high when buying honey from the vendors. First time actually climbing up. Not the easiest climb not in terms of the physicality of it but the steps are uneven and worn thus slippery. Views are worth it though but definitely not for those with mobility issues. Cafe at the bottom wasn’t for me. Reasonably priced but the smell of the cooking would put anyone off as it smelled very “oily”. Well worth a visit though and a free attraction,Jun 2018

The short walk from the car park then easy short climb up this feature reward you with the most stunning views out over the petrol blue Aegean, and back to the interior of the island. The ruins themselves are fascinating, being remnants of a fort built here by the Knights of St John. There is a One - Three week diving Eladda packing list little church here too.

Greece,eilidh2208,Monolithos Castle,5.0,Breathtaking views and without a doubt the best views in Rhodes in my opinion. We arrived just before 10am which meant we had the place to ourselves. Although this was not deliberate I definitely recommend visiting when it is very quite so you can fully appreciate the views and the silence. Honestly the most beautiful place and definitely worth the drive.,May 2018
Greece,Tukkis,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"We drove there from Ialyssos Bay. The trip was 1,5 hours one way, since the roads are a bit slow on this side of the island. The drive was quite nice however, since there is lots of beautiful mountain sceneries. It is best to drive with no hurry, so you can stop by at a beach and at local towns during the trip.

The Monolithos Castle was spectacular on its own. There is no entrance fee. The castle is in ruins, which makes it a bit mysterious on its own. And the views are a blast. A place for good pictures, or just sit around for a while and chill.

It's wild and full of enchanting places. That attraction is just a destroyed castle and a small church, i think that 1 hour it's enough for see all.

Great for photographers.",Sep 2017
Greece,Tiina J,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"Probably my favourite views of Rhodes on west side. Driving up here, there are some vendors with small stalls selling local alcohol drinks and delicacies by the roads and offer free tastings, which is worth of a stop (although prices seemed a bit better in Rhodes town). It's a bit of a climb to the ""Castle"" ruins which is actually a small church on top, and the ground is very dry and slippery so you should pay extra attention.

One you get up there, the view is spectacular, specially during the later afternoon and sunset time. Take your time to see the small lovely chapel and walk around taking pictures. Don't worry about the heat because there is some breeze on top.

Free parking as everywhere in Rhodes.

We wanted to see the west coast as the Aegean appears different colours here on the west side. Not disappointed our trip took us up the stunning coastline through Apolakia with views to the Turkish coast and mountains. beautiful area with little traffic . At Monelithos follow the road out to the Monelithos Castle . Restauarant for refreshments before the road takes you down to the base of the castle .Steep steps up to the ancient castle but worth it for the views of the coast and the Castle is truly a fortress . apparently never conquered and you can see why due to its prominent location on the cliff.

Greece,Oleg_Lesniak,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"I visited Monolithos Castle twice. First time it was in 2015, and I was so impressed by the beauty of the place that I couldn't help visiting it again during our Rhodes holiday in 2017. The Castle is located near Monolithos village. If you enter the village from West you will get to the crossroad. The main road will turn right to Siana village, left road leads downhill, and straight road divides in two after the crossroad. Go strait and then take the left road and after couple of kilometers of serpentine you are near the Castle. There is a spacy free parking place there, and a small tavern. The path in the pine-tree woods leads to the stone stairs. After few minutes you will take your first pictures in the Castle! There is a small Orthodox Church of Saint Panteleimon in the Castle, it is redecorated and contrasts sharply with its ruined environment - you can come in, light a candle and to pray Saint Panteleimon for the health for you and for your family... (you can also put few Euro in the box near the tray with candles).
The Castle is on the top of quite high rock, just on the cliff so views are just fantastic! Pine-tree forest far below your legs and calm Aegean see with small islands in mist!
My opinion, evenings are the best time for visiting the place because of absolutely magic sunsets!

After visiting the Castle you can go back to Monolithos or drive downhill - be careful, the serpentine is quite narrow, quite steep and not absolutely safe. Taking this road you will get to a small stony beach, not the best place for swimming, especially if you are travelling with children.

Greece,TheAndFam,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"We didn't go into the castle but saw all we wanted to from the many vantage points which gave so many different perspective on the castle which we felt was enough.

There are many small family farm stalls on the area of the castle selling oils, soap and honey all very rural Greece.

It is worth hiring a car for the day to explore the west coast of the island we drove from Kolymbia to Porto Antico (note this is just a beech so perhaps not worth a stop), Ancient Kamiros down to Skala for lunch (lunch on the harbour for four €50 all had fresh local fish), Siana a small village famous for honey then onto Monolithis from there to Prasonisi (where the seas meet) back to Kolymbia.

On the outbound journey you are never more than 40 mins from a stop so for those with children this isn't a day in the car which is helpful - the run back to Kolymbia from Prasonisi is an hour but we broke the journey with drinks at Lardos Bay.

My children are 10 and 13 and they loved the mix of things to see.

Costs for our day:

Car €55
Fuel €20
Lunch €50
Ice cream €10
Drinks x 3 stops €30

Greece,Darren H,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"The title says it all, this is an absolute must when visiting Rhodes. The last part of the journey to Monolithos Castle and the views from the Castle are absolutely breathtaking. There is a steep set of stairs up to the castle which may hinder those with mobility issues, however, the views of the Castle from the elevated road in are worth a look even if you can't access the actual Castle.
At the base of the steps there is a little gift shop/cafe which serve a variety of hot and cold drinks, ice creams and snacks.

The top is pretty with some shade from trees, just be careful as the ground is uneven and there is a big hole which isn’t fenced all the way around. Also as I remember there’s an archway right on the edge - don’t walk through it as there’s a very, very long sheer drop the other side! Lovely spot for taking photos, try to go when there aren’t huge coach trips turning up to appreciate it fully. If you go in a car make sure you go down to Fourni beach afterwards, it’s beautiful and quiet. Also (if you have a car and you like Monotithos) drive further up the same side of the island and visit Kritinia castle, it’s a less ruinous version of Monolithos and again has stunning views without a charge!

Greece,Martz4040,Monolithos Castle,3.0,"The journey on the winding roads through pine forest on the west coast got us to a car park near to Monolithos. From here it's around two minutes worth of steps to get the castle which is perched on a tall rock overlooking the sea. It is free to enter this castle. And when I say 'castle' it is more like the strategic surrounding castle walls and a small white church. This attraction only took around 30 minutes of our time, there is not a lot to see.
History - This castle is built around 1480, some sources are saying the Knights of St John and others are saying the Venetians.
Tips
- The approach road, where there are vendors offers a great view of the castle.
- A visit to this attraction is worth doubling up with Kritinia Castle, also on the west coast. This is the better out of the two castles.
- Read up before going as there is no information at the attraction.

Greece,Laura T,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"We was only out on a tour in our car that day, but stopped road side to take a photo of the castle in the distance as it looked amazing, and when we followed the road down, we decided to park and walk up.

The climb is not as bad as it seems, lord of shady stops along the way, and not too steep, but I would not recommend you take buggies or push chairs, not suitable at all for that and a bit too dangerous for very young children all the way up! Very scary edges with sheer drops at the top, but very worth the viewing. If you do go with kids, keep them close by, plenty to trip over and if it's near an edge, could be concerning.

As adults we loved it, amazing photos to be had and spectacular panoramic views of the coast line one side and the inland on the other!

Make sure you visit the smaller decaying shrine on the lower ledge at the edge, makes for a fabulous couples or family photo inside the building with the amazing back drop!

Greece,Reuben A,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"A few years ago we watched the impressive cliff and castle from the road's panorama. Being a windy day we renounced on the climb. This time we made it. The climb is slightly slippery. The plateau gives you a wonderful, windy sight of the sea, its beautiful islands and of the massive and impressive cliff and the disintegrating castle. Awesome scene. A must. The castle's area is unsafe. There are unprotected openings which could be dangerous for children. St Pantelimon church is modest but inviting. The descent is more frightening especially for the elder or the kids. All in all, one of the most impressive sites of the island of Rhodes. The site needs a face-lift and more attention of the tourist authorities.

Greece,lawdylawdy,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"Looking at the castle all the way up there on its rock, I thought it was going to be a hot, sticky climb but in fact, much easier than it looked. There's distraction from the thousands of little cairns people have built everywhere - including up in the trees. Why? Who knows? Probably because everyone else did.

Once at the top the views are spectacular - windswept trees, blue skies, blue seas and yes, more cairns.

Paths are well, Greek, really - slippery, uneven, polished, and there are some precipitous and very long drops off parts of the walls which in this country would be fenced off. Keep your kids on a lead if they're young ones and inclined to wander off.

The view is beautiful 360 degrees. We heard bells from a sheep heard down below the castle, must have been in the woods because we couldn't see it, but it added something to the already great atmosphere.

Greece,Stuart S,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"Whilst on the way to the secluded beach of Foúrni my family and I decided to call at castle Monólithos for a photo opportunity, and what an opportunity that is, after a relatively small climb up the incredibly smooth and slippery stone steps (sensible shoes a must, no heels) we were rewarded with the most amazing views from this once splendid fortification. Be sure to venture over to the left of the chapel (right if you do this before passing the chapel itself) after you have been past it to take your photos, as there is more of the ancient castle and spectacular views to see a mere 50 metres away. One word of warning if you are taking children be very careful as the drops are sheer and extreme with little or no protection other than your wits. The cafe at the bottom offers a lovely shaded escape out of the beating sun, have a cold drink and review your spectacular photos.

Parking was easy and there are a few places to buy refreshments before you visit the castle, but you shouldn't need them as it's an easy walk/ climb to the entrance. There isn't much here so there isn't an entrance fee, but that said, it's a quiet (in April) and picturesque spot where you can take some time out to enjoy the peace and the beautiful view. There's also a small shrine at the top where you can light a candle if that's your kind of thing. Well worth a visit.

The castle is however very ruined and what remains is perched rather precariously on top of the cliff, so I would not say that it was safe for young children and you have to be quite fit and sure footed to climb up the steps and move around the site once you get there. If you do visit though you are rewarded with some stunning views (you can enjoy these on the road to the site as well) and a beautifully natural and un touristy experience. There is a little whitewashed chapel/retreat at the top where you can leave a donation. Many previous visitors have left little piles of stones all along the path, there is something about the place which made us feel a bit superstitious and so we each left a little pile of stones too as good luck or something. An experience we will all remember.

No information about the history of the place (hence only four stars). Somewhat surprised to see the tacky souvenir seller up there too (they get everywhere).

It is promoted as one of the most beautiful castle and chapel sites in the world and I would say it must be up there for that title. The castle and chapel are situated on a very high outcrop overlooking the sea on the not so touristy west coast of Rhodes. The castle is ruined but the chapel, which is tiny, remains and is situated in the most magical position overlooking the sea. It is absolutely spectacular. The access to the chapel requires a short climb but is not as bad as it looks. However if you are not too agile don't be put off. The location can still be enjoyed from the near by parking area where there is a small bar. The visit to the castle is a must for those looking for a stunningly beautiful destination and the coastal run is worth the effort.

Greece,AlyGNorthWales,Monolithos Castle,3.0,This is such a beautiful place with amazing views but a few safety rails would be a good idea.

Greece,K L,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"This wonderful castle that hosts compelling views and a wealth of history is located on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Rhodean coastline. It is a fairly long drive to get there, but it is definitely worth a visit!

To get into the castle requires an un-barriered and un-railed uphill walk that is perhaps not best suited for young children or those with mobility difficulties. Although the castle is better, it’s not a total disappointment for those that cannot to go up as the view is also stunning from the road.

It can be a bit windy in the castle but it has an amazing atmosphere, mainly because of the way it frames the amazing view. Also take care if you head out the other side of the castle to the cliff edge as it lacks barriers.

Parking is free on the roadside and so is entry to the site. It is generally not too busy due to being away from the resorts. Also there is a cafe outside on the road with a toilet for its customers or on a pay to enter basis.

I found coming here made a fantastic change from spending another morning at the resort. It is definitely worth a visit for people wishing to get out and explore the island!

Greece,Cheryl G,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"To be utterly honest we didn't climb to the castle, as, having spent the entire day before in Rhodes Old Town, our legs simply couldn't take it.

All I can say however, is the views are out of this world and by all accounts the climb is worth it.

My images are from the roadside but this is the first place we will go to see when we return.

Very strange though is the piles of stones left by visitors. I asked the guide why these were here and he had no explanation other than to say that everyone does it. Suffice to say that before we left there were at least 10 different stone piles of various shapes and sizes left by my kids - some carefully balanced in trees. Sounds wacky and it is but good fun and nice to think they will probably still be there as I type!,Aug 2014

Greece,LucyGuy,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"We drove from Kalithea (1 hour 45 mins away), crossing the island and driving down the Western coast. The drive was incredible - an amazing coastal road right next to the sea like in the movies, and plenty of places to stop for photo opportunities if you wanted to.
As you go away from the coast you find yourself wondering up the hills, where the road wiggles it's way through for some seriously exhilirating driving (don't get carried away as there are sharp corners that are rarely signposted - hairpin bends are common!).
Monolithos offers some great views but we think the drive was more impressive.
The castle was quite easy to find, quite well signposted, but get there early as when we left the small, narrow roads were getting a bit packed up with coaches and loads of rental cars. No toilets nearby that we could see, and the café at the base of the castle didn't seem to have any either.
The castle itself was quite interesting and you were free to wonder around, but if you have young children keep hold of them as there are sheer drops from the edge of the castle down the cliff! It was free admission so a good attraction, but as we have stated, it was the drive there that was the best!
Finally, the beach signposted at the base of the castle is well worth a visit, but be extremely careful on the road down as it is a single track road with sheer drops and very tight bends. If you don't feel overly confident driving this isn't for you! The signpost says 'caves' and whilst there are some, it's one our two scattered around instead of a cave system. Fun to explore the rock though, but sensible footwear is a must.
We stopped at the little café van for an ice lolly to cool down - friendly staff and the toilet facility (for customers only) was in very good condition!
4 out of 5 stars because for us it was the drive that took our breath away instead of the attraction.

Greece,Karen K,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"A free ancient site, well worth a visit for the spectacular views from the castle and all along its approach. Rhodes has some magnificent coastline and from this vantage point in the mountains you can't get anything better.

The castle is not for the feint hearted as it is a very steep climb with well worn steps, also a health and safety nightmare in that children need to be held as there are sheer drops with no guard rails. Extreme caution needs to be exercised. Once over the shock, the views are spectacular.
If you're in the mountains, go have a look.

We returned to the safety of the village and instead had an excellent lunch at a local taverna.
Admittedly, the castle offers stunning views over the bay and the surrounding landscape... for hikers and climbers well worth a visit! But since there's nothing to hang on to or hold on to when you climb to the castle, we did not want to risk an accident!
You have to be pretty fit to undertake the climb...

After you're done here, drive down the hill to the sea … there's a lovely beach on the right just past the switchbacks. We had it practically to ourselves for several hours. Such a beautiful place.

Greece,howiet1971,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"I loved Monolithos Castle; built by the Knights of St John in the 1490's and was never defeated. The climb from the bottom is not as high as it looks, but as it's in the most beautiful location it has beautiful views over the sea, making the climb well worth it. The castle wall itself is small, but if you have aproper look around there are a few secrets to be found. (Hidden rooms) There are also 2 churches amongst the ruins, one of which is in perfect condition, the other ruined but provides one of the most iconic images on the island in my opinion. (See my photos). It's quite far off the beaten track, but there is a lovely taverna at the bottom of the climb with a great menu.
Word of warning; do not let your children or dogs run on their own up there; there are sheer drops with no safety guards.

Greece,lotte b,Monolithos Castle,2.0,"I agree, in all the languages, with the reviews of the fantastic ruins and the spectacular view. But I went there with a very energetic four year old, and it was pretty horrifying! No signs of warning, that this place has no railings or fences keeping the smaller children from sudden James Bond-villain-like death over cliff-edge. Literally, she was a few steps away from running over the edge!
So, consider if this is a place to bring small or young children, who may not have the respect for heights, that older ones have. There is nothing but your arms to protect them. Afraid of heights? sure I am, but for me it was OK. But my motherinstincts were in a state of highest alert.

Greece,metaxa27,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"Monolithos is located at the southern end of the island on the west coast. As it's away from most of the tourist areas the number of visitors it gets is relatively small but well worth the journey getting there. Perched upon a small promontory there is a well worth path that leads up to the castle ruin and the small church of Saint Panteleimon. The path is not the best especially at the top so dcent footwear is advisable. Probably not advisable for small children as there are a number of areas where there is no protection and quite a fall. The views of the coastline from the top are worth the climb as is a brief visit to the church. Wait for the daily bus tour to disappear and you could have the place to yourselves. Before the climb there is a small taverna serving snacks and although it does have toilets there is a small charge for those you use the facilities but don't buy anything. leading up to the castle there are now a number of small stalls selling local wine, honey and other products. prices are not too bad but the number of them appearing spoils the atmosphere a little.

There is a church which is definately worth going in and maybe lightning a candle. When you leave there are a couple of roadside stalls selling the local honey, the thyme one is really good, as is the olive oil, I buy it because its good but I know every euro counts to the locals who are trying to make a living.

Greece,Casper Kirketerp-Helenius,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"Get ready for some mountain climbing as you head through the woods for the Monolithos Castle. It was built in the 1480ies by the Knights of St John as a protective fortification, a very effective fortification one might say, as the castle was never conquered. Going there by foot gives a hint of why.

Below the mountain path, in the woods, you come across an almost symmetrical circle. As no material is given on the site, without Google, you are left to guessing, so we decided on this circle being a circle of conjuration. Less imaginative people would probably attribute this circle to a place for parking visitors horses, the ruins of a reception building perhaps, or a small fold for live stock.

Passing through the circle, a rather steep climb up a few hundred steps forming the stony stairs leading to the one-was castle, 340 meters atop the ocean.

The castle itself, unfortunately, is almost perished now. What remains, is a few wall sections and some very deteriorated foundation blocks. What is left, however, is the remains of an old chapel, overlooking the bay offering a fantastic view of the island. Also, in the middle of what must have been the courtyard, is a relatively new chapel. Here, you can donate to the chapel as well as light a candle and send a thought to someone near and dear.

The site is very serene, and beautiful and we quickly decided that the otherwise hot walk up the stairs was well worth the effort. Stepping close to the remains of the outer castle wall, looking over the wall and 340 meters down, gives a funny feeling in the stomach, and you cannot help but to think how many people must have given their lives to build this place some 500 years ago.

Thankfully, the place was not too crowded with tourists with time of year, which offered a lot of photo opportunities, and the views from the top of the mountain is something that can hardly be matched by any other places on the island of Rhodes.

Greece,IanBrownUK,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"Monolithos Castle is well worth the visit, just only available for the able bodied and no heart condition.

In the time of Greek Gods, many of the islanders believed this was where the Gods of Rhodes lived. Locally with the nick name of the eagles nest, when you visit you’ll see exactly why it earned its name. Found in the southern part of the island which is generally less green and far more barren, this rocky craggy mountain is one hell of a site.

The old castle is located on top of a mountain, offering some fantastic views across the sea, To say the panoramic sights are great is an understatement. They are truly breath taking. Anyone with a digital camera or one of the more professional set ups will appreciate what lays before them. Turquoise, blues of several colours await you as views across the Mediterranean deserve a good 30-40 photos..

From where you park your car, you must follow a short trail through the fragrant pine woods. Then a climb awaits you a steep stairway cut through the rock. Ten minutes of breathlessness and you are at the top of the hill which feels like a mountain! Make sure you are careful negotiating the path, to be honest if you have young children pass this one as your heart will be in your mouth on both the assent and climb down

The surprise when you reach the top is a beautiful whitewashed church as well as the what was the castle you climbed the stairs to see. If you like the type of buildings you see in the holiday brochures of Santorini, the church is worth it.. Make sure your digital camera battery is well charges as it’s a great opportunity to some truly great pictures.

Visiting Monolithos is definitely a pair of trainers or decent shoes. Wear anything else and you’re asking for trouble due to the rocky path and a fair amount of small stones just waiting to get into any ladies sandals or flip-flops. Transport this place and pathway to Cornwall and there is no way the health and safety department of the local council will allow the path to be open.

If you are taking the trouble to visit the castle at Monolithos you may as well visit Fourni beach. Most of the time you are on your own. Take some swimming gear, it is well worth it. A long and far reaching shallow sea that is only a couple of feet deep is the reward for anyone with snorkelling gear. In August and September the sea is really warm. If you are able to get yourself a picnic together, make an afternoon of it. When it’s the middle of winter in the north of Europe, it brings back so many great memories.

Greece,Reuben A,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"The view of the mount and the castle on the background of the sea and the sea coast is absolutely unique. You leave with an unforgettable impression. The way to it although slightly off the beaten track is well-worth. We didn't climb up to the castle since it was a very windy day but enjoyed the view's various angles from the surrounding road and hills. The road signs are not very generous, Unfortunately, this is true for the whole island of Rhodes and we had to ask a fruit vendor for directions. If you rent a car and tour the island,, west coast included, don't miss it.",Oct 2012

Greece,shalovesny,Monolithos Castle,4.0,"We felt the need after a couple of full days sunning ourselves by the pool to get out and about (and sit in a cool air conditioned car at the same time ) - so we started our day via Lardos village having a lovely breakfast at Yammas Bar in the square , chatting to a friendly ex pat lady and her daughter and passing the time of day with George who served us so well at Yammas.
We then drove the village of Asklipio , and up the little gravel road to the base of the ruined castle , where after our climb to the top we were rewarded with fantastic views of the village and surrounding countryside.
Continuing on our journey which took us via Apolakkia , and passing many little kiosks on the way selling the locally produced honey and Souma (firewater) - we then reached the steps leading up to the little church at Monolithos. It is quite a hike to the top , especially in the heat , but if you take your time , the peace and quaintness of the little church and the view of the surrounding coastline is well worth it . You are able to light a candle at the church and leave messages and prayers.
After stopping off for ice creams and drinks at the little cafe at the bottom of the steps , we then carried on down the very winding road which took us down th the beach at Fourni , where we spent an hour or so sunbathing (so pack your beach towels) and dodging the huge waves ( take care as the surf is quite rough - we were finding stones and sand for days in our swimwear , despite having rinsed them out!)
Fourni is very picturesque , but we found that we kept getting little bites from sand mites there , so be aware of this.
There is a little cantina on the beach selling crisps and drinks etc.
Worth a visit , and don't forget to look for the huge balancing boulder on the beach.

Food options are limited to sandwiches and fries on the beach, or a (very) near by sit-down restaurant. The atmosphere is relaxed here and the spot seems popular with locals. Be advised, you’ll be driving narrow, steep, and windy roads to here but it’s worth it. Luxury boats pass by regularly and we noticed several vips being flown to nearby resorts by helicopter. The water is very clear a little further from shore. Beach has all imaginable amenities including easily accessible shower. Food prices are reasonable at the restaurant.

so if in the hours that the sun is very strong you can avoid it.
It is a very Wide Bay you'll feel free and relaxed. In spite of the wind typical of this period of the Year We didn't Find any single Wave I was quite like a swimming pool transparent with Little fish joking and hoping you have some Little Bread for them. The only difficult Thing is the street down very inclinated so drive slow . But this is like all over Greek islands is known that most of the beaches are down and you going inclinated.
But when you arrive down the panorama the atmosphere is delicious de colours of the water the relaxing environment . if you decide to go be sure to bring with you dry pet food there are a couple of Beautiful Funny Cats around that will appreciated !! as it is a little isolated the place They also needed. 👍

Greece,David H,Agrari Beach,4.0,"We've visited here a number of times over the years. It has always been quiet and relatively undeveloped and has drawbacks. The sand is coarse and the entry into the sea isn't that easy except at certain points. The drive down is steep and not for the nervous, but you can always come by water taxi.
The right hand end has always attracted naturists wanting a quiet time and no music, but the recliners were not good, and lacked a decent cushion. However in 2017 they now come with a thick cushion and are a bargain at €20 a day for two and the umbrellas are good and thick so you get good shade. There's enough room to move the recliners around to keep the shade, or the sun if that's what you prefer.
A very relaxing place to get an all over tan, especially now that Paranga has become noisier and less naturist friendly. If you're not comfortable with nudity, don't worry as the left hand side of the beach and the first half of the right hand side are clothes/topless only.
For food, go to the Agrari main restaurant, not the bar, and you can grab any of the ready meals like a Greek salad and they'll put it in a takeaway dish. Wine is also ok at €6.50 for a half bottle of dry red.

Greece,MykonosAgrari,Agrari Beach,3.0,"Agrari beach by itself is a gem! That said, it is very poorly managed, which might explain why it is steadily at below 50% capacity. The two local Daktylidis brothers who control the beach with their beachfront properties are at odds with each other and don't work together to provide a more satisfying experience. The Sunrise hotel on the right hand side is the better one, a simple but comfortable hotel right on the sandy beach, with a pool and a restaurant with decent Greek cooking, also served by some nice girls at the beach beds, alongside with refreshments etc. But: the largest part of the beach on that side is cordoned off for the swimming enjoyment of the patrons, for exclusive use by the public - transport type ""Kaïkia"" boats ferrying people to the southern beaches between Platys Gialos and Elia beach and for the jet ski rentals there, so that less than 20% of the entire beachfront is left for the bathers paying for the sunbeds to access the sea at the rocky part, while the better and sandy part is off - limits ""for safety reasons"". This epic fail on the part of the establishment's proprietors makes Agrari an unattractive choice to spend a day at the beach, which is why it's largely empty and mainly frequented by the old, especially some nudists past their prime. Therefore also the sea ski and jet ski rentals are mostly idle, moreover they are overpriced. Forgettable.

The locals vouch by it and once you get there, you'll know why. It has a nice bar which serves good drinks and staff is helpful too.

Greece,David H,Agrari Beach,3.0,"We went here on the suggestion of two separate people who rated the beach as a quiet alternative to the party beaches.
On the plus side, it is peaceful. There is no music and it is not crowded.
There are two areas of recliners, one near the parking and one to the right hand end of the beach. Both are used by naturists as well as textiles and there is no conflict between the two. Prices were fair at €15 for the day for two recliners and a fixed parasol at the right hand end. The area ends with a cliff,, and this,together with a high screen behind, gives both a sense of privacy and wind protection.
On the negative side, the access to the sea is steep, the sand is coarse, and the recliners are not that comfortable (but they are better in the area in front of the bar). There is no service to the recliners, but you can order from the bar and carry to your spot. Our Greek salad at €9 was OK but the wine was awful. I asked for their driest white and was charged €25 for a bottle of Muscat, the label on which I only read after spitting our the first mouthful!
So in summary, if you want a quiet spot for an all over tan then bring your own food and drink and have a cheap day on the beach. If you are looking for service and a gentler swimming spot then go to Paranga or Elia, both close by.

Greece,Zolou25,Agrari Beach,4.0,"We returned several times here during our holiday. The sunbeds are 20€ for 2, which seems to be standard on the island.

Greece,ellenzb,Agrari Beach,3.0,"Nice beach but we had to walk through the gay,nude area to get to our restaurant on Elia beach. It was about 7pm and unfortunately my son viewed 3 men engaged in sexual relations! I am 100% for gay equality and have no prejudice whatsoever. However, gay or straight, there is no need to do this in public! Fortunately I was more traumatised than my son was! I was not ready for him to have this sort of education!",Aug 2016
Greece,Sciake S,Agrari Beach,3.0,"The beach itself is nice but not nicer than most of the rest of the southern beaches of the island. Plus, the service both on the beach and at the bar is surprisingly unfriendly and unprofessional, especially by Mykonos standards. Final touch: the music played loudly from the bar is really cheap radio-type dance music.
If you decide to go there, avoid the bar/ beach bed area you have to go through as you enter and either go left for the free beach or right to the other beach bed area.
The restaurant in the back is just ok, a pricy and just decent self-service joint.",Aug 2016

Beautiful, no music, families, couples, solos....
Excellent beach services.

Greece,Chrissie B,Agrari Beach,4.0,"It's quite a winding road to get to but worth it. Plenty of parking.you are directed through an entrance sign onto the beach via the Agrari beach bar. We didn't take advantage of the sunloungers and umbrellas but turned to the left to find a sandy spot which was unoccupied as there is an area for those who want to do their own thing. We did notice nude and topless bathers but it didn't bother us. They sunbathe on the rocks.I don't know how much the price was for the sunbeds. The sand is not fine so it falls off your skin easily. It was a bit breezy but that was very welcome. It's a bit steep into the water .Sandy underfoot then falls away. Then there is a ledge of seaweed which makes it shallow again. It's a really nice beach. Kids playing and local family groups. Would come back again. Not as hectic as some of the beaches on the island.

There were only 4 other people there because of the time of year and it was a gorgeous and relaxing day!",May 2016
Greece,Tim P,Agrari Beach,4.0,"Got the boat from Gialus here and thought the beach was wonderful. The boat trip itself is well worth doing.

Very quiet, clear water... Wonderful for a peaceful afternoon. My sons (15& 12) enjoyed the water and snorkelling around the rocks with the set they bought for €10 at a shop in town.

The restaurant there was very nice, and the bar served me a really strong mojito. He sunbed say we're €15 for 2, and plenty of beach for towels if u don't want to pay this

Definitely the nicest beach we have seen so far here (am not into party and poser beaches)

The sand is more like fine gravel, so do bring flip flops for walking across it... But don't let that put you off.

There is also a place doing rubber rings, jet boats and jet shoes .... Very quiet when I was there (it was a Monday, but still half term week in late May)

Greece,cbass88,Agrari Beach,4.0,Agrarian beach has beautiful clear water and a really nice rocky back drop. The day we were there had a bunch of gay men who were all nude. It didn't bother us as there are plenty of places to lay a towel down away from the nudists. The trek back up the road was really difficult by ATV as we had to push it up the hill in several spots. The water is gorgeous and the beach was very quiet. I would just take a car or scooter.,Sep 2015

Greece,duhoz,Agrari Beach,4.0,"Smaller and more relaxing beach than neighboring Elia and partly nude as as Elia. Sun beds with umbrella available also a restaurant. Water crystal clear.
No loud music, you will find nice, quite and peaceful beach and not crowded partly because the beach is not easy to access by bus. Even it is just aprox 400 meters from Elia to drive there it is about 7 km from Ano Mera village on winding road or the same distance from the airport direction. To get there is best to take a frequent public bus to Elia beach ( Mykonos northern bus station) walk right over the beach and the rocky trail (easy 5 minutes walk).

Greece,Mark Y,Agrari Beach,4.0,"The beach does not have fine sand and it is very windy. But it is quiet and if you fancy reading a book on one of the sun lounges there are quite a few to choose from. There is no thumping beach music here, just a quiet bar and a quiet restaurant at the back. The restaurant food is not great - perhaps slightly more adventurous that what you get in a self service counter (which it is by the way, to our surprise).",Jul 2015
Greece,Walter R,Agrari Beach,4.0,"Wonderful beach but difficult to get there. Usually a 30' bus plus 20' walk or 10' bus and 45' in a boat.
This summer they finally put a shuttle services supposedly to get there in 20'.
Schedule was departure at noon. Arrived at the departure location 11.40pm. There was no one. We were 5 waiting there.... Around 12.25 someone told us that the shuttle had been filled in by 11.30am and they left, without leaving a single sign saying there would be no more services this day.
Ended up arriving at the beach 2.15pm.
So if you really want to go to agrari, go the two long ways because those people are totally not reliable and without any respect to the tourists.
Returning from the beach I stopped at their office to complain and I did not even get ... ""We are sorry"".
Services is called Mykonos Transfer Services to the beaches.
DO NOT use them.

Greece,Nicholas S,Agrari Beach,4.0,"Beach wasn't too busy in mid June. During our stay it was very windy most beaches seemed to be affected, even this one. Definitely worth a visit if you plan on snorkelling as there is an abundance of fish life.",Jun 2015
Greece,Ukienomad,Agrari Beach,4.0,"A medium stretch of pebbly beach that is quieter than most but you may see topless woman and nude men laying on the beach. Not a problem for us but if you don't want your children seeing this then don't come to this beach. There are others. The beach does have a lovely secluded bar with not too loud music and nice ambiance. They also have a restaurant that is more of a cafeteria style where the foodies laid out, you pick what you want, they heat it up and bring it to you. You can take the water taxi to get to this beach from any of the other beaches on this island. Today it was very, very windy and very uncomfortable to stay for a long time. They said today was worse than usual but I would. It come to this beach again even though I rated it very good. It is a nice beach with a nice bar and restaurant. You can also rent beach chairs and umbrella for 15 Euros a day. Have fun!

Greece,Ghassan N,Agrari Beach,5.0,"we were honestly a bit afraid about going there due the the numerous reports of rude staff/owner... but then, we found the loveliest spot in mykonos... to begin with, the staff was very friendly, we ran into the owner/manager on our way out,we wanted to talk to him about the reviews, he just didnt understand,and neither did we. he was probably not the nicest person on earth, but far from being rude...
now to the beach... a spot in paradise... very very relaxing place, no loud music,no loud kids, we actually slept in the sun for an hour. the lounges are very comfortable, same prices as in all mykonos (6 euros per person if i can remember well). if you dont want one,you ll have your own space on the left of the beach to sit on your towel (surely no fees). the menu consisted of drinks and sandwiches, tasty and fairly priced. no fancy menu. the sea is amazing and the underwater views will take your breath away!! its a clothing optional beach, but not a lot of nudists but a fair amount of semi nudists are there. this being said, it was still extremely decent, no profanities, nothing annoying,every one calmly relaxing and minding their own businesses. will definitely go back to this place!

It has beach chairs and sun umbrellas for day-rental (12 Euro for the set), as well as bar service. Avoid the self-service restaurant at any cost....while the setting is gorgeous, it is a horrendous tourist trap with high prices. When here, one is at the mercy of the greedy proprietor/manager/cashier who charges whatever he feels he can get away with. A Mykonos embarrassment.

A small beach, not easily reached, ideal for all those that are just trying to lay down in the sun, grab a book and have silence around. This is Agrari. You can reach it through the neighboring beach of Elia (by bus or boat), or directly, if you are driving. It is not a gay beach, but gay friendly probably. A few families are seen, since the area is being developed and houses are popping here and there. Nudism is allowed, but nor compulsory, and I guess it is not a trend anymore. I was there last June, and Mykonos was not at its full speed yet. So, if you go in August, it may not be that quiet. Go and enjoy the sun and the peace Agrari offers!
