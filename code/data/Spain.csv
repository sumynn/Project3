Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,5.0,"This is worth the visit To Barcelona on its own!

Is place is so beautiful, I was almost moved to tears when I saw the inside.

Please visit here! It’s well worth the 24€",Nov 2021
Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,5.0,This definitely a must visit place. I highly recommend the audio tour. So many interesting facts about the building and its history. Do not miss!,Sep 2021
Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,5.0,"It seems to be taking forever but each time we come back to The Sag Fam there seems to be tantalisingly more to see and marvel at. On our visit we were told that the continued expansion apparently horrifies local residents who consider that since Gaudi has been dead for a hundred years, perhaps his plans and creative flow can be disregarded before they become uncontrollably libertine. And yet looking up at both inside and out, particularly the outside, the skill and ingenuity of the sculptures, the scale and proportion of the spires, particularly the one that may become twice as high as all the rest, there is no doubt that it’s a marvel that should not be stunted as it glides through its prime. Of course there is an evolution, most wonderfully demonstrated by comparing the two ends.

Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,5.0,"On our last trip to Barcelona 10 years ago we only went to look on the outside as we hadn't been organised enough to get tickets, so this time I made sure I booked them ahead of our trip!

The audio tour was good, explaining everything to you, although we did get a bit lost at times of what we were suppose to be looking at! In the end we just walked around being amazed at what we were looking at, and there was really so much to look at! We were there around 11am and the sun shining through the stained glass windows was amazing - definitely a good time to visit.

I would highly recommend visiting - it was one of the highlights of our trip.

Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,5.0,"We have visited before and perhaps due to the pandemic or because they did prior, but the experience was much less chaotic than it used to be. The audio guides on your own devices and better entrance process makes it all much easier. As before, we had made advanced reservations - which is definitely recommended

The experience inside and out is uplifting and awe inspiring. I would love to go up in the tower, however that portion not available due to COVID. Next time!",Nov 2021
Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,5.0,This basilica is amazing! It is very difficult to comprehend how one man could come up with such fascinating and amazing architecture and design! The audio guide was spot on with the details and the fact that you could use your mobile phone instead of a player was nice too. I hope to return when we can once again experience the towers from a higher vantage point.,Oct 2021
Spain,Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,4.0,"I have been to the Basilica twice (note that you can buy the tickets for half the price mentioned here direct from their website). It was really a special experience the first time with the colored glass and music, and then the museum below. The museum is really fascinating.

On 2nd visit, I felt like the employees were not too polite in screening us through - and felt even at 25 eu it was too expensive. The music is sporadic. Its always full of people taking cell pictures. You can't go up any of the staircases.",Oct 2021
Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We came here with a local friend. There was so much art to discover as we aren’t Spanish art connoisseurs. It opened up the whole new world of art for us. Among great less known artists, you will, of course, see works of world-known Goya, Velazquez, El Greco, Bosch.",Nov 2021
Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"The Prado is superb, really worth the visit. Taking the guided tour really helped understand it so much better and Elias our guide brought it to life in such a fantastic way. It was definitely worth having the guided tour and skip the line tickets.",Nov 2021
Spain,Prado National Museum,3.0,"A great museum, but its current state knocks off two stars. Too many things are ""closed"" without any advanced warning. Lots of construction and lots of noise. With so many things closed, we felt let down by the overall offering.",Nov 2021

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"I was able to visit l the museum this past month ( October). Very nice painter, history and art, you can find some of the most important art , I recommend this museum for sure. The staff is friendly , at the entry you leave your belongings specially if you are using a backpack or larger purse. There was a complementary entry to the "" copy of la Mona Lisa"" at the museum, no photos are allowed to take. There is also a cafeteria if you get hungry with different choices to eat. The museum uses a protocoles due to covid, nothing different from others places( wear your mask , hand sanitizer stands etc ) Had a very great time!

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"From my first visit in 1977 when I spent 4 days studying, sketching, absorbing as much as possible as an art studio to my visit in 2008 and now this year, this collection is still one of the most important to visit. Its collection of european and spanish masters is unrivaled, or at least commensurate with the kunsthistoriche in vienna.
there seems too much to see in too little time even when i spend the whole day there.",Oct 2021
Spain,Prado National Museum,2.0,"Bought tickets via the internet through a third party site.
Prado refused to honor our tickets, the only reason they gave is that its not their company, not their problem - valid tickets i muat add. When i asked to speak to the manager the person in the cubicle suddenly forgot all her english and had us removed by security. This is the first time that happened to me (there is a first time for anything i guess) and i dont appreciate being humiliated just because you cant work with your own vendors. The service you peovide is terrible and you should think about doing some upgrades because it is embarassing.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"Without down one of the greatest art museums in the world the Prado hosts a splendid array of classical art and includes original works of many a great artist such as Titian, El Greco, Goya, Tintoretto, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens, Velázquez to name a few, practically a who’s who of the art world.

Each room hosts a treasure of arts that all deserves your attention and depending on your time restriction, don’t try and see everything in one go as you just won’t appreciate it. As well as paintings there are fine sculptures and exhibits to enjoy. What I would say is don’t rush your visit and allow yourself at least 2 hours to enjoy all that the museum has to offer.

Step outside the museum to pay homage to one on its best contributors the statue of Francisco Goya and admire the architecture of the museum itself.

Booking can be quite easy now as you can go on the museum website and book a time and date you wish to visit. You then get sent an email with a barcode that gets scanned on arrival. This cuts down on queueing and makes the museum experience just that little bit more enjoyable

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"The Prado is a major museum, yet, it is not as vast as the Luvre or the Met, which makes a visit much more manageable.
Even someone who is not an art hisorian will be awed by the number of masterpieces they'll recognize: Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights, Velasquez's Las Maninas, Goya's clothed and nude Maja, and many many more.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,We had a guided tour. Our guide was fantastic. She had a mixed group of English and Spanish speaking group members. She did an excellent job in taking the time to show us all the high points of the museum and gave each group ample time and explanation of the various works. If you get a guide that has to split the group into two languages don't get frustrated and complain. Just think of how exhausting it is for the guide. This museum is so huge and overwhelming that I really appreciated having a guide to show us the important works that I may have missed had I done the visit on my own,Sep 2021

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"It’s the Prado—The art is magnificent. Go. However, I would have enjoyed it much more with a guide. There is just so much to see and it’s overwhelming. We purchased 2 tickets on line — one just a regular ticket and the other including a guide, which is an actual book with pictures and text about the exhibit. It’s beautiful and informative ( and heavy) but not really a guide to get the most out of the museum. So we just went through the second floor looking at the art and reading plaques. It seemed that part of the Goya collection was closed. As of now, there are no audio tours at all, and no guided tours in English. At 3:00 in the afternoon, it wasn’t crowded.

The staff inform you - in a bored and unfriendly, some even very rude voice - the tickets are ""sold out"". I do not get the concept of selling out if we are talking about something that is free, not mentioning the fact you actually need a ticket - but no information signs located on the building itself actually mention this. Of course all of this is just to push tourists into getting a paid ticket - the locals were simply let in. VERY BAD & FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE!",Sep 2021

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"How can anyone criticize this magnificent museum? However, I felt there was a heavy slant to their collection: religious themes, allegorical figures. They main central halls had impressive large paintings by Rubens.

Spain,Prado National Museum,3.0,"We spent 4 hoursin the museum, it is huge, but it does not have too much variety. Mostly religion-themed paintings or portraits. There were some amazing and very famous pictures in Prado, but overall I got bored of the theme of the paintings at the end.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"I gotta say I know you must visit when in Madrid, but having said that it isnt my favorite. (But thats another article.)
Why must you visit- well there are always gorgeous temporary exhibits. There is the Bosch room, the Vazquez galleries, and the large corridor full of renaissance and later masterpieces from Durer, Goya, and Rubens. (Goya's Saturn devouring his Son is here, quietly hanging on the wall, ready to shock and delight, as good art should.)
If you want to learn about Spanish painters, this is your place.
(I do wish there were more classic and ancient art, and currently with Covid some rooms are closed.) But there is so much to see. Not to be missed also are the grounds and surrounding neighborhood.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"The museum, one of the largest in the world. It was founded in 1819 by King Ferdinand VII at the request of his second wife, Maria Isabella Braganza. We will see paintings by the greatest masters of the brush. A great collection of classical paintings from the 11th to the 20th century from all over Europe. Spanish, Flemish, French and German paintings are richly represented there. The museum houses paintings by Goya, Velazquez, El Greco, Rubens, Breughel, Bosch, Sorolla and many others. The museum has two cafes and a restaurant, a gift shop and a bookstore. I advise you to spend a whole day visiting this museum. If someone wants to see all the works very carefully, including reading descriptions, one day may not be enough. You cannot enter the museum with larger bags, backpacks, but you can leave them in the cloakroom free of charge. The museum offers free admission from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. and on Sundays from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. However, then there may be a long line to enter. A beautiful museum.

Spain,Prado National Museum,1.0,"After calling the museum to check if accompanying students can come in for free, we booked the online tickets a day ahead so that we didn't have to wait in line. At the entrance, the museum staff made us go back to the ticket counter for the free student tickets. Even with the student ID having photo and date of birth, they still insisted on showing the holder's passport or ID.

When we tried to scan the QR code of the museum floor map at the information counter, only the Spanish version was available. We asked if an English version was available, and the lady behind the counter rudely answered that Spanish was an international language and we should just figure it out from that map. We asked another staff later, and he told us that the English version is on the museum's website. The website also failed to point out that currently most parts of the museum are closed, and so we were not able to see some of the important works from the permanent collection. The museum staff is probably the rudest and most unhelpful, following museum visitors around and prohibiting photo-taking, which is contrary to the practice at other places like the Louvre or Rijksmuseum that allows non-flash photography. Worst of all, since we were not allowed to take photos, they didn't have enough postcards of the important works at the museum shop. The museum should either let visitors take photos, or add the selection of its postcards!

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"Visited on a weekday in June 2021, arrived about 30 minutes before opening to see less than 10 people in line for tickets.

The ticket prices list a general admission and a general admission with a guide. I thought the guide options was a person. it is actually a very thick book cataloging the collection. After I finished my visit and was in the bookshop on the way out I discovered this (and that the book is much cheaper when purchase d with your ticket. By my estimate about 75% of the galleries were open.

The Velazquez and Goya collections were the highlights of my visit - far exceeding by count and breadth anything I had seen elsewhere. I was also surprised by the amount of Flemish painters (Jordaens, Rubens, Van Dyke, Brueghel, etc).

I spent about 2 hours walking through the galleries at a leisurely pace and stopping when a work caught my eye.

When brought up to the staff they just said it wasn't their problem and shoved us out the door. Staff in the museum was pretty rude and follow you around like a criminal wherever you go. I went May 2021, tourism in Spain is just starting up again so the place was pretty empty and I could literally tell staff would follow me around room to room which felt very strange.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"I spent most of the day at the Prado, the national art museum of Spain. I saw all the great painters including my favorites, Velasquez, de Goya, and Rembrandt. We started in the morning, left for lunch, and then spent the entire afternoon here. Eight hours and we couldn't see it all.
No photos allowed. Handicapped access in most areas.
Bathrooms are adequate but I did not see bathrooms with access. I keep forgetting that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not apply here. I'm so used to facilities with access that it's strange when a restaurant or attraction doesn't have them.
I didn't see any American painters.
I was so happy to cross an item like this off my bucket list.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"Like a sibling of the Louvre in Paris: it's a very large museum but keeps you amazed at the variety and beauty of the spanish, italian, dutch and french classic art. There isn't any reason why you wouldn't visit the Prado in Madrid, unless you've seen it many times or if you're here for a very short visit.",Mar 2020
Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We recently visited the museum and it was totally worth it. The staff was very helpful and the art work was beautiful and well preserved. If you are on a budget, I recommend going early and getting a free pass for the evening. Totally worth checking out.",Jan 2021
Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"One of the amazing things about Madrid is that galleries like the Prado and Reina Sofia offer free evenings. This is a wonderfully generous gesture.
Between 6-8pm, entry is free every evening (3-5 on Sun). There are 7000+ paintings so it’s barely enough time to scratch the surface and it works best if you already have a few ‘must-sees’ in mind.
This was our experience:
i) we had only arrived in Madrid late that afternoon so on a whim, we thought we’d take our chances at lining up for the Prado. We arrived at 5:30pm and the line was already along the side of the building.
ii) They started letting people in at 6pm and it took just under 30 mins for us to collect a ticket (which you have to do even though its free), pass through security, check in a bag and be inside the gallery, ready to go
iii) Unlike Barcelona, you don't have to pre-book for free tickets, you can just turn up
iv) a map of the floorplan was available from the front desk and was very helpful. You’ll need this because the room numbers do not follow a logical sequence and would have been horribly confusing without the map.
v) no photos are allowed at all – none at all. They are very strict about this
vi) Information in each room is excellent so audio-guides are not an essential
vii) In 1 ½ hours, we only had time for the highlights. We started with Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights (Room 56A) and Fra Angelico’s Annunciation, next door in Room 56B. From there, we went upstairs to see Valezquez’ Las Meninas and his paintings of the Spanish kings and royal family (Room12), then onto Titian, Tintoretto and Rubens in Rooms 25-29. Finally we shot down to Goya’s Third of May (Room 65)
viii) it wasn't on our must-see but I made a quick diversion in to see Valezquez’ portraits of court buffoons, jesters, and dwarves in Room 15. It was unexpectedly poignant and gave new insights into an aspect of court life that I mightn’t have otherwise thought about
ix) ‘Auto-da-fe in Plaza Mayor’ (Room 16A) also caught my eye. It showed an incredibly detailed scene of an Inquisition held on 30 June 1680. It was so interesting to have this scene in mind when visiting the Plaza Mayor later on.
x) After the gallery closed, we headed up Calle des Heurtas where lots of bars and were open and had dinner at Casa Alberto. A great finish to the evening.

And they mean it. No lockers, and no commercial locker facilities nearby. Back to hotel, drop backpack, back to museum. When I initially got my ticket, I was told I could return to get a *timed* ticket to enter the special exhibit. I asked what time I needed to return to ensure I got a ticket, and they said at latest an hour before closing at 8pm. Not knowing how long I would be in main museum, I chose not to get a timed ticket. When I went back to get ticket for special exhibition at 5:15pm I was told none were available. I asked if I could get one for the next day. No, sorry. That's a bummer. And why are photos not allowed???

The entrance prices are very reasonable for such an iconic place (especially for older people) and the cafe prices are mid-range for a tourist centre.

I visited in a pandemic and the rules were strictly enforced, in a professional and helpful way, ensuring visitors had their safety prioritised.

It was a huge bonus to find the gallery very uncrowded and to see these great paintings easily from any distance or angle. I visited twice, the second time I signed up for a guided tour with ‘The Best of Madrid’ and I learnt a lot from a friendly, warm and very knowledgeable guide.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"El Prado is one of the greatest art museums in the world, and not as crowded as the Louvre.

It houses a wonderful collection of works by Francisco Goya, Hieronymus Bosch, El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens, Titian, and Diego Velázquez. In early-March, on my third visit over the last three decades, I finally got to fully appreciate Goya. The clothed and nude Majas are nice, but his two large paintings (“El Dos de Mayo” and “El Tres de Mayo”) are powerful. Goya was the first major painter to depict war in its full horror.

Because we arrived early, I was able to really appreciate ""Las Meninas,"" Velazquez's iconic and mysteriously complex painting that is judged by some as the greatest painting in western civilization. Not far, you can find ""Las Lanzas” (The Surrender of Breda), another Velazquez masterpiece.

Then there is Bosch’s disturbingly iconic “Garden of Earthly Delights.” The Prado is said to have six of Bosch’s best known two-dozen works. Regier Van der Weydn’s “The Descent from the Cross” has been restored to its original magnificence, and Fra Angelico’s “The Annunciation” is resplendent in its original brilliant colors. Then, there was El Greco’s emblematic “Nobleman with Handkerchief on Chest,” as well as an exhibit on “El Greco and Modern Painting.”

Give yourself plenty of time, and pace yourself. It is worth spending a full day here. There is a a café in the museum, and the gift/book shops are tremendous.

Even the building, which dates back to 1819 is an exquisite structure that perfectly complements the art and sculptures on display.

There is a lot of walking involved and many of the exhibit rooms do not provide seating. However, time just flew by as I felt privileged to view the world class work of some of the most talented artists in history. Photographs are not allowed inside. However, complimentary brochures as well as books for sale are available which provide a summary of some of the art displayed.

There are many masterpieces here. So many we were there for 7 hours including breaks. Towards they end they tend to blur. There are a lot of religious type paintings (not surprising given the history) and ones of patrons (ie rich families paying the artists way!). If you've not looked at much art before it could be overwhelming, but thankfully the leaflet highlights the major works (around 50!) and you can focus on hunting those down.

We went during a non-school or other holiday period weekday and it was busy. We bought tickets the day before directly from the gallery as we were passing by and saved a little bit of money compared to buying from an agency or kiosk. I think it was €15.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We only had a couple of hours to visit the Museum. My friend wanted to concentrate on Goya.luckily, there was a major Goya's Drawings exhibit in the house.
Aside from the main mayor Hoya paintings on the permanent exhibit, the drawings were very extensive and the hot ticket at the moment.
"" Solo la Voluntad me Sobra' (""Only My Strength of Will Remains"") is the name of the exhibit. With more than 300 drawings is a rare and unique exhibition.
It was prepared to celebrate the 200 Anniversary of El Prado.

We also saw art by Velazquez, Rembrandt, Raphael, Titan, etc, walking through the Galleries.

El Prado like any major Museum in the world cannot be grasped at once. I have visited a number of times throughout the years and is always a new experience. Until next time, I hope soon.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"After the Musee d’Orsay in Paris, The Prado is probably my favorite art museum as it contains some excellent examples of Renaissance giants while still managing to focus on noteworthy national artists like Goya, Velazquez, Dali, etc. Seniors can purchase half-price vouchers online and redeem them for entry at windows 1 and 2 at the Goya entrance (north end). It is well worth one’s time to spend some time on The Prado’s website to identify which works one especially wants to see and then map out a route to them on the museum floor plan which can also be downloaded. Entry is free the last 2 hours every day but expect entry lines to be long and galleries crowded during peak travel times; we found it worthwhile to purchase discounted senior tickets and visit over the lunch hour (1 to 3pm) as crowds were light.

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"We were fortunate to walk up to the museum with no lines and literally walked right in. The building is large, so fuel up and wear comfortable shoes to maximize your enjoyment. The collection is massive and the galleries are not layed out in a grid so the audio guide may be a good additional expenditure. However, the majority of the pieces on display have plaques in English which is nice for non-Spanish speakers.
Most of the collections pre-date the 1700s and as can be expected are strongly religious in nature.
The Guide Book is very comprehensive (and heavy) but makes for a great reference guide if you have space in your bag.

The Goya gallery was perhaps the most entertaining. What a weird view of the world he had. What I liked most in the museum was the architecture of the rooms and the beautiful artwork of some of the frames.

The Prado's walls are lined with masterpieces from the Spanish, Italian and Flemish schools, including Velázquez’ Las Meninas and Goya’s Third of May, 1808. Its collection comprises 8,600 paintings and over 700 sculptures, so I recommend deciding what you want to see before stepping into the museum. If you are short on time, the Prado's website suggests three itineraries, lasting 1, 2 and 3 hours and covering the museum's most important masterpieces, which for me came really handy. Paintings by Rubens, the Bruegel Family, Jordaens and Teniers. The museum also boasts works by some of the great French, German and Dutch painters including Dürer, Claude Lorrain, Rembrandt and Watteau.

The Prado contains works by many famous artists, with a predominance of Spanish works, including Goya, Rubens, Bosch and my favourite, Velázquez. It’s most famous painting is “Las Meninas” by Diego Velázquez.

The colección is superb
The cafe and restaurant are very good for the type of fare they serve
Book store assortment and employees very good
Now to the ugliness of the reception staff seating behind their grandiose counter in the newer entrance was appalling
After asking 2 different workers a question on 2 different visits I made a point to see if one of then will be nice and or at least helpful
No
Not one of the people behind that counter was interested on just being nice
I resort to simply ask the policeman/policewoman stationed around
Yes tourists may be overwhelming but at the same time if you are a attendant at a desk you should sport a bit of patience and warm
Certainly will never ask a question there
The rest of the personal was nice informed and helpful

Room after room, the Prado contains some of the most important Spanish and European work's spanning from the Twelfth-Century through Twentieth-Century and displayed gorgeously.

The works of art vary in size but it's the enormous hung piece's that amaze me the most, their sheer size alone is impressive... with each painting meticulously lit, showing the artist's master piece's.

You don't have to have an art degree from a fancy university to find the Prado amazing, there really is something inside its walls for everyone and every age... there are private tours, audio tours [many languages] one can visit and meander in a style best suited to you.

The Prado's location is also great to walk around with plenty of restaurants to deliciously fill your bellies after filling your mind with stunning works of art.

I highly recommend the Prado solo, friends, couples and families... and worth a visit every trip to Madrid.

Enjoy every adventure ahead of you and the diversity our planet offers

The museum exposition was unforgettable. Goya,and Velasquez, Velasquez and Goya. We explored, or visually and emotionally inhaled them.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"Smaller than the Louvre and less glamorous, the Prado is quite a beautiful art museum, one that I dreamed about visiting for decades. I was pleasantly impressed and it did not dissapoint.
Buying in advance a ""skip the line"" admission will save you significant time which, is a very precious advantage, considering the limited hours a tourist has for roaming the city. You may be able to breeze through most of the galleries in two to three hours, depending, of course, on the time you stop to admire the paintings you like most. Taking pictures inside the museum is not allowed, which may be unpleasant but understandable.
This museum has a tradition of almost 200 years and its collections were put together by Spain’s 16th- and 17th-century monarchs. What is specific to Prado is the focus on the most famous painters rather than the best known works of some. The museum organisation is unique, by period and provenience, and it has the largest holdings of Bosch, Titian, El Greco, Rubens, Velázquez, and Goya.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"This is rightfully the number one attraction in Madrid. It has an incredible selection of works of art in an impressive gallery that gives them the scale that they need to be enjoyed.
Entrance is 15 Euros and I would strongly recommend buying tickets on line in advance. The queue even in the off season is massive. There is no photography allowed, which is unusual these days. They have cloakrooms, which are compulsory for backpacks and larger bags.
Plenty of facilities.
Unless you really don't like art at all this is a must see.

Spain,Prado National Museum,2.0,"I need to start by saying that it was one of the places I wanted to visit for a very long time, especially since I love Spanish painters and they did not disappoint, but...organization in Prado is absolutely horrible. We had skip the line tickets and that part worked very well, however after we got to the museum, there was no direction on how to start the tour and once we did trying to find any logic was impossible. As a very organized person, I got extremely tired by what to me was a total chaos and despite amazing works of art, I just wanted to leave. Not sure why design is as confusing as it is, maybe there is some weird logic in it, but to me there was zero. I would say that if you are there, of course you need to visit Prado, but be aware of chaos, lack of organization and get ready for wondering around.

Spain,Prado National Museum,3.0,"You can't take anything away from the fantastic collection of art at the Prado and it is one of those 'must do's' if you are in Madrid and have any interest in the arts. What lets it down is that there seems to be no limits placed on the number of people entering the museum and this inevitably means that it is overcrowded - well and truly to the point of being uncomfortable, and this was in winter! We had bought 'skip the line' tickets and yet still had to stand in line for 20 mins, which pretty much confirms that they don't seek to control numbers.

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"On our way to the Prado we saw vans parked near the road with men working to scrub graffiti off the walls; no modern “art” here. The Prado dates back almost 200 years and houses the collections of works favored by kings from Spain’s 16th and 17th centuries, especially those of El Greco (who worked hard for approval from King Phillip II), Titian, Rubens, Goya, and Velasquez. The museum does not feature modern works like those of Picasso, Dali and Miro.

Each room of the Prado had a very specific collection of works. The kings had controlled the organization of paintings by colors and then by the numbers in the lower left corner of the painting as they still are represented today. Our guide Ama gave us lots of historic details that made viewing and understanding the paintings very helpful. She reminded us that the art works of the period were designed for religious reasons because of the strong Catholic influence. We learned that El Greco’s wife died having her baby. El Greco (the Greek) was so distraught over this that he painted his wife’s likeness as the Virgin Mary in his painting The Adoration of the Shepherds, his most famous work. King Phillip never appreciated El Greco and so he stayed in Toledo where he was better received.
The museum does, however feature long lines, so yes be sure to buy advance tickets or you will waste a lot of time in line as it is always crowded.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We pre-booked our tickets online (2 adults, 1 child - child was for free) directly at the homepage from the museum after we saw the queue for buying tickets the day before. We were a bit surprised that we didn't get any QR code, just a message that we have to queue there with the confirmation to exchange that for the tickets. (We figured out afterwards that this has probably to do with the free of charge ticket for the child, that's why there was no QR code provided.) So we arrived at the Prado and there was again the long queue at the ticket offices. I asked then one of the people working there and organizing the queues where we are supposed to get the prepaid tickets and they let us directly through to the counter where we got the entrance tickets printed out. Everything went really well, without any problems and people were friendly everywhere (after I tried to explain in Spanish what we need or want, everybody was always switching to English to assist us - this I just mention because I read some other comments here). We had to wait maybe 5 minutes at the entrance in the small queue there with the few people who had tickets, but got in then without any issues. We picked beforehand a few paintings which we wanted to look at and had a good experience in the museum. You could actually really look at the paintings without any big crowd in front of it (unlike in some of the other popular museums in other cities) and any staff or security we asked questions were always friendly and helpful also in the museum (also this I mention because I read other reviews here regarding that). So in short - we recommend it (I had 2 guys with me who were not too keen on some culture and looking at paintings, but even they liked it in the end ;) )

There's also a range of different European areas focused on (Italian, Flemish and Spanish included). Whilst I did pre-book, there didn't seem to be much of a line to buy a ticket either, likely because it is the low season for tourists. The museum also wasn't too crowded, unlike other European art museums, and I didn't have to shove my way forward to see any of the paintings. As it is such a big museum, you do either need to go with energy to see everything or be prepared to skip a couple of paintings/rooms!

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We pre-booked but beening winter the crowds were small and access was easy. Security at the front was quick and efficient. However trying to use the cloak room was difficult and has its downside.
You need a Euro coin to access the lockers yet they offer no way to get change and the cloak room they said was full. Also if you exit at the end via the shop you are not near the lockers and would have to go back through the entire museum or try to negotiate re entry via security again. A small negative but we had to carry our gear for the next 90 min. So have a Euro or an empty backpack.
Inside no photos but each room is a marvel of art works. There is an audio tour, guide tour or you can just read the signage which is in English as well.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We went to the Prado twice in the same day--once with a guide, and the second time (on the same all-day ticket) on our own. It was a good strategy. The guide was slower than we prefer, but she provided a lot of information, and keyed on many notable paintings and statuary that might not have caught our eye. Then on the return visit (after a lunch break), we covered the entire museum on our own pace (faster than with the guide) and actually appreciated the breadth of the art more. We had no interest in using audible guides on our solo visit. We often find them distracting. Strongly recommend visitors take some time (e.g. 30-60 minutes) ahead of entry to understand the history of the museum, the layout, and the location of key pieces. If you go in the morning, and think that you may return like we did, be sure to get your hand stamped at the desk just before exiting. The stamp will allow you to walk right back in.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"Second only to the Louvre in my humble opinion. This will take you at least four hours if you move quickly or have specific masters that you want to see. If you try and see it all, it's easily a full day. The masterpieces are sprinkled throughout the museum so as to disperse the crowds. No picture taking of course but I suspect you could get away with a few here and there. This museum is easily maneuverable. Grab a brochure upon entering. They are available at no additional charge and are available in the language you prefer. These brochures are well done and guide you to the halls containing specific artists. They also provide the room location of each masterpiece. Having tickets pre-purchased is a must to avoid the lines. I don't think a tour is necessary since art is in the eye of the beholder as they say. Enjoy!

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"Yes, the lines are long. Yes, it is heaving with people sometimes. Yes, it is frustrating not to be able to take pictures and hearing museum attendants yell 'NO PHOTOS!' every five minutes. But still, the Prado truly is one of the greatest art repositories on planet Earth, the stellar reputation of its paintings fully justified. It is impossible to appreciate all its artworks in one visit, and I certainly would not recommend skimming across the rooms just to say you have seen everything. As a seasoned traveler and art lover I would recommend:
--Hieronymos Bosch's hypnotic and psychotic 'Garden of Earthly Delights', and his other paintings in room 56A. The 'Garden' is the most popular painting in the museum, so be patient until you can find a spot in front of it among the crowd to appreciate it.
--The Rubens paintings in the first floor Long Gallery, plus more Rubens paintings in galleries 78-79 on the second floor. The Prado has the best collection of Rubens paintings in the world!
--Velazquez' imaginative paintings in rooms 10-15, particularly his stark 'Crucifixion', my favorite work in the museum.
--The spectacular El Greco altarpieces in rooms 8B to 10B.
--Goya, Goya, Goya, all over the museum. His famous 'Third of May' in room 64 is far more impressive in the paint than in photos.

To skip the epic crowds lining to enter the museum I truly recommend buying your ticket online. It can be done at any time, I bought mine on my phone the evening before I visited. Keep in mind you still have to get in a line to enter with an online ticket--at the new Jeronimos entrance--but it is a far shorter and much quicker line than the regular line holding paper tickets. Deciding how long to spend inside is completely up to one's own interests and schedule, but I would recommend a minimum of 3 hrs to be swept up by the Prado's beautiful art. I spent 9 straight hours in the museum and still left wanting more.

I reserved for the guided tour from Julia Travels. But I could not find the starting location as there was no clear directions to the place. I missed the tour and waited hour and half to get the ticket from the Kiosk I found later. I purchased audio guide which was very informative.One could save by standing in line to purchase ticket, may be early afternoon, and getting the audio guide instead of booking more expensive tours.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"the prado is simply one of the greatest art (paintings) museums in the world. getting in and out in early april was pretty easy. 5 minutes in line. the paintings are truly amazing. most of it is spainish art and you get a real feel for spanish history in the paintings. they are so wonderfully beautiful. and it just keeps going. no way to see all the really great ones in one day, but spending one day was enough for us. a few stood out as the most beautiful paintings i had ever seen, including the Louvre and Guggenheim",Apr 2019
Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"The Prado Museum has been on my must visit list for years and I'm happy to say it met all my expectations.

I arrived at the ticket office early and though the line for tickets was kind of long, it moved fairly quickly and the line into the museum was not crazy. I was inside a few minutes after 10 am.

It was a dream to see in person paintings I had only read about and studied in college. Flipping the pages of a three pound art book and seeing the real thing is no comparison.

The Prado got busier and busier as the day wore on but it didn't diminish my enjoyment.

The museum is HUGE, it can be overwhelming and I got lost a few times, but what better place to get lost in?

I only wished photos were allowed. I don't have to use the flash!

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"I was able to find this museum fairly easily. It was also pretty obvious where to purchase the tickets as I approached the building. Admission was €15 and my contactless credit card was accepted. It was not crowded on this December day so advanced purchase or skip-the-line purchase was not necessary. Once inside, I was told that my backpack had to be checked in. It was free and I was given a card to use to get my backpack back. I asked about my camera and was told that I could take it in with me. However, once inside someone soon told me that no photos were allowed in the exhibits area. Photos were only allowed in the gathering spots outside the museum. I would not have carried my camera around if the check in person at the cloakroom had told me this. Also, there was no WiFi available that I could use. The museum was huge like so many are. A map was not provided when I purchased my ticket. A less than friendly employee informed me that I needed to get a map from the information center which I found. The map also gave locations of some of the more popular works which I appreciated. Once I had the map I could make the most of my time and find the pieces that were a priority for me to see. An art enthusiast could certainly spend several hours here but I didn't have that time. Audio tours were also available but I did not purchase this option.

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"The Prado offers free entry for last 2 hours off the day daily. We time ourselves so that we get there about 1/2an hour before then. When we got there, the queue was about the entire length of the museum which I estimated to be about at least 600 m long or about a few hundreds strong as they are not single queue. Given that it is more than 1/2hour before they allow entry, we decided that by the time we are admitted, we cannot do justice to the arts pieces within. Instead, we walked to the King Neptune fountain for some pictures and return to the museum to assess the situation. Oh my gosh! The queue has grown to at least 100 m. My experience in Berlin Germany tells me that those at the end of the queue may not even be admitted into the museum due to time constraints. Entry is controlled as they restrict only a number into the museum at any one time. In deduce that it is not worth taking to get in for free unless you have plenty of free time in hand in Madrid as to get to the front of the queue, you will probably have to be there at least more than an hour earlier than the free entry time. Pay your way to enjoy the exhibits without stress and have plenty of time in hand to appreciate them.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"We were here last month, and the visit did not disappoint. Having studied a little art history I had a good idea of what not to miss. I have teenagers so I needed a strategy that would get them in and out within an hour and a half before their screen time addictions kicked in.

There was a special exhibition of Goya drawings we never even got to, as the place is so big. You could easily spend two days and not see it all.

Must sees:
Bosch’s “Garden of Earthly Delights”
In an amazing room filled with multiple Bosch pieces. Astounding for many reasons but mostly that he had these”surreal” visions in the 1400’s, some 500 years before Dali and the surrealists.

Then go upstairs and see the Rubens ( finest Rubens collection in the world ) and then the Goya’s, and the Velasquez’s to give you a key taste of Spanish Art History.

Do not miss the one Rembrandt. The piece from this Renaissance master features a “ghost” in the background (you’ll have to look hard) holding a bag to catch someone’s recently removed head!!! Ask a docent!

Remember the entry after 1800 in the evening is free but then you dont have enough time to see the entire place before it closes at 2000 hours. Two hours here is not even enough for one floor...But you could come here two or three evenings at that time if you wanna save some money... its well worth it else just buy the ticket and spend at least half a day here...Its very centrally located and most tour operators including the HOHO bus has stops here on both the routes, The evenings here are enjoyable around this major attraction with good food and a relaxed atmosphere...their gift shop is very well equipped and you have an excellent print on demand option in various formats..

There are mostly long queues to obtain tickets for entry , I think worse at weekends . . Senior Citizens gain entry at reduced cost , I think it was half price , approx. 7.50 Euros . There are also times later in the afternoon where the entry cost is reduced .
You could spend a long time there , there is much to see, particularly if you are into art and painting.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"This museum is a must see, especially if you enjoy art. There is an expansive collection of European art, especially Spanish art. The collection of paintings by Velazquez, Goya, El Greco and Raphael were some of the best highlights.

Given the size of the museum, would recommend downloading and reviewing the museum map prior to going. The museum’s map includes masterpieces that are must-sees and the rooms they are located in. Would also recommend charting a route through the maze of rooms beforehand so you don’t miss anything or waste time navigating the museum. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking around a lot. It took us around 3 hours to visit the entire museum and at least cover all the masterpieces highlighted in the museum’s map.

If you are certain which day you plan to visit, you can purchase tickets online. Otherwise you can purchase tickets at the ticket office on the north side of the museum. For the Saturday morning in November that we visited the museum, we were able to get tickets in less than 5 minutes. Though I suspect the crowds would be bigger during warmer months. Security did not have any issues with us bringing our small bags into the museum, though you will go through metal detectors and your bags will be x-rayed. Photography is not allowed in the museum. There is a restaurant in the newer wing that has both a cafeteria style and full-service dining section that was pretty good and was a nice place to take a break.

Spain,Prado National Museum,3.0,"However, it wasn't mine. There is much wonderful art on display at the Prado, and for some people it is the finest art in existence. For me, there were a few pieces that attracted me, but not many. I appreciate the value of the collection in aesthetic terms, but again, it's not to my liking, in such vast quantities. The odd saint doing their saintly thing is fine; rooms full of huge dark paintings on such subjects is more than I need.
As well I found little attempt at the Prado for the establishment of any sort of context for the art. No Dali next to the Bosch to demonstrate the relationship between them. Lazy curation.
And the strictly enforced ""No Photos"" policy is out of date. If you only have time for one museum in Madrid, go across the street to the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum. More manageable size and vastly more inclusive collection.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"The Prado has improved since my previous visit more than ten years ago. The information system on individual paintings in Spanish and English is a great addition. Unfortunately now that my wife and I are that much older we flagged after about three hours both physically and from too much to see. Its still an excellent experience especially as we qualified for half price entry and if you have a chance to visit soon a wonderful exhibition on two very early European female painters is top class. Its a challenge for the Museum Curators as to how to improve the overall visitor experience. To appreciate the current Goya drawings temporary exhibition would require a day on its own - it wasn't my cup of tea but I was very impressed with how the curators used the available space. There is an old adage that less is more and to my mind the Thyssien Museum was the better experience despite its poorer information systems and fewer paintings. Coherence is the attribute that separated the temporary exhibitions in a very positive way from the permanent collection in the Prado. In summary the Prado like the Louvre needs a customer who unlike me does research on what they want to see and can get it done. If you are like me and semi-accidently end up in Madrid for a long weekend and can't be bothered to do much research- the Antropological Museum should be top of your Attractions To Do List.

I love the fact that they have a short description of each painting next to it, even in English. The museum is spanned accros 3 floors. There's also a nice looking café and a big gift shop.

It's totally not underrated and unless you really hate art, you should see it. If you're a geek on museums or just don't wanna storm through it, the 2 free entry hours (Mon 18-20) are not enough for you and you should buy a ticket and preserve half a day for it.

Spain,Prado National Museum,4.0,"For one of the great museums of the world, I found myself overwhelmed by quantity and underwhelmed by content. I went especially to see paintings by El Greco and there were an incredible number. However, my perception was that the El Greco paintings I saw at the Prado had a dull, overly-gray appearance which suggested they needed cleaning. The El Greco paintings I know in U.S. Museums all have a vibrant, colorful intensity that is quite distinctive. I've heard that the Prado resists the American inclination to ""overclean"" its artwork. From my point of view as a non-professional art lover, the Prado's huge collection of El Greco's work lacked the vibrancy I feel sure was present in the original work at the time it was created. I feel my impression was exaccerbated by the rather dim lighting of the Prado's galleries. I was also hugely disappointed that photography is not permitted at the Prado. I feel this policy is very counterproductive to the educational purpose of a museum because it denies visitors the opportunity to revisit these great paintings through their pictures. So, I was disappointed by my visit to the Prado which lacked the variety, light and color I expected to find in one of the world's great collections of paintings. My review probably suffers because I did not extend my visit much beyond the El Greco galleries, choosing instead to leave to revisit the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum which has a huge, vibrant collection of art in well lit galleries where photography is permitted. I believe the Prado should modernize and adopt some of the practices of its competitor just a few blocks away.

Spain,Prado National Museum,5.0,"So, how does one rate one of the finest museums in the world? Humbly. Loved it. I am not an art expert, but it was exhilarating. The Raphael is luminous. El Greco, dynamic. Velazquez, vibrant. Best of all is the sculpture. Ancient sculpture looks so realistic, way ahead of the painters. Can't imagine the time a sculptor spends on a piece.

The museum could do us a favor and limit the size of the guided groups. When 30 people huddle around a piece, the rest of us have to skip it and come back. That said, don't mess with the school children groups. The teachers have them sit compactly. One can slip up to read the plaque and move on. So cool children are exposed to this!!!!!

Spain,Prado National Museum,2.0,"My review is not about the collection the Prado carries, it is about how it is organized.

- QUEUING First we had to queue for approx 40 min. it was freezing. We were well covered and we did not have a problem with that except that there was another entrance which was indoors. There was no indications to it whatsoever.
We did not think of buying the tickets online, it cuts the queue. Make sure you do get one online from the official website of the museum.

- NO LOCKERS we entered and had to keep and carry our jackets and bags with us. There was no lockers available to store them. They only store the big sized bags. The rest you have to carry. That was very inconfortable and made our visit very brief (made sure to check Velázquez and el Greco works)

I love this museum and it's contents but I think it is because I've studied Northern Renaissance Art. Bosch is called ""Basco"" on your museum floor plan and nowhere is ""Bosch"" which is confusing. Look at both the front, open panels of the triptych and move to the backs. The other collections of Spanish, French, etc art and artists is amazing. Do homework, pick and choose or you could be overwhelmed. This is a very large project to see in a day.",Nov 2019

Be aware if coming from the main road that the main entrance is at the back which is where the cloakroom and main facilities are. The museum leaflet is well laid out. We took one and had a cafe drink while we sorted out what we wanted to see. Galleries are set out by country and artist. Recommended pictures to see are on the back of the leaflet. The museum is well laid out and easy to find galleries and artists. The cafe is very good and reasonable. If you want tea and this applies to all of Madrid, order black tea with seperate milk otherwise it is all chucked into a teapot. The teabags are weak!

The organization is perfect with staff always ready to help. Like any museum of this level the rooms are always very crowded and to see some works the visitor may have to wait a while. The biggest difficulty we had was to appreciate in more detail Bosch's painting entitled ""The Garden of Delights"". Guided tour groups can bring some inconvenience to other visitors as it is common for them to come unceremoniously pushing those who stand in front of them. The museum also has a cafeteria and a good restaurant with excellent service. Buying entry tickets online is highly advisable as the queues are huge for purchase at the museum.

Their website doesn't tell you that until after you have purchased. Digital tickets are not acceptable. My hotel was nice enough to print them for us, but be aware. Also, if you chose the senior discounted ticket you will have to wait in the onsite ticket line to verify your age then they give you your ticket. Again, you don't know this until after you purchase online. You might save a few bucks but lose precious time. I did however, find almost no line on a weekday afternoon off season.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,3.0,"We did the combo tour, of the Cathedral and then the Royal Alcazar. Our tour guide was good, and we learned a lot from her. We felt that the tour of the Cathedral was informative, nicely paced, and loved getting to go up the Giralda tower. However, we felt that the tour of the Royal Alcazar was a little less interesting and a little too long. We spent too much time slowly going through small rooms. While we did appreciate that the tour ended at the Alcazar, with the ability for us to go on our own and see other rooms or the gardens, we were too tired and needed a break from ""learning"", so we just went home. We ended up buying entry tickets to the Alcazar the next day just to see the gardens. If I had to do it again, I would not buy the combo tickets. I would use this company to tour the Cathedral, but then would just book entry with audio tour at Alcazar so that we could do that at our own pace. Maybe spread them out and do one each day.

The cost for the tickets for 2 is about 28E but its so worth it..

The RA is one of those places that continues to surprise from the magnificent gardens to the Arab baths, from the stunning patios and courtyard decorated in Islamic motifs to the soaring state rooms. The architecture with fusion of Islamic and Christian traditions is a delight and repays you attention...and as you get a little weary fell your heart lift in the gardens with the water courses and shaded areas.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Allow plenty of time to visit this place. There are a lot of nooks to see in the building and the gardens are even larger. Tickets were bought from the ticket office located near the exit and were free timed and with no need to join a group. A long queue but it moved efficiently fast - a total contrast to the impossible bureaucracy at the Cordoba castle. Cards accepted. Freelance guides intercept you at the entrance but you don't have to hire them.

The ground floor of the palace shows off the architecture from the caliph period. Good basic signing. Looking up at the ceilings is as valuable as gazing out of the arched windows.

The first floor is so different, mainly showing the Spanish influence.
The gardens are a series of delights with superb smells drifting by from the jasmine bushes. The maze was cordoned off but you can view it over the wall by walking to the far end of the palace garden wing and going up the stairs to the first floor. After all that a welcome small café is tucked away in the garden with shady outdoor seating.

You could spend a whole day walking through the beautiful gardens fo the Alcazar palace. Next to the beautiful and well maintained gardens there are also several palace rooms you can visit. It is a nice combination. The grandeur in the palace rooms and the details of the walls and ceilings is tremendous. The gardens are in my opinion even more splendid. They are so large and beautiful.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"I booked a week before my visit. Occasional time slots for Cuarto Real Alto were available, so I booked a ticket including that. It was definitely worth the additional cost. Cuarto Real Alto is a newer part, opposed to the general tour which takes you to the 14th century areas. Cuarto Real Alto was lavish and completely different from the rest of the Alcazar.

The allocated timeslot is for the Cuarto Real Alto. You first have to enter the Alcazar itself (involves some waiting due to a security check) and present yourself at the Cuarto Real Alto entrance 15 minutes before the allocated time. Actually a full 15 minutes is not needed, we waited for missing customers until a few minutes before the tour started. I'd advice being 5 - 7 minutes early as you will get a separate audioguide and need to leave your bags into a locker after another security check. Finding the entrance for Cuarto Real Alto wasn't easy, but the staff was happy to help.

The tour consisted of a single audioguide recording which included all of the rooms. That means that the duration of the tour is fixed, 23 minutes. We were followed by a friendly security guard who made sure no one was left behind. The audioguide was available in Spanish and English.

In case you come early, you can do parts of the general tour before going to Cuarto Real Alto. Just don't go too far from the patio where you come after entering, as there are unmarked points of no return where security guards won't let you come back. I did some of the areas on the sides of the patio first, then Cuarto Real Alto, and after that the rest of the areas on the sides before continuing to Palacio Pedro I (entrance in the end of the patio) and the gardens.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,1.0,"Unfortunately my visit the Royal Alcazar with my husband and one year old baby in August 2021 was no less than terrible. Soon after we entered the alcazar, my baby became a bit sleepy and to calm him down I kept walking while holding and cajoling him. When he was soothed I turned around to see the sights that we missed including the main plaza of the alcazar. The staff was extremely rude and yelled at us to keep walking forward. I was jolted by their rude behavior and the manner in which they spoke but complied with their request immediately. It was extremely odd as just then another family (white) was allowed to walk back as one of their kids wanted to see something again.

One of the guards then proceeded to follow us and continued to yell that in the alcazar you are not allowed to walk back to a sight once you have passed it by. There are absolutely no signs that tell you this, it is not written in their brochure that they give at entry, and no one among their staff tells you this at any point. My husband pointed out that as we are being yelled at, yet another couple with a small child was allowed to head back to see the earlier sites, however the guard simply refused to acknowledge and just kept yelling. At this point we definitely felt racially discriminated against as the only difference between us the the two families allowed to head back was the color of our skin.

My family and I walked through what was remanning of the alcazar gardens but had missed most of the inside. At the exit, I spoke with a manager and signed a reclamation form that asked for a refund as we paid 58 euros to see the alcazar which we were unable to see because the management does not inform you of the rules of visit at the outset.

The next day, which was our last day in Seville, I returned to the alcazar to follow up on the reclamation. I was shocked to be met with even more rudeness than I had experienced the previous day. The management was extremely aggressive with me from the get-go. I explained to them that if they could not provide me a refund (this is an option on their reclamation form) as it might take some time and I was leaving Seville the next morning, then I was willing to re-visit the alcazar to see the sights missed (also an option on their reclamation form).

After calling three security guards to flank me (I do not see why this was necessary) and about 10 phone calls, I had waited for almost an hour before the top manager arrived. By this top manager, I was simply told I could not and would not receive either a visit or a refund. No explanation or reason was provided when I asked for one given that these are both options listed on their own form, he simply said “not possible”. Then I asked the manager for his name and he refused to give it to me at which point he became physically aggressive in his gestures and pound and threatening (my 1 year old was in a stroller right behind me). I was so shocked at the treatment that I took a picture of the manager to attach with this review and he proceeded to run towards me and took photos of me and my baby in retaliation and kept on verbally threatening us.

I have never had such a poor experience on any visit. The management and staff of the alcazar are not only racist, rude, and aggressive but do not follow their own protocols set in place for complaints and reclamation. After my jarring and clearly racially discriminatory experience I must say most of the good reviews here must be from white people.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"The centuries old Alcazar is a complex of palaces, fortifications, courtyards, reflection pools and an exotic labyrinth of gardens, bursting with orange trees, palms and greenery. Inside, it’s all exquisite tile work, intricate Moorish architecture and Mudhejar horseshoe arches, delicate plaster latticework and bright geometric tiled designs. Don't underestimate how long you need here and allow plenty of time – we spent at least 3 hours here.
The Alcazar palaces were so much sensory overload that we took a break in the middle and took time out to explore the gardens, which was a good change the pace. There’s also a basic café and toilet block behind the Italian Grotto Gallery.
For anyone with even a passing interest in Game of Thrones, you’ll recognise many areas from Game of Thrones (series 5).
BUYING TICKETS:
Definitely recommend buying tickets online beforehand but you don’t need to panic if you’ve left it quite late. We only bought ours the day before and there were still a lot of time slots left (this was off-season in Feb). Tickets are timed and they only let a small number through each time. We had a 9:30am slot (one of the first slots) and only had to wait about 10min. It helped to have your ticket ready (phone or paper) because otherwise if you’re holding things up, you might have to wait for the next group. There is free entry on Mondays but only from 6-7pm in summer & 4-5 in winter. You’d be hard-pressed to see much in an hour so this is really only worth considering if budget is very tight.
DON'T MISS HIGHLIGHTS:
* Baths of Maria de Padilla – this is eerily beautiful. You go slightly underground to these amazing baths. This is where Maria, mistress of King Pedro the Cruel would escape to for a bit of indulgent relaxation. Considering she was sleeping with someone whose nickname was ‘the Cruel’ she probably needed some calm and relaxation in her life.
* the Courtyard of the Maidens is a highlight. Expect a bottleneck because everyone wants to position themselves to take photos with the stunning reflecting pool stretching out behind them. You need to allow some time here.
* King Pedro I’s Palace (1360-64) – this is a bit of a rabbit warren and we had to double-back on ourselves in order to see everything. I’m pretty sure we still missed parts. Just don’t miss the 12th century Hall of the Ambassadors, a stunning room where Pedro received important guests. Foreign dignitaries must have found it hard to take their eyes off the overwhelmingly beautiful gilded domed ceiling, encrusted with gold and mirrors. Not sure how they concentrated on whatever Pedro was saying. Maybe that was his strategy?
* Charles V & Isabella Wedding Rooms – beautiful, vivid tiles walls
NOTES:
* Check what’s open. The giant maze and Tapestries Room were not open when we were there (Feb 2020). The Tapestries Room was being restored but there was no sign so it was unclear when it would re-open. Same with the maze although I suspect it was only closed for routine maintenance.
* If you are also visiting Granada’s Alhambra, try to leave a long-ish gap before you go to Seville’s Alcazar. We saw them within days of each other and stunning as they both are, we nearly overdosed on patterned tiles and reflection pools.

We were able to enter easily, and wandered through the castle for a little over an hour, it truly is a beautiful set of buildings. Once we had made it through the buildings, admiring the architecture and history, and taken quite a few photographs, we made our way into the gardens, which are expansive and gorgeous. We spent another couple of hours here, just wandering, and of course, taking more photos. Before exiting the gardens we watched the peacocks for a while, then made our way to the upper level, near the Cuarto Real Alto, where the was an exhibit on the history of ceramic tiles in Andalucía, which was informative, and beautiful.
The Real Alcázar de Sevilla is a very large complex, and can get crowded, although during this visit it was not. I recommend purchasing your tickets ahead of time, and for an early timeslot.

The palace itself is magnificent with all the decorative art with Koranic scriptures written all over. The colours are vivid as well. A very nice area are also the gardens as well. Being in spring time it was very pleasant to walk around in.

Some atmosphere is lost because of the crowds but it didn’t detract from my experience. To get full justice, I would suggest spending at least 3 hours as it is a huge complex.

12€ is a small price to pay for a history trip. There are guided tours as well to take advantage of. We used “Smiling Tours”
The guide was waiting outside asking peopel if there were interested in joining a group to take a 2 hour guided tour which was only 10€ and well worth the money as there were lots of stuff I learnt on this, my 5th trip to Seville.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,2.0,"Very nice attraction, highlight to visit. (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)

Nevertheless I would recommend to well prepare your visit upfront to avoid frustration, time waste and to save mobile battery on your precious holidays. With Covid, there is no skilled staff present, only security guards that barely speak English to ‘help’ visitors with the extremely complex ticketing system.

Rather than trusting the validity date & photo on the student card I presented with our pre-purchased tickets, guards suggested to go get my passport. Not being an option for our planning (going back to the hotel meant 1h lost, in 35°C), we chose to buy another ticket - as paying just the difference was not enough, a total new ticket was required. Only possible online through what must have been the first website ever made on earth: not suitable for Mobile, only in Spanish and constantly bugging payment with the weak 4G signal in the historic city center. No wifi available at the attraction. Other websites existed, but with wrong timeslots available. As paying in cash, by transfer or simply trusting us was not an option, we were left attempting to buy another ticket for about 30 minutes.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"It is the fortress-palace built by King Peter the 1st of Castile in the 14th century and subsequently enlarged by other Spanish kings. It is still used by the kings of Spain as their residence when they are in Seville. The complex consists of three different buildings and an immense garden. The attraction of the palace lies in the extremely elaborate decoration carved on the surface of many walls and applied to other architectural elements such as doors, windows, columns and arches. This decoration is based on intricate geometric shapes and stylised calligraphy finely chiselled on the stone, so that the surfaces seem covered by a lace. It is an aesthetic ornament borrowed from the Arabs, who dominated much of Andalusia from 711 AD to 1492 AD, and it is called Mudéjar ornamentation (the Mudéjar were the Arabs who remained in Spain after the recapture of the territories by the Spaniards). There are several specially attractive ""patios"", all of which evocate the Arab culture and the fascination of ""Thousand and One Nights"". The visit is pleasant and can take up to one hour. There are no sitting places.

The site is open from 9:30 am; closes at 17:00 in winter and 19:00 in summer. Admission is € 11.50 (€ 3 for the elderly and young people); on Monday the visit is free. Visitors are often very numerous, especially during the weekend and in season. The queue at the ticket office and at the security checkpoint can therefore be long and also the waiting time; you can skip these lines if you buy your ticket from the official Alcàzar website; there is a small supplement of € 1, but you have the right to pass the security check in a fast lane. Make sure you buy the ticket from the official website and not from other agents or tour operators who charge a heavier commission: the name of the official website is ""alcazarsevilla"" and operates in the "".org"" domain).

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,3.0,"Tl;dr.
I DON’T RECOMMEND this museum for visit. There are a LOT of great and FREE sights in Seville. For example, Parque de Maria Luisa and Plaza de España.

Alcazar - absolutely OVERRATED and MEDIOCRE. You wouldn’t find any authentic, special atmosphere there. I would say it’s okay, not more. There are a lot of great examples of moorish-style architecture all over the Seville and Andalucia, in general. So, it’s much worth to walk around the city to see some. In the matter of interior, may be you won’t find so much examples nearby.. But all the interiors in Alcazar are pretty much similar. Means it’s enough to see just few halls. I don’t even mention details or buildings that added on top / next to the moorish-style building. Absolutely nonsense and out of place combinations.
Garden. It’s weird to be seeing as cultural phenomenon. It looks like some park created 50 years ago. Not feeling any history at all. Space, landscape design.. I didn’t feel any authenticity in that garden. And it’s just ridiculous if to compare to the (FREE) Parque de Maria Luisa.

On top of it - price.... it’s hillarious to ask that entrance amount (~12€) for Alcazar kind of experience. And I was lucky enough yet to not face much crowds while visiting...

Final shot. Official website doesn’t work properly. So, I couldn’t book tickets online. Thus I had to stay in line to buy tickets offline. While I found that tickets offline are CHEAPER than in ONLINE (wtf..?). Okay, good. BUT, if you want to pay by card - then for non-spanish card it’s possible in USD only. Means obviously as you are in EU - they will receive payment in EUR = double conversion, where obviously commission is put on YOU (wtf x2). No comments. ‘Hello, planet Earth, great service..’

Not recommended.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"Was magical to walk through the alcazar, in particular the beautiful gardens. Agree with other reviews that the garden are the highlight. We found the buildings similar to that of the Alhambra in Granada. Couple of negatives- poorly signed and audio guide both unavailable the day we were there (and seemingly long term) and expensive, so it was a bit hard to follow where to go and the entrance to the alcazar is actually near the cathedral despite where google maps takes you!
Also, it would be great if you could but tickets online to beat the que but website doesn’t work. Last negaitve- we had terrible customer service, but hey, everyone has a bad day. Wouldn’t have missed this sight but advice is to be organised and aware of those couple of tricks.

It turned out this was an exhibition and not the Cuarto Real Alto entry. The start of the tour is at the top of the stairs and no further. At the start of the tour you need one euro for the locker as no bags allowed. The upstairs rooms have a grand lived in feel with furniture, paintings and much more.

The palace is quite breathtaking with a mixture of styles. The formal gardens match the quality of the buildings. Plenty of fountains and well maintained paths. This is a world class site of historic importance, a highlight of our visit to Saville.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"This is a place that's hard to describe...you just have to go and see it.

Also, we learned later that Mondays are free!",Mar 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Simply magnificent but with one major criticism. We were unable to make on line reservations in advance as the website would not permit. When we arrived. Quite early in the morning, there were no audio headsets available. This detracted hugely from our enjoyment of the spectacular place.
However this is just a phenomenal place to visit, please don’t miss it!",Mar 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"We had a guided tour and it really helped to explain the history and architecture of the palace. The gardens are gorgeous and well maintained. Alhambra in Granada is based on this palace, as it is much older. For Game of Thrones fans, the palace was used for filming scenes in Dorne, so some of the staircases and garden may look familiar.",Mar 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"We visited the Alcazar on a lovely sunny day and spent a few hours looking around. Well worth the money and I'd recommend pre-booking online beforehand to skip the queue.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"An amazing palace with 10th century front tower and walls. On entering there is a Moorish courtyard with beautiful Arabic arches and inscriptions. There are so many stunning rooms and courtyards that are mesmerising by their colour, tiling, arches, carvings and exquisite ceilings. The gardens are so extensive with orange groves, palms, pools and fountains. You can spend an entire day here and well worth the entrance money. Students and senior citizen reductions too.",Mar 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Visited this palace and was astounded at the history. Despite there being many visitors, the whole place is so tranquil. The gardens especially so. The whole place feels peaceful. We were there for about 4 hours but could easily have stayed all day. Well worth paying the small extra charge for the audio guide. Very interesting and informative. Great value admission charges too. If you go to Seville, you have to visit this palace.",Feb 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"The only problem with a visit to the Alcazar is queueing for entry if you don't purchase a ticket in advance. Otherwise it is an outstanding array of palaces and gardens. Because of the limit of visitor numbers to 750 and the vastness of the site, it didn't feel too busy. We didn't take an audio guide and relied on our guide book and the free map provided. It is certainly the 'must see' attraction in Seville.",Feb 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,Wow. Just wow. This place is just spectacular. It was a little cloudy when we visited but would love to see it with a clear blue sky! The gardens are fantastic and the variety of tiles in the architecture and gardens are incredible. Give yourself a good half day and would highly recommend booking in advance!

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Are there more beautiful and huge gardens in the world? I presume not. The Alcazar is of course a world spot, the richest place to visit in Sevilla, a royal palace full of beauties and architectural wonders from both Muslim and Christian times and this mudejar style that makes Andalucian palaces so unique, but it is also and maybe first a fantastic garden with all styles of trees, flowers, fountains. Thèse gardens are gigantic, gorgeous, fascinating, restful after long hours of visit. One just wants to wander through them, sit down on a bench, admire, think or dream in such a paradise place where beauty, harmony and sweetness are the only words.",Feb 2020

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,We did a private tour in Spanish with a tour guide. The place is really impressive inside. The grounds are also beautiful and well kept. The guide was very knowledgeable and kept the group engaged. After the tour you are free to remain inside and explore on your own. I strongly recommend a visit to the Real Alcazar when visiting Seville.,Feb 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"I booked my tickets online which is a necessity even in February. I had an appointment for 1:00 for the royal rooms but missed my time slot as I was not told where to go. Arriving late and therefore unable to take the tour, I was abusing myself for being so stupid when I discovered that this was a regular occurrence and I was one of four parties who had the same problem. If you have paid for the tour you have to appear 15 minutes in advance at the entrance which is at the top of the staircase at the far right of the main courtyard.

Aside from this disaster the visit was amazing if a bit crowded in the palace itself. The audio guide is worth renting as it provides additional information on each room and sections of the garden though one is sufficient for two people.

We visited with a small group and a guide, and while he was knowledgeable, I think anyone willing to do some reading in advance might enjoy seeing the palace and grounds just as much on their own. To me, guides (like this guy) sometimes are a distraction, and also often go too slow for me. Plus they cherry pick what they show and talk about. Anyway... It is a beautiful complex that warrants 1-2 hours of your time.",Nov 2019

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"We were debating whether to purchase tickets online given that we were visiting on a Monday afternoon in February. We did not think it would be busy. However, we opted to purchase tickets the day before online. This turned out to be a very good decision. There was a big queue when we arrived. Even in the pre-booked tickets queue was there a queue. Luckily we went straight in as we were already over 10 mins over our allocated time slot. Probably saved over an hour queuing for tickets too. Follow the directions on Google Maps (entrance and not where it takes you to middle of gardens, we ended up walking a very long route). It is beautiful inside. The main attraction is the garden and balcony walkway views. We spent a good amount of time in there areas. One of the gardeners even helped pick some oranges for us to try (they taste more like bitter lemons but very juicy!) What a nice gentleman. There are also some nice rooms inside with the famous tiles. We did not opt to visit the apartment rooms. Plenty of opportunity to take stunning photos. Make sure you book in advance. You can get in on Mondays after 4pm for free. We noticed the queue really long when we left around this time. Although if you are organised then you can get €1 tickets online a few Mondays in advance.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"I bought entry tickets (€12.50)and audio guides (€6) online well before arriving in Sevilla. There is a separate line for those with tickets at the Lion’s Gate entrance and you can get in line 20 minutes before your timed entry. There was another fairly long line, once inside, waiting to pick up audio guides. Once we had these we started a self paced tour. You can go through the site in any order you want. We found that because the sign outside each building and room was in Spanish and English and you’re mainly looking at the gorgeous tiles, mosaics and architecture, you don’t really the need the audio guide. The ceilings are amazing!

We spent lots of time in the gardens and loved the Seville orange trees, many still with fragrant orange blossoms. There are lots of places throughout the entire site to sit and there is a cafe as well as several restroom areas. We spent 2 1/2 hours here.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"Great complex of Spanish-Islamic palaces. Some tips. Order tickets before you go off going at busy periods. The audioguide is good, although there is a little bit of information (in English and Spanish) for each area. Children’s version is only in Spanish unfortunately - perhaps agreed 9-10 will manage with the adult one. Some interesting rooms, including where Columbus’ expeditions were planned. Don’t miss the room of the half-orange (the audiologuide is especially good at this point). There’s also a treat in the gardens of the ladies: La Fuente de Fama (fountain of fame - see picture) - a salmon pink and outrage fountain on the east wall with a cherub in the middle. Inside is a 16th century barrel organ which plays tunes powered by the fountains on the hour. It’s not the most spectacular display (so don’t raise your expectations too high!), but a nice little distraction. You can see the Organ if you go to the right of the fountain and look through the holes on the metal door.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"We had booked our tickets in advance and on arrival we noticed how the queue for ticket holders was actually longer than for those without tickets! This was commented on not only by us but also by other ticket holders as being a silly situation which maybe they should consider planning for in future. The other thing is I felt there should have been a separate queue for large groups and school tours as it was quite chaotic with them trying to check tickets for entire groups of kids and having them taking up the entire footpath while they waited for the rest of their party. We booked the audio guide of the cuatro real alto as part of our tickets and this was quite interesting to see. This was to start at 11.30 and despite us having queued at the entrance from 11am we only made it by the skin of our teeth due to all the aforementioned hassle with the queue. After this however we could relax and properly enjoy the beauty of the place we were in. The gardens are magnificent and you can really take in all the beautiful tiling and artwork at your leisure. Lovely water fountains and different things to stop and admire on your walk. You will easily spend two hours here but you should allow for more as you don't want to be rushing around such a beautiful place. One of the highlights of our trip to Seville without a doubt.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,1.0,"We bought tickets online and showed them at the entrance. Four full paying adults and one friend who is a student. My friend took her student card and ID to prove her age but they would not accept it. The security staff ridiculed her in the queue and said she looked 26 not 24!!! She had to buy a new full price ticket as they wouldn’t let her in otherwise. They made derogatory comments to each other in Spanish about tourists (not realising we understood the language) and laughed when she had to buy a new full price ticket. It was a terrible terrible experience! This place will always be a popular tourist attraction but they need to do something about the rude staff - refusing to accept valid ID and being rude/derogatory to tourists is not acceptable!!!

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Twenty years ago during Holy Week, I waltzed into the Real Alcazar without waiting. Last week, in mid-February, I had to stand in line 100 minutes (more than an hour and a half) because I hadn't thought to reserve and pay for a timed entry.

Once we got in, however, it was hard to say which was more impressive, the buildings or the gardens. Do go, do give yourself enough time to wander throughout the gardens. Perhaps the Giralda is more exciting, if you're young enough to climb to the top, but for me the Real Alcazar is the number one attraction in Sevilla.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,3.0,"Book in advance if you want to see the upstairs. There is a two week wait even in February which meant we didn’t get to see it.

As others have said this place needs some TLC especially the gardens. Weeds and rubbish. Dry and poorly maintained fountains.

If you buy your ticket at the ticket office they insist that card payments are in your home currency. This gives a poor exchange rate. They wouldn’t budge so we paid cash.

It is amazing, but compared to other similar places in Spain it is over priced and neglected

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Allow about five hours to see the Alcazar and gardens. If you want to see the upstairs part of the building I would advise booking it a couple of months ahead, at least, to make sure of seeing it. We booked online when we arrived in Seville on 26/01/20 but couldn't get booked for the upstairs visit. There is still plenty to see on the ground level, however, and the building is very beautiful.It is also heaving with visitors and an audio guide is essential to hear the history of each section. The gardens are also included in the entry price and they are well worth seeing, even though some parts are a little neglected.",Jan 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Yeah the Cathedral is nice but this is the real deal in Sevilla. Give yourself a full morning to get lost in this beautiful place. You can't rush it, you need to get an audioguide and you'll feel like you want to stop and absorb the atmosphere of every patio, room and garden you encounter. It's truly a magical place. Go there early in the morning to avoid the long queue.",Sep 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,2.0,Disappointed with it overall. In urgent need of a lot of work. Gardens horrendously neglected. Some of the mosaics are lovely but in a lot of areas needs repairing. Think I was expecting too much... need to go with low expectations.,Feb 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,Stunning architecture and collection of tiles and period art set within the most beautiful gardens in the middle of the old town. Hard to believe you are in the middle of a big city when you are in the gardens as it is so peaceful within.,Feb 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"This place was lovely. We did the tour of the private apartment areas as well as wandering the palace and the gardens. The tour is guided by audio sets and led by a security guard who makes sure no one wanders where they shouldn’t. The audio was great because it turned on automatically as you entered each room and was set to the language of your choice. The gardens are extensive and even though we were there in January, are full of greenery and a few colourful flowers.",Jan 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"We visited here as a family of five, with kids ranging from 13 years old to 17 years old. Everyone enjoyed it and was impressed with the entire thing. It is a very interesting place with decorations and style of the Moors and the Christians. At several points in history, each were in charge of it. The gardens are a must see, quite spectacular up close and from a second story window. Walking into the admirals chambers where queen Isabella received Christopher Columbus after his second voyage to the New World was amazing! It is 100% worth going to this magnificent building, both for the art and for the history. We took a paid guided tour and it was worth it so that we could find out all of the interesting stories that you don’t get by looking at it alone.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"This is truly one of those “must see” sights in Andalusia! I have no idea how anyone makes it through in 2 hours (previous reviews), I was there about 4 1/2 hours. It’s not just the glorious architecture (many rooms), but the fabulous gardens as well. I’d say about half my time was spent wandering the gardens, where you can find some space to yourself. Wonderful day! My only complaint is that they appear to let numerous tour groups in at the same time- suddenly, in one of the most important rooms of the palace, I was being pushed against the wall by a ridiculous amount of tours crammed in together. It was so loud, I couldn’t even hear my audio guide. Surely you can do better than this? And as other reviewers have said, buy your ticket online. I opted to buy in person as I wasn’t sure which day I’d go (and it was early February), only to get stuck behind a large university group that moved as slowly as possible! The line for online tickets zipped along. Still, don’t pass on this - and allow plenty of time for the gardens.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Plan your time carefully. This place was so huge we couldn’t finish walking it. And we were there more than 2 hours.

The buildings were great, but the gardens were spectacular. We enjoyed exploring all the different parts of the palace, and after awhile we decided to ignore the audio guide as it was talking very very long to finish each segment AND still take meaningful photographs.

This is definitely a must-see, and perhaps best done as a stand-alone rather than on the same day as the Cathedral.

Real Alcazar is not to be missed if you are in Seville. To be honest, every corner of the Reales Alcazares de Sevilla is worth exploring.
The entrance to the Royal Palace of Seville is located in the historic centre, just behind the cathedral. Here you will find the Plaza del Triunfo with the Archivo de Indias. You will easily find the entrance of the palace from this square.
The time printed on the tickets is the time of entry in the Royal Apartments, you can enter the Alcazar anytime of the day you have the tickets for. You should therefore arrive at the Royal Alcazar at least thirty minutes in advance of that time to be able to make it to Royal Apartments from the main entrance.
The time you select to make your purchase will be the access to the Real Room (Royal Apartments/Cuarto Real Alto), for access to the High Real Room. It is essential to deliver the ticket or the reservation number to the personnel located at The Patio de la Monteria with 15 minutes in advance at the time fixed at your entrance. Otherwise you cannot make a visit to these rooms and must acquire new tickets to the next session available.
Backpacks are stored in the lockers outside the Real Rooms, be ready with 1 Euro for the locker, and you are given Audio Guides.
To be honest, every corner of the Real Alcazar is worth exploring, and you need more than half a day to do justice to the place. And then there are the gardens which were featured as Water Gardens of Dorne in Game of Thrones.
Carry a bottle of water to avoid dehydration and make sure to wear sunglasses, sunscreen and a hat to combat the Meditteranean sun.
Booking your Alcazar Seville tickets online is highly recommended as you can save time and energy by walking in through security and skipping the average hour-long ticket queues.
If you're a Game of Thrones fan, read up on the Game of Thrones filming locations prior to your visit so you can find them easily when you actually visit the palace.
The Royal Apartments in Alcazar Seville or Cuarto Real Alto, this set of eleven rooms completes the private quarters of the family. These rooms are replete with personal effects of the royal family including paintings, tapestries, beautiful furnishings and more. No one is allowed to photograph these private apartments and a visit is the only way to view them! To visit the Royal Apartments you require an additional ticket and it is open for visit only until 13:30 daily. The rooms are open only in half hour slots from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM, and only 30 people are allowed in one slot. There is a guard along with you during visit who keeps herding people so there is no possibility to linger, its strictly 30 mins for a visit.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"First of all, remember to book online otherwise you may need to queue for a couple of hours. On a Saturday with a booking we still had to wait in a queue for people with reservation for about 15 minutes. There is no priority for families with children even if booked beforehand. Also there are places where there is no lift or any ramp so we had to lift the pushchair regularly.

But, this is a unique and beautiful place. Gardens are huge and at times you can be alone, even on a busy Saturday.

All the tiles and decorations are breathtaking.. truly posh place and a must see in Seville.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"Have to say that the Alcazar was not what I expected it to be. Given that it's still used by the Royal Family, I think I expected more of the lower rooms to still be used/furnished but in fact this was effectively an empty shell in places. That said, the mixture of architecture styles was very interesting, and the lavish designs/ceilings were good to see.

The real attraction for me were the spectacular gardens. They are immense and beautifully maintained and perfect to walk around in the late afternoon sunshine.

Visiting in January we didn’t get the best of the gardens due to lack of flowers but it was still really enjoyable. It must be fantastic in late spring. Lovely walks and water features.

The palace is stunning. The attention to detail is incredible in the huge number of rooms.

If you want to visit the Royal rooms pre or early booking early is essential . We went in at 10.00 and it was sold out for the day.

It was a good move, we skipped the line for the tickets and our guide was enthusiastic. Rather unusually I thought for a local, she was proud of the Moorish heritage of Seville and the history behind Alcazar which was more complex that I imagined.

We toured the palaces and the gardens. She pointed rooms that were used for the filming of Game of Thrones.

At the end we were glad that we opted for a guided tour and then spent some further time exploring the Alcazar.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"We pre booked tickets online to avoid long queues and paid extra to take the tour of the royal apartments upstairs. Your bags have to go through security screening again upstairs before you place them in the lockers (1 euro coin needed). You are then escorted round the apartments by a security guard whilst you are following an audio guided tour. This was very interesting and worth paying the extra fee for. After this we were free to explore the rest of the palace with a different audio guide and the vast gardens at our own pace. There is a cafe in the gardens serving drinks, ice creams akes and pastries which was reasonably priced. It is probably better to go in the morning as it ets more crowded through the day. this was a beautiful palace and the gardens were worth visiting even on a cloudy January day.

I know most will say that this doesn’t compare to The Alhambra in Granada, but it wasn’t far behind. It may have been because the weather in Seville happened to be much better on the day we were at the Real Alcazar compared to the weather the day we went to The Alhambra, but we were very impressed with what we saw.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Words cannot do this palace full justice and can only be appreciated by visiting it. Bought a combined ticket for the palace and a tour of the royal apartments. Buy on line and save yourself time waiting in line. The royal apartments can only be viewed by ticket and need to turn up early as there is additional security to go through. Also remember a euro as no bags or phones allowed in so euro needed for locker. However the very nice guide has a supply of euros if you are caught out like we were. Well worth the additional cost to see around the apartments. The security guard takes you around whilst you listen to commentary on a audio guide.
After palace walk round the gardens and grab a coffee whilst youd feet recover. Then do the rest of the gardens. Expect to spend 3 hours easily here. Did not get an audio guide and found out what I needed to know from my phone. Well worth the money

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,1.0,"As a website developer the official website has decided to use a payment provider that does not work with many of the cards for visitors around the world.
When you pay by card online, the check with your bank for VbV and similar security checks, want to ensure your billing address has been provided. They do this by checking the numbers in your billing address, so for example my address of 86 Somehwere Street, Town ZZ29 4AA will only be authorsied if 86294 is passed.
As this websites information requested only asks for the ZIP code ZZ29 4AA they can only pass 294 and when compared to 86294 guess what it fails.

A few hours will take you through the beautiful rooms and gardens. Don't miss the Maria de Padilla baths under the house (enter through the garden).,Dec 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"We went there in December after Christmas and it was impressive. Especially the gardens were very nice, probably also because it was very sunny. Also the interior architecture is impressive. We didn't get to see the Royal Chamber because it's open only on certain times. Also beware of the very long waiting queues if you didn't reserve in advance.",Dec 2019

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Spent a day here and loved every moment. From the architecture to the gardens, the whole place is fantastic and if you’re a fan of ‘Game of Thrones’ you’re in for a real treat as some scenes were filmed here.
The entrance fee is worth every cent. Along with the Cathedral this is a must visit attraction in Seville.",Jan 2020
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,The most beautiful palace and gardens . Make sure you use the audio guide as gives you a great tour and all history in English . The gardens are breath taking . Give yourself a few hours and make sure you just sit and relax and take in the scenery and beauty of this place . My favourite place in Seville,Dec 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"Its a beautiful monument with a very different style of architecture. A must see in seville for people interested in architecture and history.However, if accompanied by kids, they could get bored very quickly. It is much advised to secure the entrance tickets beforehand. The queues can become extremely long. We ended up going on a Monday which is a free entrance day and hence faced terribly long queue for tickets though were lucky to get them. Later the staff declared no tickets available so many had to return back.",Dec 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"This was the last alcazar of our tour, still impressive and sprawling, easy to loose your way, so hang onto your map, and take plenty of water.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,The palace is quite big with multiple wings used by different kings.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"After attempting to beat the queues arriving at 8.30am we didn't enter until 1.30pm. Crazy long time in the queue even in December. Booking is definitely advised or going in with a tour group to get in early.

It was very beautiful inside, with very intricate architecture. The audio guide was very informative - without it you wouldn't get the full experience.

The gardens are spectacular and the palm trees are huge!

I did enjoy the visit however I'm not sure anything can justify a 4.5 hour queue... so pre-book.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"We were organised and got tickets as the queue we saw on a Sunday was unreal, our walking guide exclaimed it was the longest she had ever seen, so do be organised and do the same.
Once inside the walls the noise simply disappears and it was such an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon soaking up the beauty and different cultural and architectural styles of the gardens, fountains and accessible rooms.

Little tip:
Do buy a ticket for the upstairs rooms & chambers. It's the one thing we didn't know about....I just assumed as it was on the map it was open to visitors. It's not and tickets sell out super quickly.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"Booked in advance online, definitely worth doing as long queues even in early January to get in if not pre booked.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"Got tickets to the Real Alcazar in Sevilla. We wanted to go with our 6 month old baby but there was no option on the website to book a ticket for a baby, so we figured we could just bring him. We rushed to get to the rendevouz point on time, searching for a blue umbrella (that was on the description of the ticket). We looked everywhere but no guide with a blue umbrella.. so i called the number on the ticket. It was a newyork number (so as a Dutch person it was pretty expensive to call...). After waiting for 7 minutes, the tape just said no one was available, call again later! We started going up to the different tourguides on the square and eventually we found ours, with a white one instead of blue.
But that wasnt all... when we wanted to go in, our guide all of a sudden says we cant take our baby with us because we didnt have a ticket for him! I tried to explain that there was no option on the website for a baby. When I almost started crying, he negotiated with the guard at the gate who after a long discussion, Let us in.
The tour itself was great, but I'll never book something via headout ever again!

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,Went on a Monday with the cheap PreBooked tickets late in the afternoon. It was very busy with a queue around the block; obviously popular with some due to its movie link. A lovely historical building with those gorgeous colourful tiles that are abundant in Seville. A peaceful atmosphere even with lots of people milling about; especially in the well maintained and varied gardens.,Nov 2019

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,This place is not to be missed! I would recommend visiting Alcazar with a tour guide as that way you can skip the long waiting lines and gain great insight of what the life in this palace was really like. I visited this palace with GetYourGuide tour. The tour guide Miguel was very knowledgeable and passionate about the history of Spain and Alcazar. The most enjoyable part of the palace were the magical gardens. I would really recommend spending at least an hour exploring the gardens alone.,Dec 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Needless to say that is the reason why travelling to sevilla.,but to avoid the long queues and be able to plan your trip is advised ro book a timed entrance in advance or join a tour (they have a special entrance).

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"I had made plans to visit here before i arrived in Spain,but somehow overlooked booking the tickets in advance. read forums and saw on their local news that the queues could be hours long,so on the day of my visit,i gambled by arriving just 1 hour before the opening time and oh yes,its true. the line was all the way back and could have lasted maybe 2-3 hours even !
was approched by someone if i was interested to join a tour which also ensure a skip the line (yeay to no queues !). we paid around €30+ each person but doesnt matter to me because i was not gonna queue for hours.Its not really a huge place so if you wander around on your own,maybe give yourself 45min-1 hour. beautiful place,to be honest. worth a visit.

really,pls come here prepared.remember to book your tickets weeks in advanced ! save yourself some money and hassle :)

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"You do have to plan ahead like the most popular attractions but not the Seville Cathedral fortunately. Buy tickets and line up a guide ahead of time not to wait in line. I did not have a guide here and I enjoyed it but think it would have been better having a private guide which I always prefer. Since I`m into photography, the outside gardens were a real bonus for me. My wife was sick in her hotel room so I checked it out by myself and it was nice.",Oct 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,1.0,"Glad I have been before and seen it , spent two hours queuing today and when I realised that I would have to spend another hour to get in I gave up, yes it is lovely but in my opinion it’s been spoilt by the fact that you can only get an online booking several days in advance , I suspect this is to do with the large number of “official guides” who come up to you in the queue trying to offer overinflated tours with the promise of no queue. The Seville tourist board need to sort it so that people can actually just queue for a reasonable amount of time to get in the castle. Some things not right here and it’s gone down hill from when I visited last time 12 years ago. Wasn’t so bad for me from the uk and who has seen it before but felt bad for the person from the US who couldn’t get in and probably would never get another chance , rubbish experience all round !

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"It was was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, The Alcazar offers some of the best surviving examples of Mudejar architecture.It also features Gothic, Renaissance and Romanesque design elements from previous stages of construction.The upper levels of the Alcázar are still used by the royal family as their official residence in Seville.

The Alcazar of Seville was used as a location for scenes in Season Five, and Six of the hugely successful  Game of Thrones, standing in for the Water Gardens of Dorne. The palace was also used to shoot the Emerald City, based on The Wizard of Oz, in late 2015 and broadcast in 2016.

Although all tourists books or website say Alcazar are extensive and fascinating and should spend two to three hours minimum. The I would say one to two hours will be very enough as staying here is an unpleasant experience for as tourists are all over the place.
There are two queues at the entrance, one for those with tickets already purchased online which I highly recommend you to pre purchase the tickets to avoid long queue and another for buying tickets on the door. The price is the same, but the queue for buying tickets on the door is slightly longer, usually over half an hour。

塞維利亞王宮是一座摩爾人的城堡。塞維利亞王宮是穆迪札爾風格（mudéjar）建築留存的最佳實例之一，還具有以前建築中的哥特式，文藝復興時期和羅馬式設計元素。於1987年被聯合國教科文組織（UNESCO）列為世界遺產，

塞維利亞的城堡被用作第五季《權力的遊戲》的場景地點。這座宮殿還曾在2015年末拍攝過以《綠野仙踪》，

現時Alcázar的高層仍用作王室的官方住所。 儘管所有遊客的書籍或網站都說遊覽《城堡》至少應花費兩到三個小時，但我認為花一兩個小時就足夠了，因為這裏到處都是遊客，所以難以暢遊，但是你可考慮夜游王宮，人流會較少。

 入口處有兩個隊列，一個用於已經在線購買門票的隊列，我建議您提前購買門票以避免排隊；而另一個則是在門上購買門票。價格是一樣的，但是在門上買票的隊列稍長，通常超過半小時。

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"The Alcázar is one of the most impressive sites I’ve ever seen in my life. The palace has an extraordinarily rich history, with Moorish and Christian influences.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,3.0,"No doubt the architecture and such is lovely, but this is more like a ruin. Not well kept, in my opinion. If you want a tour you should book in advance, but I just stood in line by 9-10am and paid 11 euros to walk around on my own. Stood in line about 45 minutes on a busy weekend in Sevilla Dec 6-9, 2019. Was told when the King visits he does not stay here, but rather at the King Alfonso 13 hotel, which is also lovely.

When I booked two weeks before the visit, there were already no time slots available for the Royal apartments. Nevertheless, the palace is amazing. The gardens are extensive and there is a lot to see there. Do not miss the musical fountain - it is one of the few of its kind. This palace is so impressive from a historical point of view as well. In these halls the destiny of some of the most important maritime expeditions was discussed and decided upon. I bought the audio guide, but to be honest I didn't find it that useful. There was enough information provided and the guide wasn't needed. Another thing that might be of interest is that Game of trones was filmed here. The entrance fee is 11.50 for the ground floor visit and additional 4.50 EUR if you want to visit the Royal apartments. It is a really breathtaking place and a must-see if you are in Seville.

Others had been standing in line a lot longer than us and there were quite a few grumpy people. Whilst the pre-booked ticket line moved through relatively quickly, the regular ticket line did not. Those tickets are only available when the visitor numbers inside the Alcazar allow. So when there are lots of large groups and people with pre-booked tickets - the wait is much longer. It was too late to book a ticket online for the next day so we decided to come back first thing the following morning - we still had to wait in line for an hour but we finally got in.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"I will begin with the only downside of the palace - No lockers! (They offer lockers if you go to the upper quarters but only for tat part) Keep that in mind as you'll be walking around for hours, including up and down stairs. I highly recommend spending €6 for the audio guide it really gives you so much more information you wouldn't get otherwise. There's A café on the premises and a Gift shop. We ordered online after reading the reviews but when we arrived (Thursday) there was a very short line and no online order was really needed (we ordered through headout. w\fees it came to €24.42 instead of €17.5). The palace is amazing! So many details, you can spend hours exploring the different tiles, ceilings, structures, shapes, paintings. We were just in owe at the amount of details invested in the palace. Once we head out to the gardens it was such joy to see all the fruit trees, flowers blossoming, small ponds, Peacocks, Ducks, Birds, Fishes. It's a fantastic experience altogether and should be enjoyed for at least 4-5 hours, go to every nook and cranny you never know what you'll find.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"This is absolutely a must see when visiting Seville. From the architecture of the buildings to the gardens, this is a beautiful site that cannot be missed.

The entrance is located close to the cathedral at the Puerta del Leon which has red walls and a lion above the gate. There are two lines, one with and without tickets. Would highly recommend booking tickets in advance as the line without tickets was quite long even on a November day. You will be passing through a security checkpoint before entering. Once inside, would recommend spending at least 4 hours here to soak in the entire site. The audio guide was useful and goes into detail about each location. Aside from the complex of buildings, don’t forget to visit the gardens which Game of Thrones fans will recognize from scenes of Dorne.

Note that ordinary tickets give you access to the entire ground floor and the gardens. The second floor (Cuarto Real Alto) requires a special timed ticket that you should reserve well in advance online. This gives you a special tour of the portion of the complex that is used by the current royal family. This tour has many restrictions though. First, you must arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled time. Upon checking in, they will ask that all your bags and phones be stored in lockers. You need to have a one Euro coin to use the lockers (you will get it back). You will get an additional audio guide that once started will guide you through the roughly 45-minute tour. A guard will be following you the entire time, but his job is to just shepherd you from room to room while the audio guide does all the explaining. No photography is allowed inside this tour (but allowed everywhere outside of Cuarto Real Alto). In my opinion, the tour was only OK. The rooms we saw were nice but definitely not the best parts of this site. I would not be too dismayed if you were not able to secure a time slot.

There is a café onsite by the gardens that served sandwiches and other pastries. A small gift shop is located close to the exit. Definitely wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking around a lot and some of the pavement can be uneven.

Didnt buy the audio tour handset and definitely got by without needing it. Wow, each corner you took led to another room, garden, terrace. A magical place, totally loved the peace of the gardens, getting away from some of the busier parts for a while. Very peaceful, stunning scenery and architecture. What a fabulous place. Easily could spend mist of the day there, wandering around without feeling the need to rush. A great cafe, and a small gift shop both reasonably priced.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,Situated in the centre of Sevilla this is a landmark attraction. There are a series of ornate rooms (many moorish) and court yards. There is no organised way around the place you just keep wandering into different areas and it gets confusing after a while. There is a cafe and WCs and a lush garden near the cafe. If possible you may find it better to book online to avoid the queues. People 65 and over can receive a 50 % discount on admission on production of their passport.

This ruined the whole experience for me.

You should keep in mind you can pay in Euro if you have cash.

Alcazar is a must visit on anyone's itinerary to Seville, we loved our time there, not restricted to an organised visit of 1.5 hours, there is just too much to see in this time. We hired audio information to assist us which were invaluable, you can use in any order and revisit areas if they are busy. There are lots of people on tours in every area, but we found as the day progressed many had left. On Mondays from 4pm the entry is free.",Nov 2019

Finally, we did it last November.
The city was incredible. Despite the crowded queue for visiting the Real Alcazar ( we where waiting 3 long hours), the result was marvellous. The Cathedral was impressive and the top of the Giralda is very similar to the stunning views of the top of the Rock in Manhattan.
The tastes and richness of the Andalusian cuisine is a good point in favour.
All and all consider, this is a visit that you don't have to miss.

Wander through the gardens and the palace of Pedro I and see the courtyard and the Hall of the Ambassadors and the living quarters, all of which are a hybrid of Christian and Muslim architecture and decorations. The mezzanine is from the days of Charles V and is luxurious and impressive. The gardens are wonderful. Wander past the pool of Mercury (after the God) continuously filled by water flowing through a pipe from a reused Roman aqueduct, and through the 8-squares garden to a fountain that is over 500 years old. Walk in the vestibule atop the old wall. It's a wonderful experience. The place closes at 6 pm in the winter, but you are ""ejected"" at 5:45.

We went in just before time, passing a long queue of non ticket holders and stayed until 5.45pm. We decided that as we had all day to wander we would hire the audio guide which was simple to use and very informative.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon at the Real Alcázar. We felt that we got the most out of our visit by booking in advance on the official website not only because we avoided the long queues to buy tickets, but also because we were able to get tickets for the tour of the cuarto real alto (upper royal apartments) which are limited and often sell out. I booked about a month in advance and bought combined Alcázar + royal apartments (12:00 tour) tickets + audioguides (@ €23 per person). Earlier tour tickets had already sold out. We arrived at the Lions' Gate entrance of the Real Alcázar at about 11:30, had our tickets scanned, and entered. No queue!  We found the meeting point for the tour of the royal apartments which was up the stairs at the far right corner of the courtyard and were there 15 minutes before our tour as recommended. We waited to have our belongings scanned and then placed them in a locker for €1 (money was returned when we retrieved our belongings). We were given special audioguides that would automatically play as we entered a room and were told that no photos were allowed on the tour. As our small group of 10 people toured the apartments, a security guard accompanied us. The tour lasted only 30 minutes, but in that short time we saw stunning rooms and learned about the gorgeous furnishings, beautiful art pieces, and history of the rooms. The Spanish royal family still uses these rooms when they visit Seville so it is understandable that security is so tight. 

After the tour, we picked up a map and our audioguides (for the rest of the Alcázar and gardens) in a store near the entrance. The audioguides were helpful and gave us a better understanding of what we were seeing. There was so much to see and the blend of Christian and Moorish architecture was magnificent to behold. We loved the intricate ceilings and plasterwork, colourful tiles/mosaics, and the gorgeous tapestries. Tip: don’t forget to see the easy-to-miss Baths of Maria de Padilla located under the Patio del Crucero (especially if you’re a Game of Thrones fan).

We were lucky to have a beautiful warm day to wander through the lovely gardens. Though the flowers may not have been at their peak in October, the gardens and water features were still impressive. My husband and I enjoyed watching the peacocks and parrots in the garden. If you like mazes, make sure you check out the hedge maze. 

We took a break mid afternoon and had lunch at the on site cafeteria. We found the food and drinks to be reasonably priced and tasty. Overall, it was a well spent afternoon at the Real Alcázar!

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,"We booked our tickets on the palace official site, including a tour of the Cuarto Real (Royal Apartments which are time based and limited to 20 persons per group). The Cuarto Real was truly amazing to see as it is a closer look at the environment of the Royal family. The other rooms and areas (liked the central vestibule which were very elegantly designed in tiles and moorish carvings. This led on further to the vast gardens and fountains.

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"The Alcazar is quite the find in Sevilla offering a small-scale version of the grandeur of the Alhambra to all visitors. However, the queue for entry is a major pain and I waited 2 hours to get in myself. That’s with an arrival half an hour prior to the official opening time. Note that there’s nowhere to sit along the queue route so if you have problems being on your feet for long periods of time, I even more highly recommend purchasing your tickets online first. The official website is the way to go and from my explorations there were tickets available online 3 days out so you could possibly purchase on Monday and visit on a Thursday.

The site itself was amazing. I was blown away by the manicured gardens and opulent decoration of the structure. There are fine details everywhere so there’s always something magical around the next corner. I spent the majority of my time in the palace itself and wish I had some more time in the expansive gardens. I would suggest planning a good 6 hours total to see the site at a leisurely pace.

I highly recommend visiting this site while in Sevilla!

Do go on a pre-booked tour to ensure you jump the very long queue and to get the most out of the history of the buildings and gardens.,Nov 2019
Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,5.0,"Real Alcazar has so much to offer. A palace, which has been beautifully restored with examples of the most desirable tiles, gardens, fountains a maze and even an English garden, which really was like walking through a large English park. Do not miss the opportunity of visiting this attraction which is very well maintained. Forgot to mention the very good cafe where peacocks stroll among the outside tables and also the shop where you can buy some very reasonably priced gifts as reminders of those stunningly beautiful tiles. Best to book your tickets online, the queues were quite long even in October.",Oct 2019

Spain,Real Alcazar de Sevilla,4.0,This place is awe inspiring and tranquil at the same time. A must see for game of thrones fans but just as worth while for a history buff. But take advantage of skip the line tickets because the line up is huge and can take well over an hour to get in.,Oct 2019

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"First off, I want to mention that the cafeteria is now back open(visited today 10/27/2021) & you can sit at their tables overlooking the animals. They also have the slushed ice drink vendor & ice cream vendor open. (In addition to snack & drink vending machines throughout). We booked a timed ticket online before we left out for the day for 2pm & even though we didn’t arrive until 2:15, it was no problem. & there was a ticket booth open, so you could have actually just bought your ticket when you arrived there. & there was no line as well. Also, I had a backpack & they don’t check or rummage through them, so you could have your bottled water or whatever in there. it’s not that large, can be “seen in 2hr”, but the more you walk around, you see different animals come out & are more active at diff times (we spent 3.75hr)& they are VERY CLOSE to you!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I honestly loved this place. I’ve struggled to fill my time in Valencia but this was a great choice.

Entry price is reasonable, I entered at 10:00 on a Monday and was not too busy.
The enclosures are fantastic as different species live amongst each other. The animals looked relaxed and happy too which I find the most important factor.
Plenty of drink vending machines and toilets dotted around the place. I spent 1 hour and 45 minutes here on my own.

Easy to get to without car, number 3 metro and a 10 minute walk

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This is one of the best zoos in the world. Its 'zooimmersion' concept means that you get the feeling that the animals are visiting you rather than the other way around. The zoo is themed around Africa and has one of the most impressive animal habitats you'll see. Large, spacious and you really get the feeling that you're visiting the African Savannah. We were so happy to be back again after four years!

Be advised, it's not allowed to bring your own food. My only point of feedback is that staff could be more friendly.",Sep 2021
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"The park was great. It was smaller and done in about 2 hrs. I thought some of the areas could be improved, but overall it did remind me of San Diego Zoo or Disney’s Animal Kingdom (just smaller scale). Definitely worth a trip to see the animals.",Sep 2021

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,2.0,Very poor COVID management herding people into large waiting groups. Making a bad situation 10 times worse. Really ruined the day at what is normally a great day out.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We visted here whilst having a weekend away in València.. Our son is 3 years old so didn't have to pay for him.. We booked online and was happy with the price for 2 adults. We booked the 12oclock entry and when we got there the que was massive but then we spotted the online ticket que we waited maybe 5 mins and was in so very happy with that.
The bridge across had lovely veiws and the park itself was just WOW!
How natural it all looked, how clean it all was, it was amazing!
The animals all seem happy and able to get away from visitors eyes if needed too and seem to have plenty of space in a natural environment, running water and fresh green grass seemed to be a prominent feature in all inclosures which makes the habitats feel very natural and much better than other zoos we have visted.
We stopped and had lunch which overlooked the giraffes and was a lovely view while having a bite to eat, food and drink was very fairly priced compared to most tourist attractions.
We left very happy and would happily have payed more than the ticket price.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,Loved it. We went with my husband and we could see so many species and have some drinks/food next to the animals. Better than the London Zoo.,Feb 2021
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,This is the best zoo I’ve been to! I am so happy to see how well the enclosures are kept and how healthy the animals look. My toddler loved running around and looking through the different view points (some his height). The walk ways are well shaded and there are private rooms to breastfeed (if desired). The restaurant and cafe were great too although there wasn’t much for vegetarians/vegans. All this despite covid restrictions. We had a wonderful family day out. Highly recommend :),Mar 2021
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Bioparc Valencia is well worth a visit. It is beautifully laid out & very navigable. The Savannah style grounds are really attractive & provide room for the animals to roam, with bridges, rivers & rocks separating them from visitors, as opposed to cages or railings.
All food venues were shuttered during my visit due to Covid restrictions.",Feb 2021

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This place is remarkable. This is more than a park. It's truly like a small forest surrounded by animals. The Management's efforts towards maintenance is excellent. This place has every kind of animals including Sri Lankan Leopard which is very unique. As I'm from Sri Lanka, I know how beautiful this creatures are and how hard to witness their beauty as these species are really rare.

A huge area has been allocated for elephants too and I noticed that they have started to expand the aquarium too which is really good.

The best part of this park is that they offer a very clear map to you at the very beginning of the tour which you have to follow and keep with you through out the visit.

They have allocated vending machines at most of the places which is really good as you would feel hungry for sure as this park is really huge!

A fair bit of walking involved but a lot of the time you’re in the shade of the trees or under cover.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"It’s a very nice mini-safari where animals seem to be quite comfortable in presence of humans. The African savanna collection is amazing: elephants, lions, antílopes, and charming giraffes. Highly recommended.",Jul 2020
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"The Bioparc is a zoo that is built with the intention of allowing the visitor to feel submerged in the habitat and I think it totally achieves this. We ended up spending the whole day there and some poor weather meant we basically had the place to ourselves. We grabbed a paella for lunch at the park, which wasn't the best paella I've had but we did get to enjoy it whilst looking out at the lions. ",Jul 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"It was all a bit of a rush and if I return to Valencia, I would like to revisit this well kept zoo. The animals looked happy and healthy - always a bonus. It was spacious and even though there were crowds around, you never felt jostled. The food inside was most disappointing so, perhaps eat before you go in as picnics are not allowed.",Apr 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We arrived around lunchtime so started with some food from the cafe inside (extremely disappointing quality and choice) but then started to wander the site. It is extremely well laid out to minimise crowds , not that there were many when we were there , and you get to see the animals form different viewpoints and relatively close up without disturbing them - so much better than many zoos we have visited. We had a keepers tour of the Lemurs island which was very informative (in English as well as Spanish). We ended up spending 4 hours here and it comes highly recommended but eat first as you cannot take your own food in either!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"So far, this is the best zoo I've visited. Loved the way they have arranged the animals for viewing. The ""park"" concept used definitely relaxes the animals and I believe they won't feel that they are caged or in a closed environment.

The property is well managed and the animals are treated with due care. It is a must visit place in Valencia.

Recommend travelers to visit on a weekday to avoid bigger crowds.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Very very clever architecture...allows you to see animals much closer than in UK zoos but without barriers as clever use of water, glass or steep banks etc. Also added bonus you can see the animals on different levels in each enclosure so up high as well as ground level or underground.
Everything clean, tidy, well organised...only gave it four stars as no sign posts so when we wanted to go back and revisit some enclosures we had to work it out on a map but hardly a big deal...

only other thing is DO NOT bring food with you as they confiscate it at the gate (they frisk your bags!) and you won’t get back until you leave..this is to prevent you feeding the animals I think but was a pain (they did allow me to bring in some items as my son has to have wheat free foods).

Fantastic day out, well worth it.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,I like this zoo very much. It is so nicely done. Animals have a lot of space and it is hard to see any cages.,Nov 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"After the shambolic entrance process (after buying your tickets you merge into the prepaid queue and have your tickets checked before entering the park).
After that minor annoyance you walk a short distance over the Turia Gardens and into an immaculately presented park. The layout is easy to follow, making sure you don’t miss out on seeing the wonderful animals who I have to say looked very happy in their enclosures which have been thoughtfully constricted to provide as natural an environment as possible.
There are many highlights but for us the elephants and the gorillas were just fantastic.
We also enjoyed a refreshment and snack in one of the cafes and sat soaking up the atmosphere.
Obviously this is an attraction geared for the younger visitor but as a mid aged couple, it certainly caters for all age groups and definitely worth the visit.

And most importantly with the sheer size of the place the animals seem to have enough space to roam about and seem to be very well cared for, with all the enclosures being very clean. Would definitely recommend to visit if in Valencia",Oct 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Many species to see. A beautiful landscape with many corners of view for the animals. Many tunnels that look like are made of rock and wood. It was perfectly organized so that you'd enjoy the visit. The best attraction for me was the hippo enclosure that you could see the hippos underwater with lots of beautiful fish in a quite interesting tunnel, it was beautiful!
But there where disadvantages too. The staff did not speak english and all the presentations, videos and everything didn't have english subtitles so that you'd understand. Only one man in the lemur enclosure knew how to speak english and could tell us some things about the lemurs. The lemur experience was bad, we couldn't see the animals because their enclosure closes just after morning and you can't get in because the staff comes and opens it for a free tour with specific timeline. When we got in we didn't understand anything because it was all spanish(video,speach) and the lady got angry and told as to come out because we where looking for the lemurs not understanding what she was saying and got out herself and we didn't see everything good enough. The man that I referred to in the lemur enclosure was her assistant and he was very polite with us but he actually didn't tell us much because the lady got us all out.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We ate at the restaurant in the zoo which was centrally located with a perfect view of the giraffes, zebras, and other birds like the ostrich. They all seemed so close and barrier free in their natural environments. The giraffes where very interactive with our baby coming by many times really close with their long necks that could reach us. We really enjoyed this park. It was not very packed so we where able to get lots of good pictures. Unlike some other zoos this zoo did not smell and seemed very organized and clean.",Oct 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Valencia Bioparc is an excellent 3-4 hour visit whilst in the area. All the animals looked healthy, active and were roaming around in the open enclosures. The whole park is unlike a zoo with cages and bars as all the enclosures are more natural with a lot of animals mixed together.
It was very busy when we visited on the 8th October and we couldn’t see all the animals as much we’d have liked to due to the crowds.
The cost was €18 per adult, no food is allowed in to the park which was a pity. We had some food taken off us and sealed in a bag then returned at the end of the day.
Definitely worth a visit when in Valencia.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Visited this amazing place on Sunday 1st September, what a beautiful place well laid out and the animals were so contented and were not penned in small enclosures, The hi lite for me was the Lemur enclosure where the Lemurs jump across branches above your head and then just chill out hanging on a branch within touching distance of you so you can get really close up and see how beautiful they are. The food and refreshments were good and not to expensive as you can find at some attractions, Brilliant day out and would definitely go there again if we ever go back to Valencia",Sep 2019

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Just returned from Valencia Bioparc! HOT! Shady areas but no respite from the scorching heat. No air con places apart from inside the cinema which showed the 10 minute clip of the work the Parc does.

Not allowed to bring your own food. Can only bring your own water! Bags got searched.

Can buy tickets online and show your mobile. No need for paper tickets as some older reviews state and that we fell for. Queued for 20 mins to buy ticket at the counter. Could have walked straight in via fast lane for those that have tickets already!

Once you get in, you’re collared by staff to take a photo with a statue gorilla! Option to buy photo when you leave. 8 euros each. We politely declined.

On way out, noticed they covered up the gorilla with a huge tarp and had elastic securing it, so you couldn’t take a photo of it!?! Bizarre given that there is a real life gorilla cage inside! Take your photo with the real animal instead!!

You then walk across this huge white bridge which runs overs the northern end of the river Turia park. Scary for those who have vertigo like myself! I couldn’t look down as was very high up!

Arrived at 11:30, so missed the lion feed at 10:30 which would have been good to watch!

Had lunch at the cafe that overlooks the giraffes, lions and other animals, free roaming. Huge plate of chips 4.50 euros. Coke from vending machine 2.50 euros. Baguettes 4.50 euros. Cornetto 2.50 euros.
Croissant 2 euros. Choc muffin 2 euros.

Parc is all African animals, elephants, giraffes, lemurs, chimpanzees, gorillas, etc.

Spent 5 hours there.

Watch the bird show. Highlight!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,We visited the bioparc in Valencia. It is really nice with separate sections for the animals from all over the world.

We had a fantastic time, we were able to see all the animals up close and all the animals look so well cared for too.

Drinks and food are pricey and they do search your bags on the door so you aren’t able to take any food in with you. You are allowed water bottles though as long as they are not glass.

There are a few little play parks next to the restaurants for the kids to play on which is ideal for the adults to have a little rest whilst having a drink.

Would definitely recommend the Bioparc for a family day out!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Went to Bioparc today with our child after reading some negative reviews about the ethics of the Valencia Aquarium, glad we chose this instead as even in the +40 degree heat we enjoyed ourselves. 2 adults and 1 child came to €66. Happy animals and such clean beautiful habitats.
The points to reconsider for the parks owners/managers are the restaurants kids meals, the children’s dishes cost 9 euros and aren’t fit for human consumption! The cultlery wasn’t up to cutting through the chicken dish.. even in the Uk where we have low standards for kids food there is a choice of sandwiches at least!
We were ushered into the obligatory photo at the start of our visit and told to view them in the gift-shop on our departure, really nice photos but why print 6 of them for every visitor? if you’re claiming to be environmentally conscious just show them on a screen? most people aren’t going to pay €8 a photo as we have phones to take our own, so to see them ripped up and binned after turning down purchase is such a waste! If you insist on printing them offer them all at cost so it’s in keeping with your environmentally friendly ethos? Alternatively sell them on to the visitors personal memory sticks etc and stop printing them all!
Overall though, a good day out. Enjoy Valencia x

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"This is a different kind of zoo with an Animal Kingdom vibe - you get close to the animals, who have generous enclosures, and wander around a ‘Savannah’ or through giant resin tree trunks. It’s definitely best to go early if you can - you can take in plastic water bottles but no food - inside its reasonably priced, bar the slushies which were double Merlin prices.

A few things could be better - firstly, no food but smoking, allegedly not allowed yet everywhere - we walked through clouds of it. Also there’s a gorilla statue at the start and photographer - get too near said statue with your own phone and you get shouted at - hardly welcoming and the photos I saw at the end were poor. If they want to be called a bioparc, they should also do more for the environment and get rid of the plastic everywhere rather than claim it’s recyclable : they could learn a lot from the Eden project. It’s also ridiculous that you are not allowed back in if you take respite from the heat.

The carrefour nearby has the cheapest cafe ever - two euros for tortilla and a drink - and there’s also swan pedals at the nearby park.

I’ve been 3 times - twice with a school trip and once with family. It’s enjoyable and worth the trip, though with a school they make you stay with a guide mainly so you see very little albeit well explained. At time of writing free tickets if you spent 30 euros at carrefour. With the terrible exchange rate with the euro currently still worth it -just- for a morning’s entertainment.

For a good part you are separately by very little which makes for great pics and good viewing. We went in July when it was baking hot, and so we planned for an afternoon visit which meant it was not too busy and the weather cooled down during our visit which was perfect! They have some casual eating places, ice-cream hut etc... they do say not to take in your own food but we saw plenty of people eating things they had bought in with them. With the walking around, breaks for good and drink we spent all afternoon there. I would recommend this place when in Valencia.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Brilliant zoo which emphasises the importance of conservation efforts in a world which all too often forgets that animals are just as important creatures as we are.

Couple that with the fact that we had to trek around three food venues on site to find one veggie option! I find this ultimately hypocritical. If your MO is conserving the planet, why support the industry that is most responsible for its destruction - the meat industry?

The menu at the “Snack Bar” had a bocadillo de tortilla (Spanish omelette baguette) and a sandwich vegetal, which according to the menu, contained egg and asparagus. When ordering I double checked with the staff that it was vegetarian. Great! Until I take it back to my table, and after three bites sink my teeth into a massive wad of tuna fish. I took the sandwich back and the bar staff were upset that this had happened, which was a relief - other places have insisted that fish is vegetarian - so they brought me another sandwich. With tuna fish in it. The third sandwich they brought (with many apologies) had no meat in it.

How can a park, reportedly dedicated to respecting the planet and conserving animals, not cater to the demographic most concerned with animal welfare?

Additionally, if you’re going to run a campaign within the park for eliminating single-use plastic from your catering facilities, for environmental reasons, I have some advice. 1) consider eliminating the single use plastics behind the counter - I saw bar staff using plastic bottles, plastic bags, plastic wrap etc.
2) consider introducing drinking fountains around the park, rather than just selling plastic bottles of water from vending machines.
3) consider committing in full to the environmental message by either reducing the meat in your menus, or by ensuring it is all responsibly sourced.

Despite the clear hypocrisy in this park, and the fishy taste it left in my mouth(!) ... this is an important and successful zoo with considerate animal enclosures. They have made clear efforts towards animal conservation shown in their good track record of births within the zoo, as well as their many donations and collaborations with external organisations. This is a great zoo, with some improvement needed in terms of the internal facilities and general message.

We booked our tickets at the Tourist information centre in Valencia and were able to jump the queue.

The map of the attraction takes you on a trip to Arfica. I think the first thing that struck me was there were no bars, this did not feel like a traditional zoo. All the animals were in open enclosures and we were separated by the clever use of ditches, water barriers, glass and height difference. What this meant was you really get the feeling of being very close to some magnificant animals. The day we visited was a local public holiday, but the park is well laid out and it did not feel crowded and there were plenty of places to observer the animals.

I probably took way too many photographs, but I would recommedn this attraction if you are in Valencia.

It is very accessible, no stairs etc. so easy to get round.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,3.0,"Some parts of the park are nice and well laid out, some are a little more run down and in need of attention and updating (which I am sure is planned). We got a slight discount with our tourist cards so the price was average. The entrance almost makes the park look closed down and empty but when you get further back is better presented.

Most of the animals seem fulfilled and entertained in decent sized display areas, with room enough to move, and it was easy to see most of them from most angles.

I have been to ALOT of animal parks worldwide and this is the first one where my bag was checked and food items were taken from me and stored in a locker. Arriving in the afternoon our plan was to wonder around and eat these snacks, then have a substantial meal later on in the day in the park. However extremely disappointingly the restaurants/ kiosks all closed early and had nothing more than unappetizing looking rolls and sandwiches left when we got to them leaving us paying high prices for vending machine snacks to tide us over.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,We went at 5:30 the temperature was more comfortable and it was very quiet. I am not a big fan of zoos and some of the animals seemed a bit miserable and some parts were over crowded. Other parts were really well done and well maintained.,Jul 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"The park it’s self focuses on allowing the animals as much freedom as possible and having environments more similar to the wild than a zoo which is good to see. The animals all looked well kept and seemed happy. The price to get in was just over €23 euros which we didn’t think was too bad however we had seen all the animals within a couple of hours, which was disappointing compared to the entry price but it was still a nice day out.

I’d definitely recommend this park, as it’s a great attraction with beautiful animals and helpful staff

Dozing lions relax on rocks overlooking plains of feeding antelope and zebra. Giraffe wander aimlessly amongst them all - almost close enough to touch

My daughter was in two minds about the visit, but having witnessed the spacious and thoughtfully designed enclosures, was happy to have changed her mind.

Go ! You wont regret it.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I’m not typically one to visit zoos, but we needed a break from our busy travels and spent 3 hours at the zoo one morning and it was so delightful!

The arrangement of animals they have is really quite exciting but as someone from North America, we truly loved how little of “caging” there was. It felt like you were right near the animals, but there was this trust that you would respect the animals and the zookeepers wishes. It was lovely to listen to all the sounds of the animals and it made us forget we were in a big city. They have shows where the zookeepers come out or they speak about a specific animal and they are so well done!

Give yourself a few hours to relax, listen and watch some really magical creatures. The chimpanzee clan has a new baby who is quite entertaining and the gorillas are so human-like you’ll have a hard time watching!

Could not do pre booked tickets as couldn’t find a way to buy a mobile ticket (you seemed to need a print out - not possible in holiday home) so we turned up as they opened 10am on a Thursday and got in within 5 mins.

Park didn’t disappoint. Loved seeing the lemurs as they were let out in the morning (1030). Stopped for a snack at about 1130 (avoided the lunchtime rush by doing this).

Only downside was the shop - there was a bit of a hard sell on the photos we had taken on the way in (don’t you want to have the memories?) but the photos were grainy and not so flattering to be honest. Also they said they can order taxis for you ... but the phone seemed to be unplugged so they couldn’t. (I thought they could have done it on a mobile or given us a number to call but instead we were told to flag one down

We ended up using my taxi app to order one as waited for 10 mins in the heat for one to flag down with no luck.

We hoped the place would be a bit larger and feature a larger variety of animals besides those native to Africa, but overall it was a pleasant experience I can recommend to others.

You should also be aware of student discounts they provide, just make sure you bring your student card.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,1.0,"We decided to visit Valencia Biopark in Spain. It was a warm sunny day in May. After seeing some of the animals, we took a break, bought ice cream and were sitting at one of the tables near the river to watch the animals from the café.
But what happened in front of us shocked us enorm.
A big bird with black feathers started suffocating a little baby duck.
Minute by minute while our ice cream melt, the little duck was dying.
I screamed at the bird, tried to scare it away, tried to find help, but with no success. The little duck was killed and its family watched the whole thing from the river. Finally I found a lady from the café, she called a staff member and after 10 minutes the dead duck and its family was gone as nothing did happen. But the big bird was still there, spreading its wings in the air, waiting for another victim to kill.
We were afraid, that it could fly over, cause we were not sure, what kind of bird it is. Later I found out, that the bird is called marabou.
The staff member didn´t even try to speak with me and apologize or ask how all of this happened, although I stood by.
Another thing was that as we walked in the Biopark, on the left side was a green field and a hienna came out. She was watching us and was only a few meters from us. But the only fence was less than 1 meter high, so actually she could freely attack us.
There was also a section with free walking monkeys and I asked the same staff member, if it´s dangerous. She laughed at me, instead being professional.
It´s a responsibility of the biopark not to let animals that are danger for other animals in one place together.
I find this BIOPARK very dangerous. We saw whole groups of cute little children, that were visiting the park. I wouldn´t recommend to visit it at all. Today is a little duck dead, but tomorrow could be a human.

There are some activities scheduled (where the animal keepers tell you more about the animals) and a show at 1 pm about bird and mammalians which is very nice. It is not too cheap and I though the visit lasted longer. It is true that animals are not in cages and their habitat seem to be reproduced at its best, but sometimes I still could notice the sadness in their expressions (the big gorilla for example seemed resigned). There were full of families with babies and I think they enjoyed the park very much. I went there because I read about it and it was highly recommended, but if I could go back in time I would go for something else, probably my expectations were too high.
Good for families with babies.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Biopark Valencia is famous for its landscaping. And that is well justified. It’s a remarkably lovely zoo. Some of the landscaping was so good that I couldn’t believe it was artificial (the underground caves).

Landscaping was excellent and the enclosures for the elephants, giraffes, and zebra were wonderful.

However, there were surprising flaws. It was very difficult to navigate. We often did not know where we were. Yes, we had a map but there were almost no signs anywhere. This is true of many zoos, but I felt that the Biopark was exceptionally bad.
We also saw a member of the cat family on a tiny island. It was going in circles repeating the same behavior over and over again. this was a sign of the type of distress we’ve seen at other zoos when animals were in enclosures that were far too small. We were very upset by this.

As photographer I was disappointed by the glass. Some animals could be seen only through glass (e.g., the gorillas). However, the glass was very poor and highly reflective. High-quality photography was simply not possible, Surely, non-reflective glass could have been used.

We also encounter tiny glass enclosures for small insects and frogs. These were in bright sunlight and it was almost impossible to see the insects behind the glass because of reflections.

So, much though has gone into designing some of the enclosures ... but much less thought has gone in to designing the ""visitor experience.""

Biopark Valencia is a good zoo, but it could have been a great zoo.

We went in April and was very quiet with no queues but made the mistake of expecting to purchase the “spring deal” at the gate but this is online only and 24 hrs in advance ( bit annouying as this wasn’t made clear at tourist info) so we paid 47 Euro for two instead of 38.
The majority of walkways are designed as rocky tunnels and mini canyons with either open viewing or glass screens (depending on the animals) and creates a degree of intamacy when viewing the animals not often found in other zoos.
All the animals look in very good condition and the enclosures look fresh and clean which again is unusual for many zoos and wonderful to see.
The information boards at each enclosure are great and quite comprehensive which again is great to see. Well worth a visit if you have time when in Valencia.

We enjoyed a whole day there and were very impressed at the layout. Good access for wheelchairs. Well worth a visit. There is an underground parking for easy access that cost 6€ for all day. Easy to find and very well laid out.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Firstly, the animals look to be in very good condition, in spacious clean enclosures.

There are lots of different animals. The Giraffes (my favourite) were in the middle with lots of viewing places and tryouts could even watch them while having a snack. There are plenty gorillas for the boys too.

Book ticket in advance to avoid the queue we were in within 5 minutes having just bought a standard price ticket at the tourist information centre. The general queue looked quite long.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Want a fab day out, it’s a must. Ok, in principle I do not like the idea of zoos and animals being locked up. But Bioparc has really tried to give them space and at the same time maximising the visual impact for visitors.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"The Bioparc Valencia is a fantastic place to visit. The animals are well looked after in fantastic settings. The layout is great and the the place is very friendly for disabled and wheelchair users. The facilities are second to none and the way the animals are free to roam is wonderful. Add to that the good work done to preserve species, one of the chimpanzees has recently given birth two twins and to see the interaction of mother and babies was amazing.",Feb 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"It’s a great place to visit with the family.
Animals seem to like the conditions very familiar to the native, but at the same time comfortable to watch for the visitors.
Lots of cute, gorgeous, strange, little, big animals.
Exist time when animals are out and people can comunícate with them.
Totally luv it.",Feb 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I spent the day walking round amazed at how the animals looked like they were just in their natural habitat. I struggled to see the boundaries as it was just all so natural.

The other great thing is you don’t have to lift children up to see the animal enclosures as everything is low (but completely safe!)

The cafe was great and we had lunch overlooking the lions and giraffes - amazing!

We loved it so much we have now bought annual passes so will definitely be back!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Amazing array of happy looking animals. Perfect amount of walking balanced with exhibits and they have done it up so feels like there are no barriers. Quite expensive. Under 5s go free but with two adults, a 5 year old and a 3 year old it cost about 65 Euro. Stayed about 4 hours and had a reasonably priced sandwich for lunch. Kids loved it, especially the cafe area which was adjacent to the giraffes.",Feb 2019
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I usually don't like zoos or, rather, the concept of keeping animals caged up. However, it was a beautiful, sunny day and we were told by friends that it was worth a visit. They were right.
The entire complex is thoughtfully designed with the animals' needs in mind. Waterfalls abound, there was sun and shade, the grounds are perfectly cared for and, most importantly, the animals seemed very content.
The focus is on African animals (gorillas, lemurs, giraffes, elephants, hippos, chimps, meerkats, etc.) Because the hot summer weather of Valencia is similar to their natural environment.
Make sure you get a schedule of the feeding times and shows, which will enhance your experience.
The entrance fee may be a little steep but it's well worth it knowing you're supporting such an important cause. Hint: if you're over 65 yrs you can get a senior discount rate!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"What a beautiful well laid out zoo. After the admissions kiosk you walk over the bridge and down into the zoo. It is extremely well sign posted. If you keep to the right all the time you will see everything. The animals all look very well cared for and have plenty of space to move about. The hippopotamus are a sight to behold, you can watch these swimming underwater. The baby gorilla was lovely. This is possibly one of the best zoos I have visited. We spent 6 hours here and walked around slowly twice, seeing things we missed the first time around. There are plenty of eateries here, and we had a panini meal deal for 9 euros for 2 of us which is a bargain at the cafe overlooking the lake. Would definitely visit again.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This is the nicest zoo I have ever been to. The enclosures and visitors walk ways are designed beautifully, and the animals seem to have interesting and well thought out habitats. I read on their website before I visited that they took a 'no bars on cages' approach, and was skeptical as to how they would pull this off, but I can honestly say no animal was behind any sort of metal cage. Instead, 'natural' barriers are used, boulders, ditches, glass and in one case, an impressive waterfall!

All the animals I saw looked really happy; I'm sure the warmer climate has a large part to play in this. There was also quite a few baby animals, including chimps and gorillas, and it was great to see the family units interact together.

The ticket price is expensive, but this is the same for almost every zoo in the world, such is the cost of keeping these animals. From what I could tell from the signage, it looked like if you were local then a yearly pass worked out very cheap providing you visited a few times.

I would defiantly visit again.

We had seen so many beautiful places in Valencia but the one place we hadn’t visit was the Bioparc Zoo, in the central Valencia, how great is that! We had a really great time and it was worth the visit. To see the animals in almost their original environment is awesome. We found a place where you can almost feel you were standing on a meadow in the movie Madagascar. You won’t be disappointed visiting the Bioparc Zoo in Valencia.",Oct 2018

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"This is a different 'zoo'. The animals are kept in the wild. The reddish soil gives the place an exotic feel. However it is the most expensive zoo I have ever visited. It comes to around Euros 100 for a family of four with teenagers. No family rates available and you are not allowed to bring in your own food either. Besides, I would have expected some climbing frames for teenagers. The place is very small compared to other zoos we have visited. No petting farm. It is also a bit of a walk with public transport.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This is an astonishing place, which the usual zoos with cages can’t even be compared to. You really feel like you’re in the wild nature with the animals by being very close to them with no dividing borders. Sometimes it even gets a bit scary. When we approached the lions it seemed like they could’ve easily jumped over the river to where we were standing as the river was only 3-4 meters wide. My favorite animals are giraffes and there are lots of them here. I was able to get very close but, unfortunately, it’s not allowed to feed them.
This was our second time in Bioparc Valencia but it seems impossible to get tired of this place.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Where do I begin? I have visited many zoos but this place is like a little bit of Africa within the beautiful city of Valencia. The landscaping is amazing with waterfalls and 'baobab' trees and the animals happily graze in mixed groups as they would in their natural habitat, it is riveting to watch the various un-fettered animals congregate at the many watering holes. The landscape appears seamless and emulates the animals normal environment - no bars here. You feel you are part of the scenery as they have cleverly worked the footways to weave around the setting to enable many viewpoints. The place is vast - allow a day. When we thought things couldn't get better we decided to stay and watch the evening exhibition in the arena and we were so pleased we did. I have never seen anything like this staged at a zoo, various animals and birds provided a brilliant and very well organised display - included porcupines, warthogs and birds of prey. It was a wonderful day in a wonderful place - visit it - you will want to go again and again (I know I do)!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Let me begin by saying I am not normally a fan of zoos at all, in the many that I have visited with the kids they have either been too small cages with bored looking, pacing animals or you can't see the animals at all. These was nothing like this at all, though not the largest zoo I've been to there is certainly plenty to see. There weren't any of the animals that we couldn't see during the visit and you are close up to them as well (safe enough distance though). The zoo was laid out very well and we easily followed a route through all the exhibitions. There were plenty of baby animals to see which was lovely. We didn't visit the cinema so can't comment on that, however we went to the open air display and I was very impressed! The animals were literally walking round just by our feet and birds flying over our heads! There was a lady telling us all about them which was in Spanish unfortunately but it didn't spoil the enjoyment of it. Food is expensive as it always is in these places but it was nice to sit by the enclosure while we ate and watched the zebras and other animals. There is a small playpark which entertained the kids for a little bit at the end.
It doesn't feel like you are in a city at all.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We spent 5 days in Valencia and had heard about the Biopark so decided to visit, we weren't disappointed it was a great day out!! We caught the hop-on bus in the Cathedral square (red-line) and asked for our entry ticket to the Biopark to be included. Nice tour through City on Bus which took us 30 mins or so to get to the Park. You could walk to the Park through the Turia as its signed posted when you get to the end, imagine it would take 30 to 40 minutes or so to walk from the Centre of town. Good idea we booked our Park tickets with combined Bus as we walked straight into the Park rather than queue for 20-30 mins to buy our tickets. Drinks machine and toilets as you enter the park, everywhere clean. We were given a map of the Park that was useful. Nice entrance to the Park over a bridge that we think spanned the Turia. We followed the map in an anticlockwise direction so pretty much saw everything. The Park is brilliant, animals were mixed together in what felt like natural surroundings with plenty of space. Rhinos were mixed with Zebra's and the Giraffes were just about in touching distance. Part of the Park was below ground so we could see Hippos submerged in water with fish swimming around. We took a break after a couple of hours walking as there was a nice café in the centre of the Park serving snack type food and drinks, overlooked an open space where the animals roamed freely. Plenty of information boards in English explaining about animals and origin. There was a group of 30 or so kinder children arrive when we were there and was great to see them having fun. It was a nice sunny day when we visited so good idea to take a hat. The following day it rained so likewise as its quite exposed wear waterproofs. We spent around 5 hours in the Park including lunch just taking a leisurely walk around in the sun. We had a fantastic day at the Biopark and as we intend to visit Valencia again will definitely go to the Biopark. Caught the hop-on bus right outside the Park which took us into the centre of town.

There is a route round the park which takes you through the different geographic areas. All the animals look healthy and there are things to break up the visit if with young children.

We had a snack in the cafe, basic food choices but reasonable value, and sat overlooking a scene from the Serengeti.

A bit off the beaten track. We took a taxi from the centre cost €8. Can take metro but still a 10 minute walk from the station.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Best get there early as it's quite big.
I was advised to print my tickets in advance to avoid the queues so that was good but I didn't know we are not allowed our own food in so it was kept at the entrance and given back on our way out.
There are drinks/ice creams and food places once inside.

The Bioparc advertises no bars and cages, which is accurate for many of the animals, but the animals are enclosed and contained. That being said, the animals had a lot of space and the bioparc did a good job trying to replicate their habitats.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,nice zoo although not as spacious for the animals as some I've visited the gorillas were amazing as you can get so close to them. I do think none of the animals seem to have any toys or brain enrichment items so they all looked bore. the chimps should have had things to lay with at least. not the best zoo I've visited to be honest,Sep 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,This is the best viewing of wildlife I have seen. The animals look and act in a very contented way. The keepers are very helpful and professional clearly proud of their workplace I will visit again when I am next in Valencia. Thanks for a great time.,Sep 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,If you are visiting Valencia for a short break do not miss the Biopark. Stunning experience of being so close to the animals.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Brilliant zoo set in the green space that runs through the city. Lots of different areas covered with a wide range of animals: lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants, giraffes, gorillas, chimps, hippos and many more. Took 2/3 hours to see it all. Well laid out and all the animals had huge enclosures. Around 24 euros which was good value for the attraction.",Sep 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"This is a very nice zoo, with a great variety of animals, and it is located near the city centre (20 minutes by bus).

The layout is a little difficult to navigate and it is quite expensive, but still well worth a visit.

I would suggest going first thing (opens at 10) to see the best of the animals and avoid the heat. I would also recommend pre-booking to avoid the queue.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"The Bioparc was a really refreshing take on the normal zoo set up. They seem to have really tried to create a space as close to the animals natural habitat as possible. It was a lovely thing to see the animals relaxed and up close. We went on a week day so it wasn’t too busy and made for a relaxing visit, it’s not that big so I imagine it would get quite busy on a weekend. We paid around 24 Euro each for adults so on a par with the British zoos. One thing I would say is don’t waste money bringing your own lunch or snacks, you aren’t allowed to bring in food or drink other than water and they do check your bag.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This zoo is the best I've been to so far. The animals are very close to you. Everything is designed and integrated well. We really enjoyed the machines which turn your 5-cent coin into a souvenir, and also the food in restaurant Samburu - you get a tray and choose a drink, a salad, a main course and a dessert and bread, all for 15,20 per adult. Then you can eat outside just next to the zebras, rhinos and other animals. It was a great experience. There is also a student discount for the tickets.",Sep 2018

The zoo was absolutely amazing, i would say if we had to compare it to the aquarium, i would say this beats it hands down. Plus this is the nicest zoo ive ever been to. Its so open and theres lots of space for children to explore and see the animals in environment that feels natural. Really job well done in designing such a nice place. Our little girl really enjoyed it. Also the restaurant was situated really well, where you can have lunch and
watch some of the animals. which we felt was really relaxing.",Aug 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,Fantastic experience with our little boy who enjoyed getting close to the animals (behind glass and face-to-face with the Lemurs!!) Food in the restaurant (canteen...?) not so great... maybe try other options at the park... but the view from the restaurant distracts from what you are eating!!,Sep 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"While it is plainly a good thing to see animals in their natural habitat, trips to deepest Africa are not always guaranteed to include sightings. Bioparc comes as close in many ways to being a positive way to present animals. All of the animals looked healthy and most seemed relaxed and content. The community of gorillas were especially impressive and the fact that they are breeding seems to indicate they are well cared for.
We spent a full day here and could have stayed longer. The keepers prioritised the welfare of the animals but were very helpful and informative. The exhibiition of flying birds is very popular so get there early for a good seat.Well worth the admission fee.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Zoos are the source of a lot of concern for people because of the conditions animals are kept in but when it comes to conservation and looking after their animals I have to say the Bioparc seems to have a good balance. Animals like lemurs roam free in their wide ranging enclosure and the space given to gorillas, chimpanzees, lions and giraffes is amongst the biggest and best I’ve seen.

What else sets this park apart from the others is how close you feel you are to the animals. The fencing is very clever in certain areas because you almost feel like a lion could just walk up and say hello! Which of course is a big thrill when a huge cat approaches...

With education and conservation playing an important role in the ethos of the park it is not like many other zoos and well worth visiting. The grounds are beautiful with plenty of places to eat and drink too. Service can be slow in the restaurant and perhaps a better system than two lines serving food and just two cashiers would be more appropriate. By the time we sat down with our food it was starting to get cold. Only a minor complaint - definitely worth a visit apart from that.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,If like me you have mixed views on zoos and animals in captivity then you may also find yourself surprised at just how enjoyable a day out this can be. A great take on Africa and its animals and all recreated in fabulous surroundings and helped massively by the glorious Valencian weather. This is what zoos should be like! Well done to all involved.,Aug 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,To keep the review short and sweet... I live in San Diego and I like this one better. It’s not bigger but I feel the animals enjoy this place better. They keep the focus on the care of animals and not making a dollar.,Sep 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,Great experience. different from other zoos I´ve been. You walk on trails visiting different animals. Right at the beginning you can enter in the Lemure´s place where they are free. This raised my expectations making me believe that there was the standard (Of course not for dangerous animals) but I was later a little disappointed knowing that they were the only ones like this. But the park is nice. Food and places to eat are bad and expensive as all kind of places like this. Bring your own food if you can.,Aug 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,One of the greatest zoo's I've ever been too.....a lol overcrowded by 1pm...and it gets very hot...but just a huge WOW,Aug 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"Great environment with open areas for the animals that are mostly not hidden behind great walls so you really feel you can get close.

Especially the lemur area is awesome when you can walk in between them. If they are just in the trees, then come back later, they will move through the area on the ground at some point. Also the giraf area allows you to get really close if you are lucky that they come to eat near the viewpoint.

The map of the animal areas could have been a little better and at some places it was a little too crowded. We went to Valencia Bioparc on a Monday, thinking there would be fewer people and maybe there was but I would recommend being there when it opens and maybe hit the gorilla/chimpanzee area first as this was one of the more packed areas.
Nevertheless, a really great place to visit for all ages!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"My friend and I had a Valencia card and had tickets for this bio park included. I was a bit skeptical about coming here as it's not nice seeing animals in captivity and I try not to go to zoos for this reason. However, on the whole I was pleasantly surprised with how laid back and calm the animals appeared and their environments were pretty spacious, open air and the animals were mixed, for example the zebras, rhinos and ostriches share a large area. It was a beautifully laid out park and very informative about the different animals and how they are threatened in the wild. It's a nice space for families and children. The giraffes were a highlight as they came so close to us and I loved the wild boars who followed each other around in a line. The only negative was some of the other people visiting; some people were making monkey noises at the gorillas and were so noisy in the nocturnal animals area where there were signs to remind people to be quiet and respect that the animals were resting. I think the park should have more staff around to remind people to be respectful. Also they needed more staffing in the food areas as they were run singlehandedly.

Amazing animals everywhere - truly wonderfully natural experience. fascinating. well done valencianos",Sep 2017
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"What an amazing experience. I actually didn't know what to expect to be honest. I thought it was just another zoo but it really is better than that. Considering where it is when you arrive it is hard to believe what awaits you when you go in. It was fairly quiet on this day so we only queued for a few minutes. Its a bit of a walk to then get to the start of the park but you can understand why because of where it is. There is a natural route which everyone seemed to follow at the start so we followed too. It made perfect sense as it does take you all round the park. There is a fair amount of shade in places, we were grateful for this as it was a hot day and with 2 young children it was much needed. So the animals. Some are that close you can touch them, although you obviously cannot. Our favourite were the giraffes. We sat at the café next to their enclosure by a pond with huge fish to watch swim around. We sat at a table just inside the café and had a great view of the giraffes running around. It really was great to watch. The food was ok. Small choice of baguettes which were nice. There was also the usual choice of chips and hotdogs and cakes. We spent 25 Euros on 2 baguettes, 2 cakes , a plate of chips, 2 beers and 2 fruit juices. I didn't think this was too bad. When we left we walked further round the giraffe enclosure where a giraffe was eating a snack and I kid you not, hits head was about a foot from where you can stand and watch. I have never been that close to a wild animal before. We continued round until we reached a play park where the kids expelled some energy and got very sweaty in the heat! My husband and I sat and had a beer from the café there and we had bottles of water ready for the kids to gulp down frequently. There are water vending machines everywhere so we got a couple of bottles whenever we needed too. The souvenir shops are very expensive, for example a small teddy was 15 Euros. Too much but the kids had been given spending money before we came so they chose what to spend it on. Any other time I would not pay those kind of prices when I know I can get the same for less elsewhere. One thing to note is that you cannot take food in, I guess because of the animals being so free. I think there are 3 places in total where you can purchase food including a self service restaurant. overall this was a great day and great experience for all ages. Really recommend a visit.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Superb experience from beginning to end. Never been to a zoo like it. They create the impression that you are immersed in the animals’ world. It therefore makes you believe the animals are happier (certainly more than most sorry-looking enclosures you see at other zoos). The kids absolutely loved it. If you’re in Valencia with a young family, this should be top of your list!!",Aug 2018

However, I was completely blown away at seeing how well the park is set out. The big cats were playing, which I’d never seen happen at other zoos. We sat at open cafe and watched the giraffes canter across in front of us, it felt like being on a safari. The Biopark definitely has left a long lasting impression, all for the good.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Usually skeptical of the environments animals are kept in, we were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful grounds and open space in the zoo. The animals were very active and entertaining. We had just visited the Barcelona zoo and our daughters came out of there very sad and and questioning if zoos were ethical. But after visiting the Bioparc in Valencia the girls were so happy and stated this is what a zoo should be like. The highlight was the number of baby gorillas. So amazing to watch the interchange between the mother and her babies as well as the protective father. Would recommend a visit to this zoo 100% You will not be disappointed.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Had the best experience in Bioparc Valencia. Have been unsure about my opinion towards zoos since animals are kept in small cages but this was not the case in Bioparc Valencia. Animals have a lot of space and cages(if u can even say so) really similar to their natural habitat, different species living together etc. Also as a visitor its amazing because a lot of animals can interact with people - giraffes came really close, lemurs have an open space where u can walk and so on.

Only minus was uncultimated children who were just screaming at animals(making elephant noises for example) and their parents who did nothing about it - respect the animals!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I’ve been here about 5 times and love it. This year especially, there are a lot of babies. It’s very cleverly laid out with water barriers rather than fences that make you feel part of the animals’ world. We normally go towards the end of the day when it’s less busy and you can see some animals being put to bed!

One tiny complaint would be the restaurant (which is amazing, with a balcony backing onto the park), but it uses lots of plastic - knives, forks, paper plates that can’t be recycled I imagine due to grease). Seemed a bit strange for a ‘bio’ parc to be producing so much unnecessary plastic waste.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Bioparc Valencia is a truly beautiful zoo! The way is designed is very smart, there are no cages or barriers, and where the animals need to be separate they divide them with natural obstacles such as deep lakes. The animals seemed very well taken care of and living in good conditions, the keepers of the zoo told us about how they rotate them so that none of them is exposed for too long to the audience. There are hourly talks by the zoo keepers where you can learn very interesting facts about conservation and the life of the animals that live at Bioparc.Also, it is 100% wheelchair accessible, no stairs.

Have a coffee at their amazing terrace at their cafe! it is shaded and fresh, and it is almost inside one of their 'african savannas' environments, tables are soo close to the giraffes and zebras.

I thought the giraffe/rhino/zebra areas were really good as many animals were enclosed together which is what would happen in the real world.
The zoo is not huge, it’s medium sized but it is probably one of the nicest and cleanest zoos I have been too. We walked around in about three hours including having some lunch and watching the bird and mammal show which were really good. Would recommend.

We had a wonderful time here and the staff were very helpful and plenty of places for a snack or meal too. Only slight quibble is that it wasn't very well signposted after we alighted from the metro.

I hate zoos but this has some ethics behind it. The gorilla looked pretty upset but the rest of the animals seem happy enough and have shade and aren’t alone.

For us it was €45.00 for two of us, we spent the majority of the day there.

I would say bring some food as there only vending machines and ice cream stalls on premises!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This zoo is amazing. It is fairly small but excellently laid out. The animals all look happy and really well cared for and all seem to have lots to keep them entertained, even the snake had a few obstacles in his cage to keep him busy. You really get a sense that you are in amongst the animals from the way everything has been presented. The hippos were particularly great, being able to see them swimming under water was amazing. We were on an excursion and had about 2 hours here. We managed to see everything in that time, going around at a normal pace, but would have been quite happy to have taken our time and stayed longer if we could. I would definitely recommend this place for a visit.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"As an environmentalist I have always held deep conflicted feelings about animals in captivity. The balance of the need for conservation verses animal welfare has been a hot topic for years however, I feel this compact venue has an amazing balance for the visitor and the (other) species contained within. The areas across the park flow to provide the animals a greater area to live in with a variety of compatible species. The animals seemed relaxed and at ease, curious of the visitors. The nocturnal animals were also visible to humans via viewing windows to their slumber chambers. The design, decor, the rocks, the logs, the flow and water courses were an absolute delight. The hippo in with the aqua region was an absolute delight. Well done Spain for show casing a fine example of sympathetic animal conservation.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,3.0,this is a lovely place if you want a quite scenic walk. There’s loads of different flowers and trees to see and plenty of place to sit and rest.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We wisited biopark in Valencia on Sunday and we thought it would be quite crowded but it wasnt. Although we were there at 17.00 it was just empty enough so the kids could see every animal there. The animals are african only so dont expect to see tigers or kengaroos. The zoo is perfect and habitats are spot on. Th6ere is a section where lemurs hang from the trees right above you so nothing between you and them. Also the paths are made as you were right there walking trough the old forest in Africa. There is a large underground parking garage under the zoo. I recommend going there by bike since it is a pleasant ride trough the park. Troughout the zoo are vending machines with bottled watter if you get thirsty. Toillets are free and in the zoo.

The cages was shared by several kinds of animals, and the information was plenty in esp, eng and pt(?).

You get a map, with times of several animal feedings and the like.
Took about 1,5h to walk through it all (wirhout shows).

Would recommend this over oceanographico any day of the week.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I went to the Bioparc not expecting much and fully prepared to come away hating the place as I'm not a fan of zoo's. However, I loved the place. It doesn't feel like a zoo at all although the animals are in captivity. There's a sense of space and you can see across the park from one side to the other so you can see the Giraffes, Lions and Elephants all at the same time and it really replicates their natural environment. Obviously they are separated but by rocks and water etc. but it's very well done. You feel like you can get up close to the animals and there were plenty to see. It's a small park but allow at least half a day to visit.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Went to the Bioparc with the family (two adults and 5 year old) whilst on holiday in Valencia. We all LOVED it.

Yes, it's not cheap, but it was a brilliant day out. We enjoyed looking at all the animals, being able to get close to the lemurs was great, but we also loved watching the other animals - giraffes, elephants and lions. The set up of the Bioparc meant that it was a pleasure to wander around the paths. Plenty of shade for animals and children alike. The enclosures indeed didn't have the normal cages so was great to be able to see animals uninterrupted. Our daughter was able to see too thanks to the steps they put in for kids.

Often people say it's a 2-3 hour trip but we happily spent 4 hours there and only left as we were getting tired. They can even arrange a taxi home for you from the shop!

Top tips
- Get there early (if you can) to avoid queuing. I think we arrived at 11am and still had to queue for 15-20 mins which would be best to avoid if possible
- Don't take food (as they check bags on the way in and some foods are not allowed). Do take water (in plastic not glass containers)
- We ate at a cafe about 1145. If you avoid the typical lunch time rush, the queues are shorter.

We much preferred this to the aquarium, so if you have to choose, then we would choose the Bioparc every time!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"If you have kids, it’s totally worth the steep entrance fee. Even if you don’t and you just love animals, this place is very interesting to visit over a 3 hour period or so. We were initially impressed with the lemurs and how you could get so close to them, take selfies, watch them follow you around, etc. We had heard that the Bioparc is not a traditional zoo, but the lemur exhibit was the only one that truly lacked “cages.” To me, it very much seems like a traditional zoo. The only thing that really sets Bioparc apart is that animals are mixed together in the same exhibit. One area could have as many as 6 different animals in it.

Food options are somewhat limited and you’re not really allowed to bring food in, so make sure you eat beforehand. It might take a bit of walking to find something.

If you are a student, bring your ID! It’s a small discount but these things add up!

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"After having visited the Bioparc Fuengirola location, I was excited to be visiting the larger location in Valencia.
It's hard to suggest any improvements for either site to improve these zoos. The gimmick of no cages really does work, the visitors seem happy and more importantly, the animals seem well taken care of.
The food was definitely better at the Fuengirola location, but it's understandable due to the size of this zoo, that a faster service would be required.",Jun 2018

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,Having not been in a zoo for many years I was very impressed. The zoo is split into different areas and there is a lot of animals to see. This also included a show in an inclosed area where they realised birds of prey and several animals.,Jun 2018
Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We came to Valencia for a 3 day break and the bio park was on the too of my to do list. The price is brilliant for 23.80, I think it is? Once you're in you're able to wander around all the different areas and you also get to see animals at different perspectives. Some are hiding away but almost always managed to see them.

The only downside was we went on a Saturday which meant lots of family's and children. This is absolutely fine but does make the park fairly busy and chlostrouphobic around certain areas.

Loved it and bad a great day out we spent 2 hours to walk around the whole place bht we would kf probably spent more had it not been so busy.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"We have been to many a zoo - Edinburgh, Beijing, San Diego... But this is the best so far! Feel so close to the animals and get the feeling they are well looked after and challenged as far as they can be in their captive environments. Enclosures are as far from enclosed as possible - with as many species living together as possible (without the risk of them eating one another!). Whole place is well thought out to allow for shade from the Valencian sun and for excellent views. Don't allow your own food in so we nipped across to hypermarket over the road and grabbed a picnic to have in the lovely park just next to bioparc before we went in. We have been twice now and would say that midweek calm was definitely better - and go early if possible as some areas are restricted in the later afternoon for the welfare of the animals.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,4.0,"This is definitely one of the best zoos we have visited, and believe you me we have been to lots with an animal mad, zoologist in waiting, daughter.

The zoo has an African theme, and hence animals from this continent only. It is extremely well laid out, with large, well maintained enclosures, great walkways and the opportunity to view each of the enclosures from several different angles.
The zoo is not massive – we walked around in about two hours, had a great, reasonably priced snack lunch and then walked round again – doing two circuits meant we saw every animal!

Lunch at the cafe sat overlooking one of the savannahs with the antelope coming very close to drink was superb. A real plus was the reasonably priced, good quality food - unlike the Oceanografic.

The ONLY downside was the huge number of school groups. We were very impressed that each group seemed to be accompanied by a member of the staff from the zoo, who were obviously explaining about the animals, their habitats and their habits. However this was all done with absolutely no consideration for other visitors – for example we stood looking at the giraffes from the other side of the path while a school group were viewing the animals, answering questions etc. etc. – we could not see the animals clearly and had to wait nearly 10 minutes before the school party moved on. We spent quite a bit of the day trying to avoid noisy school parties, which to be honest was nearly impossible and leads to our rating of only 4 out of 5. It would be easy for the staff of both the schools and the zoo to move the kids so that other visitors also had access to the viewing areas.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,I have been to lots of zoos in my time but this zoo is by far the best. Open enclosures with so much room for the animals to roam - no fences as such - it was so refreshing to see the animals enjoying themselves rather than pacing or walking around the fence line. The park is easy to get around and look out for specials on entry - we picked up two tickets with a drink and snack for €38 (normal price for entry alone is €23). The Madagascar enclosure was the best being able to walk through and have all of the lemurs running around your feet and being free.,May 2018

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"This zoo is unlike most of the others I have visited around the World. It's layout is that you think there are no barriers between you and the wild animals before you. They have cleverly designed little hills, trees, shrubbery and rocks to stop the animals getting too close, this not only looks amazing, but it gives the animals that natural feel to their environment. The enclosures are breathtaking, especially in the sunshine. All of the animals looked really well looked after, they and their environment was really clean. There was a variety of eateries and shops too. Lots of benches to sit down on and take a rest. And even though it was busy, it was large enough for everyone. I especially enjoyed the show about Africa in the big auditorium. They had the animals doing what they would do naturally, instead of making them do tricks. It was really interesting.

Not a cage in sight, just big enclosures with glass panels here and there and moats so that the animals can be seen in their natural environments. The big deal is the elephant enclosure and on our visit it was being refurbished so not an elephant in sight. The giraffes were tucked away as the worry seems that their enclosure was too grassy and that eating the fresh young grass might have given them laminitis, a dangerous foot condition.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"I have a certain view about Zoo’s and animals held in captivity, but thanks to the recommendation of a friend we decided to give this attraction a visit and we were so glad that we had. As you will read from other reviews the Bioparc has been constructed in such a way not only to give the animals wonderful surroundings to live in, but also allow visitors the opportunity to meander through the grounds viewing them; it really does not feel like a zoo at all. The enclosures have been thoughtfully constructed. You are going to need over 3 hours here, but beware you cannot take food and drinks (other than water in a plastic bottle) into the parc, therefore making you, the visitor, a ‘captive’ audience to purchase your refreshments at high prices! Considering the size of the attraction, the entry prices are not too bad and there is a discount for pensioners. (We are over 65 and from the U.K., so with proof of age, via our driving licences we got in for €17.50 each.) All the animals are unique and amazing. Some areas are escorted with commentaries from Parc staff like Madagascar where the lemurs are, but entrance times are clearly listed. The highlight for us was the Gorillas and the most wonderful baby Gorilla bonding with it’s mother, right next to the enclosure window glass. We walked our legs off, but it was all worth while. Don’t forget the sunscreen if the weather is hot!

The gorillas and leopards were definite highlights. On the negative side, there was no information leaflet provided at the ticket office about feeding times or special shows. There was very limited access to 'Madagascar' to see the lemurs and the talk given by the keeper was in Spanish only, yet more than half the visitors were non-Spanish speakers. Given the high admission charge, there should be more focus on the visitor experience. If you are trying to decide between a visit to the Bioparc or the Oceangrafic, then in my opinion the latter wins hands down.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,5.0,"Of course, there should be minus points, because it is still a zoo... But one of the most beautiful zoos, that I have seen - everything looks very natural, no high fences. Even if there would be no animals, it would still be amazing.
A lot of interesting animals, lemurs are walking freely in Madagaskar part. Amazing gorilla family (still not sure, how they survived - as far as I know gorillas can not be held captive, since they do not survive).
I was there during the week and it was not so crowded... Still a big minus to some strange people, knocking on the windows and calling the animals to turn around, so they can get a got shot. To this part I have no comment, but people should be perhaps learnt to show some respect to the animals.
There is also a strange part with the foto - as soon as yo enter, they make a foto with you with a gorilla (plastic, wooden or something like that) and in the end they offer you a picture -but they do not even ask you, if you wish to be in the picture.
The best way to reach the park is with the bike - enjoy the ride in the Jardens del Turia, it is about 10 km from the arts and science museum - it is really a great, easy ride, where you can admire the nature.

Again, with our Valencia card, we get a 10% discount form our ticket and so we pay only 40€ for 2. The layout is quite clearly indicated and descriptive by a map offered either in Spanish or English when you buy the tickets in the entrance. All we have to do is following the map from the beginning, for instance, we visit the immediate part of animals from Africa at the first station, then one by one we see others like those hanging in the trees, or those enjoying a sunbath lying there on the lawn. The design has a purpose chiefly not to lock the animals in a cage. But of course, for dangerous animals like tiger and lion, they have their own domain down there in the hill which cannot be reached by visitors but we can see them from the top. Elephants are having a funny farce when we arrive, seven males are fighting for the female one, lots of dust and sound are the concomitants along with this scene. Some animals are being incarcerated by glass rather than by cage, such as the big gorillas, still, they have ample place to stretch around. We spend the whole afternoon there with the bird show as our last programme before leaving the park. One thing worth mentioning is that there is a very nice and refreshing park adjacent to the bioparc. If time allowed, it's a good place to visit as well.

Spain,Bioparc Valencia,3.0,"The Biopark can be reached either by bike through Turia Park or taking the metro to Nou de Octubre- there is a 10-15 minutes walk from there towards the left side of Turia.You can buy the ticket and save some money along with your hop-on hop-off bus tour ticket.
From the exterior, the Biopark doesn't look to inviting as the buildings look neglected. Then once you arrive, you have to stay in line to get your ticket and pass after which you're invited to take a photo- except for no one told me what exactly I was supposed to expect when they've asked me to wait near the entrance nor was I asked if I'm interested in taking a pic in the first place. Once you cross the bridge, you enter arrive at the Cinema - either take a note when the film is or forget about it as no one will remind you further on- it's not mentioned on the ticket or map you're given either.
The same goes for the exhibition place where *I think* there was some show with birds of prey- but could not guarantee it as there was no mention on what the space is for, when to go there and what to expect. The two times I've tried going there to see what's happening someone came and politely invited everyone out.
The park rebuilds the natural habitats for African species- from savana to equatorial forests and the animals are mostly in open space separated by rocks, rivers, glass and sometimes wires. In some places (near the hiennas for instance), it did not feel very safe- felt like the obstacle between the visitors and the animals wasn't too much of a protection. Some animals enjoy more space, while others are not that lucky- if you check the small aquariums for snakes and frogs, you won't see much of a difference with a petshop. I did enjoy the description of each member for some of the species- elephants and giraffes. I didn't enjoy however the large groups, the constant noise and crying from kids- the place was overfilled and most kids were stressing the animals constantly yelling and crying, tapping on the windows, etc. The number of strolls was huge as well and many times i just gave up trying to see or taking a pic as it felt unbearable.
The worst part was however the cafeteria- you're only allowed with water and an adult menu is 15,20 euro (on top of the 23,80 for entrance). Taking a simple dish won't be much cheaper either, so if you think that the menu brings two dishes, one drink,bread and fruit/dessert, you'll probably opt for the menu despite the price. Prepare to wait in line for about 20 minutes and figure out what you can grab, when and from where by yourself. I can't even imagine the stress on people working in that cafeteria.
Try avoiding going there on weekends and public holidays at all costs if you care a less crowded experience.
Overall, the tour won't take more than 3 hours and if you don't like going in circles you might even include the meal time.

I wanted to do the terraces but my husband who doesn’t like heights didn’t and I didn’t realise he could therefore have got a cheaper ticket.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,3.0,"For context I had visited the Sagrada Familia last week in Barcelona and this doesnt come close. The audio guide lacked something and I didn’t end up listening to it, the numbering didn’t have a lot of order and the cathedral was busy and I missed a few things. I wouldn’t recommended paying €4 for the audio guide. The cathedral itself was lovely and the stain glass was beautiful. I wanted to get the terraces ticket but couldn’t justify paying an extra €14. Was only in there about 20 minutes, very busy with the cruise tours and school groups. Feel like you have to do it as you are in Palma.",Oct 2021
Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,Please take even 15 minutes out of your schedule to appreciate the splendour of this amazing building. Stunning.,Oct 2021
Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,3.0,"The Cathedral is beautiful and worth a visit for the multicoloured light show through the rose window alone. It’s kinda amazing to see a cathedral draped in yellow purple and red.

That being said - there isn’t a huge amount to see here unless you have a guide - which given its €8 entrance fee is a shame. There is an audio guide you can pay again for - but you have to download and listen to it on your own phone? Given the entrance fee, and the fact you’re using your own equipment. this really should be included as it is at other attractions.

Other than that - there are very little information available to read about the cathedral meaning you just end up looking at impressive displays with zero context.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,Stunning cathedral with some OTT decor inside. Should we be feeding the poor as a church or gilding everything in sight ? Anyway it made for a beautiful visit. Favourite part was one of the large circular windows creating disco effects as the sun beamed through. Loved sitting to pray and also gazing at stained glass high up. Make sure you pay the 20 euros to see the roof and the sacred art museum. Climbing the 138 steps through the roof brought a raised heart rate and fabulous views. Stunning place.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,The cathedral is open until 1415 for tourists and is worth getting to early to avoid the coach parties.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,very impressive cathedral with excellent views outside . Reasonable information to understand the different parts .,Sep 2021
Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"I paid the 20 euros price to get entry and access to the galleries, which seeing the queues outside i was glad i did as we went straight through and into the cathedral.

It seems so much bigger inside than it looks from the outside even though from outside it appears massive, once you step inside it seems to reach epic proportions.

The way up to the galleries is on a very narrow steep spiral staircase of around 160 steps which are really not suitable for anyone with any difficulties in mobility, the views from atop the cathedral over the city and the harbour are stunning, as is the view towards the mountains and Bellver castle.

Once back on the ground the walk around the cathedral's many chapels is a walk back in time to a period when christianity was at its peak and money was no object to devotion, the amount of time and money spent on these chapels is incredible.

However the one chapel which stands out the most is the newest one by Miquel Barcelo, it looks completely different to all the other sin the cathedral but it is this difference which makes it so impressive

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,Pretty impressive to be honest. The stained glass windows are absolutely breath taking and the whole place is well presented and in great shape. A leisurely 30 min stroll around but that was about it.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"A worthwhile experience. Somewhat heavy looking from the outside the cathedral nave soars to a great height. Sit down and simply take in the vast expanse.
We slowly worked our way around the various alters. It takes time to take it all in. There is an option to climb to the terrace. Our knees have become too old for that!
Spend some time in the attached museum. There is of course a gift shop $$$ Watch out.
Best time is early when the Basilica opens, 1000 and before the cruise boat tourists arrive.
Give yourself two hours to absorb the beauty and spirit of the church.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"The Cathedral in Palma is astonishing in all the best ways. It’s a soaringly immense structure (its nave is significantly taller than that of Notre Dame’s), which sits adjacent the Almudaina and looks out to the Mediterranean along the old Roman wall. The inside is glorious, but even walking around the outside is a joy. Look for the gargoyles in different animal-ish shapes. A tour of the interior is worth it—it offers insights on the construction, on Gaudi’s brief involvement in alterations to parts of the cathedral, and on the moments during the year when the light through the cathedral’s rose window aligns with the window opposite. Absolutely a must-see in town.

The cathedral was not completed until the 17th century and is a massive place with its 21 chapels.
It has lots of beautiful stained glass windows and one of them, the great rose window, is one of the largest ones in gothic architecture.
The one window that I didn’t like was in the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament which I found spooky looking and didn’t like at all.
That one area aside, there was a lot to look at here and it was nice to sit on a pew and take in the atmosphere too.

Beautiful big stained glass windows are incredible. Looks amazing when sunlight goes through them, it makes sightseeing even more unforgettable. Good place to visit if you are Antonio Gaudi´s fan.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"It is not surprising that the cathedral is ranked the number one attraction in Palma. The start of its construction dates back to 1229 and its floor to ceiling height is 44 metres. The entrance tickets cost 8 Euros, which also includes access to the cathedral museum and cloisters. You enter the cathedral close to the museum so include it at the beginning of end of your cathedral tour. In my view there are three main areas of particular “don’t miss” interest in the cathedral; the Corpus Christi Chapel featuring the Last Supper, the Chapel of the Holy/Blessed Sacrament; a Gaudi inspired ‘modern’ 20th/21st century representation by the artist Miguel Barcelo, which cost 3 million Euros and the Chapel of Our Lady of the Crown. It’s good to visit in bright sun light, as the colours from the stained glass windows are reflected across the walls with a colourful glow. Plan to stay 1 to 1.5 hours. Highly recommended and a ‘must-see’ in Palma.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"We enjoyed walking around the exterior and interior of this beautiful gothic Cathedral which is the symbol of Palma. We made the mistake of not paying for an audio headset or a guide and as a result we didn't get the best out of the experience. Written information in English is limited inside the Cathedral and in the museum the incredible artifacts are poorly curated with no information at all.
Also we felt also there needed to be a thorough cleaning of the interior as thick layers of dust could clearly be seen on the statues, religious icons etc which must be damaging them. Hence 4 stars instead of five. But do go and and see it. Stunning!

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"You can only marvel at the wonder of Palma Cathedral, even if you are of no religous background, it is well worth a visit.
The views from the outside terraces are just as good, overlooking the sea and port where all the cruise ships dock. Be prepared to queue if you have not pre-booked a ticket. The queues were long especially if a cruise ship was in port. We pre-booked our tickets with click-mallorca.com and they were the same cost if you paid on the day, however you could only pay in cash, 8 euros each, if you joined the queues. We were able to walk straight in showing our tickets to a security guard. The entrance for pre-booked tickets is overlooking the main terrace out to the port.
We spent a good hour looking around and then sitting just enjoying the architecture and the magnificent stained glass windows.
If visiting the city this is a must see trip.

The 2 rose windows are magnificent and the 20th and 21st Century alterations and additions made it feel like a living and evolving building rather than just a 'museum piece'.

However, I have been to almost all the famous cathedrals and churches in Europe such as Vatican, Seville, Barcelona, Italy and France etc, and found this one to be somewhat poorly maintained.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"We were holidaying in Mallorca in August and pre-booked the rooftop terrace tour. Each tour is limited to about 20 people, so not too crowded.

There are a lot of spiral steps to get to the roof, and the staircase is very small and hot, so that's worth bearing in mind if you are slightly claustrophobic.

When you get to the roof, the views are amazing and you get to spend about 20 to 30 minutes up there so plenty of time to wander and take photos.

The only down side was that the tour guide told us at the beginning of the tour that she didn't speak very good English and, to be honest, she wasn't wrong. I do find it amazing how some guides are able to switch between multiple languages, and I'm not one of those people who expect everybody in a foreign country to be able to speak English, but I do think when you've spent 36 Euros for 3 people on a tour, then you do kind of have an expectation that you will be able to understand the guide. Anyway, that didn't take away from the experience and the views, so would still recommend.

We booked a sightseeing bus and walking tour of the city and cathedral and was worth the money, €18 for the bus and another €20 for the tour and cathedral and it was worth it.
You get to enter the cathedral through a separate entrance so no queuing so it is worth paying that but extra.
The cathedral is absolutely stunning both inside and outside, picturesque and the gothic architecture is amazing!

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"Took a cab from our cruise ship to the Catedral de Mallorca with my handicapped Mother who uses a mobility scooter. Cabs take credit cards and Euros (not US dollars). Approx $12 Euros. Most cabs (and buses) will drop you at the base of the Cathedral and you have to walk up big flights of stairs to the entrance. Lot's of annoying street hawkers and beggars around the courtyards.. Ask your driver to take you to the top of the hill and drop you off. At that point you are very close to the entrance with no staircases to climb. If you do end up at the base and want to avoid the stairs: walk to the left of the Cathedral, past the courtyard fountains, past the second large set of stairs and turn right (you should see horse carriages) and take the road to the top. Turn right and follow the road to the top. The entrance to the Cathedral is on your left - It is not clearly marked until you get up close. The road does have an incline, but mom's scooter handled it fine. They do ask for shoulders and knees to be covered (but they were not strict in enforcing this on the day we were there). Tickets for entry at $8 plus another $4 for the audio tour.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,3.0,"This huge building dominates the city and its position on the shoreline means it hasn't been lost in a modern urban sprawl. It took around 400 years to build, starting from the reconquest of the island from the Moors in 1229. There is grassland and a promenade in front of the cathedral and the entrance for individuals is at the side. Our tardiness in leaving the hotel meant we had about 20 minutes to queue but it was in the shade so was ok. Entry was €8, cash only to avoid tax probably and you had the option of hiring an audio guide too. Inside the cathedral was bright and airy and had coloured light on the columns from the modern stained glass windows. It was also crowded, I'm used to northern European cathedrals that are really just tourist attractions rather than places of worship now. I guess Spain is a lot more religious than the UK and the cathedral was also a lot more gaudy (or is that Gaudi?!) with baroque exuberance everywhere. Not my kind of thing and to be honest, I'd have been happier just seeing the outside in hindsight.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"Not to be missed. Notice the majestic Gaudí lamp coronating the altar. A modern computer study has shown that the slender columns are engineered to be right at the center of the safety structure range. Another interesting fact: The Cathedral is at an angle with respect to the street layout of the old Roman city, the reason being that the basilica was built over the foundations of a Mosque, and thus it is oriented toward Mecca. Take a few minutes to admire the huge Rosettas at both ends of the Cathedral. Twice a year the sun shines through both at the same moment.",Aug 2019

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"We have visited many cathedrals and churches across the whole of Europe, and this one came second only to the Sagrada Familia. Architecture of the cathedral is beautiful with the stained glass windows and beautiful lighting. A highlight was each of the chapels (complete with English description) which gave a lot of background to the Saints that are honoured in Majorca.

A big tip is to visit on a Sunday from 12.45pm - 1.45pm, as we got free entry and an hour is more than enough for your time here (although keep in mind that on a Sunday most shops/restaurants are shut and it’s very quiet, so YMMV).

Don’t miss this on your trip to Majorca, even if you’re at a resort it is worth catching a bus to explore the Cathedral and it’s surrounding streets.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"La Seu or “the cathedral of light” is a Gothic cathedral, one of the tallest in Europe. A really impressive with its dimensions building which you can marvel at from the lake below. The most interesting to me was the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament by Gaudí (maybe because I haven’t had the chance to enter Sagrada Família in Barcelona. This chapel was a breath of fresh air in almost the same Gòtic churches).
The lake below the building is artificial though very beautiful especially in the evening around 8pm when it mirrors La Seu behind.
Be careful if you want to go to the terraces. We weren’t told at the ticket point that there are 2 ticket prices - with 14€ and without terraces 8€. Terraces hours are 10am, 11am, 12, 16, 17, 18. Once you are inside you can not buy separate ticket for the terraces and there is no separate entrance to climb up.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"Having visited Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, it was hard to imagine anything coming close to it's majesty and magnificence but this certainly does.

A range of chapels border the main seating area and high altar. The range of architecture and artwork is stunning and the windows cast light in the most magnificent ways. It really is not to be missed.

A couple of helpful tips:
We arrived at 950am and queued briefly until it opened at 10. Be aware, pre-booked tickets can get straight to the entrance scanning kiosks but this isn't signposted and we queued until close to the ticket booths before finding this out.

Arriving for opening meant we had quite a few minutes of quiet and empty time in the Cathedral with a handful of others but it quickly fills up and becomes busy.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"Quite lovely, I have been to many basilicas/cathedrals across Europe, and I recommend this one. Be sure to make time for a half or full-day, because behind the cathedral is Old Town Palma, which has lots of shops and restaurants.

I will say, I ate two different tapas plates at two different restaurants and they were both rather mediocre (St Ambrose is the name of the one I remember), so I would recommend researching good restaurants in the area, instead of just wandering into a place.

I recommend taking the time to explore around, perhaps grab a cocktail or some tapas after the cathedral. A great break from the beaches.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"One of the most striking landmarks of any city in the world! The cathedral’s soaring gothic architecture rises up on the coast with flying buttresses towering over the sea. It’s really easy to imagine oar-struck mariners gazing at these carved walls when arriving at the port of Palma hundreds of years ago - what is such civilisation - what is such a god!
The cathedral itself is late compared with other gothic cathedrals of Northern Europe, and less ornate in some façades. The interior is mighty impressive, boasting one of the highest naves of all such buildings. Curiously, most if not all of the effigies are brightly coloured (unlike in Northern Europe), but seemed tainted due to a thick covering of dust that shrouded most of the interior. One of the most eye-catching features is the canopy which looks contemporary - we discovered later that this is by Gaudí - so well worth closer inspection.
Be warned, the cathedral closes rather early - some days at 5.15, and there will likely be delays getting in due to queuing.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"It is no chance that the tallest Gothic temple in Spain (the belfry is 44 m high) and second tallest church in Europe is called “La Seu” – “The Light”: Risen in the forefront of the Capital Palma on the Balearic Islands, throning over all around, with severe but distinguished beautiful forms it tactfully invites one to enter this temple of spirit and to pray frankly and in seclusion. One is impressed by the beauty and harmony of this sacred place and turns back to the 13th century when the construction started – it was only 400 years later when the whole was ready and could send lauds to the skies. A master work of incomparable artistry, even from outside and especially in its interior it creates an atmosphere of Divinity and a feeling of freedom beyond time and space, rising above and coming closer to the Lord God. The specific skyline of Palma is dominated by the majestic corps of the Cathedral attached to tradition and religious activity. Built as a token of gratitude and respect for God’s grace and generosity La Seu inspires to noble thoughts and beneficial activity.
Some details deserve more attention due to unique character or chef-d’oeuvres from famous authors (even the great Antonio Gaudi contributed to the perfect balance between the diverse styles of art): The Cathedral incorporates 21 chapels, 9 bells and 61 glass windows and is exceedingly rich decorated by medieval icons and ancient treasures (gold, silver and jewel works). On the glass windows one can follow scenes from the Old and New Testaments and the penetrating and refracting light rays lend an irresistible charm to the whole culminating in the “Gothic Eye” – the largest rosette in the world interplaying and combining light and colors to fantastic unimaginable tints in the inner of the temple and charming pictures on the floor. And more, and more…. Days are needed calmly and profoundly to explore and fully admire what the eyes see and the soul perceives – as Antoine de Saint Exupery once said “only the heart could see the invisible!” At the end, it wasn’t a usual visit, it was a festivity for eye and soul indeed: We left the religious shrine of Palma and the Balearic “transfigurated” and unanimously felt sparkles from that “Light” which gave us mercy, kindness, noblesse and brought us closer to heaven. The mission of “La Seu” to propagate the light of God’s words from on high and far-reaching was in fact realized.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,This beautiful cathedral took over 400 years to complete and was built on the former site of a mosque. Its' interior has several interesting things to see like the immense stained glass rose window and a unique chandelier created by Antoni Gaudi that hangs above the altar. Its' exterior is described as Catalan Gothic and the cathedral is a prominent sight of the city's skyline. Next to the cathedral is the Almudaina palace which was a seat of government in Moorish times. Definitely worth a visit for lovers of great architecture and history.,Aug 2019

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"Visited the cathedral last week with my husband while on a 2 week trip to Palmanova. The outdoor view is amazing, especially from the seafront prom directly across the road, which provides a good spot for photographs with all the greenery and the fountain (you just have to wait for a break in the traffic as loads of buses and lorries passing by on the main road tend to block your view. We were warned to go early because of long queues to get in during the Summer months but we didn't arrive until about 11am and despite there being loads of organised tours from the cruise ships that had docked we only had to queue for about 20 minutes to get in. We are not religious in any way but once we stepped inside the main area of the cathedral the sight took our breath away with all the architecture, stained glass windows and the lighting. It was definitely worth a visit and the entrance was only 8 Euro's.

Family outing

Palma Cathedral is a magnificent 14th-century cathedral also known as La Seu, it’s a must-visit.
Located opposite the Parc de la Mar and a superb sight for those arriving by sea.
The center rosette is a massive stain-glass window which reflects the light at certain times of the day. Spectacular.
The cathedral of Palma is on the site of the mosque which Jaume the I commissioned after his conquest of the island once liberated from the Moorish occupation.
Not many people know, but if you book about 2 months in advance, you can visit the terrace on the roof. From here you will have a birdseye view of the city and a mouthwatering view of the sea and the coast beyond.
Not recommended with very young children.
Check for opening times and availability.
Don't miss the museum.
Well worth the visit.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,4.0,"Cathedral de Mallorca is a building of outstanding size and beauty however do keep in mind that it is relatively expensive to visit (8€ pp) and you must make sure that you are “dresses appropriately” as you may he refused entry despite queuing for a while! The outside of the building is stunning and there are plenty of wonderful photo opportunities. If you buy your tickets in advance (I believe this is more expensive too!) you can jump the queue and enter through the group entrance. It is a splendid place but I only think it’s interesting for those who are interested in architecture or churches in general, other wise I don’t think it would be worth the expense. We didn’t get an audio guide so I can’t comment on that. The relics are interesting and the church is beautiful. It was very peaceful apart from the occasional screaming or loud child.

Spain,Catedral de Mallorca,5.0,"The historical La Seu Cathedral is the largest religious building on Majorca and the second largest in all of Spain, after the Cathedral of Seville. The city of Palma actually dates its origins to Roman times. The Cathedral of Majorca was constructed on one of the ancient acropolis of the city. When touring the entire Cathedral of Majorca campus, remnants of Roman ruins can still be seen. The Christian faith was part of Majorca from the fifth century. Even when the Muslim Moors conquered Majorca in 902, Christian workshop continued. When King Jaume I reconquered the island in late 1229, he vowed to erect a church in honor of the Virgin Mary. He kept his promise beginning in 1230. Although construction started in 1230, it was only finished in 1601 (i.e. construction was nearly 400 years). The cathedral actually stands where the main Arabian mosque stood during the time of the Moors. The cathedral is built in the Catalan Gothic style (rectangular with three naves, each nave has an apse) - 400 feet long, 180 feet wide and its nave is 144 feet tall. The interior build area is ~71,000 square feet and can hold 18,000 people. The cathedral is beside the Parc de la Mar and just a short distance to the Mediterranean Sea. The architecture of the Cathedral is amazing and must be seen. The eastern main rosette of the church is considered to be the largest in the world with a diameter of ~36 feet. Created in the 14th century, its more than 1,200 pieces of colored glass are pieced into patterns and floral ornaments. Between 1901 and 1914, Antoni Gaudi made some Art Nouveau changes to the cathedral, changing some important structural components and optimizing the acoustics. The tremendous chandelier above the high alter are part of Gaudi's design. Unfortunately, conservative churchmen felt Gaudi wanted to bring too much Art Nouveau elements to the Gothic cathedral and stopped his work in 1914. The Cathedral has a fortified bell tower with a total of 9 bells - bell ‘N’Eloi’ is huge with a diameter of 30 feet and a weight of ~10,000 pounds (5 tons). This site contains significant history and architectural beauty - a must see when visiting Majorca.

Q
It's location is stunning with views of the harbour and open sea - how many cathedrals have that? The gardens and walks around the building are beautiful, but the full grandeur of the church's interior has to be seen to be believed. Amazing stained glass,particularly the huge rose window above the altar cast a magical light on the interior, especially when the sun is at its height. The chapels along the sides of the building are equally beautiful. The great Gaudi of Barcelona cathedral fame had an input to the decor and fixtures in the late 19th century, and these are well worth the visit.

The trip also include the cable car to the top (be aware that this is weather dependent so may not run) If you are not on a tour you can book these on line in advance. Air at the top is a little thin so take your time and if you do feel light headed do take time to sit down – and, don’t forget it will be cold up there so bring warm clothes and also wear suitable walking boots. If you are a hiker you can hike to the very top (you need to pay for a permit). After the cable car we had a light lunch at the café at the base of the cable car, which was of good quality, before heading off to see Roques de Garcia (great for photographs).

The weather can change at any time here, so at one moment I was driving in the clouds and another in the sun. The first time I went the cable car was closed due to the wind. I learned on their website you can view if its open before going. The second time I was more lucky and could enjoy a view from two viewpoints near the cable car station. If you want to climb the real top, you need to request a permit weeks in advance. I also made two walks at the base of Teide, I liked the trail around Los Roques de Garcia alot.

At the top we regrouped and the guide walked us around a path explaining in detail what we were seeing. It was considerably colder but fresh air. There was loads of loose stones from eruptions, snow in places, steam vents with yellow sulphur sublimed where the moisture has escaped. The views were great almost like a lunar landscape. A geography lesson in one hit. The walk was quite easy but you have to wear good fitting shoes, my white trainers are no longer white from the volcanic dust.

Sadly the wifi did not work there. After 1 hour sam lady then sold the tickets with hardcopies.

After waiting another hour to go up, the discovery was ok and disappointing as you just see snow and cannot climb up the volcany.

The price per ticket was Euro 37, and honestly a rip off.

For us we recommend to make pictures of La teide fom Adeje or elsewhere for free if the sky is blue. Safe the money for a rental car to drive around the island.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Epic volcano and must see attraction of the island. I recommend to get there by bicycle (longest climb in Europe) or by car to 2350 m and then to go by cable car to 3555 m. Fantastic scenery and views. Just amazing.
I was there in December so it is important to check weather forecast not to get wet (when by bicycle). Cable car also might not operate everyday due to aversive conditions so we had to wait 3 days. You will get an email around 8.00 each day informing about it and then you can reschedule or cancel your cable car reservation.",Dec 2020
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,Would have come to Tenerife only for Teide National Park. Did the short Roques de Garcia walk followed by the climb to Teide summit via cable car ( and a special permit). AMAZING! take into account that the summit IS cold and windy. Enjoy,Dec 2020

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"The drive to the base of El Teide is worth the trip alone! The island climate coupled with the quickly changing altitude result in a number of quickly changing micro-climates; ranging from sub-tropical to desert like in the space of an hours drive! The cable car is a little expensive in my opinion (17 euro each way), though there is also the option to walk up and down, which i recommend!",Oct 2020
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Nice steady drive up to the cable cars (Eu 37) and plenty of disabled parking spots well worth a visit,Nov 2020
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Amazing place. We walked up on Blanca trail, leaving car by road. We started walking at 0700 (awake 0500 and just over an hours drive) and took 5 hours to walk to summit, then 30 mins down to cable car and took that down. Then 2k walk back to car (easy 20 mins on road and way easier than walking back down) You need to book permit to access summit (free). We are slightly fit people in our forties, ie we are active and do go hillwalking a bit. But it was hard work getting to summit because of altitude, 3700m. There is a risk of altitude sickness and I felt it a bit especially at refuge on way up, circa 3200m. But then felt fine to top, but hard work. Nobody pays any attention to acclimatising etc and most drive from sea level in morning and hike up to 3700m on a demanding ascent. So altitude sickness is a risk......... But amazing hike and an achievement, with stunning views and an active volcano (sulphur steam pours out etc). You can get cable car up and down if you want to, just walking last 200m. If hiking up be prepared, it can be cold so layers and hat. Even if 25’C at sea level it can be freezing at summit. Take maybe 2L water etc. Yes you will meet people running up and down but for normally active people not 25 any more it is an arduous but manageable hike,

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,We hired a car to drive up to the volcano ourselves as we didn't think tours would be going on etc with the coronavirus going on. Was exceptionally quiet up there. The park is much bigger than we thought and we could have prepared ourselves and gone for hikes across it. The volcano itself was inaccessible due to the cable cars being closed I think more due to the weather than coronavirus. But either way it was fairly pricey and we hadn't brought coats or trainers and the clouds kept meaning it was raining! So we headed to the beach instead!,Nov 2020

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"What an amazing trip to this special National Park. The landscape is stark which is likely why legend has it the devil lives here. The last eruption was in 1901.

We spent about an hour exploring the valley and rock formations. You can see how there were once a wall separating the two calderas.

A very popular place with many cars and busses. Take your time walking around as it takes about two hours to get back to the city proper.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,3.0,"Volcano, park itself and hikes there are beautiful, but agency organizing trips (Volcano Teide experience) is horrible and I recommend to avoid it and do the trip on your own. This Is my feedback for them:
Firstly I was unable to order thé trip at all on your website. I tried to contact support but I was given totally horrible answer, totaly unuseful. So I booked trip in another time an another type of the service And it somehow worked(?!?!). The day of the trip we were told that cabine doesnt work because of thé Wind, which would be ok if we wouldnt be rufunded only 38% of the paid price!! So we threw 88 EUR in to the toilet! We wanted to go to Teide no to have some alternative hike, which we didnt use at all and we went to Teide by ourselves. Because originally we wanted to book permission to Teide but one month in advance it was totally fully booked, so only legal way was to buy trip from you. This is shame and touristic rip off!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"The Teide National PArk provides an outstanding experience of a volcanic landscape. We drove up from Los Cristianos and stayed overnight in the Parador (see separate review) which is located opposite the Roques de Garcia. These striking rock formations come with a flat well laid walking path which provides excellent views across different volcanic landscapes. The next morning we caught the cable car to the top of the volcano (almost) which was quick and easy and gave great views over the whole park. At the top there are three marked paths - and your cable car return provides about an hour at the high altitude to do some of these walks with the audio guide that you can download when you buy your ticket. The first goes to the summit, but you will not be able to do this unless you have acquired a summit pass some weeks or months previously. The other two paths are quite rough and involve some uphill sections. One goes to the old crater and the other to ""La Fortaleza"" rock formation both offer views across the path and we did part of each walk but did not have time to get to the end. We then drove down to La Laguna, having sampled the descent of the Valle de La Orotave (Heavily forested). On La Laguna road you see the Teide observatory and some coloured rock formations before leaving the park. Try and stop off at the Portillo visitor centre, where a botanical garden gathers to gether in one place all the plants that grow in the National park. An unmissable visit.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"It was a bright clear day when we went up the cable car - you could see the crater and for miles in every direction. Truly stunning. It gets windy and cold up there so wrap up warm. There are 2 trails out to view points which are worth doing but are a bit rough under foot. One of our party suffered a bit from the altitude but he had a cold and recovered once we were down - I did see a couple of older people struggling in the same way. You book for a specific time but that is really just to manage visitor flow - you get in the next available cable car. Each car takes 44 people, mostly standing, and it is a bit of a squeeze but the journey itself is only about 5 minutes. Queueing was bearable. As one car is going up the other is coming down so the turnaround is good but queueing at the top to come back down can be pretty nippy. The website implies 1 hour up there before returning but this is not enforced - if you do both trails you need a little longer than that.

The scenery is amazing. Although it is cooler, the sun is still very strong.

We would have liked to travel up in the cable car.
Sadly we did not book online in advance.
Therefore we were presented with a two hour wait, which we chose not to accept, as we had younger children with us.
IF YOU INTEND TO TRAVEL IN THE CABLE CAR, PLEASE ENSURE YOU BOOK ONLINE IN ADVANCE.
Please also note that the cable car does not run in high winds. So check the weather forecast.
At the cable car station there is a very good souvenir shop as well as a smaller craft type shop.
There is also a very good cafe for drinks and snacks, with panoramic windows, giving excellent views.

To go above the cable car upper station requires a permit which you need to obtain online in advance There are two walks from the top cable car station which are certainly recommended The views are spectacular, and even in February there were still small pockets of snow near the paths

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"I hired a car and took a leisurely drive from Los Cristianos via Valle de San Lorenzo, Granadilla di Abona and Vilaflor (the best and most scenic route in my opinion) setting off around 9.30 am. As you enter the main crater, Las Canadas, which is vast, the landscape is just awesome! I booked online in advance for 1140 and when I arrived there were plenty of car parking spaces. One hour later and it was full. Very efficient boarding the cable car, staff very helpful, you get approx one hour at the top (I stayed a little longer, no problem, the return time doesn't seem to be fixed)) There's a path around the mountain, from the top cable car station, where you get fantastic views of Las Canadas, the main crater, the horizon beyond, surrounding islands and a close up view of Pico Viejo. You can't go to the summit anymore without buying a special ticket./ pass online a few weeks in advance, costs 66 euros, for 3 hours.The air is quite thin at the top station of the cable car, but shouldn't be an issue unless you have breathing difficulties or suffer from vertigo. Although this was January and there were patches of snow around, the sun felt quite strong in a crystal clear blue sky, so I was quite comfortable with a warm jacket over a t-shirt, and good trainers, Having been to the summit twice in the past with the family I can definitely recommend it if you don't mind the cost and the risk of cancellation due to bad weather as you have to book so far in advance, Even if you don't do the cable car trip, I can highly recommend a visit, an experience not to be missed.

It was fascinating.
The landscape changed from dry with no vegetation apart from the occasional cactus, the lovely green vegetation and pine forest, then as you get near the top it turns to dry, and rocky again. The top of the volcano looks like a moonscape and I was told a lot of the planet of the apes film was made up there.
The coach took us down a different way, it was all so interesting.
Tenerife isn’t just beaches, sun and sea, I really do recommend this trip to the highest mountain/ volcano in the Canary Islands!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Went here with my fiancee, have to say it takes your breath away seeing the clouds underneath you, the views from the top are amazing, it's very cold so wrap up and sensible footwear is needed as the footpaths are very uneven, the cable car ride from the base where there is a cafe, toilets and a gift shop is fun but they do pack you in !! I'd suggest to get there when it opens at 9am as the parking is limited and it was very busy when we got back down from the top at about 10.30 am the 27 Euros each we paid was well worth it in my opinion even the drive there was a great experience with lots of view points on the way there.
I reccomend a visit you wont be disappointed.

We bought the guided tour, although I think it would be as good without. No big queues and although we were told you could only be an hour up at the top we spent two! Great experience and certainly worth the visit.",Jan 2020
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We went on this tour with Jet2holidays, because it was an English speaking tour and we had booked our holiday through them.
The tour guide was very knowledgable, and we made at least 6+ stops to take pictures and talk about the area.
We had hoped to go up in the cable car, but it was too windy, so our money was refunded for that portion of the trip.
It was a 6 hour trip, plenty of bathroom breaks and places where you could have a snack. No food provided with this tour.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Breathtakingly beautiful views, but be prepared for the wind to rise and you won't be able to get to the top by lift. But the good thing is that although you have paid for the elevator ticket before. Then, in bad weather, the entire ticket will be refunded when you call. If you want to do the same over the internet, you will lose a small amount. Don't forget to call then. We called and got the elevator ticket refund",Dec 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We drove up to the mountain at noon from Adeje to the cable cars. The drive itself is a part of the experience.
When we arrived we were lucky and could take the parking spot of a car leaving.

Luckily we could still buy the cable car tickets on the spot (leaving within 20 minutes). The cable car ride is short (10 min). The Cable car itself had kind a of a cattle car experience.
In that sense the 50+ EUR is exaggerated.

It was chilly on top and it is advised to take a jacket with you. The walking trip -without permit- is doable with sneakers but walking shoes are recommended. The views are incredible and worth the trip.

In the end we took the other road to playa de Cristianos. This road was slightly more difficult but still very acceptable.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We hired a car for about a week of our holiday and decided to visit El Tiede. The first time we drove up there I hadn’t put any petrol in the hire car and on the way up there I suddenly panicked and realized that I wouldn’t be able to get up there and back down again without running out of petrol. I turned around after getting about 2/3 of way up there to fight another day.
We filled up with fuel and tried again two days later. It’s quite an strange experience as you start to drive through a cloud and everything goes a bit darker and colder. Then suddenly you’re driving out the other side and there is brilliant sunshine, and you realize that you’re above the clouds. The air gets a bit thinner and the scenery is absolutely stunning. The cable car taking you to almost the top takes about 6 minutes and you start to wonder exactly how they managed to build this up the side of a volcano.
This will be the part of your holiday that you will probably remember most when you look back to your trip to Tenerife.

The scenery is utterly different from anything else (except parts of Lanzarote) although the majesty of El Teide is unique. Be prepared for a cooler feel on some days and we have been driving through snow on some trips. Global warming seems to have put an end to that!!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"I love the area around Teide for photography. What I'd not done before was astrophotography. I'm so glad I took the chance.
I visited in Jan so the core of milky way wasn't visable but i still managed to get some great shots.

I went to a car park just beyond the cable car to the summit, That id already vetted during daylight.

Even if you don't want to take photos you will see a totally different night sky to the one you see at home (unless you live in a international dark zone) . I suspect once the core rises in April the view is even more amazing. Likewise during a meteor shower I suspect you get a great view.

Remember the air is a lot thinner at 2400 metres I suspect heavy smokers or those with breathing conditions may need to slow down. You will also notice a drop in power of your car as you climb and there is less oxygen available for effective combustion.

So now the one negative that didn't bother me in the slightest but i could see affecting a lot of people.
The temperature.

I went mid Jan, the temp during the day in los gigantes was about 22, during the day on Teide it was about 17 (so approx 5 less).
However at night it's a bigger difference and temp is VERY localised. The night I went up it was 18 degrees when i left at 1930. When I got to my destination an hour later it was about 5 degrees, but I'd travelled though little areas as low as zero .

I only stayed 90 mins and on the way back the car registered temperatures between -4 and 3 degrees, being 14 when back at hotel approx 2320. So pick your spot and wrap up warm.

Unfortunately, we found out cable car not running when we reach there because windy, lucky they can refund. They will email you if cable car not running in the morning. It still worth up there even without cable car, there is modern coffee shop with good view and little shop also.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"One company runs the tours so it doesn't matter who you book with. Having gone before we knew to have coats and appropriate footwear for the top. It's cold. However the only leaflet we saw was after we came back down the cable car and this really should be shown before you book for health and safety reasons. There are health considerations with high altitude and the footpath up the top is very uneven and rough with steep inclines. Our trip gave you 35mins at the top and the route we took needed 20 each way not including stops for photos. If you didn't get the first cable car you would not have had time to enjoy the view. So would have liked a bit longer there and skip the holiday dross trinket cafe stop on the way back. You can buy that stuff anywhere and coffee at the bottom of the cable car. But it's a cracking experience. Fantastic views. And vulcanology is a fascinating subject. Loved it.

Highest point of Spain, volcanic sightseeing, various views of you take the west road from costa adeje to pico del teide instead of the southern road from playa de Las Americas.
Climbing up this road is greener and more woods, approach to teide itself and entering the Canada is nicer via this road.
If you want to go on the top of teide at 3718m you need to reserve your access on the official website. It s free but do it at least 6 to 8 weeks before you go. No permit, no climbing. You should also book your teleferico ticket online to ensure access to at least the 3500m level and walking tours. Some days all teleferico tickets are sold out.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Dec 2018: Took the cable car up and walked down. I am no mountain goat; it took 5 hours. Definitely need good walking shoes, in sections it is steep, rocky, scree and slippy. I would recommend a walking pole to help with balance. It is sometimes easy to lose the path (if you do, stop and take a look around). There was no snow or ice and in sheltered parts it was very hot (take lots of sunscreen and water and lip balm!). The part from the refuge down is steep then it really levels out. The views are incredible!!
Jan 2020 walked up, took the cable car back down. To do this you do not need to book a time for the cable car but carefully check the weather as the cable car could be closed due to wind, and then only option is walk down again.
Walking up is easier! The initial gradual incline is a good introduction. No pole needed (would hinder you on the steep bits). To go up took me 3hrs 30. In the shady sides some parts of the path were icy and snowy so good gripping shoes are essential (definitely not trainers!) and lots of sunscreen and lip balm (the wind was strong and biting in some parts). On this occasion when we got to the top it turned out that they had closed this path due to ice and the ranger at the top was not pleased with us, however there were no signs further down and plenty of people had headed up before us and were behind us.
I would rate this walk as moderate: take plenty of time and be aware of the altitude. On the way up we passed a sign saying it was another 4 hours to the top: - however from this sign it took me 2 hours 45 mins at a slow to steady pace (plenty of people were passing me).
If you can climb Snowdon then you can do this: Set off with plenty of time to get to the cable car if you are walking up and be prepared for it to be closed (so plenty of time to walk back again - as the reviews of the refuge are that you will be turned away if you have not booked beforehand even if it is late).

As we followed trail 12 west around the summit (trail 10 to the summit being closed due to recent tremors), we noticed that we were breathing harder due the reduced oxygen levels at this altitude.

We drove from Costa adeje and although there were some narrower roads and hairpins I didn’t find it difficult. The staff at the visitor centre were really helpful and provided a map showing places to park and warned that there may be a wait for parking. I had researched the cable cars before leaving home so knew parking could be problematic due to the popularity of the trip up the mountain. We therefore booked in advance and chose 12 noon for our visit, we managed to park easily about half way up the hill on the side of the road at around 11.15am and were on the cable cars within 20 minutes of arriving and earlier than our booked time. The views were spectacular and I’d recommend checking weather forecasts on the previous day as I would’ve been disappointed if we hadn’t been able to see out towards the coast and over the towns. You can change ticket times / days free of charge at anytime. The path up to the top was closed due to snow and ice but it was December when we visited so we weren’t surprised. Take warm clothes as it’s is much colder at the top and make sure you book in advance, it’s a long drive to turn up and find they haven’t got any availability. When we were leaving all car parking spaces were taken and there were queues of cars waiting so if you book for the afternoon make sure you leave plenty of time to park. The paths at the top are rocky so sturdy shoes are a must.

The teide park is amazing. Lots of trails for hiking but if you prefer to drive and visit some mirardors it will be also an amazing experience.
For those who want to climb the vulcano or do a part of the trail then you should take trail nr 7. At the visitorcenter you fund maps or simply download the trails.
Untill the "" huevas "" eggs of lava, its a path that is not to difficult. ( Do not forget warm clothing , water, food)
If you want to get to the top but do not want to walk well then the cablecar is the solution. However you need to book tickets online. Keep in mind that due to the high altitude and rapidly changing weather its possible they close it. You can get a refund or ride on any other day if thats the case.
If you want to go to the very top thats 200 meter above the station you need to book online a special permit.
This ticket must be bought months in advance !!!
Clash of the titans was filmed here. Trail nr 3 but easily reached by car also.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We were at Tenerife for one week. I booked the reservation for the peak exactly two months before visiting. That time there wasn't any place on the first time section. So if you want to go up to the peak must book it really soon!! It's free, only a registration needed.
The cable car was only operated one day during our stay, because of the weather. We were lucky because I made the registration to the peak and bought the return ticket to cable car to that day.
It was 3 celsius up there but felt more, it was only cold when the wind was blowing. (mainly at the summit directly). I only wore a sweater, scarf and autumn coat and it was perfectly fine.
The way to the summit was difficult only because of the altitude. It was noticeable that the air was rarer going up. We were much more tired and had to stop several times to rest. It was a special experience.
At the peak you can still smell the sulfur and see, smell and feel its steam.

It was one of the best experience in my life. So so happy that we had the opportunity.
If you are in Tenerife don't miss it! It's a real must see thing.

There are a lot of great trails near to the cable car lower station. We went on Los Roques de Garcia. It's a good program after Teide.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,El Teide is one of the must see visitor attractions in Tenerife. The drive up is interesting with several switchbacks and is quite challenging at times but the views and final results are well worth it. The views of the lava flows and rock structures are stunning and make you feel you are in another world. This year there is a lot of snow at the summit which seems strange when you are standing at the base of Teide in beautiful sunshine. There is plenty of parking and there are cafes nearby the base as well as entrance to the cable car which takes you near the rim of the volcano.,Dec 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"If there is one thing you can’t miss on the island is the Teide National Park. We rented a car to get there and consequently were able to see a bit more of the island. We stayed in Costa Adeje and from there it is just about an hour leisurely drive to the Teleferico cable car station. We stopped a few times at miradores (viewpoints) to admire the scenery. Upon arrival around noon there were very few spaces left to park the car, so be prepared to walk a bit up to the station and be there well in advance if you pre-booked your ride on-line, like we did. Weather was fantastic up there and we did not need all the warm clothes we took with us. Yes, it was a bit chilly on the top (nearly 4000m), so trousers and a jacket and a pair of sensible shoes is a good idea. Plus, a sun screen of course. The scenery will take your breath away. It is a vast volcanic landscape on a scale I haven’t seen before. You are expected to stay at the top of Teide about an hour, unless you are a serious rambler/climber and don’t need a ride back. Google maps advised us to take a northern route first along the motorway, TF38 and TF21, whereas we drove back south along TF21 and TF51 visiting Vilaflor and Arona, which are pleasant, quiet and scenic little towns. It was a fantastic day out, hope you will have fun, too.

You can take a tour or do as we did in a hire car - just make sure you're happy with hairpin bends and the brakes work! We had booked a cable car ride in advance but unfortunately the wind on 2 days made this not run. The online booking system is very good, notifying us well in advance so no wasted journey. The refund was also prompt so 10/10. The cafe near the cable car is woefully inefficient with one person trying to serve a constant line of visitors so take a picnic but be prepared to pay a euro for a pee!",Dec 2019

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,Worth a drive by and stop to take a few photos if you’ve never seen a volcano before. Eerie atmosphere if it’s cloudy as the cloud blows across the moonscape-like rocks. Pretty cool to see but it is what you see in the pictures so don’t go expecting much more. Didn’t visit the towns or tourist buildings up there as we had a sleeping baby with us so that might add to it?,Dec 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,1.0,"My wife and I wanted to go with the cable car to the summit of mount Teide. At the ticket window the seller had two prices for adults (27 euro and 33 euro) written by hand on a piece of paper. I opted for the 27 euro option (obviously) only to be told ""they are all sold out"" and we had to buy the 33 euro tickets. With no other choice I purchased two 33 euro tickets. At the entry to the cable car we were told we had to go to a kiosk nearby. Only then we discovered that we had been sold tickets plus rental of the audio tour. This was something we never asked for, hadn't been told about and didn't want. We were then asked to pay a further 50 euros as deposit for the audio players. I told them we didn't ask for them and didn't want them. The guy in the kiosk quickly produced a paper for us to sign saying we wouldn't ask for a refund - no sign, no travel. Having no option, I signed.
In my view this is a shabby scam designed to extract more money from tourists. The fact that we were forced to sign a ""no refund form"" tells me that this is a well practsed trick. It spoiled our excursion and we will not be returning to this attraction again.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"I visited in November on a beautiful sunny day with clear blue skies. The drive up from las Américas was beautiful such changing views of volcanic plants soils and a few trees. The road was good a bit twisty but had a good surface. The parador had toilets which they charge1 euro for which was very expensive even I had to pay in my wheelchair. I later found if you buy something it gets reimbursed but if I had bought a coffee I would have needed it again so we were so cross we had a drink elsewhere.
The parking can be difficult if you go at very busy times but there is a lot. A few years ago we went up in the cable car but we decided we did not want to queue. The experience was so good we returned 4 days later taking the route from las gigantes which is a shorter and less twisty route and the scenery is different more woody in places and shows the black lava. From there we visited Oratava village which is extremely hilly and very challenging in a wheel chair but good at providing blue badge parking

2. Go there early! - at peak time (11:00 - 13:00) it is really hard to park your car. There are not enough parking slots. I ended up driving around for 1.5 h looking for a free spot.
3. If you want to see the top of the volcano you have to apply online for a special permit at least 3 months earlier.
4. Best way to get there - rent a car. Views on your way the top will be breathtaking. National park is stunningly beautiful.

A good bus trip and spectacular sites although the guide Ilana was a bit irritating and loved her own voice a bit too much. The one thing that was not that good was the cable car as we had to queue for a long time before being crammed in then once at top we had to get back in queue to get down in time to get back to bus (not much up their).

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"I could never visit Tenerife without visiting the fabulous El Teide - after all it is the main “character “ of this unique volcanic island. Which ever route you take up the drive is spectacular, and the views phenomenal. (However, if you suffer from car-sickness or vertigo - then perhaps you may want to give it a miss.) We found we were driving up in thick fog and rain, but it all cleared up once we hit the national park, and we had blue skies and clear views - albeit it was chilly and breezy. Unfortunately the cable car wasn’t operating due to high winds, so that’s a visit for another day. Having been previously in early Summer I think I preferred the scenery then as the spring blooms added greenery and life to an otherwise rather desolate but majestic landscape. A word of warning - if you have a heavy cold then you will find your ears continually popping & crackling at the changes in altitude, and they may become quite painful.

After dinner (which was excilent) we drove one parking spot where our guide told us some facts about stars on the sky. This was hilarious happening and we all enjoyed.

Drove up through the forest and clouds to the level plain prior to assaulting the peak itself. Cafe near the summit is very nice indeed. Views are to die for, not surprisingly since it stands 12K feet high. A dormant volcano so minor eruptions prevent summit attainment on every occasion. Short walk after the Alpine type transport.
Unmissable global point of interest but take appropriate clothing for the summit as temperatures plummet rapidly with the ascent. Great memory as summits of surrounding islands break the cloud level.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"What an amazing and breathtaking place, photos do not do justice to the awesome beauty this place exudes. Everywhere you look you want to take a photo!
The drive up the mountain was really easy but we did not go in peak time (weekday in November) however, do not forget to book the chair lift ahead of your visit or you will miss out even during off peak season. There is a real shortage of parking near the summit so you can consider leaving really early and enjoying the sunrise or catching the Bus 342 from Costa Adeje (Bus Station) to Los Cristianos, Arona, La Escalona, Vilaflor, Parador de Turismo, Teide National Park and El Portillo, my advice would be to catch the bus at the first stop (Costa Adeje) so that you have a better chance of getting a window seat. There is also a Bus 348 route from Puerto de la Cruz (Bus Station), El Botanico, La Oratava (Bus Station), Aguamansa, El Portillo, Teide National Park - Las Cañadas del Teide - Parador de Turismo

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Once you’re at the top cable car station the views are incredible and well worth the trouble getting there. An experience not to be missed.

The trouble getting there: As you approach there is a car park at the bottom of the hill. If you can find a space do it and just suck it in and walk the hill. It was full on our visit so we started up the hill behind a queue of other cars all fighting for the illusive space. We were incredibly lucky as we crawled to the top of the hill missing space after space for one to become available at the perfect time. Fantastic.

Head to the ticket office. All tickets sold out for the day!!!! Why was there somebody at the bottom of the hill telling us not to waste our time!!!!

Went on the official site. No tickets available online. Grrrrrrr

Went on a third party site offering guided tours and got the last two spaces of the day at 2:30 (it was 12:30).

It was well worth the wait so here’s my top tips.

Book in advanced
Wear suitable shoes. Walking boots or something with a hard sole. The rocky paths are unforgiving.
Prepare for the worst and wrap up warm. There can be snow up there when it’s sunny at the base cable car station.
If on a tour take water and snacks.
Enjoy.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,3.0,"Firstly if you’re going to Tenerife visit Teide and take the walk to view Pico Viejo (trail 12 from top cable car station)
The views are phenomenal and it’s definitely worth the visit to walk around an active volcano smelling the fumes.
But.....
Considering (as we were told) of the 6million tourists the island receives a year 4million of them venture up Teide the way the set up is run is shockingly bad!!

We ventured up on Sunday. Arriving around 11.30am, after a 1.5hr drive and 20mins trying to park (parking is carnage, get there early) we walked up the hill to find the ticket office out of tickets for the day. We tried to ask the lady if that was the guided tickets also or only standard tickets. She spoke next to no English and just kept shouting go information at me. So we went across to the information section and queued for another 20mins to get to front and be told rudely and abruptly by another member of staff we dont sell ticket here you have to go inside and as it says we are sold out. I tried to explain I’d done that and was sent to him for guided tour tickets and all he kept doing was shouting sold out sold out. To which there was a lot of groans behind us in the queue so I’m guessing they’d been sent here too!
So we cut our losses for a wasted day and headed back to hotel. When back we booked and paid online for tickets for guided tour to Pico Viejo for Tuesday.

Tuesday morning we woke early to check online if the cable car was running and the website said closed so I called to double check and was told it was open. So always double check don’t trust their site.

Arriving back up there Tuesday we queued for 15min in the queue listed as online tickets (logically we thought) to get to front and be told by the same grumpy man from previously that we had to go over the other side near the toilets and wait by the tour sign for our guide.
She arrived on time and was extremely polite, friendly and English was good.
She waited till everyone arrived to then go get our tickets ( you’d think she’d have these ready!) then she lead us to the cable cars where we joined in the queue and waited for about 30mins for our turn ( we booked the 11.30 tour expecting that was when we’d go on the cable car we didn’t get on it until 12.10)
When at the top the tour was good, very informative and spoken lengthy in English and Spanish.
Views are incredible and totally worth the hassle to get up here.
Our conclusion is:

****We are not pig ignorant English expecting everyone to speak our language however considering 4million visitors come up a year from all over the world, as the most widely spoke language you’d expect the staff here to speak better English than they do. We met a Lithuanian couple who’s was having as much difficulty trying to communicate with the staff as we were their English was fine but like us Spanish was little.

**** BOOK IN ADVANCE

**** always double check the cable car is open before venturing up

**** The tour is good. Our guide was so friendly and polite but considering the cost in future we’d have just booked the standard cable car tickets and read up on google. The info isn’t something you couldn’t find yourself.

**** be prepared for lack of organisation

**** get there early to be able to park

**** staff in the shops are very polite and friendly

**** canteen area service fast and food was delicious

Worth a visit but be prepared apart from the Amazing views and atmosphere up the very top (yes it’s cold wrap up) and the shop/canteen staff it’s all a bit chaotic and lacking organisation and structure you may leave as we did a little disappointed from this.

The path is waymarked however we choose to go up the mound of sand in front, it looked liked the path back down rejoined the foot path, it doesn't do we spent an hour getting lost because of make pride refusing to retrace steps! We got to the Roques and had a look around the main ones, then had time for a coffee and cake in the restaurant ( yes you pay for the toilet but no other option, money off your drinks) expensive but only time we will probably say had coffee in a volcanic crator. There is a small gift shop, a small museum (closed when we were there). We caught the bus back from the Roques end so no walking back.

The tour is well worth the money while you are touring we stop at a little shop that sold bakery things to eat as well as gifts. We got back on the coach and drove some more and then we so the sun set and had champagne while watching it. The guide asked me me to put my glass up and looked through it and that's when I saw beautiful sunset through the glass and had to take the picture. There were places on the mountain where are some of the other people went up to look at volcanoes but I do not go I stayed firmly on the ground while my husband is brother and wife went up. After all of this we were taken to gorgeous restaurant where we had a three course meal provided for us all inclusive in the excursion and meal was delicious. When we had all finished our meal accompanied with either red or white wine we got back on the coach and went right to the top of Mount Teide to do stargazing. Although it was very cold up there are it was still very informative and entertaining as the guide Marco and Nico absolutely amazing I really knew this stuff and made it very entertaining that you really want to learn more.

I would encourage anyone to take a trip to Tenerife and do this tour.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,Went on all day coach trip (8am-5pm) from los America’s ... great from start to finish ... to see the total transformation from tropical sunshine and arris landscape to green pine covered mountains and volcanos was just spectacular... plenty of stops to take amazing photos. DO NOT MISS! Only advice I would give is if directed to a recommended restaurant for lunch don’t go there quality and price of food not worth it ... take some pack up or find a cafe. Otherwise an absolutely brilliant day out!,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,Stunning scenery of the volcano highly recommended place to visit especially in nice weather. Climatic lunar landscape when coming from the west.,Oct 2019

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Loved this little adventure! Took about a hr from where we were staying by car and then only 8 minutes on the cable cart and the view is amazing.

Defiantly book before you go, on the official main website as saw people turned away as it was fully booked. Take a jacket as can get cold at the top. Lots of free parking available.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"This is absolutely must see! Cable car up to Teide is really a fun and you reach 3550m level. You need special permission if you want toclimb to the top of the Teide, but it's free of charge. You need to apply this special permission two to three months is advance. Be prepared that cable car is sometimes closed due to weather conditions for example due to heavy wind. If you reserve cable car tickets in advance from original website it's quite easy to change tickets for another day. If you give your contact information during reservation you will receive notify by e-mail if cable car is closed due to weather conditions. On morning reserve warm clothes, because temperature can be nearby zero Celsius degree, but on afternoon temperature is much higher, maybe 15 to 20 Celsius degree if sun is shining. Reserve also hat, sunglasses and proper shoes, because paths are rocky. View from Teide is really amazing!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We rented a car from Guia de Isora to Mt Teide and getting there was just as fun as exploring the volcano. The road is beautiful and peaceful and full of volcanic rocks. We did not go all the way up Mt Teide because there were no more tickets for the day, so make sure to reserve or purchase online before going there. We did some trekking on the lower parts of the volcano and our boys, aged 7 yo, loved playing in the area and learning fun facts about the volcano and rock formations. Thumbs up!",Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We took the cable car to going up and then we came by foot down where we spent 5 hours to do so. The cable car is 13.5€ each way. Is better to book online or you can buy tickets until 12 from the site. There is a nice cafe with acceptable prices like 3€ a coffee and a sandwich for 4-5€. The time that is on the ticket is not the actual time when you will gonna leave. I saw that young spanish people were left to go immediately with the next cable car instead of waiting in the queue 2-3 hours which is not fair I find it racist. The other tourists had a later cable car than it should just because the spanish were left to go ahead. We had 40 minutes delays.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,The road to the mountain is fascinating and full of amazing views. Recommend buying tickets to the cable car in advance and those who want to take the tour to the top as well. The view from the mountain is spectacular and breathtaking ... above poor.,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Rode a motorbike woith my boyfriend from costa adeje and over towards puerto de la cruz. Loved seeing the clouds below us,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"I went on an official tour that picked me up at Catalonia Punta Del Rey hotel and dropped me off there on the way back from the Volcano tour. Was nice to pass through the woods and then get to the top of Teide. I know someone who got engaged on the pricey sunset tour of Teide- sounds very romantic to me! The cable car is so crammed that I was lucky to see from the window! Luckily the cable car ride was quick and the views from the top (on a clear day) are sensational. The guide says it rarely gets cloudy or super bad with the weather which I found surprising as it is so high up! It takes your breath away (in more ways than one- due to the altitude- so be wary!). There are two trails that don't require pre-authorization and pre-planning and pre-paying for. Unfortunately- the rest of the tour group were extremely late coming down from the mountain and so I was very annoyed that I didn't get all the extra time they had as I was on time. I could have done the extra walk to another viewpoint with that time rather than wait longer at the car park. The landscape though is very unique and interesting and is used to represent space and I can see why. The restaurant (with gift shop) has a wonderful floor to ceiling window but the price of food and drink was expensive there! We were going to visit the observatory but as the tour was running late then we couldn't!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,We took the cable car almost to the top of the volcano. Beautiful experience and definitely a must-see if you are in Tenerife. You can book tickets in advance. We rented a car and the road going there from the resorts in the south is good.,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Amazing views, would definitely visit if your in Tenerife! Beautiful. Cable car was shut due to winds but still enjoyed our trip.",Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"I know that easy way is organise a permit, go up by cable car and walk 30 minutes up to see the top or spend some additional money for tour with local company. Some people chose altavista night and hiking up but i suggest even better way, most adventurous. Just do an overnight hike up from Montana Blanca parking. We left from parking shortly after 0:30 as all guides indicated that it takes up to 5,5 - 6 hours to get to the top but with decent pace you can do all of it in 4 - 4,5 depending on your fitness level. Just get some light source, warm clothes and you won't be dissapointed - it is totally doable, but temperature and wind conditions can be harsh up on the top. Sunrise was spectacular, no permit required for volcano and no booking for altavista so that is the perfect solution for people coming to Tenerife with last minute offers and with no figured-out plans. We got down with cable car even that it was not taking any people up (closed due wind conditions)

Spain,Volcan El Teide,1.0,We arrived on time for our booking at 9 am to go up in cable car and walk to the top. Waited for an hour as the cable car wasn't running due to windy weather at the top. Staff told us we could come back later if it opened. Came back at 2pm and were told we couldn't go up as we missed the tour at 9. Staff blamed each other and not very helpful so we nearly left extremely disappointed and upset before realising we could use the cable car tickets at least. An apology would have gone a long way.,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Nice trip and saw a nice sunset and very nice nature and rock formations. Also the history is nice to hear,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Took an organised tour with a local tour company while on our holiday in Tenerife to take us up to the volcano and a trip on the cable car taking you higher. £27 and 30minutes once up there to return back down. The place is beautiful and very busy, on checking the time 25 minutes in we went to get the cable car back down only to queue for 20 minutes then to find our coach had left without us.
When visiting mount Teide do your homework before going. DO NOT use the local tour companies. A local bus can take you there but the last one leaves at 4pm. You can book your tickets on line and I advise on doing has you may find once there they have sold out but check if your money will be refunded or tickets can be used on another day if the weather means the cable car doesn’t run. You will need at least a couple of hours once up there to explore and take in the beauty of the place. You can walk to the summit but be aware the air does get a little thin.
Although we got left behind the staff were absolutely wonderful in helping us arrange transport back to our hotel. Yes it cost us but we had a wonderful day and the views are breath taking

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Stunning sights and location, even the trip here has some amazing terrain and gorgeous winding roads. Hire a car, if you take the bus tour it doesn't stop off enough to make the most of the surroundings. Get there early or book online otherwise queues for tickets can take hours! Make sure you stop off at some of the parking places on the way, some of the canyons and roads are beautifully contrasted.",Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"This is the reason we chose Tenerife, we wanted to do the mount Teidi tour and it did not disappoint. It is like nowhere else I have been to. Loved looking at the rocks and views. When we go again we will definitely do this trip again. Highly recommended.",Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Thanks to reviews read on here, we have just had a lovely day out at Mount Teide! We were driving so took advice from previous visitors and booked the cable car the night before and got there early. We arrived at 9.50am for a 10.10am cable car which was perfect - quite a lot of car parking left and time to go to the loo! We walked straight to the online ticket desk, showed the code which had been emailed to us the night before. One thing to note is that someone takes a photo of you against a scenic background just before you enter the cable car. We were not prepared so ours wasn’t great but when we came back down, some of them were lovely, especially the bigger family groups. For 5 EUR, that would make a nice souvenir.
At the top, we found we didn’t need our jackets but some people were in shorts and t-shirts and others dressed almost for the Arctic so it partly depends on your personal body temperature! Always best to be prepared though. We only managed one of the walks at the top in the time allowed and the terrain is very rough. We managed with trainers but walking boots or shoes would be better if you have them. I was quite surprised that my husband felt a bit dizzy and light-headed due to the altitude but I was fine so you just need to be careful.
The views when you come back down at the bottom are great, especially the view from the cafe. The prices are inflated due to the captive audience but a drink and a snack wouldn’t be too bad to enjoy the scenery. We left at about 11.45am and there were no parking spots nearby by then although I am sure you would get one if you are patient as people will be leaving as well as arriving. I think the cable car is pretty expensive and you don’t HAVE to go up in to have an enjoyable day but you do get amazing views from up there.
We came back down via the Visitor Centre (on the road to Oratava) which was definitely worth a look. While we were there, the sunshine disappeared and the clouds rolled in, to the point where it was quite a dangerous drive back down with very poor visibility. Just goes to show how quickly the weather can change. Overall, an interesting and enjoyable day.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Visited as part of our Canaries Cruise and not disappointed.

Although they squeeze 35 people into the cable car to take you the last 1000 metres, it is well worth it as the views are spectacular and photos do not give it justice.

Beware as the lack of oxygen really does effect you at 3550 metres above sea level.

A must do visit when on Tenerife

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"It's important to start in the early morning and to access the National Park from the West side (Chio). Follow the TF-38 and later the TF-21 to Orotava. On this way you find a lot of interesting spots. Walk a little bit inside. At the Parador, you can stop in the hotel for lunch. Really impressive is the walk (1 hour) to the Roques de Garciá. (cap and cream a must). Reservation in advance requested for the cable railway to the top. One day time requested.",Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,You can't come to here. It's really a must see!! The place has done a great job of authenticating the building.,Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,We took the picturesque drive up to El Teide but were hugely disappointed to find when we got there that the cable car to the top was fully booked for that day! We saw nothing on the website to warn us about this so sadly never made it to the top.....,Sep 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"This is one of the best trips to do. Our guide Tania was likened to a very enthusiastic primary school teacher(this is a compliment). She spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable about Tenerife and the star constellations. Your experience will obviously be heightened if the sky is clear, which it was on our trip. As the sun sets the landscape of the volcano is spectacular and changes as the light dims. We then had a meal which considering the restaurant was serving a number of coach trips was good, although my wife did not like the sweet sauce on the meat. If you are a wine lover there is plenty to drink, this on top of the generous amount of Cava that was given out earlier on the trip. After the meal standing under the stars is magical, Tania points out the various constellations with accompanying information and legends. If you haven't been to a dark skies environment, you will find it a totally different experience and although you do need warm clothing, blankets are provided if they are needed, it is warmer than going to the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland. It is a long trip but the time passes very quickly. One more point of information is that the drive up to the volcano has wonderful views, sit on the right side of the bus if you have a head for heights and on the left side if you don't, of course coming down its the opposite but does not matter as much as it is dark. One final mention is for our driver Renaldo who drove so well you never felt uncomfortable at any time.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,The views are stunning . The volcano was so amazing. natural creations with lava rocks and green stones. Definitely would say it’s a must to see. Cable cars I would say it’s not really necessary to pay and go up.,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"I would say it takes atleast 30 to 45 mins to get to the car park from the main roads. And the roads are quite winding and a little tricky, so be careful on your way up.

The cable car is quite nice to go up in so worth booking if you have the time. Once up to the viewing area (you can't go to the peak without a special ticket) there's a nice trail to walk around and get to explore the views and have some pics taken etc. It can get a little chilly near the top so take an extra layer.",Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,It's amazing to see how our world is functioning and i thing that the Teide national park has it all. Very interesting trip.,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We had hoped to climb to the summit of El Teide. My guidebook implied you could get a free permit on the day. So I looked about two weeks before to find the next availabile permits were late November. Drat. It needs planning in advance, including booking the cable car for the correct time to coincide with your permit time (if you get one). Permits are given in two hour time slots. So we had to just do the walks from the crater. Access to the summit is through a gate manned by park staff who check for permits, names and ID.
We booked the cable car a week ahead to get a morning slot. We arrived at the car park at 9.30am and there was plenty of parking. By 10am it was nearly full at the weekend. You are allowed only one hour at the top cable car station, but this was not monitored and most people went a bit over. If you have paid 27 euros to get up there you want a bit more than an hour. We comfortably visited both viewpoints from the upper station in the hour, it it was a bit crowded (hence the time limit). Although clear on Teide the views were not great as there was a cloudy haze over the sea. Very warm up there in early October, we took fleeces but didn’t need them.
There are 40 hiking trails in the national park of various lengths. Pick up a trail map from the info centre near the Parador. Note, in October and on some dates in Spring, the park authorities shoot Mouflon. Check the website. Many of the trails were closed three days a week because of the shooting. We were there on a Sunday and there was organised rabbit hunting with dogs going on. This is to control the rabbit population. We never saw a mouflon or a rabbit so they must be efficient. Lots of lizards though. They are extremely interested in your lunch. We sat down, got out the sandwich box and were surrounded by 20 lizards within a couple of minutes. They are harmless but quite big! They also fight and squeal over food. Interesting to watch.
On Sunday there were lots of motorbikes along the roads in the national park, but on weekdays they were absent and it was fairly quiet and peaceful.

Amazing lunar l as landscape where many movies have been shot.
A must in the visit is to take the cable car.
It takes you as close to the summit as you can go without a special permit to climb to the peak.
But that's definitely for professionals not sightseers in my opinion.
A fantastic trip well worth the day out.",Jan 2019

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,We rented a car. The main road up there is extremely safe but it is a little bit of a climb. The volcano peak is itself in a huge older crater that has amazing mars like scenery. Beautiful to drive through. There is barely any facilities up there and the ones where you can stop are packed. The facilities by the volcano téléphérique is near impossible to park at so plan ahead for bathroom break and bring snacks and water. There is a few places to stop and take pictures.,Oct 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to El Tiede. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a permit to ascend the summit as all of the open slots were filled months in advance. Accordingly, we hiked the many trails 150 meters below the summit for several hours. The views were spectacular and (though we live at sea level) altitude was not a problem. I suggest wearing appropriate gear/footwear, as the terrain is a bit rugged, and either applying for the permit two months out or paying extra for a guided tour.",Sep 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"What an experience! Views are stunning, and it's like being on a different planet, hard to explain! The smell of sulphur is quite strong in places.
It was rather chilly, and very windy, so an extra layer is advisable. As are trainers, or walking boots, as very uneven footpaths. A good thing as it's been left natural, but clear footpath made.
Be prepared to queue, and wait around, unless you pre book. A good idea to arrive there in the morning to buy cable car tickets as they sell out. This is the only reason I didn't give five stars.
The drive up the mountain is an experience in itself!! Steep at times, and lots of twists and turns in the road. Take advantage of the view points on the way up, not only for a break, but for the stunning views.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Top tips
-Book tickets in advance for cable car
- Arrive early if travelling by car
- Explore the 2 walks at the top
- Take a jacket
Finally. .. either on the way there or on your return go to the visitor centre for the national park which is situated on the road leading to Orotava. Here you will find peaceful gardens of specimen plants to explore and in the centre an extremely informative display explaining the geography of the island and then view the extremely fun and informative film on how Tenerife was formed.
This is a hidden gem in the park I think most people drive past it on the way to the cable cars.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Have driven to visit El Teide several times when visiting Tenerife.

Nice drive up trough Vilaflor, returning via Chío towards Los Gigantes. Takes about 3 1/2 hours if stopping at a restaurant for a meal too.

Sunday seems to be the best day to make the trip. Very few tourist coaches.

Stop off just after Vilaflor to see Píno Gordo. Good sized lay-by to stop and admire the scenery. Also a curious man dressed in animal skins with 2 goats (charges €1 for a photo) - he’s been there for years and we always look out for him when we make the drive.

Plenty of tour companies offering 1/2 day trips but if you hire a car it’s a much more pleasurable experience.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,3.0,"We headed up Mt Teide from Puerto de Santiago. Some of the roads early on were a bit hairy - giving that feeling that the bottom of your stomach has dropped through the floor.
After that the road surface is fairly new, in great condition and wide. A really enjoyable drive over varied landscape, rocky, volcanic etc.
When we approached the top / cable car station the parking situation looked daunting but there always seemed to be people coming and going and spaces available.
Arriving at the cable car station there was a notice - no tickets available for today. Major disappointment ! Having done a lot of skiing this is all a bit incomprehensible.
Anyway we had a drink then drove back to the sunshine making it back to ‘all-inclusive heaven’ for lunchtime.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,1.0,Don’t try turning up if you don’t have a ticket. They don’t even tell you that all tickets are sold at the bottom of the hill. They want you to walk to the top to buy a coffee. Not impressed,Sep 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,I drove down to Mount Teide from Santa Cruz on TF-24. Absolutely amazing views for a long way till you reach Teide. It was hard not to stop every mile to take another photo. Magnificent scenery. The road was in good condition and the driving was easy. The weather was clear and the views wonderful. Highly recommend visiting Teide.,Jul 2019

Spain,Volcan El Teide,2.0,"Took this trip in September 2019. I booked through my holiday representative (Jet2 Holidays)at my hotel for the half day excursion and added on the cable car ticket. We were collected at 7.40am and spent 2.5 hours travelling to the Mount Teide National Park via every hotel in Tenerife ( or maybe it just felt like it) to collect fellow travellers. We spent 2 hours at the National Park and then another 3 hours getting back to our hotel stopping at unnecessary places. This is not a half day trip it is a 7.5 hour trip ( a full day).

When we booked we were not given any warning that this trip might make you feel unwell. I started to feel unwell even before I got out of the bus. Dizzy, nauseous and light headed with wobbly legs. By the time I got the the top of the cable car I couldn’t breathe ( I am asthmatic) and fell down some stairs. Not one person had warned me that you can get altitude sickness over 2400m. (mount Teide summit is almost 3900m). Not the rep who sold me the tickets, not the tour operator on the bus and not any of the staff at the National Park or the cable car station. No signs telling me I might experience this and not to travel to top if you are asthmatic or have breathing difficulties. I had no idea what was wrong with me and there is no way I would have done this trip if I had known that there was a chance I would feel like this. It is essential that Information is given to all parties interested in doing this excursion!

I had to wear a long sleeved shirt.",Sep 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"First things first: I love the Teide (it would deserve 6 stars but more on that later) and have many times since I was a child. It’s my favourite mountain/volcano and the scenery is stunning. I’d recommend getting there first thing in the morning or in the evening to avoid the crowds. During the day, the viewpoints are particularly crowded, which spoils the experience. However, if you do some walking/hiking, you won’t be bothered by the crowds. Most of the people don’t go further than the viewpoints. The queue for the cable car is the worst. You could see hundreds of cars parked at the side of the road at noon. Better to be there early and book tickets on the net.
Now the reason I only give the Teide 4 stars is because it’s overcrowded, which causes damage to the nature and animals. I know that they have been thinking of restricting visitor numbers and they should really do this to preserve this gem.

But overall very good day and beautiful views",Sep 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"This was a great trip. We were on a small bus with the roof off. The roads that the bus driver had to drive down were mental, only wide enough for one vehicle but there were buses and cars everywhere, we had a fantastic driver. It's very high and when you look out at times all you can see is hugs drops. I couldn't look at times, it was quite scary. The views up there are stunning, we didn't go up the cable carts as we are bad with heights and I'm glad we didn't as it was quite windy and they were moving quite a bit, even the people that came off said it wasnt great as it was swaying. There Is a toilet there and a small restroom and shop which was nice, food ok.
On the trip we booked it included wine tasting with tapas which just topped the day off.
The host was lovely, we tried 6 different wines and had a chance to buy which we did. The spread that was laid on was beautifully, we all felt a bit tipsy in the heat too. Would definitely recommend this.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We reserved tickets for the guided tour on line and when arriving we received a text that the cable car was closed due to rain at the top of the mountain, a bit late but ok. Our tour could be moved to another date which we agreed with.
When you arrive at the top of the cable car there are three paths, for one, the one that goes to the crater, you need to book a permission, maybe 2-3 months in advance, we thought that the tour would take us there, but it didn't, it just went onto one of the two other paths. The guide spoke mainly in Spanish and only very short versions in English so it was mostly standing there and waiting. To save a lot of money I would recommend only to book the cable car and explore on your own

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Situated approximately in the centre of the island and about an hour from the north (by motorcycle or car) or a bit longer by coach, Mount Teide is a currently dormant volcano and forms a symbolic landmark for the island of Tenerife. See it featured on fridge magnets, postcards, pencil cases, towels and almost everything else in the local souvenir shops!

Though you can see it from the coast, it takes a while to get there, what with the bendy country roads (if travelling from the north). Routes to the south and west a bit more direct. It's easy to appreciate why it's sometimes used for lunar landscape effects on films (and – apparently – occasional NASA training?).

As you'd expect, there's a cafe-cum-buffet restaurant with a viewing window near the base of the cable car (teleferico), at an altitude of around 2,500 metres (approx 8,000 ft.). If you decide to go up in one of the cable cars, they told us you'd reach 3,700 metres (over 11,000').

However, cable cars do not run when it's windy, which is quite often. If this happens, given that you've booked your time slot and paid, they refund your ticket payment — directly if you book via the website, or indirectly if you booked via a travel agent in which case you have to go and ask. Of course, they then try to sell you an alternative day and time(—if you want to go back all that way!).

Other alternatives are the sunset trip and the astronomy evening trips, after nightfall.

The drive up is amazing with views that are breathtaking, there are lots of photo spots to stop and take in the scenery.

Both our kids aged 17 and 6 loved the scenery, looking down on the clouds, and the 6 year old took a bit of volcanic rock for school show and tell.

Was initially a Daddy day trip, but everyone loved it, my partner not so much on the way up with very narrow roads a a sheer drop with no barriers...

Came back through the National Park which is also very special.

We went to Villaflor first, to drink a barraquito. After that we went to the national park and stopped at a lot of places to walk around and get some pictures. The national park offers some truly amazing landscapes.
To end our tour we went to the small mountain-village Masca. The road to get there was beautifull, but the village itself felt really dissappointing. There is nothing to see there (just a tree and a small closed church), just some tourist trap... I would have rather spent more time in the national park.
Àll in all a great trip and the kids (8-11) loved it too.

Unfortunately the cable car wasn't running due to wind but we stopped in the cafe for a drink and a sandwich (average price for this type of place.) The little shop there is lovely too, plenty of reasonably priced souvenirs.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Booked a half day trip with Jet 2 holidays through the rep who visited our resort. Our hotel was the middle pick up point so we got picked up at 8.20am which allowed us enough time to grab a quick breakfast.

Once everyone was picked up the Tour Guide told us lots of interesting facts and information and explained the various views we drove past.

The cafe we stopped at half way was really nice and had lovely views, we had a quick drink and an ice cream, or you could just use the toilet and admire the view.

We had also pre-booked the cable car as had about 3/4 of the people on the coach trip as well and the tour guide had reserved us a time slot, an advantage of being part of an organised trip although there was still some queueing time involved and some managed to get the cable car before us but they also got an earlier one back down so think everyone had the same length of time up there. There’s 2 cable cars and they each take about 8 minutes to get up/down.

There are toilets at the base and top cable car stations and these are kept clean.

We thought it was well worth going on the cable car and really enjoyed our time up there, would have preferred slightly longer but it was still enough time to have a decent walk about and take a few photos but not quite enough time to walk all the way round (walked some of the way then turned back to ensure we had enough time to queue and get back down to meet at the coach for the required time). Didn’t quite have time to look in the gift shop after exiting the cable car at the bottom but viewing the sights was more important to us, and if needed you could go back down slightly sooner to allow time for a quick look.

We wore shorts and t shirts and popped fleece jackets in our back packs, we didn’t need to put these on, it is cooler up there but there was still heat from the sun it being a hot day in August, I decided to put a long shirt on over my t shirt instead as sun protection just as much as anything else.

After the cable car we were driven to get out and look at some very interesting rock formations. We then drove back to the resorts and everyone was dropped off accordingly first picked up was first dropped off so everyone experienced the same length of time on the coach. We got back to
our resort about 2.40pm which was ideal as we managed to catch the end of lunch which finished at 3pm. We then had time to enjoy the rest of the day around the pool and cool off which was nice and one of the reason we decided to pick the half day trip rather than the full day and think a full day trip could feel more tiring but it depends what you want out of it.

Tip remember to take a bottle of water or 2 each with you to keep hydrated, you can buy bottles of water from the cafe you stop at on the way there if necessary.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"After hiring a cheap Seat Ibiza for the day (and it Iived up to its price) we took a “scenic” drive from Costa Adeje to Mt Teide.

The drive itself was worth the hire cost. I’ve never driven such windy, scary but beautiful roads before. The climb seems never ending and our car was screaming with the struggle but heavens above, what a drive. From the hustle & bustle of the coast to little mountain villages; from barren rock to lush green trees, all the time rising and rising up the volcano.

After an hour’s drive we arrived at the Mt Teide Cable Car Centre. Now to be fair, our group didn’t have any intention of going to the top, although now we wished we had.

There is a lovely cafe & a souvenir shop and lovely views (air conditioned) of the landscape.

The landscape at the foot of the Volcano by the cable car centre is stunning. At this point you’re already at 8000ft with the cable car taking you up a further 3000ft to just below the crater. If you’re a little overweight & unfit you may start to feel the “thinner” air but it’s a small price to pay.

We got there at 1pm on an absolutely stunningly clear (& warm) day. The direct sunlight takes its toll very quick so keep yourself hydrated & covered in sun cream!

You pass “The Rocks” on the way, barely half a mile from the cable car, & the views there of old lava flows etc are jaw-dropping.

If we’d planned it better, a late afternoon drive to see a dark sky would’ve been better but even without going to the summit, it has been the best part of our holiday on Tenerife.

If you can hire a car...do it. The drive itself is amazing & it’s cheaper for a family of 5 than paying for a bus excursion! Can’t recommend it highly enough.

Not sure what stopping at the village of Masca was about (apart from having to purchase something each from the cafe to use the toilet) if there was anything else in the village not enough time to see it.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We visited the vulcano begin August. We took a tour, which can easily be booked at your hotel or at any tourist information center nearby. Of course you can expect beautiful views and impressive sights. But there is one thing you need to know. If you are afraid of heights and/or depths; think twice. The tour operators usually choose the tight way up the vulcano and the broader ways down the vulcano. That means the first part will take you higher and higher (steeper and steeper) upto 2200 meters high. So choose your spot in the bus wisely. But when you get to the top (the real top is 3700m but can not be reached by bus but by using cable cars) the views are amazing. A must do if you like nice sights and wide views.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"If you e come to the island then a trip up the mountains to see the volcanic landscape is a must do. You’ll not see anything like it elsewhere in Europe for sure. You can get the impression that you are on the moon or mars given the amazing clusters of lava rock formations.
Overall it’s as Barron at it comes, arid desert with odd plant life and plenty of geckos but with a strange fascination to it.
The Teide volcano itself is a foreboding sight, looking menacing and the knowledge that it is active.y live (although been silent quite some time now) tends to not to stray too far from the imagination.
You can get to the base of it by road, possibly 800 metres back. Or you can get a cable car to the top but I did t do that so can’t comment. That is the closest you can get to it regularly speaking. You need a permit to climb to the creator I’m told which there is a three month waiting list allegedly.
There are many tours that go there and various option of mode of transport. Personally I prefer to hire a car for the freedom.
Just a word of caution; some of the roads going up/down aren’t for the faint hearted. Much of it has barrier but there are a few sheer drops that may put your stomach in your mouth! The driving above the cloud cover and looking down at the clouds clinging to the mountain is amazing. On a clear day you can see some of the other islands in the canaries in the distance.
I’ve seen questions about altitude, yes it’s high but no problem for kids or seniors in normal heath at least I would presume. So you can forget the oxygen masks.
There are a number of little cafes dotted about the roads but as you might expect quite overpriced for what you get. If you can take a packed lunch.
Allow yourself at least half a day minimum to go up drive about and get back down.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Today were at an excursion, impressions weight! Landscapes super, I didn't think that such happen in real life! I consider that at stay on the island, he should be visited, impressions for the rest of life! At visit, I recommend to take footwear with the rubber, not sliding sole! Big height differences from 2000 to 5000 therefore to people with poor health, it is better to consult with the doctor!",Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"In this review I wont write how beautiful it is, a must see and similar things, as thousands before me did that. I'll focus on useful tips and my experience to help you plan your visit:
- Teide is the highest peak (3718 m) and the most visited national park in Spain, both island and continental Spain. Having that in mind you can presume it's very popular and tickets go fast,
- book your tickets ONLINE - you'll avoid queues and more important - disappointment if there're no more left if you just appear on the ticket booth (I saw many people like that during our visit). When booking online you must choose a time slot - many say morning is better, but we were there afternoon and it was totally clear and fantastic. Have in mind weather up there is changing very fast,
- if they cancel your visit due to weather conditions (that happened to us) you'll be notified on the morning of your journey with options to reschedule or cancel. ACT FAST as all others cancelled will reschedule with already almost full following days,
- due to the above mentioned DO NOT book it for the last holiday day - you wont have a second chance, rather somewhere in the middle,
- have in mind your ticket allows you ONLY to the upper cable car station (3555 m). From there there're two hiking paths you can hike, free and included. If you want to climb the top by the crater (3718) you MUST obtain a special permit. This is done on their same website, BUT you must do it WELL in advance, 2 months at least. The permit is free and only 200-300 are issued for each day. We booked our tickets around month and a half beforehand, but weren't lucky to get that permit, although I tried 3 times a week during those 45 days,
- most convenient to arrive to Teide is with your rented car (very cheap on Tenerife). From any point on the island it's around an hour drive. Parking is a BIG problem - if you see a spot down there on the road park there, do NOT climb the car up towards the cable car station, as you'll get stuck as many try to park there as close as possible - better walk this 200-300 m. CALCULATE some time for finding parking to reach your time slot on time.
- dress appropriately, NO flip flops (they're not forbidden, but you'll hurt yourself up there), have water, sun screen and sun glasses. No matter how warm it is down (during our visit it was 34'C in Las Americas) have AT LEAST a sweater with you or a light jacket.
- enjoy the nature at its best up there with terrific views and do at least one of the trails. Calculate 3-5 hrs for this memorable visit.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"It is expensive, but the views are fantastic if you get a clear day. Don't bother with the audioguide; it's only worth it if you want to use some of the paths to get back down.",Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"The Teide tour and scenery is amazing, I booked this with the Jet2 rep at the hotel but didn't book the Cable car. The coach can be hard going if you get travel sickness but makes up for it with the stops at the little cafes on the way up and down. When we arrived we just had to book the cable car, the views and scenery where breath taking and it felt like and looked like we where on Mars or the Moon. Amazing place.",Jul 2019

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"It was a lot of fun going up in a cable car, but it was very tight as there were a lot of people to fit in the cable car. It was very bumpy on the way up!

When you get up it you have to choose a route and then do a long walk. It was a lot of fun! If you’re lucky you might see the crater smoking.

Best views for photos.
You must visit this place , would recommend to hire the car if you up for it , need a entire day to explore the mountains .",Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We just could get up to 2000 mts, because young children (under 4 I believe) are not allowed to get the cablecar. Still worth getting a car and explore.",Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,We visited Siam water park on our stay in Tenerife the slides were great would definitely recommend the fast track pass as the queues were very long and stood for so long in the heat is not good.The food and drink are an absolute rip off prices but most places like this are snd they don’t like you taking in own picnic(so I read on another review) so we just bought food and drink at the water park.The beach area was nice to sit and have a rest and there’s plenty of seating areas dotted around the park .If you’ve got teenagers like us go it’s a great fun day out.,Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We drove up in hired car. Use cable car cafe, souvenir toilet etc rather than hotel. Would have paid more and gone to the top if allowed to but too complicated. Spectacular views",Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We approached El Teide from Chio (near Los Gigantes) and the drive up was absolutely spectacular. We did not take the cable car to the top but we didn't feel like we missed out at all. There is a viewpoint where many tourist buses seem to stop just before the cable car station, from which point you can see the peak. Does not disappoint! There are also many lay-bys to stop in on the drive up. The drive itself takes you up via wide roads that aren't too windy - no dangerous turns etc like you would expect going to high.

Overall well worth the trip up. Took us just over an hour from Adeje to get to the wonderful viewpoint, including a couple of quick stops en route for photos.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Very enjoyable afternoon. Went on the cable cars (which did actually feel rather overcrowded). Had ice cream and drinks on our return to the base station-delicious ice creams!!,Aug 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Even the drive up here was stunning, as you head above the clouds you start to get an idea of just how vast this landscape is, it definitely helps put our own existence into proportion!

I could see two other islands from the road, and although cloudy down below it was hot and sunny around us. Loads of opportunities for pics, but watch out for Wombles who spam their brakes on in front of you with no warning, just to take a pic.

I followed other’s advice, dressed warm, comfortable hiking shoes, got my permit...(free from the teide website and allows you to climb all the way to the crater- get in plenty of time before your holiday though!!!) we were ready to go or so I thought. Disappointingly, I wasn’t able to climb to the crater using my permit as the cable was closed due to high winds, we were advised against climbing that day. Shame, but the lady at the visitor centre said I could go back and use my permit the following day if I wanted to. We chose not to, as our itinerary for the next few days was extremely busy. We did however give some of the lower trails a go (there are quite a few) and had a very enjoyable 6k hike in the sunshine. Where we were it was boiling, so no need for jumpers at all!!! My advice to those planning a trip would be to check the Teide website before heading out, just to make sure the cables running. Also, It may be obvious to some but to go by car just programme your satnav for the cable lift station, and there is a car park there. We arrived at 9.45am ish and there were still spaces, although this may have been because others knew that the cable was closed and so had decided not to make the journey.
I will definitely be returning to this amazing place next time we visit Tenerife, and will be hoping to make my hike to the top this time!!!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Very interesting place. Good roads leading to the volcano. it's worth getting on top of the mountain with car cabin. Unforgettable views. It is wonderful to come to the volcanic rocks so close.,Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We went to Mt Teide on our second day of a family holiday. There was my wife our 5 year old and myself.
The drive up to Mt Teide is absolutely stunning. The winding roads up through the mountains is an adventure in itself and there are some really great spots to stop along the way to take in the scenery and the landscape.
Before you even get to the cable car station you are already at over 2200 mtrs above sea level. On the day, there was not a cloud in the sky so could can see for miles as you go.
We booked the cable car in advance but booked the very basis level which allows you up for around an hour. This was fine for us as we knew our daughter would only hold the interest for around this time.
The cable car was an adventure in itself and the views going up are unreal.
When you get to the top it really is breathtaking. Before I went I was not aware this was the highest peak in Spain but when you get up there you really get a perspective of just how high it is. There are two walks you can take when you get to the top and we took the shorter one considering we had a 5 year old. Looking back we could easily have taken the longer one as they are not too difficult and are good fun for kids.
When we got to the end of this walk, you could see the clouds in part of the valley below. This gives you a good idea how far up you are.
Overall I would certainly recommend this trip for couples, individuals and even families

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,Very interesting place. Great view from the mountain. Also the drive there is beautifull and goes through unique landscapes.,Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We took a day trip here in an open top minibus. The journey also took us along the coast, above Los Gigantes, and through a valley to the village of Masca. The views were stunning but not to be recommended if you are afraid of heights!

The guide stopped at a few viewpoints along the way for photos and also at a little refreshment stall which appeared to be a usual stop. We then travelled on to Teide and it's stunning landscape. The rock formations are out of this world and we stopped in the massive caldera to take it all in. Unfortunately, the cable car to the top wasn't running on this particular day. Apparently it doesn't run when the wind is coming from a particular direction so don't buy your tickets in advance as you.d only have the hassle of getting a refund. There's a cafe in the crater where you can buy souvenirs and refreshements or use the services. It costs 1 euro to get into the toilets, but you get a ticket and this is refundable from any purchase made in the cafe.

We'd been advised to take jackets as it's cold on the top. We never got to use our jackets as it was still hot in the caldera but our guide told us that it could drop to 15 degrees (Celsius) on the top. We still wouldn't have used our jackets as that's our usual summer temperature at home - and that's on a good day :-)

well recommended if you like views and different terrain.

Formas Magicas Routes
100% RECOMMEND WITH MARCO

We have just experienced a magical private tour of the National Parque del Tiede guided, in English, by our wonderful, congenial and considerate Guide Marco.

Marco has a wealth of experience, enormous general knowledge and is a superb driver. Most importantly, he has a true generosity of spirit making you feel so welcome on his island of Tenerife

This daytime Tour can be 4 or 6 hours and we booked through our hotel Concierge. We are so pleased we chose the longer Tour.

Our age group spanned from 15 to 72.

Marco paced the day perfectly after our 11am hotel collection. His knowledge was phenomenal and he offered all the information we needed to bring the whole experience to life, stopping for spectacular views and great photo opportunities and a fabulous lunch at the Parador high within the park

Sadly, our 8-minute cable car ride to the peak had to be cancelled because of the prevailing wind.

Formas Magicas Routes is a highly professional company and I would highly recommend this Tour with Marco which has left us us with the most wonderful and warm memories of Tenerife

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We did a half day trip including the cable car to Mt. Teide . The tour guide had great english and German and was very knowledgeable we really learn a lot on the way to the national park. There was plenty of stops along the way to take in the views and get some snaps. The cable car ride was great and the question were not that bad even though it was very busy we waited about 15 minutes. Once at the top we had lots of time to explore the trails.
Make sure to wear good walking shoes as there are a lot of loose rocks on the paths.....it is a volcano after all.",Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,Booked this trip through the hotel. Took about 1.5 hours to get there. Stunning landscape. You can take a cable car to the top (or very near the top) & from there you can see for miles. Once you get off the cable car & follow the track around it gets very uneven & rocky. You definitely need trainers or flat supportive shoes here. All in all a very good few hours & something you should do whilst here.,Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Teide... Teide was the first mountain I ever knew by name many years before I ever even saw it in person. Why? Because my great-aunt Juanita who was an accomplished watercolor painter always included the Teide in her paintings. Sometimes they were the focal point of the painting or just a distant image on the horizon but almost always there. These paintings hung all over my Canary Islander grandmother's home and my parents home as I was growing up. So when I finally made it to Tenerife visiting Teide was on the top of my list of things to do.
We drove up to the cable car station early with my brother and niece,a good decision because we realized later how many people came here and how parking had become a nightmare for those who came later in the day. On the way up we marveled at the incredible landscape the result of past volcanic activity,it looked like the surface of the moon or Mars with no trees or plants in sight. Once on top the views were spectacular! We walked the one trail through the volcanic rock admiring the unusual shapes of ancient lava flows and distant views below. We were on the top,the highest point on Spanish territory and we felt it. It was an exhilarating experience to have finally met Teide in person after knowing her name all my life. I know my experience was very personal and others might not share the same feeling but just for the views alone I would recommend visiting Teide.

To commute from puerto DLC, there is only one bus at 9:30 AM to the cable car which will take to the upper station. Please note that you can only stay 1 hour at the upper station. The bus back is at 4:00 PM. Plenty of places for a picturesque click !!",Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"I can't say how amazing the trip to El Teide was for our family. If you don't know, its the highest point in Spain and the 7th or 8th highest spot in Europe (Even though Tenerife is closer to Africa!) To get to Tieide you can take a bus, but we drove our rental car and it as about a 45 min drive from our hotel in La Caleta. The drive itself is amazing climbing from sea level to about 7,000 ft through the clouds, you get to see some great views of the island, as well as the changes in environment going fro the arid low level part of the islands, trough the lush forests near the clouds, and then breaking through to an almost Mars like landscape. We purchased a timed ticket online and I am glad we did as the lines can be long. Plus parking can be a bit of an adventure, as you might have a bit of an uphill walk to the cable car from the car park.
Someone told us to not bother with the cable car ride to the top. DON'T LISTEN! It is a must, and was so amazing. The able car takes you to the top station at about 11,500ft. Again, more amazing views and a fun ride. At the top there is another short hike up stone steps to the true summit at over 12,000ft, but we didn't bother as the lower oxygen levels were noticed by my daughter and I which made it hard to climb the steps. So we took some time to just enjoy the views and get some great photos.
Once back down, there is a gift shop and cafe, for some coffee and ice cream and the prices were reasonable. It's worth bringing home some lava rock jewelry.
This was one of the best things I've ever done in my life and I am so glad we took the time to visit El Teide!!!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,1.0,We spent about half an trying to find a place to park. Once we did that we then had to walk another half an hour to the cable car.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"The view from the peak is absolutely unique. The one hour tour your ticket allows you to stay on top is almost not enough to admire everything. On a sunny July day it is not cold at all up there, I did not need warm clothes. Even with a ticket bought on Internet, we did have to wait an hour to get up, which seems a waste of time, lack of organisation.

We spent 1.5 hours in the visitors centre then because of heat(24oC) went to café @ El Portilla very nice lunch.,Jul 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We did this trip today as a family of four as part of an organised tour. We took a coach ride which picked us up from outside the hotel, had an running commentary of the scenery, plants and history of Tenerife on the way. Our guide Rudolf, was incredibly informative and diligent. He told us a huge amount of information, which was very interesting but not always that relevant to the tour or the children.. Saying that I would much rather have a guide who tells us a lot rather than one who has very little and seems disinterested.

The tour self includes a few stops at key places for photographs and then a ride on the cable car up to the point on the mountain which is 3500 feet.

This was by far the most exciting and surprising thing we have done in Tenerife. I would really recommend going to see the volcano as it is an eye-opener and really informative. Some of the negative reviews are probably down to renting a car and making your own way there. This is challenging due to the traffic and not having the knowledge that you can get from the guide and I much recommend that you do an organised tour. That way you can sit back and enjoy the scenery, taking the facts and not have to queue at the cable car. Everyone has approximately one hour at the top of the cable car and this is enough. You could push it and take more we found the are quite thin and an hour was enough. There is a lovely café which serves sandwiches ice creams and coffee so you can have a lunch afterwards.

As mentioned I would say this was the highlight of our trip to Tenerife. It was great to relax but even better to have not missed this fascinating, geological miracle.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"El Teide is a sight that cannot be missed. It was raining in La Laguna when we started out and raining until we reached an altitude of about 1800 meters, and then the sun came out. It was a glorious day after that. We were told later by local people that this is common. It's only on rare storms that the mountain is in clouds. There are a lot of opportunities to pull off the road and take in the view.

If you choose to rent a car and drive up to the lift, be aware that parking is very scarce. We circled around and around for a long time, checking out every place that we could park. Even the most marginal spots along the road were taken for at least 1/2 mile in both directions. We finally had to settle on a parking lot at an overview about 1 mile away from the lift. We were about an hour late per our tickets but we were ushered right into the line without any problems. We hitchhiked back and were given a ride by a very nice couple from France. (Merci beaucoup, Monsieur et Madame.) I strongly suggest that you either get to El Teide very early or arrive between 2 pm and 3 pm, which is when most Spaniards have their main meal and have left.

The lift is a bit on the expensive side but the view is worth it. Note that you will ride up with a lot of people who should have showered that day but didn't. A minor inconvenience in an otherwise great experience.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Another visit to the summit of Mount Teide. My partner and I have done it many times. As we had friends visiting we obtained our free passes to the summit online months before our visit.
We were lucky. The weather was dry and calm. We took the cable car. At the top of the cable car station we then walked to the summit and back within the 2 hours allowed.
Slow going but worth it.
Took water, wore sturdy trainers and a light jacket.
We all enjoyed. Always feel privileged to be allowed to access the summit of this volcano.",Jun 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"Go on the cable car, it's expensive at €27 each, but lots of fun. Go early to miss the crowds and midday heat. Not a lot of shade if you decide on walking one of the trails, and wear walking shoes if you have them. I wore trainers and stumbled a couple of times. The view after taking the cable car is nice, but not spectacular. You will get equally nice views beforehand. Take water and a light jacket or fleece as it gets chilly at the top.",Jun 2019

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"In October 2018, my partner and I visited the volcano Mt Teide on the island of Tenerife, as an excursion part of our holiday. The tour was planned by our tour operator that included the coach journey to Mt Teide and Roques De Garcia. Cable car lift to the top but not summit. To walk to the summit, you MUST have a permit that you can only acquire through the website: PARQUE NACIONAL DEL TEIDE where you have to state a day and time that you will be visiting the summit. We were the only two persons from our coach that had a permit and therefore visited the very top of this volcano, that stands 3718mtr above seal level and s the third largest volcano on the planet. We felt very privileged to be there and would recommend anyone who wishes to visit the volcano, apply well in advance for a permit and hope that the weather conditions are perfect on that day

Worth it as the scenery was spectacular at the top.",Jun 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Great view. The plateau below the cable cars 🚠 is spectacular itself and worth a trip even though you don’t go to top. The roads at least from the south where we came are good just watch out for wannabe Tour de France climbers who cut corners. If you take the cable cars up the view is even more spectacular but you can argue whether it’s worth 27€. You have to pay extra and book in advance to walk the rest of the 200m climb to the top. There are good toilet facilities at the top and bottom of the cable cars. At the bottom there is a small cafe.,Jun 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"I have been here several times and enjoy the drive, the roads are much better surfaced now and by using a car you can stop in a number of locations on the way for a variety of views. Depending on time of year even at the bottom you can stand in snow in warm sunshine which always make a good picture with shorts and T shirt.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Hiking to Pico del Teide is an amazing experience due to the extraordinary views. For the ascent I have chosen Montana Blanca route and a overnight stay in Altavista refuge. The next day I started at 5 a.m. to reach the summit before the sunrise. As adviced by the hut guardian, I have walked slowly to prevent development of high altitude sickness. It was quite cold on the summit and a smell of sulphur could be well recognized. The crater was emitting gases. The view of the sunrise was just great. I have also enjoyed the view of the mountain's shadow on the sky. During the descent I went to Pico Viejo (this section between the two summits was the most beautiful part of the entire hike but quite demanding for the knees; I have met there only two people so the entire mountain was only for me :) ). I have ended the hike on Roques de Garcia.

One has to keep in mind that:
- the altitude is quite high so without proper acclimatisation it is better to walk slowly
- the temperature range is large - very hot during the day (take a lot if water, a sunscreen, a hut etc.) and very cold in the night (take warm jacket, long trousers, gloves and a hut)
- the best access to the start and end of the is by a car (there is infrequent bus though)
- I have not seen this information before on Internet but there were informatation boards (in May 2019) that some sections of the park are closed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays due to mouflon shooting.

Be ready for long walks, wear comfortable shoes and don’t forget your camera with a fully loaded battery!
The only point to improve is the lack of parking space in the proximity of the cable car terminal, it is at the top of a hill, a heavy walk to get there.",May 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,Definitely worth the trip great views of landscapes and wildlife. As you travel up across the island you see the arid south turn to green high forest and more sweet Spanish views down to Porta del a Cruz.,May 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"My partner and I are keen hillwalkers and were in Tenerife for the Tenerife Walking Festival in May 2019. We had planned to do an additional walk on our own up to the summit of Mount Teide.

You do have to plan ahead for this as you need a permit to visit the summit. These are free, but limited in number; the slots fill up quickly so you are best to book one at least 3 months ahead. NB: the permits apply between 9am and 5pm which are the times that the cable car runs – it is possible to visit outside those hours without a permit, but you would have to either walk up from the road level or stay overnight in the Refugio Altavista and hike up from there.

I had booked an 11 o’clock slot for our permit (it gives you a 2 hour window), and our plan was to take the cable car up most of the way, hike to the summit, and then walk all the way back down to the road (TF21).

The hike from cable car top station to the summit is a steep taxing walk, but anyone reasonably fit should be able to do it so long as they take their time – there’s no actual climbing required. However, it is at a pretty high altitude which may affect your breathing, so take it slow. Fit youngsters will do it in 20 minutes; most people can do it in 30 mins or so; it took me an hour, but my lungs are damaged and I struggle with hills even in England where they are much lower!

Just to give you a bit of context, we are both in our early 60s but experienced hillwalkers. We wore stout walking shoes and I used a walking pole, but people do manage the climb in trainers. Don’t be fooled by sea level temperatures - it’s cold at the top, so dress for it. I wore a thin base layer, a thin t-shirt and a good quality fleece; lightweight waterproof in my bag in case I wanted it (for its windproof quality, not because I thought it might rain).

Then we walked back down to the upper cable car level and turned left (East) and followed the path until we got to the turn off for the start of Route 7 (PR7). This is the path that takes you down the mountain, past the Refugio Altavista, past Montana Blanca, eventually reaching the road (TF21) about 2.7km east of the cable car bottom station.

We descended steeply for about 40 minutes through dark volcanic rocks to Refugio Altavista. From there the landscape changes to be lighter, softer rock – but it is still going steeply downhill until you get down to the point where the path passes Montana Blanca. At this point you can take a little detour up to the top of Montana Blanca if you want to (we didn’t bother).

From this point it gets less steep. Continue following the PR7 – the route is very clearly marked with new metal signs (the best I have ever seen) – all the way down to the road. There is a car park here – this is where people park if they want to walk up to Refugio Altavista and stay the night there in order to get to the summit at dawn.

Note that this a difficult downhill walk, losing some 1500km of height over around 8km. Ideally you should have some experience of hill-walking and be equipped with walking shoes/boots, walking pole (if you use one) and a strong, healthy pair of knees! Also, don’t forget this is a desert environment, although it is cold at the top it quickly becomes hot as you descend, so take plenty of water with you – I took a litre and a half, but wished I had taken more.

Unfortunately, my knees are not as young as they used to be, so the walk was quite challenging for me, but I wouldn't call it a scramble: at no point did I feel the need to sit down and scoot down on my bum, or (worse still) turn around and come down backwards on all fours - as I have done on ""walks"" in Snowdonia or The Lake District!

Once we got down to the road we still had to walk back to the cable car base station (where we had left our car), which is 2.7 km by road. Alternatively, there is a signposted path but the terrain forces the path to veer away from the road so it is about 1km longer, which at the end of a challenging walk felt like a km too far for sore feet and thirsty throats.

The total walk from Teide summit back to the cable car base station took us around 5 hours, including two short breaks to eat or just look around.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"brilliant, the views are stunning so enjoyable! All the staff are so kind and nice! 100% recommend.

We booked in advance and went early so don’t have any queues etc and were lucky to have crystal clear sky’s!!

The cable car is brilliant feels really safe and only takes 5 mins to travel up, we had one nervous of heights traveller but it was fine and the trip down is actually smoother than the way up! The whole setup including the roads are a credit to the island really well done!

Two things:
1. Would recommend wearing runners or hiking boots (not sandals as we did) and of course the recommend you bring extra layers as it can be cold

2. It’s a long drive up hill, so make sure you have plenty of fuel in the car before you enter the park! (Don’t go by the “range” function on the car as it’s a long steep climb up)

P.S.: Remember that you DO NOT NEED the National Park's permit to climb El Teide if you are off the trail by 9 AM, before the first cable car arrives at the top station.",Dec 2018
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We took our rental car to the top of the mountain. The drive was absolutely breathtaking!

The difference in terrain and scenery is so vast, it’s hard to imagine you’re only driving for about 1 - 2 hours. The roads are tight but easy to maneuver. The lookout spots are frequent and not crowded. There’s about 3 different restaurants on the way up.

Also, for those who suffer a small bladder, there are two bathroom stops on the way up. The facilities are clean, but take your own toilet paper as there is none available.

Parking is free but a nightmare. Get there early! Usually around midday you’re lucky as the early risers are leaving and you’ll find a parking spot as someone is pulling out.

Cable car costs €37 if you’re coming up by yourself and not with a tour. Be aware! The lines are long but move fairly quickly.

When you get to the top: take a jacket! It gets very chilly at the top of the mountain.

Some climbing is always involved and there are little to no hand rails. But the view is worth it!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"It's not surprising that the El Teide National Park in the most visited Park in Spain and one of the most visited places in the entire world. The Park is easy to reach via bus or, preferably, by hire car. Within just a couple of hours from the coastal lowlands of Tenerife, the visitor finds him/herself in a landscape like no other. Of course, no volcanic eruption can ever be the same, but here are such dramatic variations of volcanic activity in touching distance. The great advantage of going by hire car is that one can take time to park at many different locations and just take time to experience these landscapes. But beware when driving your own car/hire car - the coaches descending from the mountain come whizzing down and often stray over 'your' part of the road. Just stop if you are not sure - it is certain that the catches are NOT going to slow down for you! A trip up the cable car to the highest spot in Spain, at €66 is not cheap but for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I think it is worth it. Best of all is the 'Stargazing' experience and to be at the top of the mountain at sunset and see for your own eyes, the largest sunset mountain shadow of El Teide is an amazing experience - one that takes time to actually grasp what one is seeing. It is difficult to described to other 'mortal' folks what one has seen. In the new book, 'A Day Above The Canary islands' (in the bookshop) is a photograph showing the sea shadow. The book also contains an amazing aerial photograph showing the lava channels for the 1909 eruption - something that is not visible from the ground viewpoint. But to summarise, the colours of this volcanic landscape are, in fact, brown and black. However, the amazing different shades of brown and black, displayed on the various rock formations of lava and volcanic rock is not just amazing, it reminds one of the stupendous forces that must have produced such a landscape.

I advise to pre book tickets on line. Make sure you leave enough time to find parking place and be prepared to walk up to the cable car. We went on a Tuesday in low season at 2:20 cable car. It took us 1/2 hour to find a parking space and 20 minutes to walk to cable car.

Secondly once we got there we took the cable car and went to the top 3200+ meters high. It got even better once you were at the top and took the hike trails either left or right of the mountain. We did both! If you think it’s too hard then just go to the peak side. The photos below speaks for its self.
Finally they say 15min - 1hr is enough at the top but we spent about 1 1/2hrs at the top. It’s amazing and breath taking! Now if you really want to hike to the top which is another 400m you will need a permit

The tickets are timed as only so many people can ride the cable car. We had over an hour to wait for our trip. In their favor we boarded the cable car within a minute or two of the time on our ticket, just wish we had an earlier time. If you are driving yourself as we did parking is at a premium and you may have a long uphill walk. There is a great path at the top. Be prepared for the altitude which can make the walk a challenge. It is also very uneven so if you have balance or mobility issues you may be limited to the area around the cable car.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"I've been to Teide quite a few times as I have family that live in Tenerife and visit once a year. However I'd never climbed right to the top before and decided to do that on my most recent visit.I looked online before I went and found out that a permit is required. Note you will need to book this some time in advance - I booked 6 weeks before and there were very little slots left. You only get 2 hours and it is billed as a 40min walk. What they don't tell you is that the walk starts from the top of the cable car which means you have to get the cable car up. The cable car station usually sells out of tickets by around 10am. So, you also have to book your cable car tickets in advance. Also note that this isn't cheap - our 2 tickets were 54 euros.The parking by the cable car is not great and you could find yourself queuing for a space, the queues for the cable car are also large so basically you have to prebook everything and arrive at least an hour in advance. I'd suggest 2 hours from your slot time. If you book an afternoon permit slot time, note that the last cable car leaves at 4.50pm but they book permit slots after this time - go figure!
We never made it to the top because we did not know this stuff!!! We arrived an hour before, took time to park, luckily managed to get a ticket even though they were sold out. We then queued for ages and got to the top at 3.15. Our slot time was 3-5pm so we started late, but of course we had to be back before 4.50 to get the last cable car so we ran out of time because we also had to be back earlier than our booked time!
All sounds very negative, but if you know all of this stuff in advance and get organised, it's an amazing trail up to the top (we nearly made it so got most of the views etc), the views are stunning and it's well worth doing.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"We booked the excursion through our TUI rep in the hotel for £85 each and were picked up by coach at 2.30 pm near our hotel in Los Gigantes. After picking up more people on the south of the island we proceeded to travel up the mountain with our excellent guide, Isobell describing our surroundings as we made our way up through the canopy (forestry) which had been damaged a couple of years ago by Forrest fires.
After a comfort stop we pressed on to the volcanic fields above cold level, and had time to explore and take photographs before arriving at a hotel where we were given a three course dinner with wine (all inclusive) then we climbed a little higher to a point near to the Astro observatories where we drank champagne as we watched the sun set above the clouds.
Another comfort stop before finding a place to study the stars and galaxies which Isobell pointed out with her laser pen. She was fluent in English and extremely knowledgable about astrology.
We arrived back in Los Gigantes about midnight after one of the most fascinating and value for money excursions we have experienced.
Highly recommended and worth every penny. Dinner, wine etc included in the booking price!

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"El Teide is well worth a visit if you travel to Tenerife. You can get most of the way up the mountain by cable car but the queues are very long. I drove to the National Park from Los Christianos via Arona and Vilaflor. There are some interesting miradors on the way and eventually you get to the plateau of the mountain itself. And WOW here there are spectacular views of the mountain and other rock formations. You can go on numerous walks around and up the mountain. However you will need special permission to go to the very top of El Teide as it is a place of scientific interest and is protected.

The most popular stopping off point is Roques de Garcia and it gets very busy on a good clear day with limited parking spaces.

It only takes about an hour to get to the plateau of the volcano from Los Christianos and the roads are very good, especially when you consider just how high you have to climb. Coaches have no problem with the journey

I did a simple 1.5 kilometer walk from Los Roques to get closer to the volcano and it was well worth it.

I came down via Guimar where there were more fantastic mirador stopping pints on the way. A wonderful day out

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,"Go... it's really excellent. We were incredibly lucky to have gone on a totally cloud free day. The views are incredible. Our tips are
1. Arrive as early as possible - we parked easily and reached the top before it got too busy (9.00am on a busy weekend)
2. If you want to get to the summit you must pre-book as there is, for quite understandable reasons, restricted access.
3. Walking poles are really useful. I suffered from dizziness and some altitude sickness. I wish I'd had my walking poles to give me a bit more stability/leverage as I personally found it a lot more challenging than I'd anticipated.

We saw families trying to ascend in thin soled shoes and even carrying a Boots plastic bag as if they'd arrived for a stroll along the prom! Needless to say they didn't make it.

Spain,Volcan El Teide,5.0,My specific purpose to visit Tenerife was to hike to the summit of this mountain the hard way. So first thing I did was book a permit. This is most important as you cannot go beyond the cable car station without permit unless you spend a night paying 21€ at Altavista hut. The permit is given for specific hours so you better be there within that time. I reached at the bottom of the hiking trail early and then walked all the way up to the summit. I'm very fast and it took me under 3 hrs to get to top from Montana Blanca trail head and 2 hrs to get down. And what a view.,Apr 2019

You can't go to the actual top just near it, and we got 1 1/2 hours to explore the volcanic landscape on a serious of steps and paths in the Caldera (Crater) instead. We stopped for coffee in Vilaflor, lovely coffee it was too! We took our own food and there was a lovely seating area in the caldera looking towards El Teide, stunning location for a picnic! The air quality is amazing up there - so clear and bright. Even 2 teenagers appreciated the magical quality of the views and landscapes.",Apr 2019
Spain,Volcan El Teide,4.0,"We took the cable car and from there by foot.
Tip. Please book ahead your trip and all will be just fine.
The ascension is not very difficult but you will feel the lack of oxygen and the fast tranzition from the base to ~3500m.
It takes between 25 to 45 minutes to be on the top.
Please mind that you will not find a vulcano crate, rather it looks more like a normal peak with some places below where some soulf steams are coming out.
You can see a beautiful volcano crate if you continue for 3 mins from the top, some pictures attached. Worth seeing it, trust me.

Please mind that you might need to cycle around parking lot as the available spots are limited.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"The current Alcazaba (Arabic for"" citadel"") is the best-preserved Arab fortress in Spain. However, it does not occupy half the area that it had in its heyday. The most important first defensive line on the seashore has been lost. The most powerful walls and towers were here. The residential area around the citadel has completely disappeared. During the Moorish period, it even had its own fecal water evacuation system, with latrines in almost every house! Christian ""liberators"" only began to approach this level in Madrid during the communal reforms of Charles III at the end of the 18th century, and in the rest of Spain only 4 centuries later at the beginning of the 20th century. Interestingly, Alcazaba was stormed three times during the wars between the Arab principalities. The Almoravids took it in 1092, the Almohads in 1146, and the Nasrids in 1279. But Isabella and Ferdinand could not take the fortress by storm, and did it by bribing the Arab commander Ali Dordux. Today's Alcazaba consists of two internal walls running along the perimeter of the hill. Several old defensive towers have been preserved, but the famous ""Torre del Homenaje"" stands in a dilapidated state. By the way, there is a tower with the same name in Granada. Behind the second wall is the Courtyard-a Palace complex consisting of a patio system, residential, official and outbuildings. Alcazaba and the castle of Gibralfaro are considered as two different objects. An adult ticket to Alcazaba costs 3.50 euros, and a combined ticket costs 5.50 euros. Tickets can only be purchased at the ticket office, there are no online sales.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"The famous fortress, or literally citadel, Alcazaba de Malaga is comprised of two walled enclosures. It was originally connected to the city ramparts that formed a third defensive wall, now only two inner wall remain. The second inner area of the fortress was completely enclosed and punctuated with several defensive towers. The outer citadel is accessed through the “Puerta de la Boveda” or Vault Gate, then the gate doubles back, a design to make it nearly impossible for a surprise takeover of the fortress. We walked some of these dark stone returns imagining the an invader’s shock at what he would find around the next corner.

There is a lot of climbing in these old ruins, which will warm you up even if the sun doesn’t. The pathway we were on wound up to the enclosed gardens and lovely fountains, where we all took turns posing for photos. We then passed through the Gate of the columns, later called the Tower of Christ, that also served as a chapel. Another inner enclosure is accessed through the Gate of the Granada Quarters that acts as the defense for the western side of the palace. This is one place you would not want to go to uninvited (or at a minimum without a tour guide!).

I was able to wander round the Alcazaba, as it was 10am, it was pretty quiet and there was a lovely cafe with wonderful views serving rioja and coffee.

The history of the Alcazaba is fascinating and I recommend Mohammed as a knowledgeable and educated guide who explained a lot about the significance of all the water features and gardens and the cultures of the people who had built and inhabited the fort.

For those who have a particular interest in this period in history, the site evokes pictures of what it must have been like to live day to day, or to be under attack in this place. The views of Malaga port are fantastic. There are no amenities at the site, so you may want to take some water or a snack with you.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"The place is a great place to explore and admission is very cheap. It is a reminder of how clever our ancestors were without all our high tec devices and methods.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Yes, you can take a taxi or bus to the top and walk right in, but where's the challenge in that? You can walk from the bottom, but don't do it on a hot day.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,We found ourselves with a free afternoon and wandered into the Alcazaba. So happy we did - it is an incredible structure. Easy to walk and explore - the best of it is the symmetry of the courtyards and the beauty of the orange trees in bloom.,Feb 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"This is one of the most impressive monuments in Malaga. Allow yourself enough time as the climb to the castle is steep and long. Unfortunately, the lifts were not working when we visited so had to take the climb up. But you could visit using a taxi or the Bus tour and you wouldn't have to trick up the mountain. You would be missing impressive scenery though.",Feb 2020

Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"Lovely views and a quieter, interesting expierence near in the city centre but nothing too special. The experience is let down quite dramatically by the lack of information, almost every information board inside is regarding tools or pottery used when the fortress was in use, i found it very difficult to get a feel of the atmosphere and history behind the architecture. It isn't a huge area and when busy can be quite crowded at points.
I find it a shame as i really wanted to enjoy this experience more!",Feb 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,Enjoyed our visit to the Malaga Alcazaba. It proudly looks down on old town & is illuminated at night giving good photo opportunities! We bought a joint ticket for Alcazaba & the castle which sits higher up on the same hill - but not connected. Lots of steps & steep baths but the 360 views over Malaga make it worthwhile! Inexpensive & worth a visit.,Feb 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"This was a great, cheap and enjoyable surprise. Really beautiful in parts, very interesting, great views of Malaga. I enjoyed the Alcazaba very much, much more than the Alhambra Palace in Granda which everyone talks about. Much more to see here.",Feb 2020

You can buy tickets for both the palace Alcazaba and the castle ruin located higher up on the hill overlooking Malaga, but we settled for only Alcazaba. We spent about one hour there and took some nice pictures. I’m enclosing some samples, hope you like them!",Feb 2020

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Although the tour we took was in Spanish, my husband and I still really enjoyed climbing through this Moorish fortress, and hearing how things changed when Ferdinand and Isabella ""redefined"" this place when the Moors had been driven out. The gardens and the views from the ""ramparts"" are amazing. Well worth a visit for anyone coming to Malaga. Sunday bonus after 4 pm, it's free! And we heard tell that perhaps there would multiple languages in the future.",Sep 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"The Alcazaba is an amazing fortress palace/castle. It is worth taking the time seeing the fortress.

Highly recommend if you are in this part of the world",Feb 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Didn't get the time to visit inside the Alcazaba , but it's worth taking the side walk up ....as you get higher and higher every new level opens up a new view of Malaga's beautiful architecture , park and port view ....
And don't forget the Bougainvillea .... one day i want to go back and visit the whole Alcazaba",Oct 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"If visiting Malaga you must see this ancient Arab monument, a gentle 15 minute climb or by the elevator (not on Mondays) at the back of the Ayuntamiento. While not as romantic as Alhambra in Granada, it gives an excellent idea of the pre-Castilian Moorish occupation of Malaga and Spain generally. Worth the visit, cheap too. I did not climb up to Gibralfaro!",Feb 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Although not as ornate as the Alhambra in Granada or the Alcazar in Seville, nevertheless this makes for an interesting morning or afternoon. You can get a joint ticket with the Castle above, but its on'y a few Euros to get in. If you want to avoid the climb there's a lift on Calle Guillen Sotelo behind the Banco de Espana, or you can walk down from the Castle. There's also an outside bar/cafe with great views.",Feb 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,It was a definitively a must in malaga. We bought dovoe tickets for alcazaba and gibralfao castle and it was 5.5 euro / person,Feb 2020

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"This is a nice trip for an short afternoon. It should be done together with the castle. Free entrance in Sundays, but without audio.",Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,we trully relish our time at Alcazaba of Malaga - historical complex outright. peaceful walk up exercise. I recommend wearing tennis shoe. be sure you have enough change for the entrans fee/not too expensive! Great conversion from shopping in Calle Larios & eating in el Palo. We likely should have gone up there two times in a single day to backjack off all the calories!,Dec 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"After reading reviews and hearing recommendation, I visited here. €3.50 entry... no signs in English... no clear arrows to direct you around... you go out the same way you came in so no idea if I saw everything, but it was all in Spanish anyway! The views are way better from The Castle too ( Gibralfaro ) and you don’t have to pay for the views - there’s a separate platform before you pay entry and many people seem to just do the climb for the views of the city and port. Wish I’d just done that instead!",Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Enjoyed our visit. Lots of history of the Moors time in Spain with significant pottery displays. Particularly liked the gardens and the orange trees on the way to the top. Super views of the city and the cathedral. Well worth a visit. It is just beside the Roman Amphitheatre so take in both together. It is not the Alhambra in Granada, but no queues to get in and a fraction of the cost. Well worth a visit.",Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,One of the most impressive castles (the castilo on top) and palace (below) plus beautiful gardens from the period of Moors in Spain. After you enter the Castilo you must sit for a few minutes at the lovely cafe with wonderful view to take fresh orange juice or coffee and cake.,Dec 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Of the 2 monuments up this enourmous hill this is the best. The moorish architecture is well preserved in place and some of the colourful decor can still be seen. You can actually get the elevator to get here which saves your legs. Don't be confused though as I was. From reading previous reviews some people claimed you could get to the castle directly from here- you can't! You have to leave the monument and climb the steep hill even further to get to the castle you can't just walk through the grounds.

Main downside and why I've not marked higher is that there is absolutely no signage in English and you don't even get a leaflet when you buy your ticket with any sort of map or explanation. This is a real problem as you have no idea what you are looking at.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. It’s a citadel with lots of books and crannies which is how a castle should be.

Entrance tickets can be bought from two multi-lingual machines just inside the entrance and there was someone on the desk helping people out when they needed it.

Lots of steps but the views from the walls and some of the rooms over the town and coast are fabulous.

The orange trees added atmosphere.

Great fun to explore slowly. The free map was good enough to find our way around.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"We loved this place and glad we had tickets in advance as there was a queue. A few of the stone paths can be uncomfortable to walk on but are beautifully created. Orange trees smelt gorgeous. We had a coffee inside the grounds where there are toilets all very clean. We loved the Palace inside that has some beautiful architecture a lot of which is very well kept, it must have been an amazing place to live in. So glad we went it was a tranquil place with beautiful views too.",Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Granted it is smaller, this was still a great opportunity to walk round a sensitively kept Moorish gem without it being absolutely packed with tour groups. It has everything you would expect - traditional gardens with geometric design, lots of water features, classic Med and north African planting, geometric tiling and amazingly intricate plaster work.

The combo ticket with Gibralfaro for E5.50 is a great price.

Wear sensible shoes as it is steep in parts and there are lots of uneven surfaces

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,Very nice adorned with flowers and foliage with amazing views along the way up. Great photo opportunities. Little museum type rooms on the way to also learn the history of the feature. Good walk to tire out young active ones. :),Dec 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"The Arabic name means citadel. This fortress-palace located at the foot of the Gibralfaro hill dates from the Muslim period. It was built between 1057 and 1063.

The best-preserved Alcazaba in Spain combines defensive purposes with the beauty of an Arab palace.

The entrance is situated next to the Roman amphitheater, from where a path climbs to the fortification. Some of the Roman-era materials were reused in the Moorish construction of the Alcazaba.

The views are panoramic over the city and the bay.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"It has loads of history, lovely grounds to walk around or just sit and take in the views from up high. Good place for photos, kept clean and not to busy. Takes a good few hours to walk around and see everything so well worth the entry fee which was under €10 for 2, or more if you wanted to continue up to the castle. Well worth a visit if you are in this area.",Dec 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"This is a fantastic value, only a few Euro, and you have access to the entire place. It's a huge labyrinth, filled with history and really well maintained. You could spend hours here, marvelling at the wonderful engineering, architecture and views, visualising the life people must have had here. You go up so high you have wonderful views of Malaga city and the Port. I'd highly recommend for anyone with the least interest in history or architecture. A lot of the pathways are made of various types of cobble, and can be a bit tricky and steep at times, I slipped once and I'm fairly sure footed. Highly recommended.",Sep 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,We got the elevator from the side to take us up and we had a pushchair. Looked amazing when we were on the port so we're curious to see what's inside. Unfortunately no English translations all in Spanish. We came not knowing much and left not knowing much. However still glad we went as there are beautiful photo spots here. It's not pushchair or wheelchair friendly so we parked the pushchair in a quiet corner and walked with our toddler. If I came again I'd bring the baby carrier for sure!,Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,Well worth the hike up hill to see the amazing view of Malaga. We didn’t bother going inside the castle however we did see a long queue so it’s possibly worth visiting,Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"I did not expect to find such a fantastic hilltop fortress in the middle of Malaga. When our partners had booked the trip to Malaga , this was not what I expected to walk around. Stunning location and the history is fascinating. Well worth the money and time for the views and the peaceful atmosphere.
Visit the castle as well - more climbing but well worth it. Joint ticket for 5 Euros is a bargain.",Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,Interesting as a hilltop fortress for Ty he walls and ramparts there is nothing to see inside. Very poor information for non Spanish speakers where there are boards giving information on the towers and fortifications. If you need to walk off lunch it's worth the €3.50 entry.,Jan 2020
Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,I'd like a lot more direction and information in English - or for that matter in Spanish. Bought the joint ticket with the caste and thought they were connected - doh!,Jan 2020

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"I came here as part of a guided tour, which I would recommend doing, since you really get to understand and appreciate the architecture and how the fortification was designed. It is a fort, so decorations aren't as intricate as the Alcazar in Seville or the Nasrid palace in the Alhambra. But it is still beautiful and has a nice view over Malaga. There is also a garden inside which is especially nice.",Dec 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"This place is a true wonder. I'd suggest allowing a good 1.5 - 2 hours, arriving early to beat the crowds.

We very much enjoyed exploring all the different areas, although I'm not sure that I would fancy it in the heat of mid summer.

Our guide, Anna, was fantasitic. She is a teacher, had a great interest in history, and was guiding to improve her English. Very interesting history in the Alcazaba, and the relationship of Malaga to the ebb and flow of Islam/Christianity in the Iberian peninsula. It is definitely worth seeing.",Dec 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"There is not much to see in this Alcazaba especially if you've been in Alhambra, Real Alcazar of Seville and even the Alcazar in Cordoba. It is true though that this is a fortification and it is older. The views towards the city are nice and in general it is a pleasant walk up the hill. There is a small entrance fee. If you have time you can also buy a combined ticket for the Alcazaba and Gibralfaro even if you need to enter from two different locations.",Nov 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,Alcazaba can be easily reached by bus or taxi. It involves climbing stairs but it's not too bad. This Palace fortress offers a combination of history and beauty. Highly recommended. Do buy the combo ticket with the Castillo Gibralfaro (5 Euro) to complete the trip.,Nov 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,This was a bit of a surprise it a lovely place for a stroll round with very interesting parts. It’s a bit steep in places so take care and wear sensible shoes. There is also a little cafe/ bar near the top where you can sit with a beer/wine and a snack and look out over the port. Very enjoyable and not expensive. You can double up and buy tickets to also go up to the castle (long steep walk but worth it 👌,Nov 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"This is a major attraction in Malaga and worth spending some time walking around the site. Unfortunately it is not friendly to mobility impaired people due tot he number of stairs. It was the palace of the muslim governor of the city before being used for the same purpose by the first christian governor. The style of the building is typically Moorish, similar in many ways to the Alhambra, but much smaller and less ornate. The gardens are excellent and add to the beauty of the place.",Nov 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"The Alcazaba is an old fortress, built on a hill and overlooking the city and the harbour.
Comparable to other historical venues this one is no exception when it comes to combining Moorish and Christian religion within one venue.
This results in very nice and interesting architectural combinations.
From the outer walls you'll have very nice views over the city and the harbour, especially when skies are clear in early spring and late autumn.
It might be wise to choose a day without cruise visits to the harbour because the place will be busy if the 3000+ passengers of a cruise liner want to visit this place all at the same moment.......
A combination ticket with the Gibralfaro castle is advisable to skip the line there.

We went down the gardens and court yards until we reached closed gates for it was not possible to reach the Alcazar unless you go back again and go through another passage to reach the Alcazar.

As you explore the fortress, it leads you into pretty garden areas, water features and well preserved interiors. There are also great views of Malaga.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"I went to the Castillo on top as well so this is a combined review:
The castillo itself is not so interesting but you get a really great view of the city and the entrance is not that bad (3.5€) You can get a combined ticket so you can go to Alcazaba as well were the castle is more interesting but view is worse. Alcazaba is a really nice castle.",Nov 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Alcazaba is a Moorish medieval fortress on top of a hill. It's the highest point in Malàga and you have stunning views of the gardens down below and the port of Malàga.
A stroll in the serene gardens is so relaxing with its lovely quaint courtyards, beautiful fountains and high arched doorways.
The walk up is quite a climb but totally worth it!!",Oct 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,The building itself has seen a considerable amount of re-building - but it is possible to see some of the older - original buildings and get a good feel for the place. Amazing views. There is a lift for anyone not able to manage the steps. Definitely worth a visit.,Oct 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,Lovely place to spend a.few hours which was reasonably prices at 3.50 euros. The views were fantastic. It's an up hill climb and a bit cobbly. Drinks machines and toilets are inside. Only complaint is the waiting to get in because you have to use a machine to pay even though two members of staff are there watching you use the machine .But would recommend a visit if in Malaga.,Oct 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Surprisingly extensive once you get inside, this must be the bargain of tourist sites. Plenty of small gardens and walks with water interest, and a small museum and cafe at the top. Can get queued up, but well-worth a visit. Allow plenty of time!",Nov 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"It may be a big claim to say this is a lower key version of Granada's Alhambra but it certainly delivers lovely gardens, water features and well-preserved Moorish buildings. The water ways and fountains are particularly nice on a hot summers day as are the cool courtyards. We bought our ticket in combination with a ticket for the Castille Gibralfaro (Euro 5.50)....one is at the top of the hill, one at the bottom and they are not directly connected. The reference to an elevator seems to disappoint some- it only runs from the higher level of the Alcazaba back to street level, not up to the Castille. Both the Alcazaba and the Castille are worth visiting (the former more so, although the Castille does have great views) and one doesn't have to be visited immediately after the other.

The Alcazaba itself is beautiful. It's been superbly restored and is a maze of walkways, passages, gardens and fortified walls. Just wandering around is brilliant. Be aware though, that to get to the castle you have to go back down to the entrance and start the climb again, which to the top of the castle is quite a hike. My advice would be to do the castle first.",Oct 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,A really lovely and interesting place to visit. Not in the same league as the Alhambra but still worth a visit. The climb up is not too strenuous but there is a lift (you will find it around the back from the main entrance) if you need it. Views and gardens are lovely.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,Thisxwas a lovely expetience. Breath taking views and a lovely walk through history. We went up in the Lift direct down the street beside the townhall/Ayuntamiento.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"We started our malaga touring at the top of the hill and the castillo, and bought a combo tour ticket with Castillo & Alcazaba for 9 Euro.

It was a much easier walk down to the Alcazaba from the top than walking up (picture a views walking down are attached).

There are many paths inside the walls and nice view look-outs from the Alcazaba also.

It’s a beautiful sprawling venue with great views and some nice although dated archaeological displays. Worth the few euros it cost. My only feedback was we had wheelie suitcases with us which was a nightmare due to so many steps and cobbles. Not a place for wheelchair users. Could do with a place you could leave your bags.",Oct 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"The Alcazaba of Malaga is the best preserved citadel in Spain and well worth traversing the main levels and hundreds of steps to get a spectacular view of the Port of Malaga. There is a small lift at the port side of the hill to gain entry if you need. It was built in such a way, with an outer and completely enclosed inner walled enclosure that, if invaded, it would be difficult for soldiers to infiltrate and also the royal family had its own escape route.
It has its many lovely courtyards, fountains and is within easy walking distance of the city. There is also a Roman amphitheatre on the city-side that is currently being excavated. It's also worth taking a look at night from below.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"We visited both the Gibralfaro and the Alcazaba whilst in Malaga. The Gibralfaro is the best for views across the city but the Alcazaba is the best for seeing the Moorish architecture.
I liked the way that despite being built as a fortress which you can see in the way the entrances were built to slow down any invaders as they climbed the hills, it is very peaceful and tranquil once you reach the upper levels with the courtyards and gardens.",Sep 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"this place intrigued me so much,malaga has so much history to it,to learn of how many countries have occupied Malaga over time.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Definitely worth a visit. Fortification with Moorish architecture, you can feel the history and cultural roots of Malaga from the time of Arab rule.

Spain,Alcazaba,1.0,Such a shame you can’t always get in. None of the pay by card worked and as we - and a lot of others didn’t have coins- we had to leave without seeing it.

Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"The Alcazaba has been made to look as authentic as possible with the walls made up along its perimeter but be very careful if you have young children with you. Some of the walls are quite high with dangerous drops on either side yet there is very little protection to prevent a fall. Children thinking they are in a castle will want to climb, play and peek over the turrets be aware.
Handrails are also a rarity on this site.
The walkways inside are ok but I think it’s the walls people and kids will want to explore. There is some information in several areas about its past but all in Spanish.
Worth a visit but just be careful.

There is a cafe on the top and nice gardens, so you could visit it even during day, not worrying about the heat, where will be place to hide from it.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"We wanted to compare this citadel to the Alhambra and others, and it was worth a visit but the walk up the hill takes determination. If you want to take the easy route up, there is a lift behind the town hall that brings you up in the middle of the building. The views are beautiful and there's a water vending machine which was welcome. It's well worth a visit, but make sure to go back down to see the amphitheatre as well.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Enjoy walking in around up and down the Alcazaba on the hill over Malaga from which you can enjoy great views, admire the historic moorish construction. Do note the Gibralfaro cannot be reached from the Alcazaba, you would need to go down to street level again and get time to get up the other way, bit of a shame (we missed it, as we were out of time and heat did not allow us any further climbing!)",Aug 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"On the hottest day of our break we visited the Alcazaba. Be sure to take water with you if it's hot and avoid the shops directly opposite who are charging €1.95 for a 500cl bottle (€0.35 at the supermarket). Very good value place to see as a top sight...think it was €3.50 per adult to enter with a bolt on option for the castle. The adjacent roman theatre can be seen from a public viewing promenade immediately adjacent so is worth a look, but be warned the promenade gets very busy. Alcazaba is an impressive monument nearly 1000 years old and still pretty intact with lots of original features. Pleasant garden and fountain spaces dotted around and it offers a good view over the city and active docks. Few places to fill drinks bottles or cool off but I dont recall seeing any toilets !? There is however opportunity to cool off in an outside bar in the street or inside Alcasaba (Inside near the top...)if you so wish. We went for ice lollies on our visit !! Unless you love the searing heat, then avoid midday.

This place clearly has a great deal of history and I'm sure visitors would enjoy their visit more with just as little research. Ramparts, fountains, pools, Moorish archways, terraced gardens etc are all in abundance in this pretty area, as well as marvellous views over the harbour. Well worth a visit - pity you can't visit the Gilbafaro castle ruins at the same time but they are kept separate and you have to leave the Alcazabar to go back up the hill to gain access to the castle.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,Equivalent to Alhambra Visit. See Roman Theatre Visit as the Roman Theatre is actually part of the Alcazaba.,Jul 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Some of the views and scenery were excellent and worth the visit. Entrance was very affordable but cash is preferable for entry and be prepared to wait in a small queue, depending on when you go.

A few inclined sections to have to walk up and to make the most of it, you really should go off the path and up some of the steps to see the views and the detail in the buildings.

We didn't go to the other site but there was a combo offer that would save you a euro or two if you were.

Well worth a visit, maybe allow about a hour and a half for the visit and maybe an extra half an hour for a drink or ice cream at the bar.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"We used the lift to access this palace which made a great difference as one of our party is 77yrs and would have struggled to fully enjoy the grounds without this service.
The palace is built on a reasonably high rock and consists of many small inclines and stairs to gain entry to the well maintained gardens and courtyards.
The lift takes you into the highest point and we worked our way down enjoying the views across the city and port. Resting in the shade of climbing plants in some of the courtyards some of which have water features.
The artifacts on view have short explanations in Spanish which we used Google translate to identify the ones drawing our curiosity. This many we did not spend as long within the palace as we possibly could have if there were to have been more information in our language.
There is also a small café with outside table and chairs at the top of the path leading to the east wall.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Two large fortifications with numerous layers of walls, a very reasonable price and great views of Malaga. We hoped there would be more interior/furniture left in the castles, but instead most of it is just walls and gardens. Either way, we would definitely visit again for the view!",Jul 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"On the hill between the port and the old town there are two large fortifications well over 1000 years old to keep the city safe from intruders. We visited both - the Alcazaba and the Castello of Gibralfaro and were impressed by the well reconstructed facilities and exhibits in both. Both feature a considerable number of fortifications with courtyards and nicely landscaped gardens. Gibralfaro further allows you to walk along the top of the defence walls and getting one of the best views of Malaga City and the harbour.
Note that you can safe a lot of energy by taking the lift from the port side entrance into Alcazaba. And once you have finished Alcazaba get back to the Portside and take bus 35 from in front of the town hall - it will take you right to the top of the hill and entrance to Gibralfaro

I think it would have been great if there was an audio guide or more information available about the history.

Also make sure you wear good shoes because the path up to the castle is very slippy!

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"It is a very interesting site..very ancient but there is a steep climb up to it. The paving underfoot is very smooth and so can be slippery especially on some of the steeper inclines coming down. A lot of people in flip flops had difficulty descending. Little cafe on site with a small selection. Go early to avoid climbing in the heat. Im very fit...i walk my dogs 8 to 10 kms a day and i run 10kms in 70 mins but I had a lot of difficulty making the trek up in the intense heat there was the day we went. Price is reasonable.

Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,The walk around the Alcazaba was worth the price. The fortress gave an idea of how the Palace was protected. The solid stone work made one consider how the fortress was built. Walking along the fortress walls gave a good view of the port and parts of the city.,Jul 2019

There are 2 ways to visit it:
1) buy the tickets and then follow the sign to the ascensor de Alcazaba, which will take you up on the Alcazaba and then you can just walk around and go all the way down by foot;
2) buy the tickets and walk all the way up, it's a really nice walk actually, not that hard and you can stop from time to time to enjoy the views or take a rest near a fountain. I found out these 2 options the hard way 😁
In the end it was a lovely visit, nice architecture, pretty plants, fountains, access to the walls, beautiful views of the city. My 4 yr old enjoyed the visit and wasn't too tired after all the walking up and down.

Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"Overall we were disappointed with this Alcazaba, and quite critical, perhaps because we already visited others including in Seville and the Alhambra in Granada. Although we knew this one would not be as good as the others, we had expected more than we saw.

It was smaller than we had thought it would be and the fountains in the courtyards were either not working or were poorly maintained. The courtyards could be far more attractive than they actually are, and it was overall (at least in our opinion) a bit neglected looking and the interiors were lacking anything of interest.

We took the lift up to save us a climb. Cut into the hill, the entrance is a bit hidden on the street running behind the town hall, but is marked by two potted trees on the pavement and a pedestrian crossing.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"We stopped at Puerto de Malaga, which wasn't as good as we thought it would be, and decided to go to the Alcazaba, which is just across the street. We had been told it was worth visiting, and indeed it was.

There were no lines, not too many people and it only took about 45 minutes to do. You could spend a little longer, or you could do it quicker. It's a good time filler, but that's not being fair to it, as it's really more than that.

We had been to the Alcazar in Cordoba, and this, to us, was just as good. The price wasn't bad, EUR 3.50 and 1.50 if you're over 65. And, if you're over 65 or tired or just lazy, there is an elevator (ascensor) to the top. Then you can just walk down through the Alcazeba, instead of going up and back down. To get to the elevator from the main entrance, go back down the hill (Pintor Nogales) and turn left. It's about 100 yards or so on the left. You can buy tickets there too.

I would recommend this if you're down by the port area. You can park at the Muelleuno underground parking garage.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,Go in the evening - it was uncrowded and we were able to wander about and take photos unobstructed by too many other people. It’s open until 8pm and we were there from around 6pm and there were only about four other couples and families. There are a fee steps and a bit of a steep climb to the main buildings bit otherwise it’s easy to wander around the gardens and the palace buildings. The central courtyard with the reflection pool is as nice as the Alhambra in Granada. The views of the city and the beach are very nice also. Well worth a visit.,May 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,Interesting and very old. I enjoyed the exercise climbing up to the top. The view was really great from there.,Apr 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"This very old fortress is easily accessed from the centre of Malaga (a lovely city). It is quite a climb (there is a lift for those less mobile) but it is well worth it for the amazing views. There are some lovely gardens within the fortress, and displays of ancient pottery etc that are interesting to look at. There is also a Roman amphitheatre near the entrance. Good value and worth a visit, particularly on a sunny day.",May 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Impressive and unique place. It looks even better by night - lighting is really well done and you can just sit on the surrounding wall and look at its beauty.
It's placed right in the center of Malaga and it's easy to get there.",Nov 2018
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"This fortress is older then Gibralfaro and it sits physically just below it, but you will have to hike around to the lower side of this area to get tickets to get inside.

There is a Roman excavation near the ticketing entrance side of the fortress, limited in size, but a reminder that once upon a time, everything around the Med was part of the Roman Empire.

We had just completed our hike up to the Castillo Gibralfaro, so another steep hike slowed us down quite a bit. As the day was bright & sunny, the views of Malaga below were very good.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Worth a visit for the views and the gardens, which are very nice. For the price it's good value, and certainly worth it if you won't make it to the Alhambra. The interiors are pretty dull - it's not the Alhambra.",May 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Yeas, go there. No mattr if you think its smaller than la alhambra. Which is true. You will see many similarities and also differencies, much roman influence. Its a 60 min comfortable walk. 90 min if you take a tour, which I did and recommend.... the free one by elora malaga was excellent for us.",May 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"We purchased the dual ticket Alcazaba & Castillo de Gibralfaro for 5.5 euros each. Both looked very interesting with great architecture and views of the city and pretty gardens. But unless you have a guide or can read spanish it's all pretty meaningless. It's a shame the information on the walls isn't in English or even better you had the opportunity to hire a headset that talked you round the sites. It's still worth seeing though but be warned you walk around Alcazaba first which is all up hill, then you walk back down to walk around the side of Alcazaba to get to Castillo de Gibralfaro - a steep walk, if its a hot day you will need water.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"An easy climb, with lots of shade if you are tired and too hot while climbing, and then offering an amazing view of Málaga on the top. It's also worth to pay the 3.50€ at the top to have the ""full"" view of Málaga.",May 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,We went to Malaga a bit unresearched to be honest but found this place at night all lit up it looked stunning so we went back next day what a great fort well worth the visit and 5€ for the dual ticket to the other fort at top of the hill,May 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"Not bad for the price. Lots of steps and uneven surfaces, so totally unsuitable for those with walking difficulties.
Pretty gardens at the top with scenic vistas of Malaga. Interesting Moorish architecture.
Not an awful lot here, and no information in English or guides to impart any knowledge of the place. In general, OK but certainly not worthy of five stars !",May 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Most visitors won't associate Malaga with historical sites of 11th Century Spain but you don't really need to go much out of your way to access the Malaga Alcazaba. It's cheap to enter and there was no requirement to queue or book in advance on my visit.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"An excellent opportunity to see the city of Malaga, and we'll worth the price of entry. Walk up from the city below, or take a bus, either is good. The Moorish history of Andalusia is fascinating, and this place makes it come alive.",Apr 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"Yes, I agree, it is beautiful and impressive. But, for such a touristic site, I would have expected that the information written all over the place would have been translated. At least in English. The audio guide is a must, but de didn't know how to get it. Brace yourself, it is a lot of cardio (steep, uphill and stairs)! But the view, oh my, it is breathtaking!",Apr 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Great experience at the Alcazaba. Just queue and in and slowly smurf up the hill. Enjoy all the view points and exhibits on the top. Then be smart and take the elevator down. Better for the knees and then turn LEFT up to the castle.

Spain,Alcazaba,1.0,Don’t get sucked in to this boring fortress. Little historical interaction. Best thing this place is for is to twist an ankle. Stay away and if possible stay away from Malaga all together. The focus of the town is seems to be to make sure they get their typical 3 or 4 hour stint at their favorite watering holes.,Apr 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Really worth the visit for the views, and the place itself is well preserved and maintained with loads of different areas open to the public. We didn't do the Castle, although you can buy a combined ticket which saves you a little. Our reason was that we were advised that there was more to see at the Alcazabar which was better restored, and the views were as good.",Apr 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"A visit to the Alcazaba is a must when in Malaga, not only is it in good condition but the views from various points are excellent. Don't expect the Alhambra but there are plenty of attractive areas and it is very photogenic. As well as the main entrance there is a lift from Calle Guillen Sotelo which runs below the citadel and gardens. We took the lift up and then worked our way down to the main entrance/exit.",May 2018

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,Well worth the time to go here Great old building in good condition for its age was not going to take this site in but we were glad we did,Mar 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,3.0,"The Alcazaba is best viewed from below, in my opinion. There's a nice garden at the top and views over Malaga. But if you have already been to the Alcazar in Seville or the Alhambra in Granada, you will be disappointed, as the Alcazaba doesn't come close to matching the beauty, scale or grandeur of either. We went up in the lift luckily. We would have been disappointed if we'd walked all that way for something that didn't meet our expectations.
That said, viewed from below or from a distance, the Alcazaba is one of central Málaga's icons and beautiful to see at night from one of the city's rooftop bars.",Jan 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,This is an old Moorish fortified palace in an elevated position towards the edge of the old town so easily accessible. It's a good walk on paths within the double defence walls leading up to original palace rooms but only the brickwork and a few relics (with information in Spanish only) remain. It's best for showing the layout of the rooms and gardens with some running water and in particular the wonderful views across the old town and the port and sea from numerous vantage points on the surrounding walls.,Mar 2019

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"A very well preserved example of the Moorish architecture ( with a few concessions to modernity during the renovation).
Be prepared for a bit of walking up the hill and lots of steps. It's not really suitable for buggies.
It offers spectacular views of the port area and over the city - obviously a good choice for a defensive position!
At €3.50 per adult it was a pleasant way to spend about 2 hours and learn a bit and reward oneself with a beer and an ice-cream.

We walked up from the old town, but you can catch a bus that takes you all the way up - it's an interesting walk with lovely views but quite steep

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Couldn't believe it was free to enter this fortress. It's huge and very well kept, so much so that we couldn't see it all.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"Alcazaba is rambling rock and red brick fortress on a slot of the hill. Another fortress Gibralfaro is further on the top of the hill. Entrance was moderate including both or just one. Notice that these fortresses are separate and you have to walk up and down to visit them both. Route to Gibralfaro starts on the road by the entrance to Alcazaba.

Alcazaba was pretty with green plants and red bricks. Inside there was walls and towers to climb and watch views, beautiful gardens and inner yards, small exhibition of ancient items. Yard was large and winding, places were bit hard to find without guides. I think there were toilets but they were not well guided. No other services were available. Some cafe would have been nice.

Overall the fortress was in great shape and thus really pretty and nice to walk around. Route guidance was poor and you just have to wander around which is not too hard though. Take your own drinks and snack to enjoy inside. Although it was low season there was pretty much visitors inside.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,What a delightful way to spend an hour with some lovely views over the town. We visited early on Sunday morning and before the crowds - perfect!

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Having enjoyed the free walking tour earlier in the day at 11am by Maria from Explora Malaga, i was sure I should go for the 3pm Alcazaba tour. This time our guide was Javier and he was as compelling, passionate and knowledgeable as Maria.
Having a guide helps a lot as he explains very well the history behind Alcazaba fortress, from how it was built, then destroyed, then used to house the poor in the city and then finally decreed a monument and cleaned up. Javier also explained the warfare strategy behind the design of the fortress, engaging us with inreresting stories all the way to the top, that I didnt feel tired or breathless at all. Along the way we stopped for photo opportunities, marvelled at the blend of stone, brick and nature, learnt about the inquisitions, it was lots of fun. Of course there were many tourists even in early March. But still enjoyable. Entrance to the fortress alone is 3.5Eur. Definitely worth the low admission fee.
Can take a bus, 35, from the Paseo del parc to the Castillo de Gibralfaro. It runs from early morning except weekends when it starts from 11am. Buses cost 1.3Eur a trip.
Exiting the Alcazaba, you can make a right turn to go into the Roman theate.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,The old fort/palace is a great spot. It is very intact and you can see the wall structure from different periods in time dating back to the Romans. It’s a lot of uphill walking but it’s not that bad. There are a lot of water features and the views of the city from the wall is quite nice. The palace is at the top and also nice to see. Really enjoyed it.,Mar 2019
Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,"We visited the Alcabaza during our day trip to Malaga. It was not on our itinerary and for the small price point it was worth it. Our entry fee included the castle further up. The only small complaint I had was much of the area is not well marked, including how to access the second attraction. One the whole, though, that which was saw and explored was fascinating and a true piece of history. And the views of Malaga were pretty cool. It was busy. It is a tourist trap and you are stuck crossing paths with clueless people with no regard for others and consumed with their selfie sticks and poising for useless pictures. Get passed that and absorb the history and it is worth the visit.

The trek to the second site, the castle/fortress is a trek. And not for the physically challenged. It is step walk to the top and just as challenging going down. Once there, again, worth it. Especially the even better views of Malaga. Time permitting, put it on your itinerary.

Spain,Alcazaba,4.0,Right in the centre of Malaga it's a great place to visit. Not expensive either. probably takes around 1 - 2 hours maximum to go round. Excellent views out to see and of the city.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"Right off the center of town the lower original fort is complete, I assume restored, but you feel like you are experiencing it as it was in its day.

Spain,Alcazaba,5.0,"We did the Alcazaba and the Gibralfaro in one hit on a warm February day and although we found the relentless climb a little challenging (we’re 70) it was well worth it.
The lower Alcazaba is quite easy (even though I have bad knees) and the view is great over the lower city and the amphitheatre but I was delighted and amazed that I was able to get to the very top of the Gibralfaro - the view is fantastic!
The path is good all the way and there are low walls to sit down on if you need to. If you find going down more difficult (which I do) there is a bus stop at the top and for a small fare you can get back down to sea level again.

Spain,El Casco Antiguo de Benidorm,3.0,"We stayed in an apartment for 6 days in the Old Town. It wasn't too busy until the weekend, then the streets were crowded despite being out of season. Too many British pubs (facing the beach mainly) for my liking and a few hen/stag parties which I can only imagine would multiply in the summer.
There was loads of shops open late selling some nice clothes, leather and designer stuff and a few art shops. The tapas places tended to harass us into going into their restaurants which I don't like either. There's a big supermarket too.
The beach was beautiful and you can go up steps to a chapel where there's an amazing view.
Nice to visit but not a place I'd recommend for children as not much for them to do and the place was mostly full of older and retired folk.

Spain,El Casco Antiguo de Benidorm,1.0,"Took a 2 week trip to the Victoria which we last visited 20 years ago when it was run under the Best Western banner. Although the accommodation was good the food left much to be desired with little taste and always over cooked and often cold.
Some of the staff in the dining room were particularly rude and unaccomodating although not all. The non ending civil engineering projects throughout Benidorm coupled with the loud and disgusting drunks screaming and shouting throughout all hours was a disgrace and made us feel totally embarrassed to be British.Needless to say we shall never return to either the Hotel or Benidorm again.

They had also put us in a tiny room, with only 4 towels , we got moved the next day. I would not go back to this hotel.

I prefer the old town side of Benidorm with their abundance of shops, restaurants and bars.. however if they could block cars from driving along the front that would be a plus, I understand the need for delivery vans but personal cars is unnecessary.
A very clean resort which I didn’t expect with the amount of people visiting there. I watched a young man empting bins which were on the side of the walls..imagine that in Britain.. you can find your style of holiday in Benidorm just depends on what you’re looking for.

This time it was just my wife and I visiting Benidorm for a couple of days and I have to say the Old town was brilliant - Tapas Alley, choices of restaurants and bars [not rowdy and in your face] were excellent.

After my initial visit to Benidorm as part of a stag do I thought that Benidorm was not really a family resort and more geared up for party time - however after staying in the old town I have to admit - next family holiday [with the kids] will be in the old town.

Spain,El Casco Antiguo de Benidorm,4.0,"Unless you've lived on another planet, everyone's heard of Benidorm and it's a place that seems to have been visited more than any other resort, certainly in Spain, if not Europe. And yet there is nothing particularly pleasing to the eye in this popular city; there are no stunning architectural constructions, though there is the odd church and the plaza where the old castle was is very pretty. The marina and beach is always attractive but the old town draws hundreds of thousands of people, both tourists and locals, to the bars, pavement cafes, eating places and shops. And it is this, together with some of the quirky narrow streets, that creates a wonderful atmosphere where people are always in a celebratory and happy mood.
I wouldn't particularly like to go in the high season, though we did when we first came to Benidorm but that was 48 years ago and the old town was great even back then.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,3.0,"Let´s go straight to pros and cons, since I got which such mixed feelings about this tour:

Pros:
- Beautiful scenery
- Old charming train
- Nice cosy village (Soller)
- Nice cosy harbour (Port de Soller)
- Free Museum with Miró works in Soller's station
- Easy to find your way around the means of transportation
- Very friendly staff
- Enough to fill a whole day
- The tram's seats are reversable, so you can always travel facing forward

Cons:
- Very expensive (32EUR train + tram return tickets)
- Too long sitting going from A to B, not so much time at the stops (I read somewhere that the same ride with the bus is half of the time, and cheaper)
- Good part of the train journey is litterally in the mountain, that is, in the tunnels
- It is kind of a tourist trap, so expect a lot of bad behaved tourists
- You have to choose in which train you are coming back to Palma, that is either at 2pm or 6pm
- The first 20 minutes, more or less, is across the suburbs of Palma, so no beautiful views there. The next 30 minutes is on people's backyards going up the mountain, not that interesting either. The last leg of the trip is descending the short coast of the mountain to the village

It is a nice ride, no doubt about it. If you are a flatlander, it is tottaly worth it. I was not awed, having a lot of (much nicer) valleys and mountains from where I come from, but in a beautiful day it is worth it.

If you want a window/good seat, ARRIVE EARLY!! I arrived aroung 9:15am, one hour before departure. Was one of the first to buy the ticket and one of the first to board the train.

I got tired of just sitting in the train and tram. 1h20 min form Palma to Soller, than only half an hour there until the 12pm tram, which takes half an hour down to the harbour. Then I had to take the 1pm tram back to Soller, to be there in time to be on the 2pm train back to Palma. So I didn't have time for more than a short stroll in both places.

I gather that the 6pm train is always full, and that is why I havn't chosen this one. The trams as not always on time as well.

If you have a car, do it by yourself. You can still go to the train station to see both train and tram if you wish, and you can go on board while it is there.

It is better to travel with a rental car, because you can stop anywhere, and take a snapshot, take a breath of clean air and relax your eyes. Situated half an hour from Palma de Mallorca, you can travel across the mountains, but be careful : the person who drives the car should be experienced, because the roads are narrow and in many places 2 cars don't fit into the road.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"What a great place to spend time with your family. I am not sure why it took so long to be designated as a UNESCO world heritage site? Sierra de Tramuntana has everything to offer for families seeking to see the real wild side of Mallorca. We spent the majority of our time there on GR221, which offered excellent walking trails and easily defined paths that wind it through citrus Orchards all the way out to the Port. We wear our children. If you are a stroller family, you will need a large wheel sports oriented stroller to traverse the trails. All of the trails we were on were wide enough for passing on covers. Hiking shoes are recommended but hiking boots were never needed during our time there. Of course there are many posts about the historical significance of this mountain range in the sweeping views in the beauty of the walking, what I found to be most interesting was that it provided for nature walking in discovery for the entire family. There were signs for businesses providing overnight accommodation and food throughout our walk. Kilometer readings and walking time directions were posted regularly. Area maps are easy to find everywhere and are in good legible condition. I highly recommend that you take your family out for a day on the true wild side of Mallorca. Parking is not so difficult if you couple your ground transportation plans with the already invasive public transit system offered in the area. There are bus stops they can help you connect trails so you can extend your hiking. Many of the trails that start with in this mountain range are within a 40 minute drive from Palma de Mallorca. So even if you are staying outside of the mountain region you can still turn this into a fruitful day trip. Also even though there are 90 km to explore throughout the mountain range it is quite easy to find daytrip’s that will bring you to the highest points of beauty throughout the region. I would put our day in this mountain range as the best day we had on our trip.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"Mallorca really has different kinds of nature and geography. The mid and east side is rather flat. But the west side from Palma and up to Cap Formentor has mountains that are really gorgeous. Tramuntana is a UNESCO world heritage area since 2011.

Serpentine roads in the Riviera and Amalfi coast category, breathtaking views, lovely villages, history, culture and oranges...

You should have a car to really enjoy everything in your own pace.

Suggested road trips are from Palma to Banyalbufar, follow the coast (many serpentine roads) up to Deia and the secluded (unreachable by only boat until around 100 years ago) town of Soller. Along the way driving high up on the corniches you have plenty of opportunities to go down to the coast ""calas"" via small roads winding down.

Or stay on the main road and continue (after a night in Soller for instance) to beautiful little villages like Biniaraitx and Fornalutx, go down the 13 km long serpentine road (really awesome) to the sea at Port de Sa Calobra or/and visit the monastery in Lluc. Finish with Pollença and Port de Pollença and you're at the gate to the most northen part of Mallorca: the penninsula of Formentor. Here the roads are getting really narrow and the tourist invasion can cause some traffic problems. But you can settle with the viewing point at Es Colomer and perhaps also go down to one of the very best beaches on Mallorca: the Formentor Platja.

Enjoy - Mallorca is fantastic!

This was our second trip only on foot and I can recommend it to everyone who is not beginner and who has some experiences. We went from Sant Elm to Soller (+- 85 km), track was hard because of bad rainy weather, so it was dangerous - dry stones changed to wet and every step was like going on soap floor. There was no chance how to finished GR221, even bus from Lluc was stopped because of wheater.
So we moved to San Picaford (eastern coast) and there we started GR 222, which is no less beautiful and wheater there was better (+- 55 km).
People there are pleasant, nature very very beautiful, food excellent, accommodation very various in comfort and also prices, we tried everything from sleeping outside to 4* superb hotel - each way was magnificent.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"I just can never say enough about the Serra de Tramuntana range and the surrounding areas from the well known and well trodden to those seriously off the beaton track areas that very few tourists will ever find . Many spectacular views ranging from the white / pink blossom on the almond trees in the foothills to the chance of seeing snow on the high Tramuntana both in the same month of February . In the summer months always go prepared with headwear and plenty of water as the temperature can get truly hot 40 degrees + . Always expect the unexpected as sheep goats and wild pigs are always roaming about and a couple of carrots will always be appreciated by the donkey population and keep a keen eye skyward as hawks buzzards and eagles are regularly to be spotted .
And one thing to remember although the Serra de Tramuntana can be accessed from hundreds of points all are free .
I hope you enjoy your visit to a more rural Mallorquian way of life .

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"We took a hire car (wife and 10 year old son), and drove from Banyalbufar up through Valdermossa, Soller and through the mountains right to Pollenca and out to the lighthouse at Formentor.

Make sure you bring a good camera as there is photo opportunity after photo opportunity, and if you have passengers nervous of heights they may have an uncomfortable 30 minutes driving up and down the thin road up to the lighthouse!

We found Pollenca unremarkable, but Valldemossa has to be one of the prettiest villages I've ever stopped in (photo attached). You can drive it in a (very long) day with a reasonable stop off in the key stops - we had time to catch the tram from Soller down to the port, although found it cheaper and easier to get a taxi back to where we'd parked the car!

If you go to Majorca and dont do this, then you havent been to Majorca.
Also stop off at the inland lake / reservoir and have a paddle in the water - great fun and a nice way to break up the drive.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"We set out early from Cala d’Or and drove all the way to the start of the MA-10 at Andratx. We drove the entire length of the road through the mountains to Port de Pollença, with several stops along the way. We spent an hour or so at Andratx, Soller and Valldemossa and also made brief stops at Deià, Fornalutx, Lluc and Pollença, as well as several stops at the roadside to take pictures. Including the 1hr 20 drive back from Pollença to Cala d’Or the entire journey took us 13 hours, which was longer than expected but we didn’t feel rushed at any point and got to see enough of the best places along the way. I was a bit hesitant before going after reading some reviews about the roads, but in truth they are absolutely fine. The surfaces are great and although there are lots of steep drops and tight corners, as long as you drive carefully it is a fairly straightforward drive (bar one or two areas where the road becomes quite narrow). The only dangerous thing about the road is some of the locals using it, and the odd goat in the road. The views are amazing the whole way through the 100 miles or so and I would recommend this trip to anyone visiting Mallorca.

One day we stopped in two areas that were simply breathtaking! We stood in the edge of several cliffs and took amazing pictures! We then continued to drive through the range to reach the Cap de Formentor where a lighthouse is located and also offered amazing views of the ocean and cliffs! Parking can be a little difficult in these areas and the parking areas are very small, but it’s well worth a trip out there! On another date we drove out to the charming village of Valldemossa that is located in the Serra de Tramuntana. It’s no wonder why UNESCO has named this entire region one of its beautiful and wonder sites!

Anyway we ended up renting a car for a day (you do need a driver over 25 and that has 3 years experience) . This was by far the best choice anyone can make. Obviously it’s a bit different from driving in the U.K. for the past 9 years but after half hour it was soon second nature . It was absolutely amazing , being able to go where we wanted along the mountains , stop off when we wanted. It was fantastic I would highly recommend to anyone . We set off from Santa Ponsa and drove along the south coastline heading up toward the top of the Island visiting many small villages on the way !

It is striking to one who only knew the plain side (south east) of the island. So strikingly different.
My favourites were Fornalutx (Citrus culture - lemons and oranges - adding colour to the amazing mountain scenery) and Deia . But the whole serpentine mountain road is a blast. ""Mare i Monte"" similar to Corsica, the green mountain sliding into the blue sea. i found more beautiful than Corsica.

If you're not used to driving long switchback roads you maybe need to be careful but if that's the case you'll drive slowly anyway. The only once that don't drive slow are the locals that knows the roads. It can be i bit busy in the summer at least from Palma to Soller but it you continue along the mountain the traffic fades out. If you travel along the mountain all the way to east make plans that it will take all day.Tip: don't drive through the tunnel, instead go a left ju before it and go up the switchback road. You'll get an amazing view once you up there. From then on you go down again were the tunnel ends. It's the ""old road"" that isn't in use much anymore and much more fun to drive.

This road trip out does the 101 in California for a couple reasons: 1) the scenery is equally as spectacular 2) the traffic and speed are super reasonable - this time of year. Cyclists passed me and i passed them. Heard that in the summer, the cyclists can be quite busy and cause issues with hills and curves.
Tons - and i mean many - multi - mucho - opportunities to stop and take pics and just chill. there were a couple scenic bars that were unfortunately closed due to off season.... i don't know if i could handle 3 or 4 beers and this drive too.....
Es Grau looks awesome! this may require a return visit!
The drive along the coast easily took me 4 hours with stops.
The return from Soller to Palma along the expressway through the tunnel was less than an hour door-to-door.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,This gorgeous part of Mallorca deserves its world heritage status. It is absolutely awe inspiring. So much to see so many places to visit. Lots of good stop off places too.,Sep 2017
Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"For me, a keen hiker, a climb up Massanella remains the crowning achievement of a visit to Mallorca. The utter silence is disturbed only by the whirring of insects and the murmur of the wind in the trees and the grass. If you are unfortunate, you may be under the flight path of the multitude of planes heading for Palma airport. Their aluminium tubes will contain very few people who even know of the existence of the virtually undisturbed wilderness a few thousand feet below. All the better for me and the few other souls who crave the peace and solitude of this astoundingly beautiful area.

You will need 6 euros to enter the World Heritage site.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,4.0,"The Mallorcan beaches are not only touristic spots, which attract tourists. The mountains are not easy to access. The serpentine road climbs from close to sea level to some 600 m and is quite steep in some parts. There are some small parkings and nearly no viewpoints. We did only small part of the road from Pollenca to Caimari and from Santa Maria del Cami to Valldemossa.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"Our first time renting a car in Europe. Left the airport and headed for our hostal in Deia with a stop in Valledemossa on the way. Ignorance is bliss and we had no idea what we were in for as far as the roads are concerned: one side is a sheer drop-off and the other is jagged mountain that juts out too much at times. We saw countless cars with scraped paint from bumper to bumper from brushing the mountain. I guess technically these are two-lane roads but when you go around a blind turn only to see a tour bus or a bicycle (or both!) trying to traverse the same curve at the same time, you realize that the road is really a lane and a half. Then you have the locals tailgating you in frustration over how cautious you're being because it's the first time ever doing this and you've never seen anything like it in your life :). That said, Valledemossa was beautiful, our hostal in Deia had breathtaking views, the tram ride from Soller to Port Soller (great shopping) was really fun, and Fornalutx was very quaint. Beautiful scenery, fresh air, and the remote feeling had us feeling like we were a million miles away from home. Public parking spots are few and far between in Soller and while we thought we found a perfect spot, we got a ticket for €80 for parking in a residential area without the proper permit.

Having your own car means you can stop where you want, for the time you want. For us, that was regularly, but for not too long. This half of the range was done in the morning and we spent the afternoon in the Port de Sóller. The tram from the centre to the Port was €28 each way for a family of 4 (kids over 6) which was a shock, but many had print outs so assume is cheaper in advance online.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,4.0,"On a two-week trip to Spain to visit our daughter who was studying abroad in Cadiz, we spent four days on this idyllic, active and gorgeous island. The Serra de Tramuntana was probably the highlight of our trip there with it's picturesque cliffs, blue water and winding roads. I would go back in a heartbeat! You want to make time to travel along Ma-10 as it can get long with the winding road and amount of traffic.
Our journey began as we ventured from Palma directly to Cap Formentor using Ma-13 and Ma2200 to get there. The parking a traffic on the beautiful northern point is heavy but your patience will pay off. Wow! We then took Ma-10 to Port de Sollar, a little tourist town full of character and scenery. It wasn't nealry as busy as we might have expected. The drive there was a little long - while many a driver might freak out about the blind corners, narrow roads and abundance of cyclists who' own the road', once you turn the next corner to another incredible view, its all worth it. The cyclists were a plenty, in groups of 10-15- even 30, all vying for room on the narrow winding roads. Of the hundreds of cyclists we saw on our drives, we did see two accidents - both on corners.
We also spent another afternoon on Valdemossa, a quaint village tucked away in the mountains. Again, another idyllic place to wash away the stress of the real world and not far from Palma.
In terms of renting a car versus a guided tour or bus - if you have the confidence and patience, you have to use a car - so worth it!

In Serra de Tramuntana I did a 10.1 km walk from Soller to Deia. From Port de Soller (facing the sea) turn left and head towards the lighthouse. That is where the walk begins. Duration: 2 hours, 45 minutes. Map use is not necessary as the route is well marked and it’s easy to follow the signs. The route takes you through woodland, olive groves, main road (only for a short while) and ends uphill in Deia village. In Deia you can take bus L210 back to Soller or towards Valldemossa and Palma. I took the last L210 bus to Palma at 8.30pm for 2,85 euros. If you miss the last bus, have a look at the taxi fares to various locations and phone number which are displayed across the road from the bus stop. Also, there is a small shop next to the bus stop where you can buy drinks and snacks, which is quite handy while waiting for the bus.

There are loads of walking guides and online sites to get the range of walking available. There are shorter routes available as well as the path which goes the length of the mountain range. The walking around Soller ( a great base) is on good, well defined paths - I gather this is not always the case - nearly all the land is privately owned. Most of the walking would benefit from wearing proper walking boots, feet can get very tired in trainers on rough/stoney, although good, paths. Lovely area to get out into - hard to avoid a fair bit off climbing and descents. Take plenty of water with you.",May 2017
Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"If you're looking for a wonderful hike while in Mallorca, this is highly recommended. You can pick up the GR 221 trail off the main road in Deia. From the town center, you'll have to walk the road for a bit (maybe a mile at most). On the left side of the road is a wooden trail marker, the path to the right going up made of stone and dirt. This path winds along through the woods, behind local farms and private homes. Once on the path, it is marked with more wooden trail markers letting you know how much longer to reach your destination. You can follow the trail to Port de Soller and pick up a bus to take you back to Deia, or you can make the 'mistake' that we did and lose the trail at an intersection, opting for the road instead. Despite the fact that it was harrowing walking on a narrow curvy road with no shoulder, we did eventually find a path marked ""Mar"" and followed it down to the ocean, which followed the coast and took us back toward Deia. There were beautiful vistas along this path, and places to sunbathe on rocks as well as swim in alcoves of bright blue water. This is a rocky beach and the people that were there were mostly natives enjoying their secret swimming places. Even though we never made it to Port de Soller, it was a lovely hike back into Deia and took us a handful of hours to complete. Arriving in Deia on a Sunday afternoon, we were able to sit at a local restaurant and have a wonderful dinner overlooking the town.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"This was a beautiful walk in the shade of the trees, up on the hill along the coastline of Mallorca, often with the view of the ocean, but also amongst hundreds of olive trees. The path was wonderfully prepared for hiking and pretty easy most of the time, but some areas were quite hilly and covered with large stones that demanded more skills and physical stamina, so I wouldn't send my Mother with less balance on that walk. Too bad really, because large parts of the walk were just astonishingly beautiful and I know she would have enjoyed it. Even just walking among the olive trees was an experience. Trees perhaps several hundred years old, crinkled and crooked. If only they could tell their stories of what they have seen and heard.
We thoroughly enjoyed the couple of stops we had on our way also, with freshly squeezed juice of oranges from the Sóller area. Soooo gooood!!!

Saw some poor behaviour regarding cars overtaking round blind bends but no worse than at home. The road surfaces are in general superb and the gradients manageable by all at your own pace. Views are magnificent and being on a bike means you can view them at leisure rather than whizzing past from stop to stop. The descents are dreamy, mile after mile of great surfaces allowing you to safely brake when needed and get speed on when allowed. Toss up for the best descent is between the top of Orient to Alaro or the descent from the top of Col de Fermenia. Oh and then the best of the best has to be Sa Calobra.

The trail between Valledemosa and Deia evidently demanded some arrangements as it crosses private properties and is not well prepeared and poorly marked with signs.

From Deia however I had a lovely hike. Fantastic scenery and picturesce landscape. The tour guide said 2 and a half hour which is about right. The path is quite adequatly marked with signs apart from some confusion approaching Soller. I went for the trail straight ahead in the crossroads that said Soller 50 min. Also, walking in to Soller, walk passed the gas station (turn left) and turn right in the roundabout. After some three hundred meters you'll find the bus station on your right hand side. 211 brings you back to Palma. A tour compannion said Soller city centre is about a ten minut walk each way from the bus station. But my legs had had enough for one day.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,3.0,My husband grew up near Glacier Park in Montana and we have also lived near the Grand Canyon so mountain landscapes are kind of par for the course for us. That's not to say that the Serra aren't interesting. It's just that we are used to mountains. We took a bus ride and were VERY glad we did as not only do buses ply the roads but bicyclists and cars do as well. And those roads are super narrow and windy. The cyclists must be in super shape!

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,4.0,"We hired a taxi to drive us Tramuntana and Valdemossa. It was about a 40 minute ride from the city center to get to this Unesco world heritage site. We traversed a forested mountain road and went to a viewpoint with a great view of the north western coast of Mallorca.

Serra de Tramuntana is actually the entire mountain range, which has been preserved as an important nature reserve, outstanding in their geology and forest cover and harboring a diversity of plant and animal species, away from rapid urbanization. It would have been nice to spend at least one whole day here and have more time to enjoy hiking.

We did pass by Valldemossa and wandered around the historic town for about 30 minutes. Time seems to have stopped in this small town which is perched on a hilltop. There is a monastery, church, and Chopin’s old house. The old rustic town has shops and restaurants. We would have wanted to spend more time here to experience the town’s rich cultural heritage.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"The roads are a bit windy, but its worth a visit to the mountain villages. Fornalutz, Biniaraix, Valledemossa and Deia. We stayed in Soller(lovely!), and walked the Barranc de Biniaraix which is a beautiful, long, walk up in to the Tramuntana mountains. You dont have to do the whole thing, but its totally worth a climb for the views. The mountains are truly majestic. The path is well laid stones, so not too difficult, but you need good shoes and a bottle of water each, and its a steep climb. It took us 3 hours to get up to the farm. That was enough for me, I took the same path down again to Biniaraix. Warning! My husband, and son and friend carried on, they are well practiced map readers and walkers. According to the map, it is possible to walk across the ridge and down footpath 18. It is not possible, as another reviewer has said, it is private, and not accessible. They had to walk for hours, and if it wasn't for some kind driver, they would still have been walking back down the mountain road at 10pm! In the end it was a five hour hike for them. Quite an adventure, but not one to repeat, even if the maps and guide books say!

The park is full of the most captivating scenery and plenty of places to stop and just admire the views or undertake any of the many activities from hiking through to climbing.

It is a long and winding road and you will need excellent powers of concentration if you are to undertake it, as we did, in a single day.

Look to stop at every opportunity and soak up the wonderful atmosphere and scenery-Deia and Valldemossa in particular are worthy of further investigation.

When I have very good friends visiting me here in Mallorca I offer them to do the tour. One needs to be a good driver (lots of curves!). Because one wants to stop on this long way to have a caffee or lunch or or, best you leave with around 8 a.m. Coming from Palma you take the route Andraitx - Estellences (having a nice caffee/breakfast) - Banyalbufar - Valdemossa - Deya etc.. For lunch stop at the Monastery Lluc . The restaurant is simple but the place quiet nice. After take the route Puerto Pollensa and there is a sign says Cap de Formentor. Its a long, amazing drive with breathtaking views. On the way back stop at the traditional 5 Star Hotel FORMENTOR which has one of the nicest gardens. Its a MUST! Its great for tea time, enjoying this exceptional place with great views over the sea. Because the beach is on your food steps have a swim and enjoy your dinner in Puerto Pollensa on the Plaza Mayor.

best is the Italian one. The way back is much faster taking the highway to Palma. The tour is one of the most impressive ones one can do but very tyring too.

Two great walks, Puerto Pollenca to Cala Bocquer, and my favourite easy walk of all, Cuber Reservoir circuit to the Col de Lofre - sadly as we were staying a long way away in Arenal, there was no time to continue the long steep descent to Soller, which is the way we've gone before when we've stayed in Port de Soller.

Mallorca's wonderful mountains have brought us back time and again and will continue to do so. It's some of the finest Spring walking in Europe I reckon, and a 2 hour cheap flight away.

The tunnel makes Soller accessible but I do miss the days of the long snaking ascent and descent of the Col de Soller Road, which ensured that Soller was a lovely little quiet backwater, off the main touristy routes. That's progress, I suppose.

the Tramuntana was magical....lit up with different hues as the sun went up ....at times bordering on the surreal.....awesome sights while driving..fascinating tunnels to pass through..there is toll that you need to pay by cash or card.this was on the route that I took ...maybe not on others...if you're a good driver you'd definitely enjoy it...for others the drive might be a bit hairy...lovely stops on the way...when in Mallorca its a MUST DO!!.....it certainly does elevate you in so many ways

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"Drove through the mountains yesterday in our little hire car which did brilliantly well as the roads are fabulous (steep drop offs but tarmac smooth and well laid). This is stunning scenery but does make for a tiring day, especially the driver. We started in valldemossa (pretty town), drove through deia (very pretty but nowhere to stop and park!), soller, went down to fornalutz for lunch (picturesque traditional village) then carried on with a plan to carry on right up to pollenca and the peninsula but we had had enough before that sadly and tailed off to main roads around luc to drive back to our hotel. Wonderful scenery but lots of concentration needed and strong stomachs on very twisty roads, also so many cyclists and motorcyclists to be careful off plus coaches to negotiate with, enjoy it but take your time this needs a whole day.

No-one else in sight?
Don't mind 100ft sheer drop to the right!?
Do I have the place for you :)

We found this little gem by accident, didn't have the sat-nav running an thought 'I can find the way' well I couldn't - but glad I couldn't!!
Set your sat-nav for a road called Calle del Congre!
Drive right to the end - where the tarmac stops and the off-road part starts - keep going - DON'T look down :)
When you get to the end you're greeted with the most amazing views - no-one else in site and pictures to wow everyone back home.
I wish I'd taken my D-SLR and not just my iPhone.
We will be going back!
The road is not for the faint hearted though!
It's rough and VERY high!
Don't worry though loads of room to get a car up there.
If you're not sure park at the bottom and walk up there

Overall I'm giving it 9.5 OMG's out of 10 just for the views alone!

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"The mountain range in the north of Mallorca, Serra de Tramuntana, is composed of limestone weathered and worn by time, rain and wind plus the endless movements of the earths plates. For a walker they are a delight to traverse. For the casual day tripper they may offer a white knuckle ride up and down vertiginous switchbacks, around never ending hairpin bends, panoramic views and an ever changing scenery of plains, trees, wildlife and majestic peaks. Those mountain peaks are modest by European standards, Puig Major tops out at 1,447 m and there are several others just exceeding 1,000 m. The long distance path, the GR221 traverses the range and there are many other paths and tracks which offer superb walking opportunities. The mountains also shelter some of Mallorca's best villages and towns. Quiet delightful.

NB. The bus stop in palma is underground.
This was a more express bus. The one that goes through the mountains is a far more scenic ride (211) which we took on the return trip and was well worth it. The bus service was very easy to use although the bus that we took from valldemossa was 25 minutes late. You will need to check the timetables before you go as the buses are sporadic. But it is a fantastic day out for some amazing views of mollorca.

But no matter what part you visit you will have wonderful views of the mountains and the sea. My favorite part is Deia to Valdemossa, these are two of the most picturesque villages in the mountains and the road between is representative of the entire mountain road.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"I live on the east coast of Australia so we are spoilt for beaches with the white sandy beaches and great mountains for bush-walking.

What was great about Serra de Tramuntana was that there are gorgeous towns to stroll through spotted with beautiful coves for swimming or great hiking locations.

You can get to some of these towns like Valldemossa, Deia, soller from Palma via an air-conditioned bus for a 2-3 euros but you do need to check the timetable as there are long breaks around lunch time but you can relax. Driving is more flexible and the driver needs to be confident driving on narrow roads.

My favourite towns were Fornalutx and Valldemossa to visit. Cobble stone streets with galleries, little squares to have a coffee.
Rather than the gravelly beaches, the coves were more unique for me, so they were nicer to visit.

I loved staying in Deia as it was quiet and less touristy and they had a fantastic baker/store where you can buy beautiful hams, cheeses, wine, fruit etc plus a variety of restaurants that you can walk to. I'd check out Cala Deia in the morning to see if it was a nice day to swim and if not go off and do something else. Valldemossa or Fornalutx would make a great base as well. I stayed 6 days in Deia and 2 days in Valldemossa as I couldn't stay in the one place for the whole duration and did day trips to the various locations.

Hikers/walkers: a walk to the sa foradada and have lunch at the bottom, a walk along pollenca shore line under the leaning pine trees. It was quite hot in August so I avoided a lot of the hiking during noon.

Swimming: it depends if you like swimming or lying down to read a book etc. For the stunning coves Cala Deia (I think it has grown in popularity as it was the location for the Tv adaptation le Carre's The Night Manager, parking fee from 10?, with a cafe and restaurant, the conditions can vary depending on how windy it is), sa cobra (narrow road and there is a parking fee).

Town: Valldemossa, Fornalutx, soller in that order but I prefer the smaller towns. If it's a rainy day, a trip to Palma to do some gallery hopping might be an option as a break from driving.

Views: sa maroig and cap de Formentor.

Foodies: coco de Patata in Valldemossa a feather light sweet bread/pastry, ensaimada if you haven't tried it in Palma; there is a Michelin star restaurant in Deia but I didn't eat there.

History: I wasn't expecting much at Robert Graves but it gave me a brief history of what it was like in Majorca decades ago.

Other: look out for music, exhibitions that are organised around town.

Tip: I had an offline map called maps.me and it had all the hiking routes on there showing where the lookouts were. But I would recommend that you ask a local for a recommendation that suits your needs.

Start your trip visiting Port d' Andratx with a beautiful bay full of yachts and then proceed to the mountains. The scenery is amazing and you can make incredible pictures during the trip.

You'll also enjoy a stop at Valldemossa, a beautiful village with cobbled streets and and numerous cafes while a red-brick village Deia is more attractive from a distance.

We felt that it is not enough time to see all the beauty in one day - so many spectacular spots on the way. We'll definitely repeat the trip next time we are in Mallorca. We highly recommend a day in the mountains to everybody who would like to see the breathtaking beauty of the island.

We made our way along the winding roads to Soller, then jumped on the tram to Port de Solller (Tram is expensive! 6€ each for a single journey! But an enjoyable ride.) Had a wander along the promenade in the pretty port, then back on the tram, collected the car and drove through stunning scenery, with the mountains on one side, the turquoise sea on the other, eventually joining the very winding road to Cap Salobra. The hairpin bends took us to a car park from where we walked to see the Torrente de Pareis, which is beautiful and unique. As it was early evening, and also because the car park cost nearly 5 cents per minute (!!) we didn't stay long before we braved the hairpin bends again and drove back to our accommodation in Cala D'Or.

There (as in most of Mallorca) you need to pay for parking (7 euro); its a sandy strip of beach with pine trees inland. The water was beautiful, clean and clear. The beach gets crowded although we were eventually able to find a spot of sand to put down our towels.

You need to gauge all this carefully as you have to leave time to get back again! When we saw the beach that was at the end of the boat trip we didn't bother getting off the boat as it was very small and crowded with no umbrellas for any shade. However the boat ride itself is lovely and the rock formations and cliffs very interesting. We had a short stroll around Soller before our train took us back to Palma. A great day out.

If the beach is to hot head for the hills. Passing miles of olive plantations as you climb up the Tramuntana mountains the views are stunning.
If you have the opportunity visit the
Monastery at Lluk the peacefulness of the grounds and church is amazing.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"The best part of my visit in Mallorca after my friends' wedding!

The road is long and winding, narrow and curvy. At a few junctions, it did seem dangerous but we are back safe and sound now.

However the uphill and downhill drive along the Serra de Tramuntana was something which money cant buy!

Basically a repetitive cycle of (adrenaline rush+wow factor+gleefulness+eagerness+holding breath+violating camera snapshots)!!!

Let the pictures do the talking fellow adventurists.

The blue blue sea extends limitlessly and connects with the vast sky at the horizon.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,4.0,"Initially I was dubious about this trip with my 8 year old daughter and husband. I didn't see the attraction of sitting on a old wooden train for an hour with no toilet/ air conditioning and I was objectionable, & it seemed quite expensive.

My husband and daughter loved it, and I have to admit so did I, (kind of). BUT there is limited leg room. Some of the seats are hard wooden slated ones, others are padded leather. Its very popular and so busy. The train we took was 15.10, that gave us only an hour at Soller, we really needed longer there, otherwise we would have missed the last train back to Palma. Its Noisy. And the train is high and difficult to get onto. Enroute there are several long dark tunnels, and it goes at an angle / steep. (I found this strange, as British trains tend to stay horizontal). The train constantly judders !

The views and scenery are spectacular. The beach at the end is special. The shops and restaurants are great and the ice cream is a bit special.

I was constantly reminded 'its a train from 1912 !' It certainly give an appreciation of modern trains ! The connection with the trams work and there is time to find an ice cream between the two (just).

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"It's best to take at least a couple of days to see this area. The roads have to be shared with buses, cars, motorbikes and bicycles. The road surfaces are generally very good and the driving is not for the faint hearted with plenty of unprotected drops and dozens of hairpin bends, be prepared for reversing when meeting buses on the bends and narrow bits. The route Ma10 from Pollensa to Soller is an amazing driving experience but about half way I would recommend dropping down into Port Sa Calobra. This is a steep bendy narrow road and being a dead end has to be done both ways. Its also a popular mountain climb for cyclists. We met lots of buses and clclists so it's definitely not fast. The short walk to the Torrent de Pareis at Sa Calobra is worth doing and scenic break before you drive back up to the Ma10.
The Ma11 road from Soller to Bunyola takes in about 60 hairpin bends (not the new tunnel road) then the route to Orient and Alaro is well worth trying.
It's no use rushing any of this as there are plenty of places stop to eat and loads of good views.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,very scenic mountains and where these mountains meet the sea very often spectacular scenary. One of the things to see on Mallorca!,May 2016
Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"If you have hire car in Mallorca and want a good day trip then take a circular drive through the Serra de Tramuntana Mountains for some breathtaking views with beautiful villages and small towns. I recommend driving from Andratx to Port De Pollenca on the main ""coast road' via Banyalbufar, Calldemosa, Deia, Soller/Port de Soller, Lluc then Pollenca. Alternatively you could do this the opposite way round. The way back is to drive from Port De Pollenca to Andratx on the main roads and Motorway. It takes just over an hour on but the coast road will take most of the rest of the day.

I suggest stopping in Deia if you can find a parking place and have a wander up the steep climbs to the church which has great views or if you do not wish to be this energetic then try one of the small cafe's on the main road. You may have to park just outside the village and walk in.

The next stop should be Soller and/or Port Soller. If you fancy something different you could take the old tram between the centres of these villages.

After this head towards Lluc/Pollensa and you will quickly climb to some of the highest points on the road. If you fancy a good traditional Mallorcan meal you will find Mirador Ses Barques (see my review of this place) on the left side of the road with a large parking area on the front just as you go around a tight right hand bend. Even if you just stop for a quick drink then take in the spectacular views of both Soller way below and the mountains above.

After this you will pass a large reservoir just after the highest point on the island, Puig Major, which has a peak almost a mile above sea level. Its part of a military zone so you won't get any closer than the main road.

Carry on to Lluc which has an interesting Monastery.

The town of Pollenca is very mountainous and if you can find the centre of the town via the narrow lanes then you will find a pathway up many steps (100+) to the main church with more spectacular views.

In our view Port de Pollensa at the Northern end of the route is the islands most attractive seaside town and if you still have time then the the ride up to the old lighthouse which overlooks the bay and the Med for more spectacular far reaching views.

This will provide a very long and busy days. Alternatively split the journey into two days, first via the main road from Palma to Soller via a long tunnel or avoid the tunnel and take the switchback road over the mountains. This gets you to the same place but probably adds an hour and you will need a strong stomach as there are over 50 hairpin bends on the route. You can then head north or south and split the above journey over the two days.

Either way you won't regret it but make sure you leave enough time to take everything in.

One thing I would say is, be aware of random things, goats in the road, cyclists etc and be careful of the sharp bends!!! Sa Calobra is brilliant but can be bloody hairy at times!! My father in law is not so good in cars at the best of times, so this did test him!
Go later in the day, less cars on the road.

On reaching Sa Calobra we were amazed at the number of cyclists. There must have been in the hundreds as every minute or two another group arrived. At Sa Calobra do walk to the beach. It is a well defined path but the gorge that you reach is worth the short walk.

After lunch we set off up the most incredible zigzag road up and over the mountains with its numerous hairpin bends. There were hundreds of cyclists on the road which did not help with the narrow roads and traffic coming either way. I do not recommend driving this unless you are used to mountainous roads. However it is quite a feat of engineering and well worth the experience.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,4.0,"Sierra is mainly nature with hills, beaches turned to cultural landscape with terraces, farms, nice views. It is better preserved on an island than all around Mediterranean coast where towns, roads and industry changed similar landscape. First it is an example how you live with nature, how you preserve water, respect grain, fruit trees, olives, vine. It is something for old people in tour busses, something for people who want trips with bikes and especially for people who want partly preserved nature, nice views and people. More areas need to be protected and mass tourism pushed just in some parts, mainly villages, small towns and to the beach. Don’t rush. Read some guides in advance and find just some places for you and walk from one village or farm to another - far from main tourist attractions. If Mallorca is too far, you can find some similar cultural landscapes in Istria.

MA-10 is a twisty scenic road offering fantastic views from cliffs overlooking the Med. If you enjoy scenic drives, you will love this one. Lots of stopping points to get out and take photos, and lots of little villages to stop for lunch or a gelato.

With lots of stops for photos and lunch, it still only takes about six hours. You can either drive back to Palma at that point (an hour) or better yet, stay in Pollentia for the night and then head up to explore the NE section of the island with even more views.

I would take it as a quiet relaxing nature day, rather than going taking a picture and leaving. As what you are bout to experience is a nature day out.
Recommended, top sights in mallorca. Stop by Puerto de Soller for a nice lunch. Mirador Ses barques it is a really nice option also for lunch. good ViewPoint of the West Coast.

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"This might just be the most beautiful part of Mallorca! And probably one of the most beautiful regions I've ever seen in my life, too!
High mountains, daring cliffs and rocks rise from the sea, all along the north-western coast of the island. The view is spectacular, you will want to stop every 5 minutes to take pictures of the impressive landscape before your eyes.
The winding road can sometimes be very narrow, so make sure you're a good driver; Mallorca is full of rented cars and therefore, of drivers that don't really know, nor fully master their cars.
Everything starting from Valdemossa to Cap Formentor is a show of nature and I feel you can always discover new things. A real treasure!

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"The trip to the beach was terrifying but incredible as the roads were bendy and so close to the edge, but do NOT let that affect your journey the only reasons for us being terrified was because of driving on the right hand side of the road! The views are breath taking and one day I would like to try cycle along these roads. Along the way are some places you can park up and have a coffee and a snack. You can also park up to look at the view.

You walk through caves to get to the beach which were really cool and they are lit up so you can see. When you get to the beach you are surrounded by mountains, I recommend taking binoculars so you get a better view, might see bird of prey. The waves were as tall as us but we still went in and had a lot of fun going through the waves or under the waves !! A really good vibe at the beach, everyone was happy and having a good time.

This place is really worth going to!

Spain,Serra de Tramuntana,5.0,"We have Miss Nearly 2 and Miss 4mths so decided to break our trip into 2 days rather than one very long one. First day we drove over Bunyola from Sineu into Soller stopping at the fab Ecovinyassa and Fornalux and then over the mountains to Pollenca for dinner. If you stop and enjoy the various places it is a big big day in itself. A few days later we drove to Andrax and then up over the Ma-10 to Estellencs, Valdemossa and Deia ending in Soller. Again a big day in itself. There are loads of places and sights to stop at and enjoy so as someone else suggested dont drive blindly make sure you do a little research and work out what you'll be interested in and where youd like to make stops. We are very confident drivers but the roads are not for those who are nervous and passengers should try not to be whinging back seat drivers as it requires a lot of concentration for the driver. We went South to North both times but in retrospect for people taking pics it may be better going the other way as you have a sheer cliff all the way down. For those planning to cycle I take my hats off to you. There are literally hundreds of people making this adventure and Im sure its magical if you like pushing yourself to the limit. For drivers make sure you keep in mind there are coaches, cyclists, goats, sheep, deer and a two foot-hundred foot drop both sides of the road nearly the whole way. Dont let that put you off though its truly a magical corner of the world. I personally would do the driver if raining.

I repeated my climb of Massanella from last year and once again lost myself in the solitude and the scenery. Apart from two campers at Col d'Es Prat I saw no-one until well down the mountain after a start at daybreak. Although it was still mid-September, the summit was distinctly chilly.

It is a nature lover's paradise - I saw two of the area's Cinereous Vultures - Aegypius Monachus - and the summit was carpeted with tiny purple crocus like flowers. On the way down I was treated to the sight of a Pine Marten hunting in the undergrowth.

Then, as the road advances to the mountains, you can admire the terraces side dug into the hills to large surfaces that can be cultivated, the road finishes intoxicating do not know if you go back and forth (Road Serpent, built in 1932 by Antonio Paretti). In the highest point of the road a stop for pictures and orange juice drink.
In Ca Calobra you can go through two tunnels to Torrent de Pareis, a small beach with clear water and blue charming. From here we embark on a boat in the direction of Port de Soller. Navigate along the coast and admire steep banks, limestone and full of caves. At Port de Soller take tram timber after reaching the town of Soller train this change that has some Western Railroad, crosses 13 tunnels and lead us in the city of Palma.

Keep in mind that there is very little parking spot for so many cars and buses. So I would recommend you to go there in the morning or in the afternoon. However if you happened to be there during the day, just drive for another 10 minutes down and you'll get to one of the best beach in hole Island. Of cause that is just my opinion.
I personally took about 100 pictures, because the view from there is gorgeous. There is little store right by the parking lot where you can get some refreshments or souvenirs!

It is an exquisite journey on the western side of the island driving on the windy mountainside roads looking over the mountains, the sea and small hillside farming towns where time has stood still for centuries. We stopped for lunch at an AMAZING hillside restaurant called Ben D'Avall in Soller which was one of the highlights of our trip. It seems like it is in the middle of nowhere but the food is exquisite and the views breathtaking. We would've never found this restaurant on our own. We were pleased that we hired a private driver as we feel that our trip was complete and were able to see things that we would've missed had we tried to do it ourselves. All we had to do was suggest where we wanted to go and Alex of Mallorca Private Tours was extremely helpful in creating the perfect itinerary and was also timed perfectly. We were a family of three and had a private mini bus to ourselves with a customized cooler filled with drinks for one euro each (even the beer was a euro, this is a deal). Although Carlos was not an official tour guide, he took the extra time during the day to show us different sites along our route.

We were advised to take the early morning transit bus to the top of the hill to get there fresh and early for our 8:30am visit. We had no choice in the start time - there were only early morning tickets available for what was a 'festival' day (bank holiday). Starting so early (before dawn to make it for the allotted time), meant we were within the first dozen or so people through the gate.

Once finished at the palace - which was spectacular and incredibly well preserved and managed - we exited into the gardens and realised the complete madness of thousands and thousands of visitors throughout the rest of the grounds of the Alhambra and immediately were thankful that we had been amongst the first of the day to get into the palace. The rest of the visit, whilst inspiring and informative, was somewhat spoilt by the sheer numbers of other visitors admitted on that day. We had to queue to visit Generalife for about 40 minutes as by late morning the place was absolutely heaving. To be honest, whilst that area was equally spectacular, we did hurry through because we felt somewhat claustrophobic with the sheer numbers of people being pushed through, and whilst everyone was Covid-19-masked, we were happy to get back out into the gardens and for a bit of social distance.

All-in-all a great visit and not overly expensive. We also booked at only a few days’ notice and were able to make all the arrangements easily online.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"From the distance the Alhambra looks like a spectacular castle perched on a hill. That in itself is a sight to behold, especially with the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada Mountains or watching it change colours as the sunsets around it.

The true treasure of the Alhambra is the inside. There is so much more to the Alhambra than just being a fortress. Within the structure itself are other structures such as the Alcazaba, Royal Palaces, the serene Court of the Myrtles, the Partal Palace, Court of the Lions with an ornate fountain, and Hall of the Ambassadors with its stunning ceiling and the summer palace of Palacio de Generalife. Each building has its own unique character and attribute be it influenced by the Moors, Christians, Jews and the Europeans.

In addition to the buildings there are stunning gardens with a myriad of flowers, trees and birds, not to mention the odd cat or two seeking shade or water.

It’s impossible to take everything in so don’t try. Enjoy what you can and my advice is don’t be too obsessed trying to take a photo of everything. Every now and then put your camera down and just look around you, absorb your surroundings and later after your visit, reflect on what you have seen.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"What more could you say about this unbelievable piece of history, than has already been written. La Alhambra is absolutely stunning inside and out, the attention to detail as it was built over centuries is amazing. Each individual influence is apparent, yet blends together with all that came before it. I would highly recommend a guided tour because the history is so rich. It really made a difference to have an expert explain it's beauty as we toured around. Don't miss the palaces or the Generalife gardens!",Sep 2021
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Alhambra is wonderful. The palaces the churches the gardens are all excellent. But some advice to start. Book your ticket online as it gets very busy, if you want to go to Nasrid Palace this will have to be booked at a specific time - you can enter the gardens and surrounds at ANYTIME but you must adhere to the entry time for the Nasrid Palace which will be selected on your ticket. Mr H and I saw many people being turned away because they thought the time referred to entry to the entire site. You will queue for Nasrid Palace even though you have an allotted time so be aware that you need to join the queue approx 10 mins before your start time. There are lots of steps and uneven paths so not somewhere to go if you have any mobility issues. You do have to bring ID with you and you will be asked for this at entry to each site. Masks are mandatory inside but not outside although as it’s so busy you may feel more comfortable wearing it outside as well

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"The Alhambra - is SO OVERRATED. Our tour (SixThrills via VIATOR) got cancelled without us being notified, so we did this ourselves with audioguide. The audioguide was fine - but they make it so difficult for people who do the tours themselves like we did. Things are not well sign-posted - and just to buy tickets, they make you walk like a mile. There were passport-checks everywhere - slightly overboard and meaningless - we were checked passport about 7 times during the queing. Despite Covid, there was not a proper social distancing due to too many people being there - They are simply making money from tours and make things difficult for those of us who had no choice but to do the tour ourselves. It was like a zoo - too many people everywhere and can't really see anything. REAL ALCAZAR is so much better in my view - so much better run!!!

And kudos go to Maria Jose who helped organize our group and even took the extra step to walk us to the taxi stands.

Spain,The Alhambra,3.0,"A must see it is, amazing it is, tranquil it is, picturesque it is...its everything one could think of when visiting such history.

There are some serious negatives though, COVID-19 seems to have become an excuse for owners, operators. Having to show your ticket and Identification/Passport every single time you pass into a location is just pathetic - it becomes boring and frustrating.

Being told to put a mask on outside in the open air is something that is just ridiculous. Security in this place have lost the plot. All for wearing masks indoors to make those who want to feel comfortable, feel comfortable, but outside - pointless exercise. The place has become a control attraction, not a tourist attraction.

Advise, take the General Ticket Online. One time visit and that is it.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"First of all buy your ticket online. Then realize you must take the id with you that you got your ticket with; normally your passport. You will be asked for this at least 5 times. Realize that all of the entire complex to include Generallife must have that ticket to get in. You can see all of the places except the Nazarine (sp) anytime. The Nazarine entrance is your ticket time. We had a 1 pm time and got in line about 1235 and were about number 10. They will not let any 1 pm people in until 1pm and by that time at least 100 people were in line. I don't know how they processed through 2 sets of inspectors and still made the 1 pm slot. Any type of tour group has separate access. There are multiple places to buy snacks and hit the toilets during the entire visit which takes at leat 4-5 hours.

Spain,The Alhambra,2.0,"At first, the place is beautiful and impressive. So, why such a negative rating.

1) not child-friendly: we traveled with our 8months old son with buggy. Alhambra is not barrier-free. Many stairs and locations you can‘t visit with buggy. So we missed a lot.

2) mostly Spanish and unfriendly service: there is some young staff speaking English to guide you. But staff at the gates can‘t speak English. If you don‘t understand they just start shouting in Spanish.

3) mask obligation everywhere: you have to wear a mask the entire time. Even if no one is around or the guided tours do not respect this obligation you will be asked to follow this rule. If you carry a baby this could be annoying.

4) confusing organization: starting with tickets and entrance the whole experience ist not really comfortable. You have to show the tickets and or IDs several times. Sometimes two times to pass one gate. When you enter or leave a zone is not clear.

5) no map: there is no map with good oberview. Many visitors next to us had issues to understand where to go. We used Apple maps :/

Finally, parking fee was 7,20. Impressive.

Book tickets on-line as only a small number of people are allowed inside at the same time (enforced even more in these COVID times). Plus bring I.D. or you won't get in the various attractions.

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"In classically Spanish style, entrance into the Alhambra is massively over staffed, with a complete absence of organisation or individual capability. We arrived (my wife, 8 year old daughter and myself) in plenty of time to buy tickets to get in. My wife queued for around an hour- only one of us was allowed to queue while the others were asked to wait elsewhere. She bought tickets for us two adults and was told she did not need one for our 8 year old as they are free. We then queued to show the tickets. We then queued to show the tickets again. The second time we were told she did need a ticket, so please go back and queue to get one. We queued again. They had run out of tickets. We now had two tickets with no way to get our daughter in. We went to see customer services, who called the lady who could help, who called the man who could help. Turns out that none of them could help. We were then told we couldn’t return the tickets as they don’t refund. After going back to the ticket office and arguing for some time we did eventually get a refund. Long story short, no Alhambra, wasted morning. Please, please just put in a ticket machine and some clear signage - it would be more effective than the multitude of muppets wondering around posing.

He was very patient in answering all of our questions and had many stories to tell about this amazing fortress and its history. We were in awe many, many times, with an new surprise after each corner or passing through each new doorway.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"This is one of the most stunning fortresses in all of Moorish Spain, and perhaps in Islamic architecture overall all. We only had a few hours, but it's really worth a few days.

Unfortunately, COVID planning and some very odd Spanish bureaucracy have conspired to make this a very cumbersome, expensive, and irritating experience; so many gates, so many checkpoints, it's as if they don't trust the gate keepers just up the road to have looked at your tickets and compared to your passports. I'm sure there are all kinds of security issues at the site, but my sense is that a teenager could have done a better job of organizing the checkpoints and security than whatever security consulting company the government hired for this one.

Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,"This is interesting to see and most people like us come to Granada to see the Alhambra. We are glad we did so now we know exactly what it is. It isn’t on the same level as the Taj Mahal or Versailles, but it is worthwhile to see.

We took our time looking at everything and spent 4+ hours there. We bought our tickets online ahead of time and went at opening when it is cooler and the crowds haven’t moved in yet. Make sure if you used your passport to book your tickets that you have your passport on you. That is what they use to scan to let you enter. Have your QR code as well as the lady at the front asks to see both before you get to the check-in. Buy a General ticket so you can see everything. We had to show our passports several times to enter various parts of the complex. We did not have to go to a Ticketmaster machine to print out tickets like we had read. We went to the one in town, and the lady said we had what we needed already.We ordered them on the official website and printed out the QR codes. You also go to the Justice Gate Entrance if you have your tickets ahead of time.

There is art on display in two galleries on the Charles V’s Palace. The Alcazaba is best for a view from the top.

Enter the Palacios Nazarenes on the time for your ticket. That is the best part of the complex. After you see that, you can wander all over the complex to see everything else. The fountains and gardens are lovely as are the rooms with the decorative tiles .

The Generalife Gardens were beautiful. They are some of the best part of the entire complex.

There are a few gardens and water features that break up the flow of what is essentially a home design gallery tour of the palace. It is worth reading about the history beforehand for a better appreciation. It is recommended to use the local transport to visit and explore without a guide.

NOTHING!! Disgusting. I Cant think of any reason why No1 attraction in Spain doesn't have any information on display inside the Palace Or the Alcazebra telling you about it.

It is really nice especially the Gardens and Nasrid Palace, the palace has the old morish interior and the gardens were full in bloom with lots of roses and others. Took us 3 hours to visit the whole ALhambra. Parking was also easy this time but I can imagine that that will be horrible once the touirists are back in full force. Glad we have seen it now.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"I had wanted to visit the Alhambra for many years. I decided to visit in May 2021, while many tourists were not traveling due to COVID-19. This was an excellent decision, as I pretty much had the Alhambra all to myself (with the exception of the Nasrid Palaces, which had a fair number of visitors). I also stayed at the only hotel within the grounds of the Alhambra, so this really added to the feeling I was alone. I started my self-guided trek around the Generalife first, then to the Alcazaba, the Palace of Charles V, and finally the Nasrid Palaces. I did this over two days, which was I thought the ideal amount of time to see everything at a slow pace and really enjoy the surroundings.

Note the Nasrid Palaces is the only attraction that requires a timed ticket. For all other sites, you can come and go as you please. Also, if purchasing the general ticket, it's valid for a period of three days if I remember correctly, so you don't have to try and see all the sites in the same day.

I recommend visiting the Generalife first thing when it opens. As for the Nasrid Palaces, I imagine any time of day is fine (I went at 11:00). People are allowed entry in waves, but you can spend as much time as you like in any room once inside. If you're patient and attempting to take that perfect photo, simply wait for the next wave of people to pass through.

The beauty of the Alhambra cannot be understated, while the Nasrid Palaces are truly a wonder of the world. I spent hours in the Nasrid Palaces marveling at the architecture. Astonishing.

I would like to say kudos to the Staff. There are Staff hanging around near the Nasrid Palaces that ask you if you've purchased a ticket for the Nasrid Palaces and for what time. They are very courteous and genuinely interested to answer any of your questions.

There are a few souvenir shops between the Generalife entrance and the Palace of Charles V. There appeared to be a place that served snacks, but was closed (due to COVID, if I had to guess).

As others have noted, there aren't really signs explaining or describing the sites to you. I had no problem with this since I had a guidebook. For the Nasrid Palaces, many people were part of a group tour, so joining a group tour could be one source of information.

A superb example of Moorish architecture. Highly recommended. Apparently the Alhambra is the second most visited site in Europe (the Eiffel Tower the first, I believe), and for good reason!

All in all I was mesmerised by the sheer beauty and architecture of the place, with such great wrath of history it truly felt like you were in presence of greatness. There was so much to see and I spent around 8 hours in the Alhambra exploring all the fine beauty of the place. The most beautiful place in Alhambra was the court of the Myrtles and everyone was only allowed an allocated 30 minute time slot in this area as it was definitely the most preserved area with some of the finest architecture you will ever see.

TICKETS:
At the time we were planning our trip, I was unsure what to expect and the Alhambra tickets were a little confusing. In hindsight, the following things would have been helpful to know:

* Book online in advance because tickets and time slots sell out.
* Go through the official site so you don't pay middle-man fees.
* There are a number of different types of tickets but most people want the General Entrance ticket which gives you access to all the areas. This ticket should cost €14.85 pp (includes tax and booking fee)
* Entry to the Nasrid Palaces is done by time slot, which you choose when you book your ticket. However, this is the only area with timed entry. The Alcazabar, Generalife, Charles V Palace and museums are not timed. We did the Nasrid Palaces first. This worked really well. Booking an early time slot allows you to take as much time as you like inside the palaces. Everything else, you can see afterwards at your leisure, without the pressure of having to watch the clock.
* Do not miss your time slot. I can’t emphasise this enough. We met people on the day who had been late and they simply missed out. Be in the line at least 15 min before your entry time. From the main entry gate, you still have to make your way to the palace entrance where the line starts, next to Charles V Palace.
* No backpacks allowed into the Nasrid palaces so if you are bringing one, you’ll have to allow time to get to the locker rooms before lining up.
* You are told to bring a printed out copy of your online ticket (one copy for each person) and to bring ID (make sure it's the one you used to book your tickets). No-one checked our ID on the day but we did have to keep our tickets handy because we needed to show it more than once
* Some areas are free so if you miss out on a ticket, it is still worth going. However most of what you want to see (the Nasrid Palaces), will require a ticket.
* The museums are closed on Mondays

GETTING THERE: We walked from Plaza Nueva through the Alhambra forests. It was a lovely uphill walk that took about 15-20 min. The climb is steep but steady and brings you up to the Justice Gate, where you can enter the Alhambra complex. If you don’t already have a ticket, then you are better off going to the main gate instead.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Judging by the number of reviews, the Alhambra is the third attraction in Spain after the Sagrada Familia and the Prado among Tripadvisor readers. The red castle, as the name translates from Arabic, owes its early fame to the writer Irving Washington. His book Of the history of the Alhambra is sold on every corner in Granada. The downside of popularity was the problem of accessibility. The Alhambra is built as a model of Paradise for Muslims. And it's hard to get to heaven. I took it lightly, not booking tickets on the site, and we didn't get to any object other than the courtyard. In the evening, after booking a ticket, I was able to get to the Red castle in the morning, except for the Nasrid Palace. There are four objects of tourists ' desire and they are offered in different combinations. Nasrid Palace, Generalife gardens, Charles V Palace and Alcazaba fortress. The first one is the most difficult to access. Every half-hour, a certain number of visitors are launched, and tickets on the site are sold out first. This is the residence of the emirs of Granada, and the Myrtle courtyard is the most replicated photo of the Alhambra except for its perspective from the Mirador San Nicolas. Another replicated object is the hall of the ambassadors in the Comares Palace from which the Sultan and the guests left the court of the Myrtles. Court of the lions in the Lion's Palace. Animals are depicted here, which was forbidden by the Koran. This was due to the close ties of the Emirate of Granada with the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula before the rise to power of the Christian fundamentalists Isabella the Catholic and her equally extreme grandson Philip II. The cultural syncretism of the late Moorish culture is also visible in the wall paintings in the Hall of kings, which is also a violation of the canons of the Koran. It is interesting that the Emperor Charles V, who built the Palace of his name nearby, preferred to live in the Nasrid Palace. If you can't get to the Palace and see the Myrtle courtyard with your own eyes, you can replace the Partal gardens, which can be accessed directly from the Palace, and the Generalife gardens, which are generally located across the ravine from the Alhambra. The advantage of Generalife is that there I was able to take photos without tourists, similar to those in travel guides. But I came in the morning for the opening. This is theoretically impossible in the Nasrid Palace. Patio Acacia does not look as impressive as court of the Myrtles, but also very romantic. The fourth object is Alcazaba, which translates as""fortress"". This is the oldest building in the Alhambra. Nothing outstanding, but they go there for photos of Granada from the Watchtower and the Alhambra itself. However, the best photos of the red castle should be taken from Mirador San Nicolas from the mountain opposite. Which we did. Even twice.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"I visited very early in the morning. One of the most astonishing Palaces and feats of architecture I have ever seen. It is truly to see is to believe it. There isn't information to look at but each room is better than the last and the paintings inside and gardens surrounding it just leave you breathless. Your imagination runs wild -The views from the balcony are very memorable and absolutely beautiful. The gardens on the way to the Generallife estate are a real showcase of Andalucia landscaping. Just go, you can see why it's the most visited attraction in Andalucia if not Spain..",Oct 2020
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Having last visited in 2017, the requirement for your passport had slipped my mind - despite my partner querying it before we left the house. So, a bus back down to our base in the Albaicin, pick up those VERY necessary documents, another bus back up and we were off. Totally worth it, although it will be a long while before my partner stops reminding me of the error! The low levels of tourism mean that advance, individual tickets are available, which are very hard to come by in normal times. The palace, and gardens without the normal vast crowds of tourists, are truly amazing. To stand in the Court of Lions in the company of a single attendant is an experience that I am unlikely ever to repeat. The current crisis is, of course, a disaster for Spanish tourism and those dependant upon it. But the Alhambra has responded very effectively, and the one-way, socially-distanced, visiting arrangements are impeccable. This is a very hard time for very many, but the Alhambra without crowds is astonishingly beautiful.

I visited after 5pm which meant that by 8pm there was a fantastic sunset, especially from the Summer Palace!
I booked a guided tour, there were 7 of us and really worthwhile. Beware, we walked nearly 10km, which I enjoyed but some really struggled.
A fantastic monument to the Islamic history of Spain and Europe!

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"We went to the Alhambra today, what a disappointment. On reading it says that you can visit some of the attractions if you use a wheelchair. All I can say is they must never have tried it. There is so little accessible to someone in a wheelchair and some of what is would be extremely difficult using a manual chair, even with someone pushing you. Large cobbles and wheelchairs don't work. Lots of the other areas were so rough that if I wasn't closely watching where I was going, I got horrendous bumps, which hurt. Strangely because of this I wasn't able to see as much as I would have liked. Neither do 90° turns through narrow doors, with a standard lamp in the way 🥺, work in a wheelchair chair, by this time I was so upset I was close to tears and ready to leave.
Also there was a great lack of signs for information from start to finish.
I was surprised how few of the staff spoke anything but Spanish, and hubby and I speak some, yet still weren't understanding.
We saw around the gardens and 1 palace. The rest were inaccessible because of steps, yet we were still charged full admission.
Trying to get out of the disabled toilet near entrance took 3 attempts with directions from hubby and help of a mirror. Strangely I'm not mobile enough to be able to twist around in my wheelchair to see backwards.

We thought about visiting years ago, but thought it would just be to hilly and difficult with a manual chair. We thought today at least we have battery power for the hilly areas and suspension for the bumps 😱.

There was also a problem with our masks, but the sign only said you must be wearing a mask. We both were wearing a mask, but neither were acceptable, so we were given a different one. If you have a stipulation then state it.

For a place that is such a massive draw to Granada I'm so amazed at how bad the organisation is.

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"Be aware that no matter how far you drive or what ID you have with you access will be denied unless you are willing to carry your original passport to the venue in order to buy a ticket. (No copies allowed) according to confused and unhelpful staff, there is apparently no particular reason for the introduction of this draconian requirement beyond a non publicised local law. It is also worth mentioning that it is not necessary for you to present yourself with your original passport thereby validating this new demand, since only one family member may purchase tickets, so how ID has any value to the venue one cannot imagine.",Sep 2020
Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"You are required to present ID when purchasing tickets. This must be the only tourist site in the world with such an inexplicable requirement; it should hardly be surprising to the staff and local authorities that many visitors would arrive without the requisite forms of ID, as very few - if any - are likely to be aware of the unique requirement before arriving.

The information, ticket sales, and security staff are unhelpful, discourteous, and lack common sense. For example, they would not accept electronic copies of ID, when members of our group did not have the hard copies with them. We were therefore not allowed to purchase tickets.

The requirement for ID and the lack of common sense and courtesy amongst the staff will not help support tourism, which is an important part of the local economy - and particularly needed, given the impact of COVID.

The staff struggled to explain why ID is required - they suggested for ‘security reasons’, yet ask only one person to present IDs for all members of a group and do not actually check the IDs against each person. They also struggled to explain what forms of ID were acceptable. For example, it is unclear whether a non-Spanish driving licence would be acceptable.

Finally, the ID requirements may be illegal under GDPR etc, if, as the staff suggested, the documents would at some point be scanned (unclear when or how) and the details retained.

Once at the Alhambra they told us to run to the ""palacios Nazaries"", because we should be there at a specific time, but they were no signs. So from the indications we thought we have arrived there. Because there were no clear signs!!!!, we realised one hour later, where actually the ""Palacios Nazaries"" were, but they didnt let us to enter... although it was only 5 people on the cue. We could have paid the complete price of the ticket again and then we could have seen it... it felt like an strategy to make extra money from people that are a bit late.

There is no historical explanations at all, once you get to la Alhambra, unless you have been doing research before, you feel kind of lost, poor guidance. But there fore they controled our ID and ticket at least 4 times.

The complete complex is exceptional we do enjoy history so obviously it was a pleasure. We visited the Generalife last which was the right thing to do as there was quite a lot of shade which was welcome, we went on a day during midweek which meant it was not as busy as the weekend.

Yours and guides - book a group tour before you get there. Plenty of tour guides available but cheapest was 100 euros.
It says there are audio guides available- there are not! Probably COVID related but no signs inside at all. No literature available.
Download the app.. so after doing that at significant frustration with data and Wi-fi etc it was next to useless. It was only for the central palace and nowhere else. The audio was too long winded and terribly translated. Just sort it out.
On the positive... toilets well located and clean, little coffee/snack shop was lovely.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Granada’s Alhambra is a vast piece of history and an absolute must see. We visited during the coronavirus pandemic and it was quiet, no need to book tickets in advance. We walked up and got them straight away, you can buy from a ticket office or machine but only one person from the group is able to do this and they must have all ID documents as you have to enter your passport numbers and expiry dates. You have to book a time to enter the Nasrid palace, I suggest an hour after arrival so you can explore the north part, there are breathtaking views of the buildings and Granada from the gardens. We didn’t have a guide as we prefer to explore on our own. Audio guides were not available when we visited. I suggested taking a guide or at least your guide book, as there isn’t much signage of the history. This isn’t a religious site so there isn’t a dress code. In August there were lots of people in short shorts as it was very hot.

You do need a good few hours to see this properly. Make sure you take water and wear comfortable footwear. You need to be relatively fit if you wanna plan on walking the whole site and climbing the stairs. We spent around 4 hours inside. and your passport as they get checked at every point of the tour.

There are toilets and there are places to buy snacks though the gift shops close during siesta. We enjoyed a beer overlooking the Granada scenery.

Getting to/from Alhambra - there is a big car park and a bus from central Granada if you are based there. We stayed at Eurostar’s Washington Irving which was a great hotel and right next to the Alhambra. Highly recommended.

It was good that the Alhambra and the gardens was quiet, due to reduced visitors because of coronavirus. It meant we had plenty of time to see everything. Although the downside for visiting in July is high temperature, over 40° on the day that we went. After walking round for almost 3 hours, you certainly need a siesta! Fortunately there were water points at regular intervals. It was a bit much for out 7 year old. Mainly because there was a lot of walking in the hot sun.

however, it was very sensibly set up so that the most popular parts of the tour were not overrun by numbers of visitors - using time slots to make it less crowded. however, i would not like to be in the queue in the baking sun, while there is a large queue waiting to have passports checked.
we spend two days here, and didnt see everything. book your tickets early, and be sure when you want to see the nasrid palaces. we chose to go when it was baking outside, as it gave some respite from the sun.

Spain,The Alhambra,2.0,"We shouldn't have visited the Alhambra. The first sign came when we found out that my husband had bought tickets for the wrong date. I went on the website, and checked that there was availability for the correct date (several tickets available, in fact). As we do not speak Spanish well, we asked the receptionist at the hotel in Seville to help us, which he promptly did. There was no way, the attendant simply said that it was impossible to change the date of our admission or get a refund. But as it seemed like a must-see attraction (and as we imagined to be on the same level as Real Alcázar ...), we decided to buy new tickets. Even that was difficult, we tried with several credit cards but the purchase didn't work. After many attempts, we finally managed to buy, and the purchase process is very difficult, it seems that you are applying for something, you need to inform your document number, it almost gives the impression that you are getting a visa to enter some country. And I think we should have listened to the divine signs not to go to the Alhambra. Once there, only one person could enter with our documents with the attendant, because we needed to exchange the proof of purchase for tickets. And we couldn't lose those tickets after entering, because they were requested all the time! The gardens were not so beautiful because it was winter, and the staff were so unfriendly, I almost felt like an outlaw there. And there was a part that we needed to arrive on time, if we were late, we would not be admitted to the place, all of which ended up making the tour stressful and unpleasant. There were little shops selling souvenirs, and ice cream too. Ah, what a delight, at least something good in this place, I thought. I bought the ice cream and went out eating. When I went from one area to another, another attendant said that I couldn't have ice cream there. If I can't have ice cream, why do they sell ice cream ??? I got very upset and closed the lid of the cup and replied: okay, I'm not eating anymore !!!! And I quickly finished my tour, before my ice cream would melt, because at that point, I preferred the ice cream over the place. Super sorry, Real Alcázar is much better and you are not treated that way.

A ticket grants access for a particular date and time slot and latecomers will not be granted access. I strongly recommend tickets be purchased in advance as last minute tickets might not be available.

On my visit, they only checked tickets at the Nazaries and they didn’t at most other places. The Alhambra is wonderfully photogenic and there is a certain serene atmosphere. Be up top you get great views of the city and the mountains.

There are shops and restaurants nearby and I got some decent items from the local artisans. The Alhambra is about a 20 to 30 minute walk from the centre of Granada. It’s a fairly steep climb so pace yourself. Despite the crowds, I really enjoyed my visit.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"There is a reason why, even in January, you must make a reservation to enter this attraction. Overwhelming!! Beautiful!! Interesting history. We spent 5 hours- and it still was not enough to capture everything. Special shout out to the staff that keep the bathroom super clean!!!!I Thank you. I hope everyone is safe and healthy.",Jan 2020
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"No review is adequate to describe what is one of the most outstanding sites in the world. Beyond description really. So, all I can really offer are tips on how to experience the Alhambra. First, buy your timed tickets for the Nasrid prior to your visit. Enter at the Justice Gate which will bring you right to an audiotour rental spot (an absolute must!) and also position you for the queue to the palace. We had plenty of time to tour the Alcazar before entering the line. The audio tour can be set for 3 hours but this is NOT enough time. Plan to spend 5 hours total and don’t miss a thing! I would suggest packing a lunch – we did not as we were concerned about taking a backpack, but a small sack is fine and there are so many spectacular places to rest (you will need to), relax, and eat. BTW, if you are an idiot and leave your phone – simply, race back thinking your entire vacation is ruined, and find a smiling guard who has your phone!

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"What more can said about this amazing iconic site that that has not already been repeated so many times in countless reviews!?! This complex, which dates back to 889 AD, is comprised of palaces, fortified walls, gardens and other interesting things to see. The key to visiting this site is really luck of the draw. Tickets are ordered for certain dates and times and they are provided to visitors with specific date and time restrictions. Sometimes the tickets only allow access to certain areas. I visited with a small group and was fortunate enough to have a ticket that allowed access to all of the palaces as well as the gardens. It was a long day with lots of walking, but well worth every step!

Note that there are entry controls for certain areas and occasionally visitors will be randomly selected and must provide a copy of their passport picture page. This must correspond with the name on the ticket. However, this really poses no inconvenience to visitors and is an efficient way to avoid ticket fraud schemes.

It was fascinating to see the Christian, Moorish and Muslim influences throughout the landscaping and building architecture as well as the gardens. The most prominent influences throughout the palaces are the Muslim influences; the most obvious examples are the selections from the Holy Koran which are engraved on palace walls.

A highlight of the visit was spending time in the Charles V Palace open air courtyard. There was a piano available for anyone to play and a lovely wedding couple took advantage of the open space to have photographs taken and enjoy a dance. These are the type of unpredictable “happenings” that make La Alhambra such an exhilarating experience.

Just remember to be prepared to walk and be on time! Also, cross your fingers and hope for the all access pass. This is sure to be an awe-inspiring life experience.

There is so much to see here, spread over a large area and I was quite relieved that we didn’t visit the palace.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Alhambra really is a beautiful site to see and feel.
Much of it is well preserved and the intense feeling of peace and meditation is remarkable.
I found it a truly spiritual place, even though it was primarily a military fortress and a residential Palace.
The gardens and water engineering are a work of art.

Difficult not to be moved by the heart,blood & soul that went into its construction and the many who spent their entire lives building it.

A truly spectacular setting with the Sierra Nevada mountains as a backdrop.

If you do an organised tour make sure to allow plenty of time to explore it on your own. A rushed all-inclusive tour with a pack of other tourists is not recommended.

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"Drove two hours to visit, particularly wanted to see the gardens. Our group of six was denied entry to the ticket counter because two of us did not have photo ID. We were not told the reason for this rule but that we should have checked the website first. We didn’t visit the website because three of us had visited before and recommended it to the rest of us. We argued that there should be notices of this new rule at the entrance so that we could have avoided the car parking charges. So we left and we weren’t the only ones disappointed. They must have lost some money that day and probably do every day.
Checked with our holiday rep the next day and was told that you have to book the tickets online because of people selling them on at a profit and to collect them you need photo ID because the ticket has your name on it.
What a crazy system! We were treated like terrorists when all we wanted to do was walk around the gardens. These people don’t deserve our money and I certainly wouldn’t go back and I definitely would not recommend this tourist attraction to other tourists!!

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,I stupidly bought a Viator tour of the Alhambra but too late realised it did not include the Nazrid palace which is the best bit. Unbelievable to charge 39 euros pp when a regular entry ticket to the whole complex cost 9 euros (seniors but still much cheaper). We tried to go there in 2019 but were turned away but it was too crowded but this year it was not because of Coronavirus. So in normal times book ahead direct and if you do want a guided tour make sure it includes the Nazrid palace. Fortunately they had to alter my ticket time so I got a partial refund as i couldn’t make the times. But instead of emailing me the entry ticket the small print said to go pick up tickets in the city.,Mar 2020

Very little is open to visiting without a ticket so it's important. That being said, its' very much worth doing so! The grounds and gardends are beautiful, the setting high on the hill is amazing, and the Moorish palace is a walk back in time 1200 years. Visit the old fort and imagine it with the interior village populated, and soldiers in the ramparts guarding the palace and grounds. Truly an amazing place!",Mar 2020

Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,"Beautiful place with great views over Granada. Keep checking the official website for tickets - none were available initially, but we managed to get some a couple of weeks before our trip, much cheaper than a guided tour and you can move around at your own pace. Note that the timed entry is for the Nazrid palaces, not the main entry point - allow at least 30 mins to walk from entry pavilion to palaces. It wasn’t too crowded although tickets were sold out on the day of our visit. I downloaded an audio guide from the official website to my phone, but this didn’t work at all well - it would not play in the background, if I wanted to take a photo or lock my phone it stopped playing!! Disappointing, so if visiting again I would hire an audio guide, although this means having to carry around another item. Not many places to buy food and drinks so best to take some with you.

I was disappointed to find all the tickets had already sold out on the official website for the whole of March so we bought a Granada card. This is 40 euros but it gives you a time for the palace as well as other attractions in Granada so if you are planning to be there for a few days it is worth buying.
I was happy to pay just to see the palace, it was everything I thought it would be and once you are in you can spend as much time as you like wandering about.",Mar 2020
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Wow, wow, wow. It's an amazing site to visit. We took the audio guide which is well worth the 6 euro cost per person, so much info provide and you can stop listening when you wish.

We're not usually slow visitors but we were here for over 4 hours. We arrived at 8:30, had Nasrid palace tickets for 9:00, and it really gets busy later in the morning. You can purchase coffee, water, snacks at a couple of spots on the premise. There are washrooms available near the entrance to Nasrid Palace and at the main entrance.

We printed our tickets but you can also use your phone for scanning. You need to show your ticket and have it scanned at each major site within the property. It appears you can only enter once per location. We entered the justice gates, they don't scan your ticket at this entrance but seem to do so at the main entrance where we exited.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Nasrid rulers utilized the peacefulness of sight, sound, and the cooling qualities of water integral in the design of the Alhambra. Rills of water, funneled from gravity, flow through aqueducts into the Patio de la Acequia and medieval fountains, serving many uses at the Alhambra. The Alhambra’s impressive Court of the Myrtles and the Partal Palace were two such important features benefitting from this water. The reflecting pool in the Partal Palace with the spectacular mirrored image of the Tower of Comares, created a look of a floating palace which served to impress political visitors.
The architecture here seemed to focus on elegance rather than grandeur. We found examples of the elaborate filagree and intricate details that escaped the repairs in some of the Nasrid Palaces. I especially enjoyed the elaborate muqarnas stalactite stonework with downward projecting stalactites on the underside of some of the arches. In the Hall of the Abencerrajes, I craned my neck up for a long time looking at the beautiful example of the archetypal Islamic muqarnas or (mocarabe), ornamented vaulted ceiling, that looked to me like a fragile honeycomb, despite the fact that it was made of stone. I later learned that some of the stalactites were hung to hide elements of construction.
Islamic art is known for its elaborately detailed repetitive designs. Because the Islamic culture doesn’t accept the depiction of human or animal images in their art, instead, throughout the Alhambra complex, there are about 10,000 inscriptions in calligraphy as well as plant motifs beautifully carved in stone. Examples I was given are “Eternity is an attribute of God” and “Depart in goodness since it is God who helps” The last inscription I saw says it all, “Nothing in life could be more cruel than to be blind in Granada”. True enough.
At the end of Islamic rule, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand briefly took occupancy of the Alhambra, followed by Charles V, who ruled Spain as Charles I. Sadly King Charles ordered the destruction of part of the complex to build a Renaissance-style palace for himself calling it the Charles V Palace. The contrast between the beautifully ornate and intricate Islamic designs with the austere and cold harsh rooms of Charles V was startling.
True to the period’s domination of Catholicism, the Santa Maria Catholic church was built on the ruins of a great mosque in the complex. It had a spire and cross that was intended to be higher than any of the Arab structures, thus dominating the Islamic setting.
After our tour I ran into the gift shop at Real de la Alhambra. It was well worth my stop. I bought one of my now favorite Christmas ornaments there. With its unique blue and white Islamic designs, it will be a lasting memory of this amazing place.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"We wound up our trip to Seville, Cordoba and Granada by visiting the Alhambra and Generalife Gardens. This ""walled city"" was truly amazing. Stunning architecture across hundreds of years tell a great story of the Moorish (Islamic) rule that was subsequently reconquered by the Spanish Christians (Catholics). I'm sure other reviews will go into detail about various aspects of the Alhambra, however I want to add a note on our thoughts of how to see this treasure.

Ideally, I would have visited the Alhambra and Generalife Gardens over TWO days. The first day I would have taken a guided tour to get an overview and nuances of the grounds. Then I would come back the second day and tour on my own using the AudioTour which is inexpensive and quite good. We only had one day to devote to the Alhambra so we just did the AudioTour and I was very happy with that decision. In particular, my observation was that tour groups only saw portions of the Royal Palace and other parts of the Alhambra, which is understandable as you could easily spend all day there (we spent 5.5 hours all together walking the grounds ourselves and using the AudioTour). Consequently, if you only have one day for the Alhambra, I would recommend that you use the AudioTour and stroll on your own.

If you do decide to tour the Alhambra on your own, BOOK YOUR TICKETS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE!!! Tickets sell out months in advance (seriously!!). We booked our tickets two months out and got the last time slot available on our second choice of days. I think that tour operators must take a lot the tickets as it looked like it was pretty easy to get a guided tour on somewhat short notice (i.e. at least a week in advance of your visit), but then you are committed to a group tour.

I would absolutely get there as early as you can. We had an 08:30 entry and, even though we didn't have a choice as that was the last slot available to us when we booked, that was absolutely the best time as covering the grounds definitely takes the better part of the day.

Finally, I would also book your AudioTour on line to save a bit of time when you get there. HOWEVER, I would use the handheld devices they have at the Alhambra as opposed to downloading the tour on your phone. The phone version was full of bugs and didn't operate correctly.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Definitely a palace to visit, good value for money and worth the hassle of the cumbersome ticket purchase process.
In the UK I looked at the official website to buy tickets and found that tickets for the 4 weeks of late Feb/March were sold out. Once in Spain, I looked again and found that tickets get released for the next couple of days at a time.
The website insists that if bought online, you must print the ticket yourself on paper and take it with you. No, this is not correct. I bought tickets online through the official website, chose a specific entry time, entered the passport details of each visitor (mandatory input) and paid online.
At the Alhambra, there is very little signage, so ask to be directed to a queue, and then be allowed to move on to the ticket office where you show your passport again and ticket purchase email, at which point they give you paper tickets. You cannot get into the Alhambra Palace by showing your email ticket, they insist upon a paper ticket.
Once inside, the palace interior and outside gardens are amazing. So, understand the ticket process, give yourself at least an hour before your chosen entry time to go through the ticket process and have a wonderful experience.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Alhambra and all it’s beautiful sights and locations is a bit to be missed item on any trip to Granada or Spain in fact! It was just gorgeous to walk through the gardens and grounds (which you can do in part for free) but it’s certainly well worth the ticket (around $50 AUD for the two of us) so as you get access to all areas. Highlight was definitely Nasrid palace which is the one you have to be on time for! You book your ticket at a time to enter the Nasrid palace. Our advice is to go early and do that first, then you have the rest of the time to explore without the need to rush back. It took us around 4 -4.5 hours. We didn’t get the audio tour (6£) because we wanted just to wander and from speaking to a fellow Aussie it ain’t help navigate the way round more, just of course gives you the details of what you’re seeing. Best way is just to follow the crowd/ open an ear to a tour guide (!). Well worth the walk and the time. Stunning.

We were lucky on this trip since i ended up snatching up the last four tickets in the window we were there. What a magnificent place! If you plan on visiting, make sure to plan the whole day to see it all. The grounds are massive and we didn’t even get to see all of the gardens or the museum. Also good to take a taxi or bus up to the top to save your energy for the grounds and then you can walk down. We were a bit confused but you have to go the Nasrid palace first by the time listed on your ticket. You can visit the other sites at any time. Even with assigned time, we waited in line for about 40 minutes to get into Nasrid place. Good to go the the bathroom before hands since we didn’t see any inside the palace grounds. It really is a spectacular place to visit. So much detail in the architecture and decorations. Will have to come back to see what we didn’t finish.

Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,"The site is amazing. Quickly some practicalities: Is a little hike up from the town, so be prepared. Comfy shoes a must. Little bit chilly in the winter, I’ve heard exceptionally hot in the summer. Not much in the way of food/drink on offer (you can take stuff in your bag). Ordering tickets in advance is the best idea, but they release more online the day before, so don’t despair of you haven’t done it early enough. There are three main sections: the Nasrid palaces, the Alcazar (fortresses) and the generalife (gardens). The ticket grants you access to the palace at a specific time: we were told by the audioguide last to get in the queue five minutes before, which was fine (in February, I don’t know if it’s worse at other times, but it didn’t seem like you had to be there any earlier).
The downside to me was the lack of storytelling. There are very few information plaques anywhere, so the audioguide is essential. Unfortunately, the audioguide is a bit bland (“this was built by x in year y”) rather than really highlighting the significance. You might be best to get a tour guide? At the very least, spend 30 minutes reading up on a few things online before you go.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"I was initially ticked off that I couldn't buy tickets for individual independent visits (unless I wanted to wait two months) and had to buy 39€ guided tour tickets. (Twenty years ago, during Holy Week, I was able to buy an independent visit ticket the day I arrived.) The guided tour was so much better than my prior independent visit. The guide, Carmen, explained what we were seeing clearly and concisely. So, instead of needing to keep reading a brochure, we could just enjoy being in and seeing the Alhambra, as well as photographing everything we wanted. The guide's timing was excellent, except that she took her departure without waiting to be tipped! NB: tickets are checked about three times during the visit, and on days of heightened security, the guards can insist on checking the names on your tickets against your passports or other ID. No ID can mean no entry. So bring your tickets AND your passport or ID.

Entry is timed and you really do need to get there at least half an hour before your entry time since you have to get from the parking lot down to the entry point which is about a 10 minute walk if you don't stop to take pictures. You can easily spend a few hours roaming around the property. Have lunch in their cafeteria for a break during your visit. Really good food.,Feb 2020

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"If you came all the way down to Granada, the iconic ""La Alhambra"" is probably the main focus of your journey to this beautiful city. So much has been already written about the fortresses and palaces, that I'll only say the basic: 1) book your ""full"" ticket (including the Nasrid Palaces) way in advance, as visiting tickets to the ""Nasrid Palaces"" are quite limited, due literally to space availability and monument preserving from huge crowds; 2) bring your original passport as showing it will be required at the ""Pabellón de Acceso"" (Entrance Gate); and 3) ""La Alhambra"" means ""The Red One"" and the construction of a fortress on the remains of old Roman fortifications, by the first Arab Sultans of the Emirate of Granada, started in 889 AD (the actual ""Alcazaba""). Much later, around the 14th century and onwards, some magnificent palaces were built and we came to ""La Alhambra"", as it is more or less like today - an awesome complex of fortresses and royal palaces. In 1984, Unesco appointed ""La Alhambra y Generalife"" as World Heritage Sites. Can you still miss it? Enjoy!

We booked our tickets online, a few months prior to our arrival. I would recommend booking early as I have had friends who left it late and then were unable to book any tickets.

I found a tour guide very good, informative and useful and would recommend it.

Be prepared for a lot of walking along cobbled streets, comfy walking footwear is a must.

I would recommend booking Nasrid Palace & Generalife with the tour too.

Together with Cordoba it gives a valuable insight into north Arab settlements in Spain and its impact on Spain. We visited the site in January which had the advantage of less crowds, but is was cold.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,I shouldn't think anyone visits Granada without visiting The Alhambra. It is simply A Must. Stunning architecture and Gardens .

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Even in January there were many visitors, as you might imagine, so that distracts a bit from the experience, but overall, I am so glad I visited this place. I chose to walk from down below in Granada and it was quite the uphill hike and early in the morning, there were very few people out as I walked up a road through a lonely park setting. But I made it. I had a timed ticket that I purchased online directly from the Alhambra website for the Nasrid Palace which also gave you entry to everything else. I chose a self-tour so I could just absorb whatever I wanted to. It was architecturally divine and full of windows looking onto gardens of orange trees loaded with fruit and flowers (in January!) The tile work, pools and fountains were lovely. The rooms are empty of furnishings and it would have been nice to see it all furnished like it might have been when it was lived in to get a feel for what it was really like. I peeked into Carlos's palace, but it didn't do much for me. Then wandered over to Generalife...quite a long walk, with gardens that go on and on and on. The views, wonderful.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"This was one of the best trips I had taken with my husband and daughter. Pictures didnt do it justice and the amazing Islamic history of the Nasrid palace will mesmerize you. Give yourself time to explore each section of Alhambra but keep in mind that once you explore one section you may not explore it again save for one or two places. We booked our tickets a few months in advance and chose our Nasrid palace time in the afternoon. Looking back I would have liked to visit it in the morning instead and taken my time visiting the rest of the palace.

We had a lightweight umbrella stroller for my daughter. There were cobblestones in many of the roads and walkways so just make sure that your stroller is able to handle that. Strollers are not allowed in Nasrid palace. They have a place to park the stroller and get a baby wrap. For lunch, we ate at the cafe in the hotel located inside the Alhambra. Not the best food but it was easier then walking all the way out and coming back in again.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Every tourist town has a place that's ""can't miss."" Whether or not that place is worth it is more often than not up for debate. In Granada, the Alhambra is that place, but in this case, there's no debate to be had. It's absolutely worth your time and money, and you can't call a visit to the city complete without it.

Not only is the Alhambra full of history and beauty, it has some fascinating architecture and provides a great look and what life used to be like here. Our guide was charming and knowledgeable, and we received plenty of factoids and insights that really brought the fortress and gardens to life. It really is a terrific experience and one you can't miss!

Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,"I visited solo during mid February which I think is quite a good time to go as there are fewer people and the sun is welcoming but not burning a hole in you as it would in the summer months. However, it does mean there seems to be less in the way of floral displays than one would imagine during the summer. It is a UNESCO heritage site and the buildings and gardens are superbly well kept. Inside the Alhambra, in the old convent of San Fransico, there is a Parador, one of Spain's 5-star heritage hotels, so if you were a culture vulture, you could get to live on top of the action, so to speak. The experience involves a fair bit of walking and stair climbing but once you're on top of one of the towers, the view of Granada and of the Sierra Nevada is breathtaking! It wasn't expensive - 7 euro to get in. You could easily spend all day there, but after 3 hours, I'd seen enough. There are plenty of shops and cafes on-site so you can quell hunger pangs and nothing is particularly expensive. Parking wasn't too bad. I paid just over 5 euro for about 3 hours. Plenty of museums, if that's your thing, so come early. Staff generally speak English and are helpful. There are quite a few ticket and security checks and barriers to be encountered inside the site as well as on entering, so take your passport and/or driving license, or you probably won't be able to get a ticket in the first place. Also, there's a no backpack rule, so take only what will fit in your pockets. Currently, the site closes at 6pm, though that might be later in summer months. Was I blown away with it? No, not quite. I was expecting something more exotic and although there are a lot of examples of Islamic art and architecture, the buildings have more of a Roman/Spanish flavour. However, it's worth a visit, definitely.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"We arrived in Granada in July and thought we could just select any day we wanted and go see the Alhambra. We were told by the hotel that usually people book the site 3 months in advance, so we'd have little chance of seeing it---- unless----we went online on the Alhambra site at 12 am midnight when unused, last -minute tickets are sold. We did that and to our surprise, we managed to get 2 tickets. We visited the site the very next day and, instead of going directly to the palace, we strolled through the gardens and fortress first and then went to stand in a long line to enter the palace. Little did we know that the time cited on our ticket was for entry into the palace itself and not for the gardens. Not knowing this, we waited for 1 hour in line and when we arrived at the gatekeeper to the palace, we were told emphatically that we were too late (about 1 1/2 hrs. late since we had visited the gardens first) We were turned away and could not enter the Alhambra. We talked to the manager and pleaded our case to anyone who would listen, but it was to no avail. The time on the ticket is the time to enter the palace. We just couldn't go home dissatisfied and without seeing this magnificent site, so we repeated what we had done the night before and went online at midnight once again and managed to get 2 tickets. The next day, we went to the Alhambra at the designated time and waited in a long line once again. This time, we did not visit the gardens first, but instead, observed the exact time on the ticket and we made it! We were allowed entrance. So we learned a good lesson, but had to pay twice and visit the site twice! The moral of the story is to observe the time on the ticket because this tells you when you may gain entrance to the building. Stroll the gardens afterwards. The gatekeepers are strict and the rules are not bent for anyone.

There are signs for other tour operators nearby but they are all different providers not this one apparently.

Best time to go is between November and February as the crowds are not too large. If you are in this part of Spain then this is a MUST visit. You will not be disappointed.

The only thing I thought was not quite right was the marble slabs put down as flooring in the Court of Lions. It did not look right, far too modern, whereas the whole of the rest of the Alhambra was beautiful with so much thought going in to all the detail, that the marble was like a smack in the face. Another little tower in the Partal housed some of the most spectacular features, and was nearly missed by us, but, luckily, not! Definitely worth seeing, and should be on everyone's bucket list.

We found driving there from Nerja to be easy - very good road and about 1 hour 20 minutes. We drove into car park 5 - mistake. No one there to ask way. Went on to cemetery - mistake. You must head for car parks 1 to 4. We ended up in car park 2 (1 seemed to be closed).About 6 steps then level to entrance to exchange booking form for ticket (about 50 yards). We borrowed a wheelchair - arm was broken and broken arm got caught in wheel and had to be held away from wheel - awkward but possible. The accessible route is only feasible if you can walk part of way over cobbles and on inclines and partner can push a heavy wheelchair a long way - I managed it. Alhambra should have an electric buggy to take less mobile people from entrance to Nasrid palaces. Also needs a slope up to Generalife . Also need to be able to leave wheel chair at entry points to buildings for those able to walk round buildings but not walk whole way. The arrangement at the Nasrid palaces worked well. We were taken with wheelchair to separate accessible entrance and able to go round all 3 palaces.

The buildings are in excellent condition as the Spanish King who defeated the Muslim rulers of the city decided not to destroy the buildings as is usual in a conquest so much of the beauty remains, even some areas of wall paintings. It can be visited at any time of the year- we went in January so not too hot, our guide recommended April/May when the gardens are in full bloom. A long day trip, but, oh, so worth it!

It is something you do NOT want to miss, and I would allow the entire day to see it completely, and at an enjoyable pace. Buying tickets far in advance is a must... I waited till about a month prior to my visit, thinking it was February, right? Both weekend days were sold out, but I kept checking in and eventually someone apparently returned a ticket. I’m sure having a guided tour adds context, but I enjoyed being able to stop and enjoy rooms as I wanted, sitting down in various places to rest, etc. The architecture/history museum inside the King Carlos Palace is well worth some time- an exceptional collection. You also want to make time for the Generalife and it’s gardens. Because I had allowed the entire day, I had time for a fabulous lunch on the terrace at the Parador Hotel, overlooking the Generalife. This really is a unique and wonderful place- don’t try to rush!

Well, we were told that we would only be able to go in the evening. It was wonderful, and we saw a little of the outside while it was still light outdoors, but we entered just as the sun was setting. This tour had some very different advantages. The photos at this time of the early evening captured gorgeous views of Granada from above the city at sunset. The highlighted areas everywhere inside were dramatic and again, some really stunning photos as you might imagine. We had the whole place to ourselves, plenty of time, not rushed at all, and our guide was excellent. Loved everything and would recommend a night visit. My only main disappointment was that I wish we could go back again and see everything during the day also. This is true with many places of this caliber, and sometimes it works out and sometimes not. So, you either go during the day and if you can, go also in the evening. But definitely go to either, whatever works best, just make sure you don't miss it when visiting Granada, Spain.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Alhambra is for many #1 reason to tome to Granada. However there’s so much to see that nearly 3 days kills your legs.

Some websites stay that it is only possible to visit Alhambra with a guide. Not true.

In late January (2020) it was still low season but the place was packed.

The guided tour was supposed to be in English - again not true.

It was mixed Spanish and English, the Spanish overtaking the English explanations. (I know both languages so I can tell).

The tour took exactly 3 hours as advertised but the place is huge and one could easily take it much slower and admire the wonderful views from palaces and the ornate inner courtyards.

The three hour tour of Alhambra and Generalife was so hurried that we indeed wanted to go back to see the places in a different light. This again is not possible. Or you can return from the Gereralife gardens to the main palace area but you cannot access the same places again with the ticket. Second issue is that if you decide to go back to Alhambra area you cannot exit anymore from the main entrance exit area as there is ticket inspection from Alhambra to Generalife direction. There is another exit they you have to use.

My recommendation:

if you want time for taking pictures and spending time in the most magnificent palaces and gardens buy individual tickets.

If you want guided tour opt for the audio guide which costs 6 eur to hire.

Ticket prices are ridiculously high and I think even the individual tickets need to be bought well in advance (in busier seasons It means months.)

There is a dubious bonus for guided tours: you may skip the lines. But in January there were no of very short lines for individuals while there were many more groups / guided tours thus having to wait longer time. If you are with the guided group you have to stay wit it at all times. You cannot stay longer even if you wished. The guide sets the pace and it is two seconds stop and the you go to next place.

As a last thing against these guided tours: the audio guides used are of very bad quality (if you are 10 metres from the guide it’s just white noice)

If you walk up the hill from Plaza Nueva come to the same place you have walked 10,2 km.

Buildings are still magnificent!

Spain,The Alhambra,2.0,"I had seen many fantastic pictures of the Alhambra, I know the history behind it and I looked forward to seeing it. Big disappointment, and the pictures must have been from somewhere else, made at night with artificial professional lighting or Photoshopped.
Don't got there if you have problems walking, there are no handicap p-places and you may have to walk half a mile just to get at the entrance. Wheelchair ? Forget it altogether.Even booking and buying in advance wont't get you a ticket, it gives you a voucher which has to be changed for at ticket at arrival. At the ticket office you ar met with a rope, which is opened by two guards when you show your voucher and passport. The queuing system is ridiculous, they create queus and congestion, and I'd recommend they hire someone who at least once browsed through a leaflet from a logistics education to improve it. There are oceans of room for improvement.
Historical information is very limited once inside, our garden looks better, and as mentioned they create crowds. It also beats me why they consequently use the word ""Moorish"", when the correct is ""Islamic"".
The coffee shop outside to the right of the entrance? Forget it, expensive is not the correct word, the correct word has seven letters and begins with R.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"In AD889 a small fortress was built on the remains of a Roman settlement; This was rebuilt by Yusef the First in 1333. (Moors occupation). In 1492 it became the Catholic Royal Palace (Moors were driven out) and in 1526 Carlos V commissioned the construction of his Royal Palace. If you want to know more, search for Alhambra on Wikipedia, etc. loads of historical info there.
Now, the MUST DO hints.

After the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, the Alhambra is the most visited Spanish jewel, which means it gets very BUSY! So;

BUY your ticket online as early as you can before travel. I saw people get turned away from the ticket office on our day of visit. They were VERY disappointed.

The earlier you buy your ticket, the better your chance of having your preferred time to visit the Nasrid Palaces (Moors occupation period). You MUST attend the Nasrid palaces at the stated time -or miss out-. Only a limited number of visitors are allowed at any given time.

Your ticket and your passport (or identity document) must be carried on your person at all times and your ticket will be scanned at entry (where you will see long queues of visitors at the ticket office, if you have you ticket, skip this queue and go straight in), at the Nasrid Palaces, at Carlos V castle and the Alcazaba fortress. Each of these destinations WILL have queues, another reason to time your visit for EARLY. And; your tickets will be scanned again before you are allowed to enter.

Backpacks; take SMALL ones or none. In the Nasrid Palaces you must carry it on your chest to avoid damaging the architecture (another reason they limit the number of simultaneous visitors).

Take plenty of water! we visited in September - late summer / Autumn - and it was around 30 degrees outside! There is a bar halfway between the Carlos V castle and the Alcazaba Fortress and they sell water also.

The Alcazaba Fortress is a strenuous excercise if you are unfit and the steps on the many stairs are both higher than normal and very worn in places.

Oh, and the maps! There are many maps scattered around the entire complex and most do not show NORTH! We are used to maps having North at the top; nope, not in Spain, or Greece! Use your phone's compass to find it!

So, we hope you will visit this excellent location and enjoy it!

Spain,The Alhambra,3.0,"First things first, it’s the Alhambra, it’s mind blowing and a wonderful highlight.

It really wouldn’t take much to make this a five star review but...

The staff go out of their way to make life difficult for parents with babies.

If you have the Granada card you have to queue up for another hour to get a baby ticket.

No maps are offered at the entrance when getting a baby ticket but the staff take 15 minutes to complete your paperwork and ensure GDPR compliance.

There’s no explanation of which areas pushchairs are banned in and what to do with them and no information on where baby changing units are.

When you do leave a pushchair you have to do a big loop to get it back.

For the ticketed entry there’s always a queue but it’s hard to judge how quick the line will move. If you get to the front before your allotted time there’s nowhere to wait or sit while carrying a baby.

We’ve been privileged to travel all over Europe with our baby and Alhambra staff were by far and away the least considerate to babies. They could learn a lesson or two from Sintra in Lisbon.

In all honesty the Royal Alcázar of Seville was just as stunning, much less crowded and much easier with a baby.

There’s also no food choices suitable for vegans so bring a picnic.

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"Thought a guided tour of the Alhambra would be advisable and booked on-line for a specific slot time in February with Headout. Within 5 minutes of placing the booking we received an email and text message to say the slot we had booked was not now scheduled Whilst we were offered a later alternative this was not possible so they advised they would refund out booking fee 2-7 days. We subsequently noted that when the fee was taken from our account it had incurred a transaction charge and felt we should not have to pay this, not least because had they not have processed the booking (knowing immediately they could not fulfill it) we would not have had to pay this. We tried to query this - numerous texts and emails unanswered. Eventually they replied to say they were not responsible for bank charges but assured us the refund for the tour had been processed. Not surprised that after the due time had elapsed when they said we would be refunded, no repayment has been made. Worse still, they didn't even have the courtesy to tell us they hadnt paid, and a follow up email by us asking where the refund was resulted in yet another empty promise to repay - we are now told will have to wait another 2-4 days. Presumably they prefer the money in their account, and dont appear to appreciate (or care) about the inconvenience and costs to the client. Worst experience I have ever had with a company offering these services.

It's easy. Go to the opposite hill top first: Mirador de San Nicolas in Moorish quarter. The full view from there was jaw dropping. My goodness!
You don't need a ticket or a tour, just take bus No.3 in town, the driver announce all the stops. It only takes about 10 minutes and the journey is so amazing. Once get off go up the stairs to the terrace. There weren't many people there before 9am. You'll be able to take some great shots, enjoy the whole area to your hearts content. Note; it won't get dark until after 8.45pm in summer. The whole palace and fortress looked most amazing when they bath in soft orange sunlight.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"This was the second time I visited Alhambra, fifteen years after my first visit. Alhambra is still the same of course, but some changes has happened. Site is much more turistically developed now, there is a large visitor center by the entrance, with shops and other conveniences, it is possible to get a map of area, it is clean and tidy on the grounds. Palaces and other structures are nearly completely renovated now and there is much more details to see compared with my previous visit. We choose to take a guided tour this time and were good welcomed and shown around by the competent guide in a smaller group. Tour went exactly on time, and guiding with sender/receiver made it easier to follow physically, route was well arranged with some free time in the middle after ca 2 hours walk and enough time at the different sites to take a proper look. Of course, it it always seems to be too short time at the attractions, but when our tour was finished we could actually go back to the main area (no second entry to the palaces included).
We took a walk back to the Granada town afterwards; walking path went down all the way through some woods, park area and then into the town through city gates, good way to see more of town when staying in the city center.

Advice - probably best to book online - you will still have to queue but it’s one less queue! And ensure that EVERYONE in your party has I.D. of passport or driving license standard ....... otherwise you’re not going in anyway.

The previous reviews provide a good description and everyone knows the basics of why this place is special. After visiting today my advice would be to book your palace time as early in the day as possible. Get up early and tour the palace. After that you will have the rest of the day to visit all other areas of The Alhambra without having to constantly check your watch. If your scheduled time is later in the day, get to The Alhambra 2 to 2 1/2 hours prior to see everything else before heading into the palace. Recommend the audio tour.

If you visit in winter as I did, take some veeeery warm clothes! It was 1 degree today morning. Colder than in my home city Warsaw Poland...
Also make sure to book in advance as they don't sell tickets on the spot. In high season you need to book way ahead. But it's all worth it!
Ornaments, structure, attention to detail and also view over the city are just amazing. Whole load of history over there! Ah and there's separate line for tours and individuals.

There are also free lockers if you're with your luggage. They're very safe - within the eyesight of the staff plus on top of your numbered key personnel closes your locker with their key.

If you love photography, this is the place to go and the history is amazing. This incredible fortress was never attacked due to it being built up.
I also suggest don`t drive even with GPS or Maps as our GPS had many errors taking us in circles and very frustrating. Instead get a private driver and guide or a taxi with a private guide to do it right. This is the most popular attraction in Spain. Afterwards get a ride across town the the St. Nicholas viewpoint or somewhere close without the crowds to take in the Alhambra and Granada view.

From there we walked to the Alcazaba, which helped us to understand the military role played by the Alhambra during the Moor's occupation of Spain. The Charles V Place needed just a quick walk-through and was a bit of a disappointment. Our timed entrance to the Nasrid Palaces, booked months ahead, was at 1:30 and we spent about 2 hours there and wandering through the Partal Gardens. The Nasrid Palaces were beautiful and the intricacy of the detail was impressive but, for us, lacked the ""wow"" factor of the cathedrals we’ve visited in Europe. Perhaps most impressive was understanding the history of the Alhambra and the Moors in Spain. I'm definitely glad that we went as it provided a glimpse of history we hadn't seen elsewhere in Europe but I think I was more impressed by the beauty of the Mezquita in Cordoba.

1st - the Alhambra itself is simply a wonder to behold. The Christian and Muslim influence in the architecture and has such detail and purpose. The hand work done on the Muslim side is a work of art seeing the detail. This is a must see.

2nd - suggest a private guide to interact with more questions and avoid individual passes unless purchased directly via the Alhambra. The guide company used changed an ""individual pass"" and forced a ""group pass"" likely due to time of year. There simply was not enough time to enjoy the Alhambra and its details. Plan in advance!

For me I would say that it makes for better pictures from the opposite hill doing the walking tour in the late evening. It gives a breath taking view of the whole fort and when lit up its just too majestic and awe inspiring. The one big challenge is that at times one has to book more than a couple of months in advance and time slots etc need to be taken care of.. so its just not my thing and what I could make out is that its well published so the rush but I actually think I could have missed it from inside and seen more of the town.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Alhambra is a definite must see in Granada. It is an awe-inspiring collection of palaces, gardens, and castles that harken from another era. However, you do need to plan well in advance to experience it fully.

First and foremost, you must purchase tickets in advance. The highlight of Alhambra is the Nasrid Palaces. That portion of the Alhambra requires a timed ticket. Each time slot only has a fixed number of slots. Booking months in advance is required, even in “off-peak” parts of the year, or you’ll miss out on what in my opinion is the best part. Once in the Nasrid Palace, you are free to spend as much time inside. The rest of Alhambra requires a ticket, but you are free to come any time of the day. This includes the Generalife, Alcazaba and El Partal.

Given the size of the complex and the time restrictions on the Nasrid Palace entry, you should pre-plan your route. In our case, we had an afternoon time slot at the Nasrid Palace. Hence, we started with Generalife and then went to Palacio de Carlos V and Alcazaba prior to entering the Nasrid Palace. The exit from the Nasrid Palace takes you right to El Partal. From there, you can walk back to the main entrance. We saw gift shops by the main entrance outside the gate and in the Palacio de Carlos V. Plan on spending a full day here to fully experience it.

To get to Alhambra, would recommend taking a taxi. While Granada is a small town and you can walk here, Alhambra is on a hill and getting here by foot requires a steep climb. Taxis are relatively inexpensive; our taxi ride from Gran Vía de Colón was 5-6 Euros. If you are going to Generalife, you can ask the driver to drop you by the main entrance (pabellón de acceso). For the other parts, you can ask the driver to drop you by the Palacio de Carlos V. Both places also have taxi stands to grab a ride back to town.

Other than vending machines and snack stands, we did not see any dining facilities inside Alhambra. There are restaurants close to the main entrance. We ended up going to La Mimbre which was pretty good. Note that your ticket does allow you to leave the gates and come back on the same day. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking and some of the pavement is uneven. Also, the majority of our visit was outdoors and you should dress appropriately. During our visit in November, temperatures were close to freezing. It was also especially windy on the queue waiting to get into the Nasrid Palace.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"We booked 2 months in advance and visited in November, so I can only imagine how busy it would be in spring. Make sure you come right on time for the Nasrid Palace visit (the time slot for this visit is indicated on your ticket). This means that you can visit the rest of Alhambra before or after the Nasrid Palace. It should take you around half day to visit the whole palace. There is not much information provided, but the brochures you will get at the entrance are informative. I also checked information online throughout the walk. As for the palace itself, well, what can I say - it is a unique place with amazing history and of course a must see (for some probably the main reason to come to Andalusia, especially after Games of thrones), so I will not go into the details. Besides, everything is already said in the other comments. Just come and see for yourself.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"First, buy tickets months in advance!
Buy tickets on the official website, not the tour company website. Big price difference. Unless the tour offered suit your preference. (Tour guides do enrich Alhambra experience.)

If tickets are all sold out, it is still possible to obtain tickets. Tickets do become available for purchase, closer to the date.

That was how we obtained ours, mere a day or 2 before.
Check the official website every day. (Best time is right after midnight local Spain time zone.) Push Refresh button a few times…purchase the tickets right away! Don't hesitate. They go fast!

2) Also, as many had pointed out, the time listed on the ticket is the time you have to be at the Nasrid Palace. Give yourself a few hours before the time listed on your ticket.

Because Alhambra is amazing. There are much to see and absorb and experience. We allocated 2.5 hours before our ticket time to enter Nasrid Palace. It was a beautiful warm day. We started in Generalife, the garden. It is a place where one can easily lose oneself, in nature, in the beauty, and the view of surrounding.

3) We were at the line up 30 min. prior. Nasrid Palace is definitely worth the visit.
No photo can replace the real life experience. It is busy, and can be crowded at times, and at different parts.
Don’t be rushed.
Do Pause.
Do take your time.
Allow yourself to be immersed, amazed. Be in awe.

The dual language nature did feel we got less info oversll bc of the time constraint in saying everything twice. And every group was rushed through. Multiple groups are crossing over each other and getting jumbled so make sure to pay attention to where your group is.

There were three ticket checks and at least one required our passports. We toured the fortress, museum, gardens and the Generalife. We did not go into the Nasrid Palaces and therefore, we did not see the iconic Court of the Lions. Unfortunately, we realized this only after exiting. Our bad.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Compared to my last visit 15 years ago, the ticketing and crowd flow management have vastly improved and the building seems to be in better shape. Buy your tickets online at the official website and pick up an audio guide if there are any available. There is a timed entrance to the Nazarid Palace, but once inside, you can walk about leisurely. The whole place has to be experienced to be assimilated into one's consciousness. It's easy think that this was one of the richest palaces of its kind when you see the flowing water there and in the fountain in the courtyard of the lions (which was dismantled by Christian conquerors wishing to understand how it worked, but not put back together right. Consequently, it did not flow for hundreds of years until it was fixed only about 5 years back). There are checkpoints at various places where your ticket will be scanned, but you get used to that nuisance. The grounds and gardens are beautifully maintained and restoration and repair were ongoing while we were there. Allow at least 3 hours for a tour.

It was a long tour & every aspect was covered by Elena, plus she added in extra little stories & if we had any questions or wanted any more information that was no problem, so we learned so much more this time around. The Alhambra & surrounding gardens are absolutely amazing & the whole area is a feast for the eyes! It's in a wonderful location & from parts of the gardens you can overlook the whole city. There's so much history & information to take in & we would not have missed a minute of it. There was an extra tour with Elena through the Jewish Quarter, which again was so informative.

The striking palaces against the fall foliage was breathtaking and the weather was mild and sunny. Our guide (from sixthrills) told us that the two best months were May and November because the weather and crowds we're best. We took a tour of the grounds and Generalife (summer palace) and then bought a ticket to enter the palace. This was a wonderful way to do it because we got the historical perspective and a guide around the expansive grounds and then could take in the beauty of the palace interior as we wished. A few tips: 1) it is a moderate 15-20 min hike up to Alhambra but you can also take a cab if needed. 2) bring your passport as they will ask for it randomly as tickets are scanned 3) we were up there for 5 hours so although there are snacks available there, I was glad I brought a protein bar.

Had bought pre-booked tickets E15 which was so much cheaper than a lot of the online tickets we could find so we were a bit worried that we couldn't get into certain parts but nope, access all areas. These are not for the guided tours but you can buy the audio at the entrance gate for about E6 which plugs into your phone. Fantastic value, absolutely beautiful place, especially if the weather is lovely.

HOWEVER, DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSPORT as these are checked (we didn't know!!!!). Luckily we had photos on a whats app group of our IDs so they were acceptable.

Also, NOTE THE TIME OF YOUR VISIT TO THE PALACE ON YOUR TICKET. That is NOT the entry time to the Alhambra which we thought but the ONLY time you can get into the Palace, which is a good 15 minute walk from the entrance if you don't stop to enjoy and admire the walk. If you are not there at your allocated time slot, they will NOT let you in under any circumstances. We were four of those unfortunate people who didn't realise this so don't be as daft as us.

We walked home via the park (middle walk) and that was stunning. That left us smack bang in the middle of town so perfect.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,If you're a tourist in Granada you must visit this place. Be aware you must buy admission tickets in advance. Potentially months in advance,Nov 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Alhambra palace in Granada was built as a defensive fortress but is a beautiful illustration of Moorish Architecture creating strength and beauty. It is the most magical place with gardens to rival the Chelsea Flower show, every turning presents a new aspect, you will run out of film/battery as there are so many exquisite photo opportunities. Make sure you pre book either a tour or entry tickets as there are no walk in tickets available, the palace is big so using a guide means you get to see everything within allocated time span, entry tickets are timed to control access numbers. Watch out for beautiful water gardens and the decorative ceilings in Recently opened parts of the palace, watch out for cheeky feral cats who hide away from tourists, they bite so don’t touch them. The Alhambra Palace/Nasrid Palace and Generallife are all part of the complex but check your ticket covers all areas. Do take the bus/ steep walk up to Alhambra to look around the free museum and gardens and the palace built for the Charles V, monarch who was responsible for much of the restoration of the Alhambra, do this on a different day to main visit as there is a lot to take in. Do take a hat and water, even in May the temperatures are hot, be aware that there are many steps and some steepish hills within the palace but our tour moved at a good slow pace for slower walkers, lots of handy seats in shady spots to take a rest. If this isn’t one of the ancient seven wonders of the world it should be! Granada is a beautiful city crammed with history but with a relaxed vibe, lots of young people due to large university campus and the slightly slower pace that is essential to manage the heat. The city is tucked beneath the majestic Sierra Navada mountain range, skiing available in season.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Was only able to purchase tickets for the Alcazaba and Generalife by the time I went online 3 weeks out from our visit. Was at first disappointed that we would not see the Nazrid palaces. However, after wandering the extensive gardens and well preserved ruins of the Alcazaba and Generalife marveling at the beautiful architecture, formal gardens and views our senses were on overload. It is definitely worth visiting.",Nov 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"It was a rainy day during our visit, still wonderful. Bring a good pair of walking shoes. The guide we had, truly help bring the historical tale together. We got some great images, but walking the grounds gives the scale of the place and awe.",Nov 2019

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"I was in a group of about 12 people with a superb guide, Nono, who was sensitive to the group. There were plenty of historical facts combined with interesting anecdotal information and lots of opportunity for photos. 3 hours is not really enough but good a first visit. I would hate to be there in high season. November is cold but otherwise very good!",Nov 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"What a magnificent place. Everyone should experience Alhambra at least once in their life. Start with Alcazaba where you have the most amazing views overlooking Granada and the Sierra Nevada mountains. Continue in the Palace of the Nasrid with the incredible buildings/Arabic architecture and finish in the Generalife gardens. You completely lose your breath again and again. You will be amazed by the beauty when you see these priceless cultural treasures. Although there are many guests, it does not feel so bad and you can easily spend a whole day here.",Nov 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,Interesting place to visit. We bought our tickets on line ahead of time which saved us the lines. The views are amazing if you take the roof tour.,Nov 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,2.0,"On October 23, 2019, we visited the spectacular Alhambra In Granada on a guided tour booked on Trip Advisor. It was warm and sunny when we left Malaga but cold and rainy when we got to Granada. I had ten minutes to buy a warm sweater… We took a taxi up to the site (as an option to avoid the 20-minute climb) but somehow misunderstood the information and ended up at the wrong location. Half an hour and many calls later, we finally rejoined the group but missed stop number one: Alcazaba. Our local Spanish guide (Stefania) spoke a poor English, difficult to follow with old headsets full of statics. The guide spoke really fast while walking, rushing us through all the views. We only visited the Generalife and Gardens.
Great things about the tour: skip-the-line, spectacular views of the city, fabulous gardens (best seen in spring and summer, dormant in October).
Be aware:
• Not wheelchair accessible
• No heart problems or other serious medical conditions
• Travelers should have a moderate physical fitness level (I would say moderate to excellent physical fitness level)

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,We had a three hour tour of the Alhambra with a wonderful guide called Elena. Three hours passed so quickly and we still hadn’t seen everything. Being in the Alhambra was wonderful but looking up at it from Albaicin on the other side of the valley was magical,Nov 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,"The grounds are free and open for public entry so avoid all of the tourist kiosks offering tours as they are charging for nothing. There are fees to the Alcazba ( old fortress) but really not worth it, not a lot to see inside, just a sightseeing vantage point for photos. The Nasrid Palaces on the other hand definitely worth the fee to enter, book online in advance, or go very early in the morning to try and purchase on site.
Timed entry so make sure you are there at appointed time or you will miss out. 3 main Palaces Mexuar, Comares and Leones each one stunning, make sure to visit the halls of the ambassadors and boat. Then the courtyard of the lions.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"My absolute favorite place to see in the world. Beautiful, especially Generalife is stunning. I love the colours of the stones, the gardens, the numerous fountains and all views.

We went there in November and had bad luck with the weather; it was cold, rainy and windy and we only managed 2 hours of our 3 hour tour (it really was so cold I was shaking in the end). The tour was good, everyone has an earpiece so everyone could hear the guide easily. Guide spoke clear and fast English (speed is a plus).

Recommend this above all else though make sure you’ve got A LOT to wear in the fall and winter time, plus cover for rain.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Visiting the Alhambra off-season proved to be worth it. I was able to get my ticket on the same morning for the same afternoon (not that many were left, so better to book early) and the flocks of tourists were not overwhelming.

The complete visit, even without guidance, takes 3-4 hours, if you take a bit of time to admire the details, so for 14€ I found pretty good value in it! I would recommend a guided tour if you get it for a good price or the inexpensive audio guide. I just read the article on Rough Guides as I visited and it's really the minimum you should know about your visit.

Also, check the weather, if you visit the gardens and the old part, as I walked around for hours in pouring rain.

The visit is not perfectly guided by the signs. Make sure to drop by the other palace, adjacent to the Alhambra and visit the free Museum of Fine Arts (for EU citizens. 1,5€ for outsiders)

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"When I told my 18-year-old daughter that we were going to Spain, visiting the Alhambra was her one request. It was definitely worth the visit! Tickets sell out quickly; we puchased ours several months in advance when they initially went on sale.

The day of our visit we arrived early, so we had time to tour the grounds before our timed entrance to the Nasrid Palaces. We walked to the Alcazaba, toured it and the Palace of Carlos V, then entered the Nasrid Palaces. Afterward we walked around the Generalife gardens. We thought that the ordering worked well, and we enjoyed the audio guide that we rented (easily sharable if you have a headphone splitter).

Overall we were in the Alhambra for about 4 hours - this was sufficient, but we could have happily spent another couple hours or even a full day there given more time. I definitely recommend you plan a visit here and allocate as much time as you possibly can to enjoying its wonders.

Only to be told that all the tickets to the Palace were sold and booked up three months in advance. Although we strolled round within the walls, it was very disappointing. It also didn't appear that busy, surely in October they could accommodate more visitors? For most people it is hopeless planning three months in advance. There should at least be some tickets available on the day? We had to settle with watching sunset over the Palace, which was beautiful.",Oct 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,The Alhambra is a site not to be missed. We arranged a private tour of The Alhambra with Reyes Munoz-Cobo Garcia. The tour she gave was well worth the money we spent. We were a group of four. She walked through the grounds of the Alhambra with us for almost 2.5 hours and was chock full of information about everything from the history of the people to the agriculture. Her demeanor was just wonderful and she was also full of other recommendations for us during our stay in Granada. Don't miss the opportunity to take a tour with Reyes.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,A place not to be missed. It was a chilly November day and we arrived at 8.30 having bought tickets for 9am.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Since we knew we wanted to see everything, we split our visit into 2 parts. The evening self-guided tour of the interior was a really enjoyable way to spend an evening in Granada. Its Spain too everything can be super late. Next morning was the outside grounds. We got some beautiful photographs on both occasions.
It is crowded regardless of when you go so just be prepared.",Jul 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,3.0,"We booked a Granada and Alhambra Tour through VDT at our hotel. The Palace and grounds are amazing. Majestic splendour towering above the Granada Hills, and a fabulous example of Islamic architecture. The restoration work has been very sympathetically done, and I’m so pleased to have visited this ‘bucket list’ place.

Our guide, Maria, however stopped us from getting the most out of the experience. Her linguistic skills, taking a group around in French and English can’t be faulted, but she was very grumpy, and we felt it was a trial for her to walk around and tell us, parrot fashion, about the place. She was not happy with the size of the group, and made it very clear throughout the tour. There was no allowance for the age of some of the visitors with the speed she was going, even showing her disdain for one elderly lady who had to rest on some steps. Whilst her knowledge of the architecture was good, we had to look up the history on Wikipedia when we got back. She had no enthusiasm for the work whatsoever.

We will go back, but when we can go around with a book under our own steam, and really learn about the history. If you go, you’d better hope for a better guide.

Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,"After years of hearing the hype about The Alhambra, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. It has some beautiful sections, but I enjoyed the Alcazar in Sevilla much more. But if you go to Granada, you should visit.",Oct 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Went on a cold rainy day, with an injured foot, but wasn't going to miss this for anything. So glad I went. Each section was interesting on its own, whether for its views, or tile work, or gardens. But the compound as a whole was extraordinary -- spent 5 hours there. Had an audio tour which was enjoyable.

A tip: When you're near the palace of Carlos V, near the bathrooms, and you're hungry, don't succumb to the nasty vending machines, or the junk food sold in the gift shop nearby. There is a sandwich place in the courtyard of the Alcazaba. The map of the Alhambra doesn't show where the food places are. The Alcazaba courtyard is a nice place to sit and enjoy a nice lunch.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"This is the most visited tourist attraction in Spain. So, the first thing to remember is to NEVER just arrive on the day, hoping to buy admission tickets. You'll almost certainly be disappointed. I tried booking online though the official site 6 weeks ahead of our visit in mid-October and they were already sold out right through November! It's an extremely busy attraction, so plan ahead. What an amazing complex. We ended up booking a tour, to ensure our entry. It was initially a lot more money than we had intended to pay. But, in hindsight, it was really worth it. We used Lolita's Tours and our delightful guide was Juana. We were more impressed with this palace than with our visit to the Taj Mahal last year. I won't comment any further on the complex itself, as you have thousands of other reviewers who have already sung its praises.

We visited with a very knowledgeable official private guide. You’ll need at least 3 hours to cover the main areas. The decoration in most rooms is intricate and impressive.
However if you’ve visited Morocco, Turkey or Jordan you’ve probably seen it all before.

You will need to pre-book well ahead to gain a timed entry ticket to visit the Nazrid Palace but can visit the other components without booking. Alow plenty of time for your visit. We spent 6 hours visiting all locations, inluding the Generallife and thoroughly enjoyed it despite being one of many thousand visitors, mainly Japanese.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"It can be quite difficult to obtain tickets and, with Granada's approach to car traffic, I was beginning to wonder whether it was all worth while. It was, the Alhambra is a wonderful place to visit with sensational gardens and buildings. Entry to the Nasrid Palaces is on a timed basis while the rest of the Alhambra can be enjoyed at leisure. We were there in October but demand for tickets remains high and, when we bought ours on line, most of the next month was fully sold-out. You just need to keep visiting the site regularly and might be fortunate. In October, there was no split morning/ afternoon opening: we arrived about 10:00 and stayed within the grounds all day. The fort, the gardens and the art museum are all excellent and the Nasrid Palaces offer fantastic views and glimpses of moorish style and architecture.

His explanations, pace of tour, photo opportunities, etc were spot on. The audio system was perfect as you could wander a little, but still be right in touch.

Loved the Palaces and different architectures but didn't realise how big the whole site is and how much time is needed to walk up the (steep) hill from Plaza Nueva and all around. TIp 2: allow tons of time to explore. There are occasional seats in the grounds to rest weary feet!
Also didn't realise how lovely the gardens would be. Wish I'd done more homework about what to see & expect. But at least I've an excuse to re-visit!",Oct 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Of course the Alhambra is one of the great buildings of the human past! But if you don't buy tickets well in advance you may miss it! We foolishly left booking tickets until we arrived in Grenada the day before our visit and were told that there were no tickets to be had. It looked as if the only alternative was booking a very expensive personal guided tour. Then the local tourist office advised us to try the Alhambra site at midnight when uncollected tickets are returned for sale (or something). Amazingly, we got two tickets! It was worth it - don't make the mistake we made - we know we were lucky: you may not be. Book as far in advance as you can - you will not regret it.
The site is very well organised and managed. The only oddity was that with 6000 visitors on-site the Alhambra has no sit-down cafe - only vending machines and some pretty poor take-away options. Bring food if you think you'll stay for some time - we arrived at 9am and left at 2pm.

Spain,The Alhambra,1.0,"We booked our tickets online, which is just as well as they announced all the tickets were sold out shortly after we arrived. There are masses of things you are not allowed to do, but they dont seem to be bothered to give a good visitor experience at all.

The place was tired with little or no atmosphere or information about the history. I know it was November but the planting was very tired with little or no consideration for autumn planting or colour. Ironically, I had just seen Monty Don visit on Spanish television the night before, from a previous occasion and the gardens looked pristine.......obviously prepared for the event.

Very little in English, very few attendants if any, in fact I watched Russian male step into the garden and stole two pomegranates from the tree and nobody seemed concerned in the slightest. I think the site has sat on its laurels for a little too long and does not offer good value for money or a good experience. Such a shame as we had really been looking forward to it.

When we arrived we called teh tourist office and booked a guide who met us inside and for 3 hours gave us the most comprehensive and amazing stories. Patricia bought the whole thing to life.

They get snatched up very quickly so you have to be fast. Just for extra help too - My partner and I both tried and unfortunately our payment methods required SMS verification from the bank as we were overseas and if you dont recieve the SMS you cannot complete the purchase, however after we disabled that we had no issues.

We needn’t have worried, it was all fine - the QR code scanned directly from our phone, it took moment to get in, and even the queue for the Palacios Nazaríes was fine.

The Palace itself is indeed very impressive, and the grounds are very pleasant to wonder around. Reminded me of the Alcazar (royal palace) in Seville, only on a grander scale. Great views of the city from numerous spots.

We whizzed round the palace, and didn’t go inside the Alcazaba or Generalife, as we thought it might make for too long a day for the kids - aged 4 and 6 - bit we still spent a good 2-3 hours there, which the kids enjoyed.

There is a great little kiosk between the palace and Alcazaba, selling coffee and evening beer. Best of all, the coffee is served in real cups - not disposable - which you can enjoy in the square.

Wear confortable shoes and not too expensive shoes they will get really dirty, remember umbrella and water
Charge your camera
Double check before selecting the tour to be sure you see what you plan to see
Once you select a tour there is not way to change

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Early November appears to be an ideal time to visit with smaller crowds and pleasant autumn temperatures. Our “GetYourGuide” package picked us up from the Malagueta Bullring. Fairly punctual. Pleasant ride in a comfortable Mercedes van. Small group size.

Our local Granada guide Enrique was bilingual and alternated seamlessly between English and Spanish. He was very informative, professional but a bit of a no-nonsense character. The earphones provided worked well and such a necessity.

Covered all three key zones in two and half hours - the Nasrid Palace, the fortified Alcazaba and Generalife gardens. Not much queueing needed. Quite a brisk walk. Not much time to linger and take photos. Every part is different - the gardens being the most surprisingly beautiful.

Later dropped us off in the city center for two hours for some personal exploration and lunch on our own. Tour finished back in Malaga at 1900. Very sharp.

Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,Had a fantastic tour of the Alhambra. Our tour guide was friendly and really knew her stuff. She spoke perfect English. Got some great photo's and video's as well. Tour takes around 4 hours but well worth the time. One thing to keep in mind you need to get your tickets well in advance. We got ours on line about two months before we left for Spain. If you wait till you get there is a good chance all tours will already be booked. You do not want to miss out!,Oct 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"Ditto to all the positive comments, we spent a very leisurely day here enjoying lunch at the parador. The gardens are beautiful and much better kept than the ones at the Alcazar in Seville. Ensure you take your ID with you (the one you used to buy the tickets with) because at random times we were asked to show our ID (didn't make sense as we had previously shown it to get around the garden and then had to show it again for another part). We booked early online and took the 9.30 slot, so able to enjoy the palace without too many people in the rooms. Palace is stunning.",Oct 2019

My passion is Islamic garden history and this place seeded my dreams and led to all my studies and work/writing.

Try to ignore the people who spend time taking selfies and posing for friends. Notice the cats who live there and are cared for by the staff.",Oct 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,4.0,Alhambra is a large complex with gardens and fortified walls and gem of the overcrowded small Nasrid Palace (see my another review). Those large gardens with still full of flowers (in October) is an experience soothering your nerves after visiting Nasrid Palace. It takes time to see it and cobblestone paths start after a while hurting feet. Very scenic and worthwhile.,Oct 2019
Spain,The Alhambra,5.0,"The Alhambra is majestic, inspiring and beautiful. I visited in October 2019, having spent three weeks in Granada admiring it from various viewpoints including the Plaza de San Nicolas, Paseo de los Tristes and the welcoming terrace of the Mezquita de Granada. The Alhambra is a place of great historic interest. There are parts you can visit without a ticket, however it is definitely worth paying to see the Nasrid Palaces, Alcazaba and Generalife. My ticket was about 14 Euros. I didn't fully understand how the ticketing worked - there seemed to be lots of different options but I would definitely recommend getting one in advance and checking what time you are allowed into the Nasrid Palaces. I used a recorded guide that was available for 6 Euros. This worked well for me because I could wander around at my own pace and start and stop the recording when it suited me.The views across Granada are stunning. I would allow at least three hours for the visit. I would have stayed longer but I had a plane to catch! Of all that Granada has to offer (which is a lot), The Alhambra is top of my Favourites list.

If you arrive after 10am and before 14h) you will be waiting for a long time - so be smart and arrive early or after 2pm.

There’s a €12 toll to travel up the small road to the top of the look-out station, where you catch a bus and do a circuit of the volcano crater. There’s also a panoramic restaurant which is well worth a sit down inside. Plus there are a few guys pouring water down fissure vents and creating a steam geyser. They use these open thermal vents where they cook the meat, bbq style, for the restaurant.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,3.0,"Joined a half day coach trip to the park from Costa Teguise. We were nearly two hours before we saw anything due to picking up people all over Costa Teguise, Playa del Carmen and Arrecife then changing buses in Yaiza (including a wait for the bus, then a wait while others paid before boarding. We had paid fully in advance.

The coach had to queue briefly before getting up to the visitor centre as parking space is limited. However I was really glad we hadn't hired a car as cars were queued along the route for miles with a waiting time of approx 2 hours to get into the visitor centre.

We were rushed through a couple of geothermal experiments and given a 5 min break before being rushed back to the bus. Time for a brief toilet visit only!

The trip through the lunar route was fantastic but a bit boring for kids with a pre recorded audio and being unable to leave the bus. It's worth noting that hire cars are not allowed through the lunar route. The only way to do it is on an organised coach.

The wine tasting was also over in seconds but no hard sell at least!

Made it back to Costa Teguise at almost 3pm, ravenous!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,2.0,"Arguably one of the most boring things I have done whilst on holiday, don’t get me wrong the views are worth seeing especially the rock formations and lava flows but with a coach trip it gets old quickly especially when the longest stop is for lunch at a location where tickets are bought for a meal (€9 per adult €5 per child) other than the fixed meal there is nothing else at this location apart from a church and WC (we didn’t approach the church as there was ceremony taking place and we didn’t want to disturb).

El Golfo and the Visitor centre are 20-30 minute stop each which in a busy environment is not long enough to experience the views or geothermal activity and green lake or eat (which seems like a racket when you consider the option for lunch so take a pack up especially if you have an allergies as a for instance I saw no GF options (but then again I did not enquire either).

The ‘experiments’ are good to see, young children enjoyed this especially the geyser part but make sure you get a front row spot and stand your ground.

The wine tasting or wine taste is just that you can taste either a sweet or dry wine and then go in the gift shop (this location has WCs).

€12 per each for the camel ride which I did not partake in.
WCs at this location are very clean with a small cafe and museum on camel use on the island.

The guide was informative enough and multilingual.

if I was to visit these areas again it would be via hire car and not via coach, I estimate we spent over an hour in Playa Blanca picking up then another 20 wait on the coach in Yaiza allowing customers to pay by card for the trip.

In summary would not recommend a coach trip of these areas, we completed the South tour at €35 an adult €18 a child total of €123 for that price look into a day or 2 hire care and do it under your own stream.

Due to the Covid pandemics, the place was quite empty. In the entrance ticket is a free 40 minutes bus trip around the interesting landscape. The translations of the informative guiding CD to other languages weren't very good, especially when you understand English and Spanish and have the compare. Unfortunately there are no intermediate stops and so you can take photos of the very impressing landscape only through the dirty bus windows, especially, when the weather is a bit rainy. In the infortmation center, there is also a good souvenir shop and a little restaurant, which unfortunately closes very early.

A visit to the restaurant in the middle of the volcano was a must especially to the see the staff showcase the after effects of the volcanos. The views were amazing.
A little souvenir shop with reasonable prices. I'm so pleased that Lanzarote have respected the history and kept the island as close to nature as possible. Well worth a visit. Even my 10 year old son was impressed and glad to have made the trip. Definitely a place to return.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"We went by car (hire) at around 10:30am on a Wednesday. Bear in mind that there were fewer tourists around due to covid, we queued for around 90 minutes in the car to get to the car park.
TIP: Taxis and buses bypassed the queues, so consider taking a taxi or a planned coach trip, or go early!

The volcano bus tour is amazing. Not only the scenery and facts (in 3 languages), but the skill of the driver to get the bus around such a seemingly narrow and steep route.
There are demonstrations after the bus tour which are really worth watching.
The restaurant was a bit of a let down. Yes, it's an experience to eat chicken cooked by the heat of the volcano, so for that reason I would say do it, but don't expect amazing food or good service. It wasn't awful, more like acceptable. Harder to swallow given the price (most expensive meal we had).

I drove up as the guided tour included camel riding and a visit to a winery which we didn’t want to go to. It cost €12 for each adult and €6 for kids. That includes a guided tour through the park on a coach which was an experience in itself. On some corners it felt like the coach was hanging over the edge line the Italian job. There also was a couple of experiments done by the staff displaying how hot it still is under the ground. Disappointed the restaurant closed at 3.45 as the food looked divine.

The cost of admission included a 45 minute bus ride with narration in Spanish, English, and German.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Refering to Mars when you experience the Timanfaya National park in Lamzarote is no longer just a clichè:

Nasa rover has finally landed on the red planet (18.02.2021) and the scientist have named the area near the crater where the robot landed “Timanfaya” because of its geological similarity with the famous Lanzarote landmark.

I pass by the road of Timanfaya national park almost everyday now and I am always stoked by these views. Could photograph this place forever!

You can only access to the main park by booking a tour which consist in a bus ride
with other people. You can’t get out of it and are allowed to see the geological site from the window, to preserve the environment. A voice guide will explain in different language (spanish, German, English, Italian) the different spots where the bus will drive trough.

Time is approximately 20 minutes.
The tour is okay once bur I won’t definitely do it again!

I honestly prefer to drive trough the road of los volcanos on my own, having a look myself at the lava sea in both side of the street and take my time to appreciate it.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,1.0,"Extremely disappointed by this experience. The visit to the Park can only be done by bus, via a tour that lasts no less than 40 mn !
In times of COVID, this is obviously a very risky and unthinkable option when you know the spread of the virus by aerosols: no open window, no sufficiently efficient ventilation, proximity to other visitors, most of whom only wear surgical masks, not to mention the children inside the bus who do not wear any masks !
As we have health problems and are people at risk, we wanted to visit the site on foot, following the route taken by the bus. We were overtaken by aggressive staff, who did not understand our health problems/anguishments related to this bus and we were even whistled at and threatened !!
No rational explanation was given to us other than to threaten to call the police if we refused to return to our car. They followed us to make sure we left the site... I have rarely felt so attacked and insulted when I was just trying to express my dismay at the situation.
It is very sad to see that it is impossible to visit this site, one of the most beautiful on the island, when you have health problems! It is time to adapt your visit to the health context !

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We visited in December the week before Christmas and hired a car to see some of the island. We have never been to Lanzarote before but this was definitely one of the most stunning sights. My husband studied geology at university and has a very keen interest so this was like an incredibly exciting and informative field trip!

We didn’t have a lot of time and due to the worsening pandemic, we were repatriated back to the UK a few days later otherwise we would have returned and spent more time here. We did not realise at the time you can buy a universal ticket which includes entry to more than one of the attractions on Lanzarote so we were paying individually for the tickets. We also weren’t sure about getting on an enclosed bus in the current climate so we didn’t take the bus tour and feel that we have probably missed out on more of the experience. We’re not sure if you are allowed to drive your own vehicle where the bus route goes or if at other times, (pre-pandemic), you would have been allowed to get off the bus to take photos? If not, perhaps open topped buses or ones with no windows could be used?

Even from the restaurant and visitor centre, you got an excellent appreciation of the area and the heat still being emitted from underground is phenomenal. They actually barbecue food to serve in the restaurant!

It all seemed very well organised although we wouldn’t necessarily like to visit when the normal level of holidaymakers were present. You would probably either need to be there early or later on in the day to avoid the crowds. Nice gift shop selling a large variety of souvenirs. Would love to go back here and see more. We would highly recommend as a visitor attraction if staying on Lanzarote.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We are holidaying in Lanzarote for the first time in Aug 2020 and very much want to visit the Timanfaya National Park. We have a car for a couple of days.
Going by car is great as you can leave and arrive at anytime.
You can park your car in the car park and get on a coach that takes you round the volcanic area. The coach includes a commentary of what happened in those times (around half an hour).
On the return you can see experiments to show you the volcano is live.
There are also camel rides in baskets which in my opinion is the most exciting experience in the park.
Highly recommend to everyone!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"It is pointless to describe how unique is the island and how great is Timanfaya National Park - the heart of volcanic eruptions that took place in 1730s. One must simply go to Timanfaya and drive down those perfect roads (good job, btw!) overlooking the prehistoric scenery.",Sep 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"The national park is enormous, so the main area you have to pay entry to (€12 each) but this includes a coach trip and voiceover around the volcanos which is great value for money.

You drive up to the top of the park, unfortunately on the drive there is no room to pull over and enjoy the views, but they're a stunning sight to see.

After the coach tour you're able to wander around a bit and take photos. Unsure of any hiking routes.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Do youself a favour and visit Timanfaya national Park. This is the closest you can go to Moon or Mars due to rugged, Volcanic rocks/topography and awesome bus ride.

First visit Timanfaya visitor Centre(entry is free), they have good exhibition, Volcano audio visual and a nice walkway(you can spend around 30-60mins here)

Post this visit the actual park. Entry is €12/adult (child is €6). Entry price includes bus tour of 30 mins, Geyser show, Volcanic oven visit where they cook your live food. Reasonably priced restutant with decent portions considering the fact that they cook your food over the oven from the volcanic heat.

Highlight is undoubtedly the bus tour of around 35mins across the national park, expert drivers moving coaches in limited space (however watch out for Vertigo!),
TIP: Sit on right hand side of the bus for best views. Driver stops the bus at 3-4places to take snaps up close of the volcanic carter's.

We went in Aug (during pandemic) so no queues at all(otherwise it takes around couple of hours up the hill due to very limited car park space - such a shame)

In all, extremely good half day excursion with/without kids and a must visit in Lanzarote

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,3.0,"Timanfaya truely is a unique and special area. The vulcanic nature of the area gives the impression that you are visiting a different planet.

It is advisable to first make a stop at the visitor center where some information about the history of the area is given.

The tour around the craters and vulcano is per bus and thereafter a small demonstration is given of how hot the earth still is here, just below the surface.

However, there is one big problem here: in Timanfaya park Covid seems to not exist! The busses are fully packed (1,5 meter is not at all possible) and no embark and disembark policy is applied. No hand gel is available in the busses, no temperature is checked or whatsoever. After the bus ride people stand packed together to watch the demonstration. I was stunned!

So, a great sight to visit. But do know that it is not Covid safe.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"A short 20 minute drive from Playa Blanca, the roads up to the National Park are amazing themselves, it's like another world!
Cost €42 for 2 adults and 2 kids, the entry kiosk off the main road only takes cash, no card. We got there for about 10.15am, there were 1 or 2 cars in front of us at the kiosk so didn't have to wait long but the queue behind was building onto the main road. We drove up to the visitor centre and was guided to a parking spot by an attendant. As we walked up we were warmly greeted by another attendant who told us about the bus tour that was just leaving, we hopped on, no queues and had a great 30 minute, 14km guided tour of the volcano and surroundings. You can only do this on one of the coaches, you can't drive yourself round, the coach stops for photos but you can't get off. Once back at the visitor centre we were guided to three further demonstrations of the volcanos awesomeness and could then wander around the cafe, gift shop and surrounding area. Spent about 90 minutes there which doesn't sound long but it was a good 90 minutes. Our 7 YO loved it, 14 YO thought it was OK. On the way out it was definitely a lot busier with people queuing for bus tours, parking and to get through the kiosk. Would definitely advise going early.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Thoroughly recommend this 5 hour tour experiencing an interesting and informative (not lecturing) journey through the National Park.

Given the COVID 19 situation and this being the first post lockdown tour, the care taken by Angela to ensure we were all safe and sanitised at each stopping point of the trip was very reassuring.

The comfortable ride through the volcano park, seeing craters just across the way was mind blowing. There was a stop at a restaurant (designed by Cesar Manrique) to experience the heat of the dormant volcano, the kitchens use this heat for cooking.

Onwards to the coast to see the beautiful cliffs Hervideros followed by the Green Lagoon - formerly a crater.

Finally a drive through La Geria wine region - amazed to see how the vines are individually cultivated in their own walled enclosure.

We were offered the chance to sample the delicious Malvasia wine.

At no time during our trip were we pressed to purchase anything.

We paid £42 each to do a 4 hour tour of the National Park, stopping off for a 30 minute break to use the bathroom and explore the gift shop. The landscape and scenery is fascinating, and certainly not like any other landscape I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world - the landscape of Timanfaya is how I imagine the surface of the moon to be. If you’re visiting Lanzarote, you should definitely put Timanfaya National Park at the top of your list.",Jul 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We visited the Timanfaya National Park on a coach excursion from Arrecife (cruise ship visit) and had a wonderful time here. Cars are not permitted to drive around the volcano tour itself, we were fine in our tour bus, but car drivers need to park up and take one of the tour buses that are included in the admission price of the park.

The drive around the volcanoes is just wow, taking about 35-40 minutes to do the circuit with various stops and a running commentary explaining the volcanic history of the island. Note that you cannot get out of the bus for photos, you must stay inside the bus at all times, but the views were amazing.

Back at the main national park centre we also watched the earth's natural power to full effect seeing straw catching fire from the volcanic heat, seeing what happens when water is poured into the vents, and also holding some volcanic gravel and feeling the heat of it. There was food being cooked on a natural BBQ (i.e. just using the heat of the volcano). There are toilets and a restaurant at the Centre.

The national park, whilst being very popular, is well worth doing, it's a unique attraction and a 'must do' on the island.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We did the Timanfaya National Park on a bus tour and it was spectacular. The scenery is so other worldly, most of it created in the eruptions of the 18th Century. A local pastor who recorded the events speaks of volcanos pushing up through the ground, eventually erupting and creating vast lava fields. This was replicated in a further 34 locations and the subsequent lava flows headed downhill towards the sea. The landscape now is the volcanic peaks and craters and a massive cooled and static covering often many metres deep. It really took my breath away and forced me to consider the solidity and permanence of the ground I stand on. In short, don’t miss it.",Mar 2020

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"What an unusual place. Never seen so many volcanoes in one place before although none are ‘smoking’ like Vesuvius or Etna.
Get there early as this place gets extremely busy. We arrived at 10.45 and were second in the queue for car parking as all parking spaces were taken.
There is a separate visitor centre on the side of the road several miles away from here. Don’t make the mistake we did, tour buses do not run from there.
Once parked, head over to any of the buses and get on. The commentary is multi lingual and the tour round the park takes just over half an hour. The coach does stop several times to get those all important photos. I would say sitting on the right of the bus is probably better.
Once back at the visitor centre check out the outdoor displays, they are quite impressive and don’t miss out on the indoor bbq (located near the washrooms) which uses hot air from underground to cook food.
Overall one of those places not to miss.

When we got back the driver asked us where we would like to be dropped at the ship or the town we opted for the town and then had a pleasant walk around and back to the ship, there wasn't any food included but not a problem as we were all inclusive with Tui. All round a really nice day",Mar 2020

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"We did an organised coach tour of the national park and the El Grifo vineyard combined, and very interesting it was too.
The mountain and surrounding area is unique and has been used for various film backdrops, and the coach follows a winding route which best shows off the starkness and harshness of the unusual landscape.
On arrival at the restaurant there are examples to show just how thin the earth's crust is at that point - including the famous burning straw demonstration.
The restaurant meal and entertainment is very well organised, so credit to them for that, but the food itself isn't up to much.
I've reviewed the vineyard separately.
I paid €142 for two of us for the whole trip which included transfers to and from our hotel in Playa Blanca. Reasonable value, but having been there once there's no need to go again.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We made a return visit here on our recent stay in Playa Blanca. We did however decide to give the restaurant a miss on this occasion as we did not particularly enjoy our lunch when we last visited. The coach trip around the volcanoes is particularly spectacular. What an amazing landscape! It is a sobering thought to reflect on the fact that there were major eruptions here as recently as the early 18th and 19th centuries, which in the context of the age of the island is very recent indeed! But no cause for alarm as seismology can provide very early warning of any possible (but unlikely) problems in the future. The main area is known as Fire Mountain, and the geo-thermal demonstrations that you see show clearly how much heat is just below the surface. You even see meat and sausages being barbecued over the heat coming from the ground! You should not miss the opportunity of visiting this attraction, but make sure you try to get there early as by mid-morning it gets very busy indeed with a long queue of cars waiting for parking spaces.

Beware though that only a limited number of vehicles are allowed into the park at a time. Tourbuses are allowed in immediately, but cars must wait until another car exits the park - there was a looong queue when we arrived (by bus). So don't do this by car or be really early.",Jan 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Getting to the epicenter of the volcano and the coach tour is one of the most impressive experiences. The views are absolutely amazing. A piece of advice is get there early. We queued in the car on the path up for over 1 hour+ on a Thursday (which is supposedly a quieter day) due to limited car parking space. The Manrique designed restaurant at the top is stylish and it is amusing that one can dine on Volcano BBQed chicken or is tha for show?! The other food appeared to be cafe style.
We entered from the East (Yaiza side) which had a visitors’ centre but it was closed. I think there is also one on the west side but we didn’t stop (which I regret) due to having waited so long in the National Park. In all, This was my highlight of Lanzarote.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Oddly spectacular lunar like landscape that you drive through to get to the volcano visitor area, 12 Euros each well spent with a coach tour (I wouldn't want to navigate the tight turns!) and commentary then there are various things they show you like the cooking over a thermal pit and spectacular steam geysers. There is a coffee area and restaurant too. Really do recommend a visit & best advice is to go quite early and if possible at less busy times as it does get crowded and the car park fills up quickly.",Feb 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Loved this trip, the lunar road is fabulous, lke being on another planet, worth every penny, would recommend a coach trip, the queues for cars were horrendous, and you are not allowed to drive around the park in your own car",Feb 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"What a fantastic tour. I understand the buses have priority and the information added by the guide and audio inputs probably make it the preferable mode of transport.
The scenery is simply stunning with many photo opportunities on offer. The food provided at the restaurant was excellent and the demonstrations provided were interesting.
The event was all the better for the company provided by Kimberley and Dave (Rodney) at dinner.
A trip not to miss.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We visited the sight in a hire car. It is definitely worth arriving at the volcano early around 09:00 when it opens to avoid the lengthy queues. It is a pleasant drive through the Timanfaya National Park with its surreal lunar looking landscape, where you find the entrance to the volcano. There is a €12 entrance fee per person, but well worth it as it includes a guided coach tour with audio commentary. We finished our tour around 11:00 and by then the car park was absolutely full. We followed the one way system out and it was a case of the car park attendants allowing one car into the car park as one exited from the long queue which was starting to stretch back to the entrance.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,The landscape in Timanfaya national park is like something from another planet. The museum is interesting and informative. The coach trip around the volcanic landscape offers some spectacular views into the craters with interesting historic guide. Some of the corners are slightly hair-raising if you're easily scared but nothing too crazy. Volcanic demonstrations are fun and interesting. An enjoyable afternoon out.,Jan 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,Went on a coach trip to visit Timanfaya and was not disappointed. Going by coach means you get preferential entry so recommend you do it this way.

We had to come back to Lanzarote to come to Timanfaya because on our first visit we didn't manage to. The kids were less Impressed, we what do you expect from teenagers. We were not keen on the camel rides so we didn't at it was optional. The views are majestic, it's like being on another planet!

The coach took us through different types of lava field and how the driver managed the bends and narrowness was amazing. Our first stop was for a 30 minute camel ride great fun. Next we drove up to a peak where we given demonstrations of the still hot subsurface. If you visit this island this tour is a must. Go on an organised coach trip rather than solo.,Jan 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Visited Timanfaya National Park last week, late in the afternoon. Assumed you'd be able to drive through the park, but no, and probably for the best given the narrow roads with hairpin turns.

You can get to the visitors center by car but it's a UNESCO site, so you can only tour the park/volcanoes on one of the organized park buses (this tour is included in the admission you pay at the gate). Tour was about half an hour with commentary in three languages, and was an interesting way to see the park.

The visitor's center had a cafeteria, restrooms and a gift shop, as well as some interactive demonstrations put on by staff.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Absolutely worth a visit. When driving up to the volcano the views are stunning. Once up the volcano, the people are really helpful guiding you to a parking spot and telling you that a bus tour is included. The bus tour is interesting but sometimes not very visible (depending on whether you sit on the right or the left side). The demonstrations with the water and the fire are very impressive and also worth a visit is the large 'bbq' where they grill meat by using the volcano's heat. The restaurant is not very interesting, only when you want to eat something go in, it's also way to hot inside.",Jan 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Took bus trip from hotel for half day, though really depends on where they pick you up. Costa Teguise is almost first so spend first hour collecting folk.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Amazing place with beautiful views on volcanic cones and lava fields. Good commentary provided by Timanfaya national park.
I advise against going there with organized excursion, as most of companies won't let you stay around for longer that 15 minutes and then they will take you for a 45min tour around the park. It's easier to visit closed part of national park with organised group as you won't have to leave your coach but on the other hand if you want to see some more ""experiments"" with hot soil or taste volcano-bbq'ed chicken or pork you won't have time to do that. If you travel on your own with a car make sure you got there early in the morning as parking spaces are limited and you may have to walk even 30min to get to the restaurant and park entrance. There are no bus stops unfortunately.

Held shingle that was very warm, watched a geyser erupt, and witnessed a fire in one of the craters. We also saw food being cooked on the hot rock in the restaurant. Then we did the bus tour round the park, which private cars are not allowed to do, and were given lots of photo opportunities, albeit from inside the coach, as you aren't allowed to get out! Best part of the Grand island tour by a mile!!",Jan 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"This is one of two of my favourite tours in Lanzarote. I prefer the Timanfaya Express tour as this is purely the coach trip through the volcanoes with just the one stop at the visitor centre where you see the demonstrations of the heat in the ground. I love the road winding round the volcanoes showing close up the colour, texture shapes of the lava and the spectacular views. My coach had a pre-recorded commentary of the history of the eruptions about 270 years ago approximately. It was clearly spoken and interesting.
Other tours include a 20 min camel ride and brief visit to a vineyard and taste of a thimble full of wine.

We had a hire car and it’s not a long drive from PDC to the park . €12 per adult or €7 for kids under 12 that gets you a coach trip in the park. Restaurant in the place food cooked off the heat that comes up from the ground. It’s like a Luna landscape,Jan 2020
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"The bare and beautiful park is well worth a visit. You arrive in your own transport to a tourist point and your ticket then allows you to board a bus which takes a 40min drive through the volcanic remains.
At times, the bus hugs the side of some of the volcanoes and stops regularly for people to do the photo thing (if you have issues with heights, this bus ride may not be for you). You cannot get off along the way.
It gives a great appreciation of the islands history and the onboard audio guide is well done.",Jan 2020

I don’t want to give too much away, because there’s a few surprises along the way but it’s an absolute must do. There’s a shop at the top and a restaurant with meals available, or just coffee and cake, but with BEAUTIFUL views of the Martian landscape. The restaurant is very reasonable - five drinks and four mains for four adults cost us €48 in all, a bargain at just over £10 per head for a drink and a delicious filling meal.

The trip is very informative with multi lingual commentary. Plenty of stops for photographs but unfortunately from within the coach. We managed to get some really good pictures anyway. After the coach trip we were then shown the natural heat from a fire pit with water shooting from geysers, fabulous!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Really enjoyed our visit to Timanfaya. We did this as an excursion for 20 euros each. The excursion itself was way to quick, but it was really nice to see the vast area of this park. When you get to the main restaurant area there are a couple guys demonstrating how how the ground is and you will see things go on fire as well as being given a handful of very hot stones! There is also a grill that you can look down into and feel the immense heat from underground. They use this to cook the food on. We did not try any food due to needing to get back on the bus.

On a side note, if you do get travel sick, do not visit here on a bus. The roads are very windy and bus drivers seem to drive pretty quickly round here and you end up feeling quite sick.
Definitely worth a visit, but maybe better to hire a car. It will be more expensive, but worth it to take your time.

Lots of opportunities for perfect photo ( as a photographer I went there with my infrared camera and got superb shots!). There is cool restaurant by the coaches where you can have a meal grilled on the hot air coming straight from the Earth. They also do cool presentations of how hot the air by the surface is.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Definately a must visit if you're into volcanos, history, geology etc. It cost 10 euros to enter the park which includes a bus tour lasting about 35-40mins.

Arrival - either arrive very early or late; I arrived at approximately 10am and got straight in but 90mins later there was a huge arrival queue. The car park is quite small so at that point it's one car out to get one car in. I can't stress getting their early enough.

Facilities - toilets and restaurant / cafe on site however the museum is about a ten min drive further up the road (I didn't visit the museum so can't comment on that

Tour - good bus tour around the park through the low lava plains and up around some of the volcano craters with a few stop off points. I would say that the seats on the right side are better for panoramic views but the seats on the left are better for close up views of volcanic craters (right side was my preference).

Side shows - the Timanfaya Volcano is still active (the only active one) as demonstrated by the pouring of water down a tube causing a steam geyser and a fire pit in the ground.

What could be better - you have to take the bus tours and can't drive in the park itself. Buses should really have open windows or be open topped rather than standard coaches with tinted windows. Hopefully the park management will look at this in the future as a way of improving the experience.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We arrived at the park and decided to go on, as it was very busy
Coaches and taxis take priority over private vehicles, and even though we were travelling by coach there would have been at least 30 minutes wait. we arrived back and hour or two later the queue had gone down ad we entered the park fairly quickly.
The colours of the hills and mountains were amazingly varied, and they were quite beautiful. However the main tourist attraction is the demonstration of fire and the heat coming out of the ground. Throw brushwood into the hole and it is soon on fire, throw water into another hole and the water comes up like a geyser, and then in a round building, the chef was cooking over yet another hole, the temperature being 250 degrees centigrade at the bottom and 150 just below the food.
Top marks to the coach driver who navigated the steep, narrow road with hair pin bends on the way down

Another thing: it gets crowded fast. If you do not get there before 9.30, you'll have to wait in line to be able to access and park. You can only park when another car leaves.

Timanfaya is an absolute must visit location, I doubt there is anywhere quite like it in the world and am so pleased we visited.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Timanfaya National Park is the most popular attraction on Lanzarote and for good reasons.

A beautiful, wild and rugged landscape that has lava fields, volcanic activities and craters that can be scaled by hikers and walkers who are prepared to go a little further than the the bus tour.

An entry fee to the park and the 'official gate' will get you a bus tour (approximately 45 mins) or you can book in advance for a guided walk. Both these methods suit most people.

That said, if you want to walk without a guide a good place would be parking at Caldera Blanco and walking into the lava fields from there. Totally free. This can take you to several points in the park. I climbed Caldera Blanco. The parking area is on 'maps'. You can also park in the village of Tianjo.

My route took about 3 and a half hours. Circumnavigate top of caldera then back.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Really. Nice visit well organised. When we arrived the workers in the car park were working really hard getting people parked up and guiding us onto the tour buses.
The tour was 35 minutes on the bus with no getting off. The scenery was fantastic, the coach drives very carefully and slowly along a single track tarmaced windy road with some good drops either side.the coach stops occasionally so you can take photos, but you cannot get off.
Once you are back at the tour site you have a demonstration to show the immense heat coming from the ground.
Over all a great trip.on our trip back from the volcano not far away we stopped off for a ride on the camels this was a great end to the trip, it cost 12 euros a camel and it is well worth it

We were dropped off at a site which demonstrates that there is red-hot lava just below ground level. OK, it's a bit touristy and a cheesy demonstration, but interesting nonetheless. They put some straw down a hole and showed it catching fire then, at another point, they poured a bucket of water down a hole to make it spurt up like a geyser.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Timanfaya National Park is one of my favourite places on the planet. It is utterly stunning. I first visited the park 16 years ago and this year I brought my husband who is a part time wheelchair user. He had never visited Lanzarote before and this was the main thing he wanted to do.

Tourist information said that it was suitable for people with mobility problems, and to be fair to them, compared to the cycle or walking tours of the park it is. But I would say not for people who are wheelchair bound.

We arrived at lunch time which is possibly the busiest time at the park and drove ourselves. The price was €10 each we we paid for at the barrier by the LZ67 main road. We were in a queue of cars for approximately 40 - 45 minutes before being waved on into the car park. We didn’t mind that because it gave us a chance to start taking in the breathtaking surroundings.

The car park is level asphalt, but there is no disabled parking, a car park Marshall waved us to a parking space as close as she could get us to the restaurant, but be mindful the parking spaces at the top of the hill right next to the restaurant and gift shop are reserved for taxis and coaches only.

It is a steep incline to the restaurant and my husband decided to walk because it was just too steep for me to push him. It was about 20 metres on a steep incline. There are no benches or public seating in the car park area so to take a break to walk up the hill for someone disabled you either have to go for it all in one go or try and use a rock or small wall to sit on.

Views from the restaurant are amazing.

We then went to El Diablo Restaurant for lunch and had a table next to the window. We hadn’t booked but were seated within about 15 minutes after another group of eight tourists pushed past us and queue jumped.

There is nowhere to sit while waiting for a table. By the time my husband and I were seated at our table, my husband was completely exhausted by the climb up the hill in the car park, and standing waiting for a table.

My husband had chicken and pork skewers and I had Sea Bass both dishes cooked off the BBQ, 2 cokes and both had the erupting volcano brownie for dessert, with two coffees. It was nice simple food but quite pricey for the novelty of it being cooked on the volcano. It cost us just over €54. The waiters were nice and friendly and efficient. They are willing to take photos of guests. The sun is quite strong through the windows and that time of day, and the windows are also very dirty from the sand that often hangs in the air over Lanzarote.

We then went on the bus trip. There are no signs saying which bus to take and the tour busses are parked right next to the excursion busses bringing people to the park. But after a while you generally get the gist that you have to queue near the entrance to the souvenir shop. Again, for those with mobility problems there are no benches or seats and my husband propped himself up for approximately 20 minutes against some volcanic rock next to the souvenir shop waiting for the next coach to leave.

The lovely car park Marshall saw him and made sure he got to the front of the queue when the bus was ready to go. He’d been waiting longer than anyone else there but because he couldn’t stand for as long as able bodied people, they went to the front of the queue and dismissed him sitting there on the rock. But this lady was awesome, she noticed him, kept him updated, showed him where to go and understood what was going on. She was amazing. He got on the front seat of the bus so he didn’t have to try and walk the full length of the bus as well.

The bus route is just inspiring and it’s really hard to know which side of the bus is best to sit on. It lasts approximately 35 minutes with audio in Spanish, French, English, Italian and German. The driver stops by certain points of particular interest and if you want to look down into a caldera I would recommend sitting on the side of the bus behind the driver.

16 years ago when I went on this trip the bus stopped half way around at a viewing point so you could get out and take some photos. But it doesn’t do this anymore which is a bit of a shame. There is no flash photography and all your photos will have some reflection from the bus windows, but for us it was the only way we could do the park. It’s still a wow moment every time you turn a corner, and the bus driver was very competent with the tight narrow bends.

The bus trip returns back outside the gift shop. We couldn’t do anymore walking because my husband just wasn’t up to it, so we didn’t stand and watch the géiser demonstrations or fire pit. But we may go back before we go home to do the other side of the bus. After 15:00 would be good. In the mornings the cloud can be quite low and lunch time is very busy. After 15:00 the car park starts to empty so you might be able to park a bit nearer the restaurant which means a little less walking up hill.

The driver was very safe and Paul was very informative and spoke excellent English. It cost 45 euros each but well worth it as we visited a number of big destinations on the island that would cost more than that if you visited them individually. Timanfaya national park is nothing like UK parks but very interesting. Highly recommend a guided tour visit.,Nov 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"I visited as part of a coach tour booked via our hotel on a Saturday. The guide explained that Saturdays are a good day to visit as the area can suffer from heavy traffic at other times during the week. A lot of transfers on Saturdays so less people visiting.
The advantage of a coach tour is that you can do the drive around the landscape so you can see some more of the sights. Private cars are not allowed to do this. You are restricted as it is a national park and have to stay on the coach and cannot go roaming.
There is a visitors centre where they do experiments with the underlying volcanic heat, setting fire to hay, feeling the hot rocks and getting water to gush out of a tube. Views from this area are also spectacular.
There is a restaurant which uses the volcanic heat to cook chicken but did not have chance to try it.
My coach tour also included the Camel ride about halfway up which was fun.
I did this with my 10 year old daughter who also had a mountains half term project so found it interesting especially the gift shop!
Worth a trip out if you like taking photos interested in geology but you are quite controlled in where you can go.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,2.0,"Timanfaya is a protected landscape and as such visitor movement is strictly controlled. The park is accessed via bus tours only, with no possibilities to step outside to appreciate the landscape or take photograph. The information on board is just about acceptable, but the overly dramatic music detracted from the experience. I wanted to step outside and take a closer look at this ancient landscape, the majestic rock formations, and preferable in my own time, without the presence of a bus load of other tourists. Unfortunately this is not possible. Even when walking around the car park to take a few photographs I was told I couldn’t walk there and quickly ushered back to the bus.

This could’ve been a once in a lifetime experience in a wild and unique landscape, but turned out to be a commercialised tourism event.

I missed the generosity of Joshua Tree national park (also a protected environment) where visitors can roam freely albeit in a restricted and tightly controlled way, following a main road with options to step outside at key locations.

I understand that the environment is delicate, but perhaps a few view points could be accommodated within the park to allow visitors to step outside a few times during the tour. Or maybe a more widely available and accessible walking tour could be organised. I am aware that a walking tour exists but nowhere could I find any information on how to book tickets, tour dates and times. When I arrived at the park visitor centre I was informed that tickets need to be purchased 48 hours in advance, so I missed this opportunity. The national park website is in Spanish and difficult to navigate - I was not able to find the tickets here.

This is an exceptional place well worth visiting but the management is poor and I felt I was on a tight leash from start to finish. I don’t feel that I could fully appreciate this magic place due to an inability to provide adequate visiting facilities. A real disappointment.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Today we visited the Parque Nacional de Timanfaya on the island of Lanzarote. We drove in hire car from Playa Blanca, a journey of about 30mins. At the entrance to the Park you pay €10/adult each which provides you with entrance and the 35 min bus tour. Once past the entrance gate, it’s a 2km drive across the lava fields to the visitor centre where you catch the bus tour. You cannot drive any further, to see the best parts of the park you need to catch the bus, although for fitter people there are many walking tracks. A word of advice.... get there before the tourist bus hoards arrive around 10am. We arrived at 9.30am & parked very close to the visitor center & immediately got on a bus tour. When we returned from the bus tour, the car park was full & there was a long queue of cars waiting to enter. The bus tour allows you to get a close look at the volcanoes, lava flows & lava tube. A commentary is provided in English, Spanish & German. The whole experience is fantastic especially if this sort of landscape interests you. Considering the last eruption was around 250 years ago, the landscape is very new. Included in the entrance fee is a demonstration of the geothermal heat that’s just below the surface around (400m). The demonstration takes place just outside the visitor centre with a park officer pouring water 10m down a metal tube, which then creates a geyser. NOTE: you may have to wait for a bus tour group to arrive to see the demonstration. Overall very well organised, & great facilities as well as the amazing landscape.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Timanfaya National Park is apparently the only national park in Spain to be listed purely on geological grounds. It's centrepiece is the volcano itself which is still so hot that its restaurant uses its heat coming up from below ground, at over 200C, to grill the chicken, sausages and other food to be served there. Since I visited it previously over 20 years ago a visitor centre has been constructed at Mancha Blanca on the northern edge of the park. To get the most out of the visit it is worth starting here where there are professionally produced educational audiovisual displays about volcanism in general and the eruptions on Lanzarote in particular. There are also toilets and a gift shop here. The lava fields and the volcano itself are pretty impressive but not to everyone's taste as some refer to it as Lanza-grotty but this is unfair. You don't visit a recently (in geological terms) erupted volcano and expect to see a green and pleasant land. It's stark and barren. At the summit there's a great demo where an official pours water down into a hole and shortly afterwards a massive jet of steam appears. There's also the aforementioned restaurant from which there are great views. The food was all right but being publicly owned I suspect, the service was a bit haphazard, getting the order wrong on an adjacent table. Please note there is a hefty entrance charge per adult if you go in a hire car and presumably included in the price for a coach trip. The figures given on the internet are all out of date and I'm pretty sure we were charged 20 euros per adult so be warned.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,awesome place to go and go round the volcanoes with some awesome veiws then have some chicken cooked over the volcaneo,Jan 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,We drove to the park (note that the entrance for driving to the coach trip around the volcano is about 2km up the road from the main car park with the camels). It was 10€ per person for entry to the top and the coach tour...a real bargain! The restaurant at the top is well priced with great food! Well worth a visit.,Nov 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Fab, if in Lanzarote do not miss this,just amazing, Volcano's! Wow!
Our great planet of wonders
The coach trip through the National Parc is awesome!",Oct 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,Best arrive either early or late if you don't want to queue. We arrived 3.30pm and were on a bus in just 10 mins. Credit to the coach driver as the road is incredibly narrow and twisty. You have to stay in coach throughout but the driver does stop at interesting places. The coach windows are tinted so it's difficult to take photos without reflections in. The view from carpark is good though and the demonstrations of fire and heat well worth watching.,Nov 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"I’ll write the journey as it happened to make it easier to understand. As I couldn’t find much information on this myself so thought it may help others who are planning on driving to Timanfaya.

Firstly, you drive to the entrance to the park, where there is a queue to get in. We arrived at 9:30am. There was about 10 minutes of waiting to do. We came from the left side of the entrance meaning we had to turn left to get into the park. You pay €10 per person to get in. Children under 6 get in for free. So make sure you remember your kid is under 6 when you arrive. 🤫

You drive up a long narrow road, nothing dangerous really. Then there’s a 5 minute wait, to allow people to park and buses to navigate through the car park. Doesn’t take long at all when you’re this early.

You can go up to the cafe and watch demonstrations on geysers, where they pour water down a hole and it immediately boils. Which is nice, but don’t go to that bit straight away, queue to get onto a bus first and get that out the way. It’s badly organised, but we accidentally ended up the front of a queue and didn’t wait long at all. Just stand near a white or brown bus and you’ll get on in no time. They leave every 4-5 minutes.

The bus takes you on the route, which lasts around 25 - 30 minutes long. You’re not allowed to drive this route. The driver will play a CD with information on, which seemed like it was mainly in Spanish as there wasn’t much English. But when it was English, it was very informative and interesting.

The landscape is breathtaking. Untouched for hundreds of years. Sculpted by nature, no signs of life anywhere for miles and miles. Very interesting. Makes you think what the earth could look like in thousands of years time when we have used up all resources.

Once you’re done on the bus trip, watch the displays, they put some branches into a hole and it catches fire, they cook some chicken over a hole and it cooks like a barbecue.

On our way out, the queue to get in was insane! Never seen such a huge long queue in my life! Definitely make sure you get there early because if you turn up after 10:30am, you’ll spend more time queuing up.

The road from Puerto Del Carmen is fantastic and very easy. Great surface, well signposted and not too busy. We went up on a damp day and waited until after lunch for the crowds to die down.

Stopped off at the camel trail then drove up to the park. Cost for 2 of us was €16 - this gives you access to the visitor centre and also a ticket for the bus which drives you around Timanfaya. Because the rain was on, this was very quiet and this actually gave it a new dimension. Very interesting and well worth it.

Oscar Wilde said there are two sorts of people, em as have seen the Taj and then as hasn't. Add to that them as as seen Timanfaya and them as hasn't.

Absolutely spectacular .Just as nature made it.

The bus ride is something, the track is only just wide enough and there are drops to the sides.
The expressions on the kids faces when the guide handed them a handful of naturally hot stones and as he made the mini geysers go.

It's a stunning landscape and one unlikely to be matched anywhere you care to travel. Simply stunning! And all for€10 per head including a coach trip round the lava fields acc overlooking several craters.

See displays of the power of the still active volcano at the visitor center where the geothermal activity is harnessed both for choking chicken over an open fissure cum barbecue and outside where geysers were formed from buckets of water poured down pipes that instantly turn to steam and are expelled under great force high into the air.Bracken is dropped into a 2 metre deep hole where it catches light in seconds due to the intense heat just below the surface we walk upon.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,1.0,"When we arrived, the queue to get into the park had reached the main road. We did join the queue though, and over an hour later we were finally directed to a parking space. Our car had two children and an 81 year old; the children were bored, and when we reached the centre, the elderly person had to walk a long way up a steep hill. There was no facility to drop her off, before parking the car. Ten years ago we'd had a nice meal in the restaurant, so we'd been looking forward to eating there again. HOWEVER THIS TIME, the food was absolutely DISGUSTING. The skewers were the poorest quality meat I've ever been served. The pork was almost totally gristle, and the chicken had veins and skin. Five of us had the skewers and none of us were able to eat much of it. Three of us had sore stomachs for the rest of the day. Although we were seated quickly, we weren't properly attended to for a long time. Then to cap it all, having been charged over 100 Euros for this disgusting offering; when we went to pay the bill, the waiter tore up the one he gave us and gave us another even higher one. This was to be a special day, as we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, my wife's sixtieth birthday, and our daughter's 40th birthday. Unfortunately, we ended up being really disappointed.
The actual bus tour, of the park was good and the scenery was dramatic.

The food was excellent and the drive was spectacular. After the 45 min drive through the volcano it ends with a live demonstration of how the food is cooked. The whole day was amazing and would definitely go again. A warning though everything is cash in the park so if you are a couple you should have at least 120 euros between the two of you to do it all.

Back at the El Diablo restaurant, you can see food being cooked on a grill using heat from the volcano.

You have to take a bus on the single track road through the park. The pre-existing recorded information in English is very good. The demonstrations of the heat under ground were very good, the restaurant barbecues over the heat from the earth's core. The optional camel ride was more if an excursion on camelback across the landscape, at least 20 mins for 6euros per person and a photo of us was 5 euros. Lunch was served quickly, soup, breaded chicken, coleslaw, potatoes, bottled water, white wine, bananas was fine and they even offered salads and deletes to vegetarians.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,we went on an organised coach trip from the hotel. the National park is full of amazing sights. We did not realise How vast this park is. The coach driver did an excellent job as he drove around the many twists and turns and at some points we were so close to the edge I could not look. We saw many cars there but I think the coaches had their own route in order to avoid coming across cars and their passengers. A restaurant was on site and had a varied and interesting array of dishes .A selection of experiments were demonstrated by the rangers making us all gasp in wonder.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"The bus tour within the national park is good value for money at 10 euros. This is the entrance price for each person and includes a 35 minute bus tour around the volcano sites. We’d read that you should try and sit on the right hand side of the bus to get the best views on tour. So we did and we got loads of really good pictures. There was a particularly big volcano which people on the left hand side of the bus had a better view of but overall the right hand side was best. After the tour, which briefly stops at various sites whilst the pre-recorded audio guide plays in the coach and gives you information about the volvanoes and living organisms within the park, you are taken back to the main tourist site where there is a restaurant, a shop for souvenirs and some live demonstrations. The demonstrations include water being poured down a whole in the ground and within seconds a huge jet of water is fired around 40ft into the air. Pretty spectacular but what they don’t explain is how and why each of the things happen on the demonstrations. I guess we’ll have to google it if we really want to know. Unfortunately on this bus tour you can’t get out of the bus to take pictures. We gathered that this was normal so they can preserve the sites as well as they can, however we later found out through friends that it is possible to park nearby and go exploring by foot on your own. Our friends actually walked in to a crater! So there are obviously various ways of getting up close and personal with the volcanoes. Also on offer are camel rides within the park.

We were there after the holyday season so there were no queues and we coud drive straight to the parking place and take the next tour bus which is included in the 10€ enty. The landscape is worth the tour, the audio information is not really detailed and you can get that probably from wikipedia. It is a audio strean in 3 languages (german, english spanish), if they would use guides like in museums where you can choose your language they would gain time to place more detailed and probably interesting information. Unfortunately it is not possible to visit the place on foot and the bus also does not stop with exit possibilities, so you can only enjoy it throug the buswindows. For 10€ it was ok, but only because we did not have to wait. In holydayseason it would not recomend it if you have to wait for hours, similar beautiful landscapes can also be seen on the way from the old saltmine to el golfo where you also can stop and exit the car to enjoy the places.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"This place has to be seen to be believed. You could easily think you are on the moon or another planet with the landscape of this national park.

For €10 each there is a guided bus tour around the park with lots of photographic opportunities. The commentary on the tour does start in Spanish, however, just be patient, the English version follows.

The tour ends back at the car park, near the gift shop! There are further demonstrations which make it perfectly clear you are standing on a volcano!

You may well be given few stones to hold (if you can) which demonstrate the heat beneath your feet. As a further example of the heat, a small pit in the ground has some scrub weed pushed in which within a few seconds begins to smoke before bursting into flames!

The finale of the demonstration is a park ranger pouring water down a borehole which quickly erupts in steam and spray with a substantial whoosh!

Lastly, you will be directed to an indoor area, which is the top vent of the volcano. Many people hold out their hand but then very quick pull back. There is however a clue to the heat, as there are usually several chickens being cooked over the vent! I can recommend the volcano roast chicken, which is available in the adjacent restaurant. Quite an experience to dine on top of a volcano, but be warned, it can be very warm in the restaurant, but you are on top of a volcano after all!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"I would recommend to anyone going to lanzarote to visit this national park. We went on a coach trip frm costa teguise but if you go by car, you leave it at the visitor centre then board on of the parks own coaches. You are shown 3 geothermal experiments before the tour.There is a restaurant,gift shop + toilet facilities in the main building. There is also a chamber where there is a sort of deep well.You can feel the heat coming straight from the earth and above it chicken is cooking on racks.
Once on the actual tour of the park you see the extent of the volcanic eruptions and past activity. It is truly fascinating and at times quite scary. We had front seats upstairs on our coach and at times I thought we were going over the edge! The drivers are certainly skilled.we saw a variety of landscapes and even looked directly into calderas. I personally wouldn't have missed this trip for anything. There are some quite strict rules in the park but these are simply to ensure its looked after for future generations.

Part of the tour is seeing how the restaurant cook their meat over the heat from the volcano. You can get a tour bus around the volcano (this was part of our excursion) where someone explains the history of Timanfaya. the park itself is huge with nothing around but volcanic rock and how its shaped the surrounding earth.

The tour guide was very knowledgable with all the information she had for us. The driver was very experienced, as he had to tackle those narrow and bendy roads. We stopped a few times so that we could take pictures and take in the amazing views.
We got to see some experiments near the restaurant which were awesome. After the tour we had a three course meal at the lovely restaurant which is on the top of a volcano and food is of course cooked on a volcano, this trip is the best I have ever been on, do it if you can you will not regret it.

The scenery is stunning. We went on an excursion with Tui and didn't have any of the issues others did in waiting and queuing. The drive around the volcano's really is something else, how those drivers get the coaches round is amazing in itself but it certainly doesn't distract from the views that you will see.

Do note that there are different ways to view this place, I would recommend a coach as you will see much more and yes they do stop in the middle of the park so you can get off at a certain point and take it all in. Amazing place!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Hubby and I had hired a car and were aware of the ‘best times’ to go, either as early as possible or late on in the afternoon. We arrived around 3 and it was quite busy, but no major queuing. The car park was about three quarters full with a few coaches there. We were given a ticket and jumped on a coach, no waiting, so all good so far.... the trip itself involved lots of fairly narrow winding roads, with amazing close ups of some of the spectacular landscape, which can only be likened to the moon. A few sheer drops and lots of opportunities for snatching a pic or two...stopped off at the restaurant for a demo to create steam but this was very busy so didn’t get to see much. Commentary on coach was a bit long and drawn out as it was in 3 different languages. Usual gift shop which was overpriced, so we didn’t bother with it. Scenery though was amazing, although if you have visited Tenerife and are expecting a similar experience to Teide, you will be left very disappointed I think. It was very good, and I’m glad I did it, but I wouldn’t do it again.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"After reading reviews about avoiding 11 to 3 and attempting to get out the door sooner it didn't happen, so we thought we would go with the flow and if we have to queue we have to queue. However half hour car trip later, only queued 10 mins to get into the car park. This was about half 12. Then one of the guards said bus in 5 mins. We were quids in with the timing so I would say don't always listen to reviews because if everyone goes earlier of course it's going to be busy. The roads are narrow and it's not to everyone's liking but we both thoroughly enjoyed it. The photos don't do it justice. The views are spectacular. The bus is about 35 mins. Covers 4 or so languages so be patient, it is a popular landmark after all. There's a couple of little presentations which were really good. We were really excited to try the food. We ordered chortizo to share. Me half a chicken and my husband fillet steak. The waiter even asked how he'd like it cooked. Norm for steak as we know. Out comes our starters, all good. Next the main. Mine was lovely. What my husband ended up with was pork chop, said that's not fillet, took it back. I carried on eating. Next to come out was sirloin. Not a cats hell in chance I was letting the waiter tell us it was fillet as it was massive. 3rd time, we get fillet, it's rare to blue. He asked for medium. We would normally have medium rare back home but we accept abroad it's different and we do tolerate this. We really don't mind mistakes happen, but I am pretty sure he tried using the language barrier as an excuse. When he tried to explain about the translation of the meat,I was like yes, I can kind of understand but not between the first mix up. You can't translate pig and cow wrong I'm sorry. My husband thinks I was too harsh, I never complain. I'm all for giving good reviews etc but it was just 3 problems with the food that was disappointing. I would definitely reccommened coming here. Just be
mindful of some of the heights, narrow roads, high winds and of course what cut of meat you order haha.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,3.0,"We got here reasonably early but there was already a queue on the main road. Some ticket sellers walked along the line of traffic. They then let so many cars in at a time. You proceed onto another waiting area as the cars and coaches filter out of the main car park. It can take longer than an hour to get from the main road to the centre car park. The operation is well organised so there's no way of others jumping the queues.

Once we got to the centre we had to park up and wait a while to board a coach. The coach drove through the lava fields with a pre recorded commentary that flitted between Spanish, English and German. I personally got quite bored with it all.

Half an hour later the coach returned to the centre where you can see some men pour water into a hole and it blows out steam. There is a gift shop and a restaurant too.

I suppose I was expecting something similar to El Teide national park which I visited and drove through on Tenerife. I was disappointed. I feel like the morning was mostly wasted waiting around and queuing up.

One positive was the Camel ride. Which is separate from the cost of visiting the park. Which prompted me to give a slightly higher rating than I would have.

We stopped for coffee first then visited a green lagoon then on to a camel ride only if you wanted to do it no pressure. After that it was on to the volcanoes WOW! Then stopped for a buffet lunch well worth the 8 euros a quick stop to taste some wine then back to your hotel.,Sep 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"This place is breathtaking, as if you are on another planet.

We had a rental car, so left the hotel early and got to the national park around 10.30AM, assuming that we were early - Mistake! There were so many cars ahead of us, I almost wondered if they had better information than myself from there hotels.

At the check point, which is on the turning, next to the main park sign, you pay per person and get the tickets (not by car). The tickets also include the coach ride to the volcano.

So, let talks about the traffic! from the point of the paid entrance, it took us about an hour to get into the main car park, i.e. reception area. The main reason for this, is that the traffic is controlled, as the lanes are very narrow for the caches to enter and exit. The car park at the top is not that big, so they have to control the flow. So, if you can leave early before the rush period starts, do so, and on the way back, do the camel ride.

The coaches are waiting in turn to take you around, so do not worry if you miss one, there are plenty throughout the day.

First stop, as always, is the toilets. They are clean and are free. There is a restaurant there too, if you need to have your lunch. Apparently, the chicken served is actually cooked in the fires of the volcano.

The coach trip is breath taking and will take you up and down the mountain. How the driver does this is beyond me, as the lanes are very steep and narrow. It is about 25 minutes trip with audio description in various languages.

The coach will bring you back to the same location as pick up and from there you can have a photo shoot, before you head back home. Be careful, the car park is built on a steep mountain, so do not fall back. Windy – yes! Very windy indeed, so hold onto your hats!!

This should be on your top of the list visiting places.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"An Amazing place to be! You have to go there if you are in Lanzarote.
The queues get quite big around noon time, so I'd advise to go earlier in the day if you are going with your own car. Coaches go straight through so that might be better for you if you are on an organised trip.
We waited about an hour before we were able to get out of the car. After that we got on a coach trip and went around the national park, I took some amazing pictures, the views were just incredible. I don't think I will ever see anything like it in my life. Also there is commentary whilst driving in Spanish, English and German.
One thing though for those with young children - I do not recommend the coach trip for them. Maybe it was my luck but about 5-6 kids sat in front of me were violently sick for the whole duration of 35 mins. It is not a pretty sight. The road is very narrow and windy. So just beware of that. I normally get motion sickness but for some unknown reason I kept it in this day and enjoyed every moment!

The coach trip around the volcano was informative and a nice experience. The views are amazing.

My kids (3 and 6) were a bit restless during the coach tour but enjoyed looking at the scenery and hearing some of the story of how it was formed. They loved all the demos afterwards.

Coming by car is fine and I think better than an organized tour as you can go at your own pace (plus it was 20 euros for the whole family). But make sure you get there as early as you can - ideally at 9am when it opens. We got there at 9.30am and had to queue for about 15 minutes to get in - but once the car park fills up, it's one in-one out and you can be queueing for over an hour.

Do avoid noon to arrive there, because you'll be waiting in your car to get in for easely 1,5 hour. Better hours are opening time at 09:00 up to 10:00 and after 15:00. Last internal bus trip is at 17:00. Closing time 17:45. The entrance fee I paid was 10 € (adult fee). Once that you're in, you drive up to a high located point where you park your car. You can strech your legs than and even have a meal in the big restaurant. I can be some what crowded, because many tourist busses come there too. With your entrance ticket you can step on an excellent touringbus (with airco) which will drive you thourough the amazing park. You'll get during this ride a spacious look on the landscape and an closer look to some smaler volcanoes. The tour takens about 45 min and there are no stops. At several good locations the bussdriver makes a halt so interested persons can take a picture. Often it is a real ""waaauw"" experience, and at some point you can immagine how it is to be on the moon because of the desolate character of volcanic surroundings. The area covered by lava is 200 km², and there are 30 volcanoes. It is obvious that this would be to big to see it all, but you'll get a fair glimpse of what is representative for the whole park. Also very educating together with this park, is a visit a few km further (direction Tinajo) of an information center (noo entrance fee) that deals with the volcanic origin of the area in many ways. The visual representation is very accessible for children.

It’s not exspensive at all, believe it was about 6€ pp

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"After reading previous reviews we arrived at the park early before 930. We waited less than 10 minutes in our car to buy tickets and proceed to the car park. Adults were €10 each and our 9 year old was €5. The 6 year old was free. Once parked we waited to board a bus, the wait was not too long either. The drive itself was about 35 minutes with spanish and english translation. Some absolutely spectaculor views and interesting facts. The tour was relaxed and covered such a vast area. It was nice to be taken around. There were two demonstrations to watch when off the bus which the kids liked and a sweet little gift shop with a range of momentos and not too dear which was nice. There was a cafe also but we did not visit. Ulon leaving at about 12 the queues to get in were very long buts its run so well i do not think people would have waited too long.
It was a once in a lifetime trip and i am pleased we went to see it. The drivers are really great at their job, driving safely and taking time to let you look at it all on the way around. The whole place seemed really well orgnaised and was a nice morning out for us all. Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Lamzarote.

We paid €10 euros each when we arrived which was cheaper than we thought after seeing excursions for €44 euros each. The tour was informative and showed much of the park. There was also a restaurant at the top which cooked their food over a live volcano. The camels were a two minute drive from the park and cost €12 euro (two people per camel) however we should have stopped here first as they were closed on our way back at 4.30pm. Great place and would throughly recommend as a must see when in lanzarote. Good value for money.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"The highlight of a visit to Lanzarote, and probably the best experience in the whole of the Canary Islands.. An incredible itinerary starting with a demonstration of volcanic heat - boiling water and burning hay. Then a loom at or lunch at the restaurant which cooks food with volcanic heat. The real thrill is a bus journey (6km) by private road through the volcanoes and lava floes. This is truly awe inspiring and spectacular. I cannot think of anywhere else in the world where you could do this. A memorable day in all respects. TIP - better to go on a paid tour because if you just turn up by car, you could be waiting for a very long time to get up the mountain and onto a bus. You cannot drive around it yourself.

The trip included a visit to El Grifo winery with the opportunity to taste the wine produced. This was followed by a tour around the Timanfiya National Park. The tour ended at the restaurant in the park for a three course meal - salad starter, followed by barbecued chicken, pork and sausage service with pepper and potatoes. The meats had been cooked over the heat of the volcano. A dessert was also included. The restaurant tables seat 4 people and each table had water, a jug of sangria and a bottle of red wine. All of the above was included in the price. We were picked up from our hotel around 3 o'clock and were return about 10 pm. Excellent excursion and good value at Euro 69.50/person.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Hi.
We went on this excursion yesterday. In my opinion, it is worth doing. It really is like stepping back into prehistoric times. I liked that my young boys experienced something very different and learnt about the volcanoes. After about 15 minutes though, you’ve pretty much experienced it. It’s all the same beyond that point.
I suffer terrible motion sickness and I only read a previous review regarding motion sickness after we’d booked. I was terrified as there’s nothing worse than motion sickness! I’m happy to report that I was totally unaffected. I put sickness bands on anyway as a precaution, but ended up taking them off as wasn’t needed.
My other fear though is sheer drops, and this trip has many drops. I’m astounded how the coach drivers manoeuvre their coaches around so effortlessly. I was a bundle of nerves, but when I was brave enough to look over the edge, the views were impressive.
If you’re visiting the island, you have to do this excursion. Peak season is VERY busy but coaches get preferential treatment with no queuing, so best take the coach in my opinion...having said that, I don’t recall any cars being driven around the reserve?
Ps, my partner said cars are only permitted up to the parking area, they’re not permitted on the actual tour route around the volcanoes.
Enjoy!

We stuck it out out and crawled slowly to the car park which took about 60 minutes.

Once there, it is a very interesting attraction of a still active volcano. The bus tour around the landscape is what I would imagine a tour on a terrestrial planet to be like.
The cafe is very good that gives good service, and if you have never tried chicken that is cooked by the heat of the volcano, then this is the place to visit.
To miss most of the traffic, you will need to go first thing in the morning, about 9am or late afternoon, about 3pm

ally made with lava. Wasn't very nice in my opinion but it's only available in lanzarote so was good to at least have a taste. There's also a gift shop and somewhere to get a drink and food.

She explained everything about the tour and the plans ahead including experiments, camel rides , lunch and wine tasting. We climbed the volcano routes and was spoken by the lady explaining the backgrounds of the villages/volcano’s. We reached the top of the route to be involved in three different experiments, all of which were different and got to hold some hot stones from the ground below etc. Camel rides were next in which was be an experience I will never forget. To ride a camel it was €6 which took you a small route around with a group. Stopped off at a small local run place in a village where the tour stopped for lunch had a selection of hot/cold food & drinks, this was a bit pricey for lunch considering how much the tour was but was lovely stop off.
Wine tasting wasn’t that exciting, got a taste of wine which was then linked into a VERY small gift shop! Which was also another money spend as camel pictures were offered here too. Apart from the added price charges was an experience I will always remember.

Proceed to drive through this dramatic landscape to the visitor center. Were we parked up, and embarked on a 30 minute coach journey, what I’m can only describe like a scene from the land that time forgot and a scene from the film of total recall. Breathtaking scenery. How the coach driver negotiated the twist and turns through this lunar like landscape is amazing. I have visited pompi mount vesuvis earlier this year. But this tour is awesome like I mentioned earlier like a scene from a film set
This is a must visit , how ever you decide to visit , either on a organized tour, or like I did driving myself, you have got to add this one onto your list in your top 3 places to visit whilst on holiday in Lanzarote.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"This National Park should be an absolute must for those adults (and older children), visiting Lanzarote.

The park itself contains a visitor centre, which has a number of facilities. These include a café, visitors shop, toilets and a number of demonstrations of the volcanic activity still on going witinin the national park . These demonstrations include touching heated rocks obtained from under the surface, a fire pit that uses the volcanic heat and vegetation to ignite and the most impressive of all ....a water geezer!

We undertook the tour as part of a purchased coach trip as you are unable to do this individually. However, you do benefit from the guided commentary to help understand the structures and history of the area.

I would advise that this trip is probably not suited to those people with very young children and would recommend that if you are going over the peak summer months an early start would be advisable as the roads and visitor centre to get quite busy quite early.

There was already a queue to enter the park but we paid the fee collector at the gate relatively quickly and drove in. We waited a further 40mins at the top before our car was permitted to drive around the bend to park at the top of the hill near the visitors centre. (Tourists arriving on organised coach tours can enter immediately). Once you exit your private car you join the queue to get on a coach. Only their own coaches are authorised to tour the volcanic site. This is a good idea. A clear pre-recorded info guide is played (in a few languages) on the coach. The site remains litter and damage free,as tourists view the site from within the bus. Another advantage is that having queued in your car to enter the park you won't then be further delayed behind many tourist cars stopping to take photos etc. The road is narrow with steep drops at times, best to leave the navigation of the roads to the talented bus drivers. We enjoyed the tour which took about 40mins. The bus drops you back to the visitor centre where there is a demonstration of the hot earth in various forms.

You can only go by coach, cars are not permitted through the mountain roads. It was a beautiful drive through the volcanic lava lands and craters. Plenty of opportunities for taking those amazing pictures..we were given 3 demonstrations on the peak where there is also a little souvenir shop and a fab restaurant. A tip, take a.light jacket as it can get quite windy and make sure you take sun cream as.the winds can be deceiving. This was an amazing experience one of which I will never forget. If you take no other trip whilst on lanzarote this is one not to be missed.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,Very scenic and informative trip through the National Park. Demonstrations were highly entertaining.,Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"The National Park is a giant lava field, visitors are asked to drive to the top. The view is exceptional - lots of interesting shapes and colors. The guides make a short ‘show’ of the volcanic features - pouring 2L of water down a spout, and out comes a geiser of 3 meters. The restaurant was very good for a park - the specialty is a chicken cooked by the thermal heat. Fresh salads and lots of other choices. My only criticism is that the park is limited to the main roads only - we would have liked to have gone for A hike. There is a place to ride camels on the drive up that was a lot of fun.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"You have to do a guided tour in the park.
We did one through our holiday rep. Its an amazing place, the experiments at the top where they show how hot the ground is just a spade ful down is really good. It's a fabulous, drive through and quite sad when you think how many lost their homes when the volcano erupted.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"We stayed in nearby Puerto del Carmen and rented a car to visit Timanfaya National Park. The traffic/queuing outside took almost 45 minutes which I think is to be expected at a major attraction during the summer holidays but make sure you use the toilet before you go!
Entry prices were reasonable as it included a bus tour. When we finally made it to the car park we told the attendant we had a wheelchair and was directed right to the top of the car park which is on a steep hill. I would recommend any disabled travellers learn the Spanish terms for disabled and wheelchair to overcome any language barriers.
The stony path around the restaurant and toilets was extremely uneven and quite difficult to safely navigate but disabled toilets were provided. One member of staff was fantastic at explaining what happened next, and even went as far as moving people out of the way so I could get a good view of the demonstrations!
We took the adapted coach on the tour. The scenery was beautiful and the commentary very interesting. Before leaving we visited the gift shop which sold some nice items.
Very pleased at just how much effort this attraction has made into being accessible. Definitely worth a visit when staying in Lanzarote.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"This is worth taking in while you are in lanzarote, although it’s all enjoyable MY favourite part was the caves, they are lovely, would have liked to have gone back to have a meal there but only had a day left, maybe next time",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"I would recommend visiting the Park, however we went with a tour bus and I would not recommend trying any of them. Either get a private tour or rent a car, but the tour bus took 6 hours in total (for a half day trip) and about 10 minutes of that was actually viewing the sights from the park's restaurant and being shown some heat demonstrations, 40 minutes was driving around the volcanos which was nice, but the rest of the time was spent driving to pick people up, stopping and waiting at cafes, toilet breaks, forcing us to wait on others taking a camel ride we didn't want to do, herding us to gift shops, etc. Park was lovely, just find an alternative way to see it. (We did the Short South Tour)",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"2nd time doing the tour but 1st time with my 12 year old granddaughter. She found it really interesting especially doing the camel ride. Told her about some of it before so she was front row seeing the experiments. Did the caves at the end which was stunning, bit of advice if you have walking difficulties steeps down to and out of the caves are pretty uneven.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,We came here and enjoyed the trip. It was pretty amazing to see the landscape although a bit boring overall. I would say it is worth seeing and the demonstrations are pretty cool.,Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Always interesting with the Geysers being prompted by attendants. Fun to see food cooking over open fissure looks good and smells good. Shame they don't serve til 12 noon. Good tip get there for 9.30 am and avoid queues. Disabled can access food cooking and snack bar ok, but shop very crowded for wheelchairs. Don't think easy access on coaches which are included in entrance of ten euros, Disabled only charged 7 euros.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,3.0,"Booked this trip which was good but really rushed when off the bus not a lot of time to take in the fantastic views or even buy a drink at the top .
Was worth doing but glad I left my kids at the pool with granny and grand that day as was on a bus for a very long time.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"great place, one of the best places with many volcanos, national park with volcanos all covered by dried lava, acces got only touristic buses, no private cars, place where was filmed 1st movie Planet of the Apes, there is a grill over volcano crater, ground is so hot that they drill hole and pour water whitch blow up in the air about 20m, must see when on Lanzarote
visited Oct 2013",Oct 2018
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,1.0,"We done a tour of timanfaya national park with a tour operator some fantastic views and epic rock formations they took us up to visitor centre where they preform some demonstrations of the heat underground due to what they say is lava underground on approaching the hole in the ground you can smell wood burning which is deep down the hole so you can’t see. The geezers I also think are man made as they pour a drop of water down to cause steam they then pour a bucket of water Down and say in two seconds it will shoot up in air and also give you a couple of small stones to hold that they say is heated by the heat underground which I find strange as it’s only on pile where the ranger keeps turning over with shovel none of the gravel a few feet from pile is not hot. I think it’s all set up to fool tourists to pay money. The tour around the lava fields is good and informative.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Unfortunately, didn’t read previous reviews about avoiding peak times. Writing this as we’ve sat in a queue for 45 mins, so far. No toilet facilities on the road you queue on, so bear in mind if you have small children. We’ve been here before and although it’s very impressive first time,we wouldn’t have bothered if we’d known the queue was so long. Only discovered after paying our admission fee of €10 each. You can avoid queues by using a tour bus or taxi.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"Went on a coach tour of national park sat upstairs, front right hand side it's a seat for the adrenaline junkie! The road was so narrow and twisty it looked like we were going over the edge several times, think I amused my fellow passengers with my ladylike screams.
Impressed with the geyser I've never seen anything like thst in real life before and the noise it makes...powerful. the heat from the natural oven was amazing so so hot . The restaurant actually cooks food over it. Gives you a true insight into volcanic heat and the earth. Well worth going on a tour as the guide was so informative, learnt a lot from him.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,Enjoyed the day and all the demonstrations and the tour around the volcanoes and the bus drivers commentary,Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,We heard this was a must visit and wow it exceeded our expectations. We hired a car a queued to get into the park. It was well worth the wait. The scenery on the bus tour is spectacular unlike anything else we had seen. The experiments are fab and also the food that cooks from the heat below. We then visited the camels this was the funniest part of our holiday it was a great experience and a must to do. We loved this part of Lanzarote and would recommend 100%.,Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"We arrived about 11:30 and had to queue for the best part of an hour to get into the car park as it was one out one in. When we got it it was good, not to busy. Got on one of the tour buses after a 5 minute wait. The tour was impressive.
We ate there and the service is very quick and the food was ok and reasonably priced.
When we left there were spaces in the car park and no queues.
Worth a visit.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We hired a car while visiting lanzarote and decided to go and see the volcanos
What an amazing experience
The entrance price included a tour on the bus around this amazing national park
It was 10 euros each and worth every penny
Well worth a visit while visiting this lovely island",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"The park is stunning and when you reach the summit there are spotless, toilets, a good souvenir shop, a bar serving snacks and a reasonably priced restaurant with awesome views. If you go by car avoid 11.00-13.30 where you will queue for some time before you reach the summit. If you go by coach or taxi they are given priority at peak times so it’s not a problem for them. Make sure there is no cloud to obscure the view and you will have a great time.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"I visited the Timanfaya national park with a bus tour. Lovely scenery, mountains and hot springs. The stop at the restaurant looking out over the national park was very nice, and there is an opportunity to cook food over one of the hot springs.

Bring a camera to take beautiful photos. Sandals are ok for the park unless you want to climb some of the hilly areas then perhaps walking shoes would be more appropriate.

This can be a short visit through the park if you wish or you could spend the day here. If you rent a car you can go through the park at your leisure.

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"This is a must when visiting Lanzarote. We had an incredible time, from the food to the scenery, this was jaw-droppingly good. Superb!",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,4.0,"We booked the short South Tour through First Minute excursions and our package included the camel ride and wine tasting as well as the Park Tour.

Although it's made clear the camel ride is an additional cost, what isn't made clear is that if you don't go (as my 10 year old daughter didn't) you're basically left to sit on the coach while everyone else does!

The national park itself is absolutely stunning, what disappointed us was the time at the visitors centre is very short and you're rushed through the three experiments then pretty much put back on the coach.

It's a must see for anyone visiting Lanzarote, but be prepared not to be allowed to take your time admiring the view!!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We were very impressed with the organization at this National Park.
You pay your entry fee of €10 per adult and drive to the parking lot where attendants show you where there is an open slot. Then you enter a bus that takes you all thru the park to see the volcanos that continued to erupt for 6 years in the 1700’s. The bus is the only traffic allowed on the roads. There is a recording that takes you thru the history in Spanish, English and German. The tour is 35 minutes. When you return, you can go into the restaurant, but before you do, peek in the large oven heated by the heat of the Volcano. They cook chicken and vegetables on it!
A great afternoon!

Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"We came here mid week, the que was quite long when we arrived but it wanted out quick enough. It was worth the wait. We went on a tour around the volcanos. We had a 9yr old with us and he enjoyed every minute of it. The fire and water demo worked for him, as he is fascinated with volcanos and lava. The food in the restaurant was beautiful too as it was been cooked over the big bbq, the smell was unreal too.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,5.0,"Visited on a volcano tour the place is fascinating,and a must see.
Our guide was very.knowledgeable and the history is fascinating.
The park is restricted in certain in certain areas but we did see a few demonstrations.
Apparently it is 100% certain that there will be another eruption but it is difficult
to know when.
It could be twenty years to a thousand years.",Jul 2019
Spain,Timanfaya National Park,2.0,"What can I say hmmm ,honestly for us it wasn't value for money,lots of people said you must go on this trip.the TUI coach tour around the volcano went on a little to long as when you have seen a few formations .its all about the same.the food consists of a small salad grilled pork chop.a piece of chicken sausage (all dry)and a few small potatoes, red wine and water on the table which if you have any taste buds you won't have after drinking this. The demonstrations were good and the driver got us back safely.
Maybe I'm being harsh but thats how we felt.went for a late meal afterwards",Jul 2019
