Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,My favorite attraction in Barcelona! Gaudi was amazing and this is one of the products of his genius. Recommend the tour with tour guide. My 4th time visiting Sagrada and always learn something new,5.0,Oct 2021

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"We have visited before and perhaps due to the pandemic or because they did prior, but the experience was much less chaotic than it used to be. The audio guides on your own devices and better entrance process makes it all much easier. As before, we had made advanced reservations - which is definitely recommended

The experience inside and out is uplifting and awe inspiring. I would love to go up in the tower, however that portion not available due to COVID. Next time!",5.0,Nov 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,This basilica is amazing! It is very difficult to comprehend how one man could come up with such fascinating and amazing architecture and design! The audio guide was spot on with the details and the fact that you could use your mobile phone instead of a player was nice too. I hope to return when we can once again experience the towers from a higher vantage point.,5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"I have been to the Basilica twice (note that you can buy the tickets for half the price mentioned here direct from their website). It was really a special experience the first time with the colored glass and music, and then the museum below. The museum is really fascinating.

On 2nd visit, I felt like the employees were not too polite in screening us through - and felt even at 25 eu it was too expensive. The music is sporadic. Its always full of people taking cell pictures. You can't go up any of the staircases.",4.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"Extremely beautiful and quite frankly inspiring. We chose not to go in and do a tour as it was quite expensive and there was a long line. However, simply walking the perimeter and taking pictures from the parks across the street was still amazing. This was probably the busiest attraction we visited, people everywhere!",4.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,Fascinating history and amazing archhtecture. The audio guide was pitched well and the 45 minutes was just right. Entry charge goes to the ongoing building of the basilica and so makes it feel doubly worthwhile,5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,It's incredible when you are walking in the middle of the city and you are faced with such beauty. stunning! It's worth a lot to get your tickets to visit inside it.,5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,Fascinating- not sure in the end if I love it. But definitely appreciate it. Some inspired work. Unfortunately too crowded and disorganized,4.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"Amazing experience, there is much more to this basilica than the exterior.
You can pay via cash or credit card which is around 3euros cheaper, if you do not book then expect around 2hours wait before you can go in - it is busy.
We did not book so walked to Other Guadi buildings - “La Pedrera” Casa Mila which was a 20minute walk in a relatively straight line - well worth the visit with plenty of smaller non touristy cafe’s to grab sone churros and a coffee.
Note - walk down that street and you can see his Dragon building which in my opinion is his best private build. Ie. Casa Batllo & Casa Ametller.
We then we went in the other direction to the Hospital which he also built - not as amazing as other works but good to see. Returning in just enough time for our entrance.
2 adults and 1 child (9years old), we shared wireless AirPods as there are a lot of interesting facts and important elements of the build that you need to know about as you move around. Quite a few hidden gems so pay attention.
We went in around 1pm and the light through the coloured windows was amazing, also the space inside is unexpected as are the tree like structure of the pillars inside.
The external is just as interesting and littered with infested facts about the 3 families of La Sagrada Familia.
We took 2hours to go around, and replayed the audio a few times to identify certain statues and figures of the story. There is one of Guadi’s face in there, so look out.
Being religious and knowing about Jesus / Christianity life is not that important, as it is all explained to you in an easy to understand manner from birth to death.
There are toilets in there for your little ones who cannot wait, great photograph opportunities so bring your camera / phone is a must.
Not all that busy inside, which was surprising.
Excellent Spanish and American restaurants all around, so it is easy to grab lunch.Plus there is an ATM on the corner, where the metro exit is - so getting there via the metro was super easy.
Highlight of our visit so well worth the price to visit this UNESCO site, money goes to finishing the build.
Enjoy…

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"This amazing on going work of Gaudi (and artists and craftsman that will succeed him for years to come) is a joy to behold outside and in. It pays to skip the line and have a guide though that doesn’t always mean you it stand in line, just not as long. Standing in line you get to spend more time looking at the exterior, which you could do for hours and not see every detail. At the entrance there is bag X-ray and metal detector take off your belt and watch and everything out of your pockets. Heavily guarded but doesn’t detract from the visit. Gorgeous windows and light play inside, we went off season and had space to contemplate. Wonderful highlight of Barcelona",5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,Whenever in Barcelona I make sure I get around to this site just to see the progress. Not that long ago you could only see it from a distance. Now you can go in.,5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"Well worth a visit -I like churches and organs so I found it very interesting; my son has an allergic reaction in churches (more so to organs) but he, too, found the scale, history and beauty of the place impressive.

Well worth a visit -bought ticket on line -minimal, well managed queuing system - allow an hour to look round. Many found solace and peace in the church and were sat in the Nave, in contemplation. The ambulatory and north cloister worth a look as there are interesting features, including sight of the crypt chapel.

Stained glass more modern than usual. Still unfinished after a century of building.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,Pre booking is an absolute must. We booked the basic tour early in the morning to avoid the crowds. We downloaded the tour to our phones and over the course of an hour were given an excellent tour of what is a stunning building. Because of covid we were unable to go up the towers but it's still really good.,5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"really huge, place to see, make a photo in the park that is behing the Sagrada Familia it will look better",5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"This is absolutely a marvel of design and architecture. The only reason I can't rate it as excellent right now is because the towers were not open when we visited. I understand that this is still an active construction site, but would like to see these kinds of closures more prominently announced on their website instead of paying for an admission that doesn't include it. Also know that there is immense security, similar to that of an airport. Be prepared to remove your belts, watches, etc. Unfortunately because they rush you through this process, I accidentally left behind an expensive pair of sunglasses after the security check. Those two things aside, it is still an absolutely stunning and incredulous structure.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,We went there 9:30 and stayed 3 hours there. It is stunning and we enjoyed every minute there. The light inside changes when the sun moves.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,Great pics. Make sure you walk around the building. Different perspectives and styles on each facade. We did not go inside by the children did not want but a good sight to check out regardless,5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"I nearly didn’t pay to go in because I naively thought “once you’ve seen one touristy church, you’ve seen them all”. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I’d wanted to see the outside for years because of the unusual architecture and the unique ‘unfinished’ state. I was actually convinced to go in after seeing photos of the inside from reviews on here! I visited around 6:30pm and it wasn’t too busy at that time. The inside is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. The ‘forest’ of colours truly has to be seen in person to appreciate it. If you’re under 30, don’t forget to get a reduced ticket! I scanned a QR code on the outside to buy my ticket, this seemed to be the only option for on the door tickets. You also use your phone for the audio tour, the only negative for me was many people without headphones playing the tour on full volume over the top of each other. I had seen online that headphones were recommended so took my own, I’d suggest you do the same.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"We've been coming here for years and we love that with continued construction there is always something new to see, and that it will probably always be that way! There's no way this will ever be 'complete' and that adds to the intrigue and interest in visiting over and over. Gaudi is in a league of his own and you could easily come here over and over and always notice something you hadn't before. We take the self-guided audio tour, it lasts ~ 1 hour and is educational and very interesting. Plus, of course it is absolutely and mind-blowingly gorgeous. Go!",5.0,Oct 2021
Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,This structure will be equal to all the great cathedrals from centuries past!

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"Very well organised and you can book on the day to visit. It's a must see in terms of sight seeing in Barcelona. The building itself doesn't haven't a great deal of history in comparison to other large religious buildings (see Barcelona Cathedral). When you finally complete the tour with the audio guide telling you how great the building is and what Gaudi had to eat when thinking about building certain pillars, only to read that the Pope consecrated it in 2010 as just a ""minor Basillica"" makes you think Gaudi is down in the crypt spinning in his grave. Poor guy. Anticlimactic, but certainly worth 2 hours of your time.",4.0,Sep 2021

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"Honest opinion? save ££££ and view this place from the outside with the online photos but do not pay to go inside unless you are a cathedral fanatic.

I visited alone as my sister was working for the day and I wanted to see all of the Barcelona sights... this was my only disappointment.
Firstly, it is almost impossible to book online in advance (I gave up and presented myself in person with cash in hand as the site kept crashing). The bouncer on the gate was very rude and pointed me to a QR code on the wall outside the place to book before entry... so, know this: you cannot get in without completing the online booking, this can only reasonably be done by scanning the code on the wall, they only accept online payment.....they tried to charge me 3 times as x3 the website dropped out whilst stood outside the place trying to make it go through (in hindsight I should not have persevered).

Once in, expect a through bag search and pat down legs apart! (Degrading as a lone woman in my 40s, especially as the lady searching me felt about my bra and asked ""underwired?!"" = humiliated)...so if easily ruffled in this way please do not attend - I suppose at least it's keeping us all safe, watches off, body x-ray machine, bags into an airport type scanner too.

Once in, the glass is beautiful, stunning in fact.....but so too is Lincoln cathedral and York minster, so I did not feel that £26 was worth it compared to the sights I see in the UK for far less cost.

Architecture was too much for me, I'll be honest and go out there against popular opinion and whisper.....it was revolting, images of melting snails were conjured up.....obviously not my thing let's leave it there.

In and out in literally 10 minutes, out into the pickpocket thick street beyond.

So it's a no from me, but many will argue!

P.s ride a tuk tuk at your own risk afterwards, they are not insured or registered anywhere, mine agreed a 10 minute 10 euro tour, 1 hour later after I'd shouted at him 3 times to stop and then had to shout at him and demand him to stop he did....and tried to ask for 50 euro....a very frightening experience and these guys are operating all over the area.....you've been warned!

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"This really is a must see. It's presence is really overwhelming, so beautiful. The inside is stunning. We were unable to book a guide so had to settle for the audio guide. The issue with that was everyone needs their own mobile device and headphones to download the app and listen to the the guide and we just didn't come prepared (kids had low batteries, not all had headphones and grandma didn't want to go through the hassle). You can just play the audio aloud, but it's hard to hear with a million people. We went in July and it was HOT and the teens were over it after about 30 minutes, although if we had a guide and it was a tad cooler, they'd have had a much better time. We did overall love the experience.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"To see it is to believe it. This an epic building and is truly a marvel to see. If you can get a guided tour we would really recommend it but if not make sure you take the trouble to download the audio tour. It's one of those places that if you were to visit again there is somethings you would have missed last time. The pictures speak for themselves.
Although we highly recommend it we couldn't give it 5 stars due to the security do the checks and scanning your bags. We welcome security checks and fully understand the need for them and always do our best to make their lives easier. However, they were over zealous and were very rude in their attitude to us and other customers as we went through. Just be prepared for an airport style security check done with a lot more of an aggressive attitude. This was also made worse by having to unnecessarily explain our child's hidden disability several times.
They do free carer tickets if you email and they get back to you very quickly and are very supportive in helping you get the tour you want.
Overall a great visit and value for money.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"The Sagrada Familia is the most visited attraction in Barcelona. It is well worth a visit and a must see in the city. It was the final masterpiece of Gaudi and he spent the bulk of his later years working here as a devotion to his faith. The Basilica is like no other in the world. The inside is spectacular with vivid stained glass, columns shaped as trees at angles, tops of pillars dedicated to the four evangelists; Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and an unbelievable crucifix on the main altar. Gaudi is buried in the crypt but at present it is only open for services. If you wish to go make sure you check the times when you book your ticket to visit. The exterior is breath taking. The Nativity on the entrance portal, the death and passion on the rear portal where the Stations of the Cross are all outside and the glory portal which will eventually be the main entrance when the Basilica is finally finished. The towers are progressing steadily now and they are a major landmark on the city skyline. Too impressive to be missed on any visit!

You'd really better book the towers too, and best if you can get your tickets ahead of time! This church is so different from all others. So beautiful and colorful. Gaudí has a very different point of view in his designs. Very cool! I want to go back if it ever gets finished. Or at least the center towers finished.
Highly recommended for those staying in Barcelona.",5.0,Jun 2021

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"If I had to summarize the impression it gives, I will do so with one word: LIGHT !!!

Next July 20 will be the 800th anniversary of another spanish basilica, the Cathedral of Burgos, and an exhibition has been organized with the title of the same latin word ""LUX"".

As soon as you cross the line, you look up and get stuck.

Since you are not used to walking looking up, I immediately look for a place to sit and I do so in a corner enabled to watch one of the fantastic videos that explain the life of Jesus Christ with the visual information given by the sculptures. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who goes there.

Then I kept walking looking up and taking selfie photos with my cell phone.

You are under a great work that does not stop you from taking photos. Everyone does it. Everyone is looking up. This is exactly what Antoni Gaudí wanted to achieve with his work: everyone looking at the sky to reflect on what lies below.

Basílica de la Sagrada Familia,Spain,"If you only have a few hours in Barcelona, this is a must do. My husband and I have been to many cathedrals around the world including Notre Dame and Siena Cathedral and this by far was the most breathtaking.

For the price of the ticket there is an audio guide that talks you through the architecture and why everything is the way it is. Once you really start to see what is there it is memorizing. There is a good reason the cathedral still isn't finished with all of the detail and thought put into it.

When looking through the cathedral it appears there are colored lights all around and then you realize it is all from the stained glass and how it was built to maximize the light.

Hands down a must see while in Barcelona.

Each room hosts a treasure of arts that all deserves your attention and depending on your time restriction, don’t try and see everything in one go as you just won’t appreciate it. As well as paintings there are fine sculptures and exhibits to enjoy. What I would say is don’t rush your visit and allow yourself at least 2 hours to enjoy all that the museum has to offer.

Step outside the museum to pay homage to one on its best contributors the statue of Francisco Goya and admire the architecture of the museum itself.

Booking can be quite easy now as you can go on the museum website and book a time and date you wish to visit. You then get sent an email with a barcode that gets scanned on arrival. This cuts down on queueing and makes the museum experience just that little bit more enjoyable

Prado National Museum,Spain,"After calling the museum to check if accompanying students can come in for free, we booked the online tickets a day ahead so that we didn't have to wait in line. At the entrance, the museum staff made us go back to the ticket counter for the free student tickets. Even with the student ID having photo and date of birth, they still insisted on showing the holder's passport or ID.

When we tried to scan the QR code of the museum floor map at the information counter, only the Spanish version was available. We asked if an English version was available, and the lady behind the counter rudely answered that Spanish was an international language and we should just figure it out from that map. We asked another staff later, and he told us that the English version is on the museum's website. The website also failed to point out that currently most parts of the museum are closed, and so we were not able to see some of the important works from the permanent collection. The museum staff is probably the rudest and most unhelpful, following museum visitors around and prohibiting photo-taking, which is contrary to the practice at other places like the Louvre or Rijksmuseum that allows non-flash photography. Worst of all, since we were not allowed to take photos, they didn't have enough postcards of the important works at the museum shop. The museum should either let visitors take photos, or add the selection of its postcards!

Real Alcazar de Sevilla,Spain,"We did the combo tour, of the Cathedral and then the Royal Alcazar. Our tour guide was good, and we learned a lot from her. We felt that the tour of the Cathedral was informative, nicely paced, and loved getting to go up the Giralda tower. However, we felt that the tour of the Royal Alcazar was a little less interesting and a little too long. We spent too much time slowly going through small rooms. While we did appreciate that the tour ended at the Alcazar, with the ability for us to go on our own and see other rooms or the gardens, we were too tired and needed a break from ""learning"", so we just went home. We ended up buying entry tickets to the Alcazar the next day just to see the gardens. If I had to do it again, I would not buy the combo tickets. I would use this company to tour the Cathedral, but then would just book entry with audio tour at Alcazar so that we could do that at our own pace. Maybe spread them out and do one each day.

Real Alcazar de Sevilla,Spain,"First the heads up - you buy fast track tickets online or from the hotel to avoid the queues and enter through the Puerta de Leones - this is a smoother and efficient way to visit without any hassles. The cost for the tickets for 2 is about 28E but its so worth it..

The RA is one of those places that continues to surprise from the magnificent gardens to the Arab baths, from the stunning patios and courtyard decorated in Islamic motifs to the soaring state rooms. The architecture with fusion of Islamic and Christian traditions is a delight and repays you attention...and as you get a little weary fell your heart lift in the gardens with the water courses and shaded areas.

Take your time, dont hurry and allow time to relax and see how a place has become an oasis of calm, beauty and art

Real Alcazar de Sevilla,Spain,"Allow plenty of time to visit this place. There are a lot of nooks to see in the building and the gardens are even larger. Tickets were bought from the ticket office located near the exit and were free timed and with no need to join a group. A long queue but it moved efficiently fast - a total contrast to the impossible bureaucracy at the Cordoba castle. Cards accepted. Freelance guides intercept you at the entrance but you don't have to hire them.

The ground floor of the palace shows off the architecture from the caliph period. Good basic signing. Looking up at the ceilings is as valuable as gazing out of the arched windows.

The first floor is so different, mainly showing the Spanish influence.
The gardens are a series of delights with superb smells drifting by from the jasmine bushes. The maze was cordoned off but you can view it over the wall by walking to the far end of the palace garden wing and going up the stairs to the first floor. After all that a welcome small café is tucked away in the garden with shady outdoor seating.

Real Alcazar de Sevilla,Spain,"We bought a combi ticket online upfront for both Cathedral/ Giralda and Real Alcazar at tiqets.com (e-tickets). This way you don't have to first get in a line at the ticket office at the location itself. The tickets are for a certain timeslot.
You could spend a whole day walking through the beautiful gardens fo the Alcazar palace. Next to the beautiful and well maintained gardens there are also several palace rooms you can visit. It is a nice combination. The grandeur in the palace rooms and the details of the walls and ceilings is tremendous. The gardens are in my opinion even more splendid. They are so large and beautiful.
This is just a must see if you are in Sevilla. It is located centrally in the oldtown of Sevilla right next to the Cathedral.

Real Alcazar de Sevilla,Spain,"I booked a week before my visit. Occasional time slots for Cuarto Real Alto were available, so I booked a ticket including that. It was definitely worth the additional cost. Cuarto Real Alto is a newer part, opposed to the general tour which takes you to the 14th century areas. Cuarto Real Alto was lavish and completely different from the rest of the Alcazar.

The allocated timeslot is for the Cuarto Real Alto. You first have to enter the Alcazar itself (involves some waiting due to a security check) and present yourself at the Cuarto Real Alto entrance 15 minutes before the allocated time. Actually a full 15 minutes is not needed, we waited for missing customers until a few minutes before the tour started. I'd advice being 5 - 7 minutes early as you will get a separate audioguide and need to leave your bags into a locker after another security check. Finding the entrance for Cuarto Real Alto wasn't easy, but the staff was happy to help.

The tour consisted of a single audioguide recording which included all of the rooms. That means that the duration of the tour is fixed, 23 minutes. We were followed by a friendly security guard who made sure no one was left behind. The audioguide was available in Spanish and English.

In case you come early, you can do parts of the general tour before going to Cuarto Real Alto. Just don't go too far from the patio where you come after entering, as there are unmarked points of no return where security guards won't let you come back. I did some of the areas on the sides of the patio first, then Cuarto Real Alto, and after that the rest of the areas on the sides before continuing to Palacio Pedro I (entrance in the end of the patio) and the gardens.

Real Alcazar de Sevilla,Spain,"Unfortunately my visit the Royal Alcazar with my husband and one year old baby in August 2021 was no less than terrible. Soon after we entered the alcazar, my baby became a bit sleepy and to calm him down I kept walking while holding and cajoling him. When he was soothed I turned around to see the sights that we missed including the main plaza of the alcazar. The staff was extremely rude and yelled at us to keep walking forward. I was jolted by their rude behavior and the manner in which they spoke but complied with their request immediately. It was extremely odd as just then another family (white) was allowed to walk back as one of their kids wanted to see something again.

One of the guards then proceeded to follow us and continued to yell that in the alcazar you are not allowed to walk back to a sight once you have passed it by. There are absolutely no signs that tell you this, it is not written in their brochure that they give at entry, and no one among their staff tells you this at any point. My husband pointed out that as we are being yelled at, yet another couple with a small child was allowed to head back to see the earlier sites, however the guard simply refused to acknowledge and just kept yelling. At this point we definitely felt racially discriminated against as the only difference between us the the two families allowed to head back was the color of our skin.

My family and I walked through what was remanning of the alcazar gardens but had missed most of the inside. At the exit, I spoke with a manager and signed a reclamation form that asked for a refund as we paid 58 euros to see the alcazar which we were unable to see because the management does not inform you of the rules of visit at the outset.

The next day, which was our last day in Seville, I returned to the alcazar to follow up on the reclamation. I was shocked to be met with even more rudeness than I had experienced the previous day. The management was extremely aggressive with me from the get-go. I explained to them that if they could not provide me a refund (this is an option on their reclamation form) as it might take some time and I was leaving Seville the next morning, then I was willing to re-visit the alcazar to see the sights missed (also an option on their reclamation form).

After calling three security guards to flank me (I do not see why this was necessary) and about 10 phone calls, I had waited for almost an hour before the top manager arrived. By this top manager, I was simply told I could not and would not receive either a visit or a refund. No explanation or reason was provided when I asked for one given that these are both options listed on their own form, he simply said “not possible”. Then I asked the manager for his name and he refused to give it to me at which point he became physically aggressive in his gestures and pound and threatening (my 1 year old was in a stroller right behind me). I was so shocked at the treatment that I took a picture of the manager to attach with this review and he proceeded to run towards me and took photos of me and my baby in retaliation and kept on verbally threatening us.

I have never had such a poor experience on any visit. The management and staff of the alcazar are not only racist, rude, and aggressive but do not follow their own protocols set in place for complaints and reclamation. After my jarring and clearly racially discriminatory experience I must say most of the good reviews here must be from white people.

The audio guide lacked something and I didn’t end up listening to it, the numbering didn’t have a lot of order and the cathedral was busy and I missed a few things. I wouldn’t recommended paying €4 for the audio guide. The cathedral itself was lovely and the stain glass was beautiful. I wanted to get the terraces ticket but couldn’t justify paying an extra €14.

Catedral de Mallorca,Spain,"The Cathedral is beautiful and worth a visit for the multicoloured light show through the rose window alone. It’s kinda amazing to see a cathedral draped in yellow purple and red.

That being said - there isn’t a huge amount to see here unless you have a guide - which given its €8 entrance fee is a shame. There is an audio guide you can pay again for - but you have to download and listen to it on your own phone? Given the entrance fee, and the fact you’re using your own equipment. this really should be included as it is at other attractions.

Other than that - there are very little information available to read about the cathedral meaning you just end up looking at impressive displays with zero context.

Catedral de Mallorca,Spain,Stunning cathedral with some OTT decor inside. Should we be feeding the poor as a church or gilding everything in sight ? Anyway it made for a beautiful visit. Favourite part was one of the large circular windows creating disco effects as the sun beamed through. Loved sitting to pray and also gazing at stained glass high up.

Catedral de Mallorca,Spain,"I paid the 20 euros price to get entry and access to the galleries, which seeing the queues outside i was glad i did as we went straight through and into the cathedral.

It seems so much bigger inside than it looks from the outside even though from outside it appears massive, once you step inside it seems to reach epic proportions.

The way up to the galleries is on a very narrow steep spiral staircase of around 160 steps which are really not suitable for anyone with any difficulties in mobility, the views from atop the cathedral over the city and the harbour are stunning, as is the view towards the mountains and Bellver castle.

Once back on the ground the walk around the cathedral's many chapels is a walk back in time to a period when christianity was at its peak and money was no object to devotion, the amount of time and money spent on these chapels is incredible.

However the one chapel which stands out the most is the newest one by Miquel Barcelo, it looks completely different to all the other sin the cathedral but it is this difference which makes it so impressive

The weather can change at any time here, so at one moment I was driving in the clouds and another in the sun. The first time I went the cable car was closed due to the wind. I learned on their website you can view if its open before going. The second time I was more lucky and could enjoy a view from two viewpoints near the cable car station. If you want to climb the real top, you need to request a permit weeks in advance. I also made two walks at the base of Teide, I liked the trail around Los Roques de Garcia alot. There are different roads up and down Teide, so try different ones as the views along the way are also very nice.

The Alhambra,Spain,"First ever visit to the Alhambra for us was a great joy. We were advised to take the early morning transit bus to the top of the hill to get there fresh and early for our 8:30am visit. We had no choice in the start time - there were only early morning tickets available for what was a 'festival' day (bank holiday). Starting so early (before dawn to make it for the allotted time), meant we were within the first dozen or so people through the gate.

Once finished at the palace - which was spectacular and incredibly well preserved and managed - we exited into the gardens and realised the complete madness of thousands and thousands of visitors throughout the rest of the grounds of the Alhambra and immediately were thankful that we had been amongst the first of the day to get into the palace. The rest of the visit, whilst inspiring and informative, was somewhat spoilt by the sheer numbers of other visitors admitted on that day. We had to queue to visit Generalife for about 40 minutes as by late morning the place was absolutely heaving. To be honest, whilst that area was equally spectacular, we did hurry through because we felt somewhat claustrophobic with the sheer numbers of people being pushed through, and whilst everyone was Covid-19-masked, we were happy to get back out into the gardens and for a bit of social distance.

All-in-all a great visit and not overly expensive. We also booked at only a few days’ notice and were able to make all the arrangements easily online.

The Alhambra,Spain,"From the distance the Alhambra looks like a spectacular castle perched on a hill. That in itself is a sight to behold, especially with the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada Mountains or watching it change colours as the sunsets around it.

The true treasure of the Alhambra is the inside. There is so much more to the Alhambra than just being a fortress. Within the structure itself are other structures such as the Alcazaba, Royal Palaces, the serene Court of the Myrtles, the Partal Palace, Court of the Lions with an ornate fountain, and Hall of the Ambassadors with its stunning ceiling and the summer palace of Palacio de Generalife. Each building has its own unique character and attribute be it influenced by the Moors, Christians, Jews and the Europeans.

In addition to the buildings there are stunning gardens with a myriad of flowers, trees and birds, not to mention the odd cat or two seeking shade or water.

It’s impossible to take everything in so don’t try. Enjoy what you can and my advice is don’t be too obsessed trying to take a photo of everything. Every now and then put your camera down and just look around you, absorb your surroundings and later after your visit, reflect on what you have seen.

The Alhambra,Spain,"What more could you say about this unbelievable piece of history, than has already been written. La Alhambra is absolutely stunning inside and out, the attention to detail as it was built over centuries is amazing. Each individual influence is apparent, yet blends together with all that came before it. I would highly recommend a guided tour because the history is so rich. It really made a difference to have an expert explain it's beauty as we toured around. Don't miss the palaces or the Generalife gardens!",5.0,Sep 2021
The Alhambra,Spain,"The Alhambra is wonderful. The palaces the churches the gardens are all excellent. But some advice to start. Book your ticket online as it gets very busy, if you want to go to Nasrid Palace this will have to be booked at a specific time - you can enter the gardens and surrounds at ANYTIME but you must adhere to the entry time for the Nasrid Palace which will be selected on your ticket. Mr H and I saw many people being turned away because they thought the time referred to entry to the entire site. You will queue for Nasrid Palace even though you have an allotted time so be aware that you need to join the queue approx 10 mins before your start time. There are lots of steps and uneven paths so not somewhere to go if you have any mobility issues. You do have to bring ID with you and you will be asked for this at entry to each site. Masks are mandatory inside but not outside although as it’s so busy you may feel more comfortable wearing it outside as well

The museum quite well done and interesting. The Nasrid Palace wonderful.

The Alhambra,Spain,"The Alhambra - is SO OVERRATED. Our tour (SixThrills via VIATOR) got cancelled without us being notified, so we did this ourselves with audioguide. The audioguide was fine - but they make it so difficult for people who do the tours themselves like we did. Things are not well sign-posted - and just to buy tickets, they make you walk like a mile. There were passport-checks everywhere - slightly overboard and meaningless - we were checked passport about 7 times during the queing. Despite Covid, there was not a proper social distancing due to too many people being there - They are simply making money from tours and make things difficult for those of us who had no choice but to do the tour ourselves. It was like a zoo - too many people everywhere and can't really see anything. REAL ALCAZAR is so much better in my view - so much better run!!!

The Alhambra,Spain,"A must see it is, amazing it is, tranquil it is, picturesque it is...its everything one could think of when visiting such history.

There are some serious negatives though, COVID-19 seems to have become an excuse for owners, operators. Having to show your ticket and Identification/Passport every single time you pass into a location is just pathetic - it becomes boring and frustrating.

Being told to put a mask on outside in the open air is something that is just ridiculous. Security in this place have lost the plot. All for wearing masks indoors to make those who want to feel comfortable, feel comfortable, but outside - pointless exercise. The place has become a control attraction, not a tourist attraction.

Advise, take the General Ticket Online. One time visit and that is it.

The Alhambra,Spain,"First of all buy your ticket online. Then realize you must take the id with you that you got your ticket with; normally your passport. You will be asked for this at least 5 times. Realize that all of the entire complex to include Generallife must have that ticket to get in. You can see all of the places except the Nazarine (sp) anytime. The Nazarine entrance is your ticket time. We had a 1 pm time and got in line about 1235 and were about number 10. They will not let any 1 pm people in until 1pm and by that time at least 100 people were in line. I don't know how they processed through 2 sets of inspectors and still made the 1 pm slot. Any type of tour group has separate access. There are multiple places to buy snacks and hit the toilets during the entire visit which takes at leat 4-5 hours.

The Alhambra,Spain,"At first, the place is beautiful and impressive. So, why such a negative rating.

1) not child-friendly: we traveled with our 8months old son with buggy. Alhambra is not barrier-free. Many stairs and locations you can‘t visit with buggy. So we missed a lot.

2) mostly Spanish and unfriendly service: there is some young staff speaking English to guide you. But staff at the gates can‘t speak English. If you don‘t understand they just start shouting in Spanish.

3) mask obligation everywhere: you have to wear a mask the entire time. Even if no one is around or the guided tours do not respect this obligation you will be asked to follow this rule. If you carry a baby this could be annoying.

4) confusing organization: starting with tickets and entrance the whole experience ist not really comfortable. You have to show the tickets and or IDs several times. Sometimes two times to pass one gate. When you enter or leave a zone is not clear.

5) no map: there is no map with good oberview. Many visitors next to us had issues to understand where to go. We used Apple maps :/

Finally, parking fee was 7,20. Impressive.

Book tickets on-line as only a small number of people are allowed inside at the same time (enforced even more in these COVID times). Plus bring I.D. or you won't get in the various attractions.

The Alhambra,Spain,"In classically Spanish style, entrance into the Alhambra is massively over staffed, with a complete absence of organisation or individual capability. We arrived (my wife, 8 year old daughter and myself) in plenty of time to buy tickets to get in. My wife queued for around an hour- only one of us was allowed to queue while the others were asked to wait elsewhere. She bought tickets for us two adults and was told she did not need one for our 8 year old as they are free. We then queued to show the tickets. We then queued to show the tickets again. The second time we were told she did need a ticket, so please go back and queue to get one. We queued again. They had run out of tickets. We now had two tickets with no way to get our daughter in. We went to see customer services, who called the lady who could help, who called the man who could help. Turns out that none of them could help. We were then told we couldn’t return the tickets as they don’t refund. After going back to the ticket office and arguing for some time we did eventually get a refund. Long story short, no Alhambra, wasted morning. Please, please just put in a ticket machine and some clear signage - it would be more effective than the multitude of muppets wondering around posing.

He was very patient in answering all of our questions and had many stories to tell about this amazing fortress and its history. We were in awe many, many times, with an new surprise after each corner or passing through each new doorway. Sergio is an excellent guide (who also gives tours in Italian) who really knows his history and you can feel the love he has for this amazing historical landmark.

The Alhambra,Spain,"This is one of the most stunning fortresses in all of Moorish Spain, and perhaps in Islamic architecture overall all. We only had a few hours, but it's really worth a few days.

Unfortunately, COVID planning and some very odd Spanish bureaucracy have conspired to make this a very cumbersome, expensive, and irritating experience; so many gates, so many checkpoints, it's as if they don't trust the gate keepers just up the road to have looked at your tickets and compared to your passports. I'm sure there are all kinds of security issues at the site, but my sense is that a teenager could have done a better job of organizing the checkpoints and security than whatever security consulting company the government hired for this one.

The Alhambra,Spain,"This is interesting to see and most people like us come to Granada to see the Alhambra. We are glad we did so now we know exactly what it is. It isn’t on the same level as the Taj Mahal or Versailles, but it is worthwhile to see.

We took our time looking at everything and spent 4+ hours there. We bought our tickets online ahead of time and went at opening when it is cooler and the crowds haven’t moved in yet. Make sure if you used your passport to book your tickets that you have your passport on you. That is what they use to scan to let you enter. Have your QR code as well as the lady at the front asks to see both before you get to the check-in. Buy a General ticket so you can see everything. We had to show our passports several times to enter various parts of the complex. We did not have to go to a Ticketmaster machine to print out tickets like we had read. We went to the one in town, and the lady said we had what we needed already.We ordered them on the official website and printed out the QR codes. You also go to the Justice Gate Entrance if you have your tickets ahead of time.

There is art on display in two galleries on the Charles V’s Palace. The Alcazaba is best for a view from the top.

Enter the Palacios Nazarenes on the time for your ticket. That is the best part of the complex. After you see that, you can wander all over the complex to see everything else. The fountains and gardens are lovely as are the rooms with the decorative tiles .

The Generalife Gardens were beautiful. They are some of the best part of the entire complex.

NOTHING!! Disgusting. I Cant think of any reason why No1 attraction in Spain doesn't have any information on display inside the Palace Or the Alcazebra telling you about it.

It is really nice especially the Gardens and Nasrid Palace, the palace has the old morish interior and the gardens were full in bloom with lots of roses and others. Took us 3 hours to visit the whole ALhambra. Parking was also easy this time but I can imagine that that will be horrible once the touirists are back in full force. Glad we have seen it now.

The Alhambra,Spain,"I had wanted to visit the Alhambra for many years. I decided to visit in May 2021, while many tourists were not traveling due to COVID-19. This was an excellent decision, as I pretty much had the Alhambra all to myself (with the exception of the Nasrid Palaces, which had a fair number of visitors). I also stayed at the only hotel within the grounds of the Alhambra, so this really added to the feeling I was alone. I started my self-guided trek around the Generalife first, then to the Alcazaba, the Palace of Charles V, and finally the Nasrid Palaces. I did this over two days, which was I thought the ideal amount of time to see everything at a slow pace and really enjoy the surroundings.

Note the Nasrid Palaces is the only attraction that requires a timed ticket. For all other sites, you can come and go as you please. Also, if purchasing the general ticket, it's valid for a period of three days if I remember correctly, so you don't have to try and see all the sites in the same day.

I recommend visiting the Generalife first thing when it opens. As for the Nasrid Palaces, I imagine any time of day is fine (I went at 11:00). People are allowed entry in waves, but you can spend as much time as you like in any room once inside. If you're patient and attempting to take that perfect photo, simply wait for the next wave of people to pass through.

The beauty of the Alhambra cannot be understated, while the Nasrid Palaces are truly a wonder of the world. I spent hours in the Nasrid Palaces marveling at the architecture. Astonishing.

I would like to say kudos to the Staff. There are Staff hanging around near the Nasrid Palaces that ask you if you've purchased a ticket for the Nasrid Palaces and for what time. They are very courteous and genuinely interested to answer any of your questions.

There are a few souvenir shops between the Generalife entrance and the Palace of Charles V. There appeared to be a place that served snacks, but was closed (due to COVID, if I had to guess).

As others have noted, there aren't really signs explaining or describing the sites to you. I had no problem with this since I had a guidebook. For the Nasrid Palaces, many people were part of a group tour, so joining a group tour could be one source of information.

A superb example of Moorish architecture. Highly recommended. Apparently the Alhambra is the second most visited site in Europe (the Eiffel Tower the first, I believe), and for good reason!
