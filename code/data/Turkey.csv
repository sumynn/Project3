Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"This should feature in your Istanbul top 10 to-dos list, whether you are interested in history or not. It is beautifully located on the Bosphorus (best viewed from a boat or ferry on the river) and some of the rooms are visually stunning. The exhibitions in the main palace are also very good, with some exquisite exhibits such as jewelled coffee sets. Unfortunately, the Harem is hard to appreciate after visiting the main building as the rooms then seem rather repetitive. The audio guide is worth using and not too long. The museum pass does not cover entrance to the main part of the palace but covers entrance to the Harem.",Oct 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"Very beautiful palace and well preserved. This palace is a work of art with so much history, ornately painted walls and ceilings and of course furniture. In addition the palace grounds are beautiful. Definitely a must see if in Istanbul.",Oct 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,Ottoman empire moved from Topkapi Palace to this one and it's one of the most beautiful places to visit in Istanbul right on the Bosphorus. Better to buy online tickets to avoid long queues.,Sep 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,We were there for 3+ hours and did not have enough time. Gorgeous. Quite a transition from the old style Topkapi Palace to the new European style Dolmabahce. Too bad it cost a quarter of the national annual revenue and caused Turkey to go into default eventually.,Sep 2021

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"Great palace, one of Istanbul‚Äôs icons and a must-visit spot whenever you‚Äôre in the city, the fees for the full package(the harem, the painting museum and the main palace itself) is 200 Lira(approx. 23$) per person, and unfortunately the museum card(M√ºze Kart) doesn‚Äôt work here which is a shame, but overall it was very nice experience to see the Ottoman/Turkish heritage mixed with European architectural influence, unfortunately taking pictures is not allowed which is really a shame because everyone wants to take pictures and keep them as a memory for themselves, especially in such an amazing place, but overall it was a pleasurable experience and i do recommend it to everyone visiting Istanbul.",Aug 2021

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"I first noticed this palace when on a Bosphorus tour and I had made up my mind to definitely pay a visit. A small walk away from the Kabatas pier, this palace is unmistakably a must visit for any traveller to Istanbul. Expect to spend a full morning and afternoon here, marvelling at the craftsmanship and luxury of the Ottoman empire. Well worth a visit.",Jul 2021

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"One of the most wonderful sites of the last periods of the Ottoman Empire. The palace has an exquisite and detailed decoration. The furniture and pieces that populate the rooms of this palace range from bohemian glass ceiling lamps, marble stoves and staircases with glass columns. The roofs of the palace, a truly delicate and unmissable work of art",Jun 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"Beautiful views and architectural structure- so much to see - very well preserved - cafe and 2 museums within the walls, right beside the sea
Just do and see everything in Istanbul. Part of the whole world`s history. We never know for how long this will be still possible.",Jun 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"This palace is a must for any visitor in Istanbul. I could‚Äôve spent several more hours wandering the lush grounds and touring the multiple museum facilities on site. Don‚Äôt think that simply because a ‚Äúpalace‚Äù is in its name, it means the marvels will be limited as such. Although palaces are nothing short of a big deal of course, there‚Äôs so much here in store for all types of travelers.

My recommendations are to prioritize the main palace (where the sultan luxuriously lived back during Ottoman times) and the gardens and vistas surrounding it. A cafe is available here for lunch and snack breaks, let me say too. Entry is a reasonable price, and despite my objection, my admission was free due to my disability (I didn‚Äôt think this was standard across the board; maybe don‚Äôt expect free entry even if disabled). Wheelchair accessibility is quite impressive, with much of the palace hallways featuring ramps, or at the very most some slight bumps. An old manual-powered elevator is installed to access the front entrance, bypassing the grand staircase to the top. Nothing else I can really say with criticism. Bravo!

While you need not spend the whole day here if you prefer not, the Dolmabahce Palace and grounds are worth a substantial several hours to really experience first-hand. Check it out!

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,This palace is the most expensive real estate in the world and cost 25% of the total tax revenues of the country of turkey when it was built in the 1840s and 1850s. The crystal staircase and chandeliers are out of this world. The grounds are magnificent and the waterfront beautiful,May 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"We visited the palace by accident, but it was such a lovely experience. The only downside was that a bunch of the rooms were closed for renovation, so we didn't get a chance to see everything, but we spent about 3-4 hours doing the tour and enjoying the day there. It's a great visit if you want to see 18-19th Century Turkish History!",May 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"This palace is modern, huge, beautiful, charming, well maintained and well managed. The ticket is 90 TRY for the main palace and the Harem area and then a separate ticket for the painting museum for 30 TRY. You can also buy a cheaper ticket to only one part of the palace.
They give free audio guides but require to hold some ID. We left our passports with them and took them back when we returned the audio player.

With the audio guide, the tour of this palace is much more organised, informative and wonderful.

There are many cafes and restaurants around the property with beautiful views. We didn't eat there so don't know about the food.

The gardens are beautiful and picturesque.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,Really impressive. A must see in Istanbul. As grandiose as Versailles but with better views. The ballroom is one of the most impressive rooms you will ever see.,Mar 2021
Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,2.0,"This is only my opinion.
But I don't know who will exite to pay (about 120 TL - price on date 02.2021) for looking on some hundreds almost similar chairs, tables and some old beds.
Another monument to greed - while there was some people dying from starving some sultans wear expensive clothes and buy stuff they don't needjust to proove something to themselves.
So do not pay for visit this place - it is totally do not worth it.
No photo allowed and no photo you want to take in this place.
Palace as building has some preety places thou.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"The rule about not taking photos inside is really a shame as it's impossible to remember everything and give a good account to family members or friends. Other than that was happy that in January, 2021 there was no rule about getting on a provided tour; rather you could have phone like device with recorded information. You can go at your own speed and turn on and off when you feel like it. There are stations in each section of the palace where you can touch the device to the station and the information for that section will begin. It's an interesting attraction especially with regard to the European influenced interior decoration that the last of the Ottoman rulers were into. I don't know if it's because there were so few tourists there due to ""covid times"" but areas of the palace were blocked off. Topkapi Palace was much more interesting; however Dolmabah√ße Palace is worth a visit to see and hear about how the Ottoman elite conducted their lives from the middle of the 19th century through to the end of their rule. Interesting information about the short period of time in which Atat√ºrk lived in the palace as well.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"If you are in the southern part of Turkey, this is a wonderful area to explore. Antayla is a large, busy city surrounded by many historic sites, wonderful beaches and things to do but carve out a weekend just for this place. The walled city nestled against the coast is filled with restaurants, shopping and places to relax. You can walk from Hadrian's Gate to the Marina in about ten minutes but you'd be missing the joy of strolling through the community, poking around in the shops and hopping into the small but robust museums. There are vendors calling out to you but the pressure is much lower than in Istanbul or other larger spaces. Plan a day hanging out at Mermeli beach and finish up with an evening cruise on the Mediterranean. If you are feeling ambitious, the Antayla museum is a thirty minute walk or ten minute taxi ride into the city and has one of the best collections of Roman statuary that exists in the world.

Turkey,Kaleici,4.0,"What a quaint and fabulous part of Antalya old town! The streets, restaurants, historic monuments are very intriguing. Highly recommend staying inside the old town for a few days to experience it the right way.

Beach to swim: Mermerli. There are a few on the water docks to choose from but there is a small fee to enter of 40 TL. Water is calm but a bit rocky. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs a great place to relax, swim, have beer and soak in the gorgeous view of the mountains footed by the ocean.

Also check out Adalar Beach Club and Lanthe Beach near beach park. Nice spots to getaway and they have private areas to go into the waters. The swimming area is around a small cove so waters can be calmer than the ocean itself. Lanthe beach has more options for food and alcoholic drinks. Adalar beach club is basic in menu.

There are a slew of restaurants in Kaleici that need no introduction. Just walk, see the menus and go into the most crowded places. Be sure to have either Sarafin or Suvla local wine with your food.

Some great hotels to consider during your stay in Kaleici: Casa Sur, Hotel Aspen, Alp Pasha, Cape d‚ÄôPerge.

I also recommend renting bikes from the hotel and riding around old town. Maybe venture off to Konyalti beach but it‚Äôs 12 km from Kaleici roughly.

For massage I recommend the City Fitness & Spa located at the Ramada Plaza. They usual have sales and got a 60min massage for 40 euros. It‚Äôs just a very nice ambiance.

Walking right outside Kaleici on the main road (Ataturk Cd.) will expose you to many places to snack, shop and explore local souvenir shops.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"Unfortunately, my visit fell on Ramadan accompanied by a partial and then a full lockdown of Turkey, so most places, and I know because it's not my first time here, so about 90% of all sorts of establishments were closed. No loud bars breaking into your dream in the middle of a night, no crowds of tourists leisurely spending their vacation in shops or restaurants, no crowds of shopkeepers inviting you in all languages imaginable to visit their place. Quiet of not silent. Empty if not deserted. Spooky at nights more, especially when you are passing by the many ruins of once beautiful old houses. Your heart breaks every time when you see this agonising glory. Difficult to find decent food too, as you get tired of the ever grilled, deep fried, super sliced and super salty local fast food, the only available for take away. (Hence, check out all the hotels with restaurants. Some of them are open and can serve you). But the sun is still shining. The sea is still blue. The renovated houses look as magnificent as ever. The people are naturally friendly. Kaleici is still as fantastic as ever and, frankly speaking, no crowds is just great!

The hotel offered 120‚Ç∫ per person for a ride to saklƒ±kent. That is before we know that you can take dolmu≈ü/minibus to saklƒ±kent just for 20‚Ç∫ per person.
We took a minibus from fethiye, near otogar. Just go to the otogar (terminal station) and ask them to show you the stop to saklƒ±kent. It is an hour ride but really worth the 20‚Ç∫.
Saklƒ±kent park was really really beautiful, the kanyon, the raft, the river, everything. For people who loves nature, Saklƒ±kent park is a must to see. Bring you sea shoes (deniz terliƒüi) and if you want to go rafting, it costs 50‚Ç∫ per person. It was fun but I wish we could go longer in the river. The ride is a bit short, just about 30 minutes. Bring your waterproof phone case to bring your phone at the river. We didn't bring one, we had to buy one. 10‚Ç∫ and 5‚Ç∫ for students to go to the Saklƒ±kent Kanyonu. It is a must to see. A lot of people put the mud on their face as a face mask.

The castle is free for children under 18, Turkish teachers and for ones who has museum card (which is 60TL and works for most of the museums in Turkey). Others should pay 65TL. I recommend you to buy museum card instead (It's available for 1 year).

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"A must see place when visiting Cappadocia.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"I totally agree with many other travelers here that entire Cappadocia is a worldwide unique place, so I wont waste your time here explaining how wonderful it is (I'll do that in separate attractions reviews).
Instead, I'll point out here useful info I learned while planning our trip, and from our experience on the ground.
- plan to spend 3-4 days to see everything this unique place has to offer (we did it in 3 days, but needed a serious rest after that down on the coast - 4 days would be more relaxed),
- best airport to arrive is Kayseri. This airport is much bigger than the closer Nevsehir airport and has more frequent and better (and cheaper) connections with rest of Turkey. From Kayseri airport, Goreme and Cappadocia are an hour drive,
- DO rent a car at Kayseri airport. It is pretty cheap and cars are brand new - I used the ""Avec"" local company - great. You will need a car to explore the area as attractions are scattered in a 100 km radius in all directions. You'll save yourself money and do the sightseeing in comfort, not depending on groups and schedules. Roads are very good, with good signage, maps are working and petrol price is a bargain,
- if looking for a hotel with a pool to cool and relax, make sure it has an indoor pool (even in mid August when we visited morning and late afternoon air temperatures are insufficient to have a pleasant outdoor swim - 15-20'C, and also the outdoor pool water is NOT heated),
- I suggest ""Anatolian Houses"" hotel - terrific in every way, and so authentic and original, has both - indoor with hammam and sauna and outdoor pool (read that separate review),
- restaurants are feast for eyes and stomach, plenty of them - it is really difficult to go wrong with that,
- DO BUY the ""Museum Cappadocia"" Pass. It enables you to skip the lines in front of each attraction, and it saves you almost 50% of the fees you'd pay separately. It can be purchased at any site entrance. It pays of just after 4 visits out of 8 included (see my pic),
- there's no need for any organized agency tours if you have a car. Everything is well posted and explained in brochures and plaques at every site.
- balloon morning flight is a must (the best such I'd ever had, and the cheapest at the same time). This, you must do with an agency. I suggest ""Gorgeous Tours"", find their website. Same applies for the morning/afternoon ATV tours I strongly recommend.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"I will make my glowing review of Goreme NP a quick one, so that you have enough time to book your plane tickets and arrange your ground transportation. Cappadocia should be considered a world wonder. Nowhere else is truly like it‚Ä¶the stunning rock formations, the gorgeous lookout points, the hikes, the food, the people, the animals‚Ä¶I needed to have spent much longer to see most of it. And I only had a day.

Please follow me and keep an eye out for location-specific reviews within the park. In the meantime, check out Goreme. It‚Äôll be one of the most authentic, memorable experiences of your life.
