Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"This should feature in your Istanbul top 10 to-dos list, whether you are interested in history or not. It is beautifully located on the Bosphorus (best viewed from a boat or ferry on the river) and some of the rooms are visually stunning. The exhibitions in the main palace are also very good, with some exquisite exhibits such as jewelled coffee sets. Unfortunately, the Harem is hard to appreciate after visiting the main building as the rooms then seem rather repetitive. The audio guide is worth using and not too long. The museum pass does not cover entrance to the main part of the palace but covers entrance to the Harem.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"Great palace, one of Istanbul‚Äôs icons and a must-visit spot whenever you‚Äôre in the city, the fees for the full package(the harem, the painting museum and the main palace itself) is 200 Lira(approx. 23$) per person, and unfortunately the museum card(M√ºze Kart) doesn‚Äôt work here which is a shame, but overall it was very nice experience to see the Ottoman/Turkish heritage mixed with European architectural influence, unfortunately taking pictures is not allowed which is really a shame because everyone wants to take pictures and keep them as a memory for themselves, especially in such an amazing place, but overall it was a pleasurable experience and i do recommend it to everyone visiting Istanbul.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"This palace is a must for any visitor in Istanbul. I could‚Äôve spent several more hours wandering the lush grounds and touring the multiple museum facilities on site. Don‚Äôt think that simply because a ‚Äúpalace‚Äù is in its name, it means the marvels will be limited as such. Although palaces are nothing short of a big deal of course, there‚Äôs so much here in store for all types of travelers.

My recommendations are to prioritize the main palace (where the sultan luxuriously lived back during Ottoman times) and the gardens and vistas surrounding it. A cafe is available here for lunch and snack breaks, let me say too. Entry is a reasonable price, and despite my objection, my admission was free due to my disability (I didn‚Äôt think this was standard across the board; maybe don‚Äôt expect free entry even if disabled). Wheelchair accessibility is quite impressive, with much of the palace hallways featuring ramps, or at the very most some slight bumps. An old manual-powered elevator is installed to access the front entrance, bypassing the grand staircase to the top. Nothing else I can really say with criticism. Bravo!

While you need not spend the whole day here if you prefer not, the Dolmabahce Palace and grounds are worth a substantial several hours to really experience first-hand. Check it out!

Another monument to greed - while there was some people dying from starving some sultans wear expensive clothes and buy stuff they don't needjust to proove something to themselves.
So do not pay for visit this place - it is totally do not worth it.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"The rule about not taking photos inside is really a shame as it's impossible to remember everything and give a good account to family members or friends. Other than that was happy that in January, 2021 there was no rule about getting on a provided tour; rather you could have phone like device with recorded information. You can go at your own speed and turn on and off when you feel like it. There are stations in each section of the palace where you can touch the device to the station and the information for that section will begin. It's an interesting attraction especially with regard to the European influenced interior decoration that the last of the Ottoman rulers were into. I don't know if it's because there were so few tourists there due to ""covid times"" but areas of the palace were blocked off. Topkapi Palace was much more interesting; however Dolmabah√ße Palace is worth a visit to see and hear about how the Ottoman elite conducted their lives from the middle of the 19th century through to the end of their rule. Interesting information about the short period of time in which Atat√ºrk lived in the palace as well.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,3.0,"We paid 120TL per person that was the official ticket office without a guide but you have the option free for the audio guide which they give you and you hand back at the end.

It‚Äôs a beautiful place and I appreciate any kind of history and culture a country has to offer. I came to Istanbul in January and skipped this due to the cost, however my second visit I decided to bite the bullet and pay.

You just need to be aware you can‚Äôt take any pictures neither inside the palace or the harem so if your going with the intention to capture pictures it won‚Äôt happen. The guards are like hwarks and you can literally feel eyeballs burning the back of your head every move you make, so don‚Äôt even think about a sneaky pic.

They will provide you shoe covers that you must wear in the palace, I really enjoyed the Harem and this is extra so buy the ticket for 120TL that includes the main palace and the Harem, forget the others they are not worth it.

And be aware the food place there has a stunning view but it‚Äôs over priced food and nothing special. If your not starving walk down and find a cheaper alternative.

I think if you are visiting Istanbul then yes it‚Äôs worth going, I just think considering you can‚Äôt take any photos and lots of it is closed off at the moment due to covid the prices do not reflect this.

My wife was just in awe, I don't want to give too much away but I would definitely recommend visiting this palace while in Istanhbul even if you only have an hour!

Personally I would say in total you need about 90mins-120mins. They have a couple of small museums outside the Palace too along with cafes. From what I recall we paid about 90 lira per adult (¬£10), well worth it.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"In order to better understand and get the right timeline I suggest visiting the Topkapi palace first (read that review), as it was the first Sultans' residence before Dolmabahce.
Dolmabahce Palace was built in mid 1800's right on the Bosphorus straight, to replace the previous Sultan's seat.
Comparing the two, I find the Topkapi more authentic, as it's pure Ottoman design.
In Dolmabahce you can notice the western influence from that era with many Baroque and Rococo details combined with Ottoman, yet is a nice mix.
In total, 6 sultans and Ataturk resided here and it's a perfect place to explore.
Make sure you buy the Combo ticket - for Palace and Harem. It costs 1200 TL, around 15$, as in the Harem is the famous room where Ataturk passed away.
Also don't skip the Clock room and Crystal Hall (both in separate bldgs) as they contain remarkable items.

I do recommend that one takes a form of ID (passport or driving licence) with them or will need to pay a returnable 200 TL for the modern touch-phone which is used to direct you around the palace. It‚Äôs very informative and much enjoyed by the kids, so there‚Äôs no need for a guide. On the way to the Harems‚Äô section you will see a click museum and a wonderful little farm with swans, chickens, peacocks and waterfountains. Outside the Harems‚Äô section there is a small cafe area before visiting the Arts museum.
As you leave the palace, there are 2 cafes side by side by the Bosphorus, one on the grounds, where you will see 2 large iconic canons similar to those used in the siege of Constantinople, and the other Milli Saraylar cafe outside by the beautiful Dolmabah√ße Cami/mosque.

The palace is structurally divided into sections and we could visit all of them.

The southern wing is reserved for the men and contains the public representation rooms; the northern wing - (the Harem)- served as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by a big ceremonial hall and a high dome.

In both sections, each of the halls had a colour theme. Everything in this palace spells opulence and grandeur.

The palace overlooks the Bosphorous providng breathtakingly beautiful views of the strait.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,3.0,"Opulent palace full of amazing chandeliers and glass, beautiful staircases and grand rooms. Worth seeing to get a sense of a later era than topkapi. Free audio guide.

On the downside the toilets were dirty when we were there, it is expensive at 120TL per person (about 17.50) for the palace/harem ticket and not covered by the museum pass.

When we arrived we were told it was open until 5, but when we went to visit the harem we were told we couldn‚Äôt get in as it was half 4. No warning of this when we bought the ticket and when we asked for a refund on the unused part of the ticket given that they wouldn‚Äôt let us in for a quick walk around, we were told we couldn‚Äôt get one as the ticket office was closed. Felt a little ripped off.

No photos allowed inside and it is hard to understand why they don‚Äôt allow non-flash photography like other sites.

There are 3 different zones in the palace & you have to buy 3 seperate tickets for each I forgot names of sections but I do remember that for main palace from which sultan was taking care general adminstration affairs was prices 60 lira for entry ticket & other 2 zones were 90 & 40 respectively. for the adminstrative zone you dont need any tourist guides because with the ticket you will be given a gadget which gives audio guidence once you tap it to board in any of the room which have wifi sign on it. Audio's were so much in detail & infrom the detail history of almost all objects in the room. Photography are not allowed inside the palace. One more important thing, inorder to get a gadget you need to submit your passport at ticketing sections which you take back in return at exit otherwise they keep 200 lira per gadget as security deposit which is refundable at exit gate.

However, the palace grounds and building were beautiful despite the fact that most of the intricate details on their interior‚Äôs ceiling and walls were painted on instead of real carvings. So the palace cannot be compared to the palaces in Europe.

They had a small museum showcasing the utensils, cutleries and kitchenwares from the ottoman empire if you are into that.

Other than that, the palace was mostly about state rooms for meetings and gardens.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"This place is HUGE. Easily one of the biggest palaces in the world. The rooms, and furnishings are very impressive. Photos are not allowed inside the palace. Our local agent in Istanbul (Efendi Travel) had organised guided tours of the city for us, but inside the palace our small group (we were only three couples, a total of six people) was merged into a larger group, and led around by a palace guide. Some kind of guidance is an absolute must, if you wander around on your own, you would waste a lot of time and still not see all the important areas, rooms, etc... This palace is relatively new, it was built in the mid 1800's. Several historical events relating to recent Turkish history took place here, (Ataturk died here), the guides will explain everything. I repeat: it is huge, it is much better to be guided through this complex than to strike out on your own with an audio guide. You can seek clarifications from a human guide, not from a recorded audio guide! A word of caution: little kids, or for that matter, even teenagers, may be bored with seeing room after room. Also, if you do not have a passion for history you may find the whole thing quite uninteresting. The location of the palace on the Bosporus is fantastic. The views from outside the palace, of the Bosporus, are stunning. Some people may even find the outside more interesting than the inside! You can get great photos from outside. Incidentally, there is a huge cafe just outside the palace, the location could not be better, on the banks of the Bosporus. Food is good. Just outside the palace is the Dolmabahce Mosque. A small, but really beautiful mosque. Well worth seeing. Don't miss it! Photos allowed inside this mosque.

You have to wear one of those plastic booties on your footwear. (Yes they recycle.) There is a fee to enter. I bought a package tour at the airport with the entry/admission fee included. If you go on your own, it looks like it would cost more.
The inside can take a few hours to tour. The path and foot traffic are well coordinated and marked leading you from entrance to exit in a flowing manner. There are impressive chandeliers and authentic Turkish d√©cor to make you awe. There is an audio device that you can use for orientation and to listen to the story and history, free upon request.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"Dolmabah√ße Palace was built towards the end of the Ottoman empire in the mid 1800s. Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I commissioned the construction to replace the medieval Topkapi Palace for his family after seeing the more modern, luxurious and comfortable palaces of his contemporary European monarchs.

No expense was spared in this new palace which boasts 285 rooms, 131 handmade Hereke silk carpets, running water for the 68 water-closets imported from Great Britain and 6 Turkish baths, gas lighting and a 750 bulb, 4.5 ton crystal chandelier, the largest in the world. A stunning fourteen tons of gold were used to decorate the ceilings. The construction cost was five million Ottoman gold lira, or approximately $1.5 billion in today's dollars. Unfortunately, it was built as the Ottoman fortunes were declining. This put additional strain on the financial well being of the declining Ottoman Empire.

Today, it is an amazing palace to visit. The architecture combines elements of Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical European design with Ottoman elements. It is the largest palace in Turkey. It has the traditional elements of the men's quarters (Mabeyn-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn, or Selamlƒ±k) in one wing and the private family quarters (Harem-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn, the Harem) in a different wing separated by a ceremonial hall.

It was interesting to visit Topkapƒ± Palace and Dolmabah√ße Palace back to back to contrast the beginnings and end of the Ottoman Empire. Topkapi is more spread out and decorated extensively with Iznik tiles and classical Ottoman carvings. Dolmabah√ße Palace could be called the ""Crystal Palace"" as it has the largest collection of Baccarat and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the world. It even has a double horseshoe staircase with Baccarat crystal balusters in the staircase.
Unlike many European palaces, this palace could be accessed by land or sea.

After the establishment of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk used the palace as a presidential residence in the summers. He died in the palace on November 10, 1938. The clock in the bedroom where he died is still set to 9:05, his time of death.

This was an amazing place to visit. The palace, gardens and even collection of china and paintings were so beautiful. Most of the original furniture is also on display. We took a private tour with Ensar from Istanbulday to really maximize our understanding, but there are group tours available in several language.

The palace is the largest in Turkey, and the most modern one ever built in the country, order to stand equally impressive next to the ones in Europe at the time it was constructed.

Despite the heavy rain on the day of our visit, a lot of people were standing in line outside for an hour or so until they could enter.

Both the outside and the inside of the palace are equally impressive, for the size of the building as well as the riches and the vibe of opulence in the air.

Easily accessible by tram from the centre of Istanbul or if on the Ferry you come off at Besiktas, turn left on the main road and walk down to the entrance. We must have gone in the low season as whilst there was a queue to get the ticket it wasn‚Äôt very busy in the palace, often having some rooms to yourself. Of course in summer this will be a different story. The ticket can be bought for the main palace building and the harem (Sultans private living quarters) for 90 TL per adult, I thinks it‚Äôs worth it. The walk round is quite long and you will see many rooms filled with ornate designs on the ceilings and some very fine furnishings. I would allow at least 2-3 hours as you may well decide to take a coffee break between seeing the palace and the harem. Also can take plenty of pictures outside but not inside, although I took some cheeky snaps. The grand hall is something to behold. The harem also has the last resting place of Ataturk, the well respected and loved leader of Turkey in Years gone by.

We all were surprised to find out the beauty of this place. I went to Versalles a couple of months ago and believe me, knowing Versalles, you will find this palace to be completely amazing, not to big to get lost in it but with many treasures to be found.

We took four hours to thoroughly see the harem and the selamlik (two hours each). It could be done much quicker but we enjoyed every moment.

The nearest stop to the palace is Kabatas, either ferry across from Kadikoy or tram line T1 last stop. We opted for the latter as not sure how choppy the waters were going to be. A short walk (less than 5 mins) from the tramline and we were there. We got there quite early (about 10ish) so the queue was not too long for tickets. Ticket options are 60 tl for palace, 40 tl for harem or 90tl for both. We did not know he they only accept cash only, be prepared.

Once inside the palace is very grand, ( oh yeah you are asked to put on plastic shoe covers before entering ) lots of chandelier, high ceiling, so many rooms and doors you could get lost. There was a section with blue and clear glass windows which overlooks the sea view. There are selection of drink are, clocks, furnitures,etc.

Amazing floors and ceilings in the palace, not so grand in the Harem except sultan quaters

From exploring this palace, it seems to me that the Sultan's mother had a very prominent role in Turkish society judging by her expansive and lavish living quarters/apartments; more than the Sultan's wife/Queen. I'm really glad I went before opening time, so I was one of the first people to get in, (the 3rd actually). Was able to explore the place in just under 2 hours, though I rushed a bit. The lines to get in are crazy here. There were like 3 tourist groups from Japan, 2 groups from South Korea and 1 from China. By the time I was leaving, tourist buses had filled up the entire parking lot, and lines had snaked round the whole building, so quite glad I avoided the rush. Highly recommended, even though Topkapi Palace tops my list for must see places in Istanbul. Dolmabanche Palace is more glitz and glamour, but Topkapi is more historical and educational.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"On the banks of the Bosphorus, the palace presents a curious mixture of styles. Already in 1700s the Ottomans discovered European architecture and art, these exchanges intensified in the 1800s: the designers of this period were therefore inspired by the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical.

The palace was built in the mid-nineteenth century, in the last period of an Ottoman empire in serious economic crisis: the then sultan spent a fortune to dare visitors to the illusion of a still prosperous empire.

It is a huge complex that contains 285 rooms, 4 large living rooms, 6 galleries, 5 main staircases, 6 Turkish baths and 43 lavatories.

The interior decorations are the work of French and Italian artisans, with ample use of gold (45 tons) and silver, as well as glass, especially in the winter garden: Camli Kosk.

The chandelier in the Throne Room is the largest in Europe, with 750 lamps, weighing 4.5 tons.

Easily accessible from the center (surface T1, get off at the Kabatas terminus); for reasons of security and conservation of the building, the number of visitors is limited to 3000 people per day, a limit frequently reached. Prepare for long queues at the ticket office.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"Dolmabahce is really beautiful. And the location is just perfect. You can see the Bosphorus in all its glory from one side of the building and bustling new city of Istanbul (Taksim area) from the other side. The architecture of Dolmabahce is an amalgamation of old and new style of Turkish architecture and that's what makes it so beautiful and grand.

The entry fees for Dolmabahce is 60 Lira for the main museum and another 40 Lira for Harem (the living quarters). You can club these for 90 Lira special price. This museum is not included in Istanbul or Turkey museum cards.

Reaching here is fairly simple. If you are staying in Taksim area then you can simply walk here. It's around 2 Kms from Taksim square and it's a flat walk. You can also opt for tram or public bus. Kabatas is the nearest tram station and it's a 500 meters walk from there.

Do not forget to opt for free audio guide in the museum. You will have to submit one of your identity proofs as a security for the audio player. You will get it back on your way . out when you submit the player back.

As soon as you enter the palace, you will be greeted by main hall. The aura of this place will simply blow your mind. It's really majestic and beautiful. As you move through the huge wooden doors and peek into different rooms on the way, you will realize what wealth really is. There are also some day to day artifacts from Sultan's time on display here. Even though I have seen my fair share of forts and palaces in India, the difference in style of architecture and the general life depicted through daily use things is very different and interesting.

You can easily spend around 2-3 hours here even if you simply stroll your way to the palace. It's that big. If you have interest in history and want to examine everything closely it would certainly take 4-5 hours to do the tour.

I would suggest going early in the morning if that day is your only choice. They only have three kiosk to buy tickets from.
The tickets are to the Dolmabah√ße palace and you would have to pay extra to visit the Harem which is where Attaturk died.

There is also a clock Museum which has clocks made by Ottoman Mawlawi clock masters English and French crafted clocks.
The Glazed Pavilion was being restored so we really couldn‚Äôt see. There is also an Aviary.
The palace itself is very big and it gives you an insight to how the Sultan lived.
The beautiful furniture, Art work, porcelain, crystal and gold and silver dinnerware sets are stunning.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"The Ottoman sultans shifted from Topkapi Palace to the newly built Dolmabahce Palace in the 1850s. It was designed by the renowned Armenian architect Karabet Balian and his son Nikogos, while the interiors were done by the French decorator Charles Sechan. The building is magnificent, especially the ceremonial hall with its famous Bohemian crystal chandelier glowing with 750 lamps, gifted by Queen Victoria.

Indian tourists who visit Dolmabahce Palace might be reminded of the palaces of Maharajas of Vadodara, Mysore and Gwalior, which date back to the same era.

There is a small, but attractive garden around the buildings, with magnificent magnolias and little ponds with water lilies. Flocks of partridges roam freely. There are excellent views of the sea from the garden.

The interiors are fairly well-preserved and many of the personal belongings of the sultans and their families on display. Unfortunately, they do not permit photography inside.

The palace is broadly divided into two sections: the public and the private (known as the Selamlik and the Harem respectively). You need to buy separate tickets to enter each of them. We, a family of three, had booked tickets on a conducted tour, which took us only to the Harem portion. We had neither the time nor the inclination to visit the other portion, though our guidebook recommends Selamlik over the Harem.

A special feature of this palace is the tastefully furnished chamber where Kemal Pasha Ataturk, the first President of modern Turkey, breathed his last in 1938. The furniture is carefully preserved and the clocks in the room are stopped at 0905, the instant of his death.

have your passport or any national id card with yourself and at the entrance of the palace they give you some headset and audio guide(they are free ) which can be very helpful . it has several languages but they dont give you if you dont have your id card .
the only problems about the place was :

You cannot take pictures. The palace is quite big and the sultan wanted something like the european palaces, he got it but it is even too much of everything inside. Than you see many rooms, all with chairs, tables and chandeliers, therefore after 5-6 in my opinion you have enough. There are some big rooms which are really impressive. You can buy a ticket just for the palace or palace + harem.

Really very little of interest to see inside. The palace is very new, and most of the contents were off-limits, or better examples of the European artefacts could be seen elsewhere in Europe (and probably cheaper).

Not particularly well-conserved (I wonder what they do with all the entrance fees). Exception crowded - with little attempt to control the number of people (perhaps the concept of timed tickets is too difficult). I was surprised by the insistence to weat plastic overshoes to protect the carpet. This presented a slipping hazard and was totally unnecessary given that the carpet was not of any historical relevance whatsoever.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"Dolmabahce Palace is perhaps quite underrated/understated compared to the other places of interest in Istanbul. The palace overlooks the Bosphorus, and is a sight to behold. If one is staying near sultanahmet area, just get on the train towards kabatas station and get down at the last stop. From the station it is a 7-10 mins walk. There are essentially 2 sections to the museum, The palace itselft & The Harem. combined ticket prices was 90 Lira/person. Bought separately, i think it was 60 for the Palace & 40 for the Harem section. Also theres a picture gallery for which the ticket can be bought separately. I'd say just visit the palace & skip the harem section as it just contains the rooms of the Sultan's wives/mother.
Coming back to the palace, i thought it was the most visually striking palace i've visited (i've visited kensington, buckingham palace). The interior and the exterior is worth the admission price and one can take beautiful pictures outside the castle.
One thing to note, it is closed on Monday(i think) and they only admit a certain quota of guests everyday so better go there early.

It lies directly at the side of the Bosphor. You need a whole day to explore it. But take care you have to wait in line to buy your ticket and sometime the ticket window closes if the visitors exceed the number that is allowed per day.
For those who like to visit historical landmarks , this is the right plaice.
It has a coffee shop before you enter by the seaside where you can take your break and have your cold drinks, coffees and desserts after your visit.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"Dolmabah√ße Palace is on the European side of the Bosphorus, about 4 km northeast of Topkapi Palace. By order of the 31st Ottoman Sultan, Abd√ºlmecid I, it was built in 1843 to 1856. The Sultan and his family had lived at the medieval Topkapƒ± Palace, but Abd√ºlmecid wanted a residence comparable to those of his contemporary European monarchs. The former Be≈üikta≈ü Sahil Palace was demolished and replaced by a sprawling palace complex facing the Bosporus, surrounded by well-tended gardens, splashing fountains and graceful walkways. The architecture is stunning, with elements from the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles, blended with traditional Ottoman architecture. The palace consists of three parts the Muayede Salonu (the ceremonial hall), the Mabeyn-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn (or Selamlƒ±k, the men‚Äôs quarters), and the Harem-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn (the residential apartments of the Sultan‚Äôs family). The crystal staircase, in the shape of a double horse shoe, is particularly noteworthy. The ceremonial hall contains a crystal chandelier claimed to be the largest in the world, and the parquet floors in the dining hall are exquisite. The palace also has a large number of Hereke Carpets, and an impressive collection of paintings. Dolmabah√ße was home to six Sultans from 1856 until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924, and was the main administrative building of the Ottoman Empire from 1956 to 1922. Mustafa Kamal Ataturk died here on the 10th of November 1938. The palace was subsequently converted into a museum; it contains 46 halls, 6 baths, 68 toilets and 285 rooms, although not all are open to the public. Dolmabahce Palace is open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm most days, but is closed on Mondays and Thursdays. There is an entry fee of 40 TL for the palace, 30 TL for the harem or 60 TL combined (students 5 TL for each place, and children are free). There can be long lines; early morning is generally less crowded (only 3000 visitors per day are allowed, to preserve the visiting experience). I took an audio tour (in English) during my visit, which greatly enhanced my experience (it was free, but I had to leave my passport to ensure return of the audio device). There is a cafe within the palace grounds, as well as public toilets.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,3.0,"The most important part of your appreciation of any building, museum or palace is the people working there. In my case, I've been there on the 10th of August, I found out myself with a rude selling tickets clerk( the 1st one to the right) who was representing the definition of unprofessionalism( super rude), not talking about the ticket price ( the highest we faced in our 10 days stay in Istanbul), passing by the lady who gave the audio guide (you can easily feel that she hates her job), the people working inside the palace(their job is limited to stare angrily at people and ask them to not take pictures).
The good part of this is that I did although the tour, as I was already on my last day and so far to go back to my hotel. The palace is huge and represents many periods of Sultans lives as well as other periods/ the audio guide provides valuable information in different languages.
PS:I need to say that the last person that we encountered on this palace, was the man who retrieved the audio guide items and gave us our ID back, was the only bright side of this human contact experience, he was welcoming and apologizing when I said that I'm surprised that somebody is smiling here.

My favorite part was the grand ceremonial hall with the huge dome and chandelier. It was extraordinary and what I expected to see at the Hagia Sophia (but did not).

Why didn‚Äôt this get 5 stars? You aren‚Äôt allowed to take photos in the palace. None. Zero. Zip.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"We visited as part of a Bosphorus cruise tour. This is a lovely palace positioned on the banks of the Bosphorus. Constructed in c1852 by the Sultan it offers 280+ rooms (not all viewable!) and from a relatively austere ground floor your tour will take you up a fabulous crystal staircase to the Sultan's apartments which are very grand and culminates in the state receiving room which is enormous and has a ceiling which can only be described as spectacular. Your guided/self-guided tour offers an interesting insight into the lives of the Sultans. Kemal Attaturk lived and died here in 1938. Unfortunately no photographs are allowed inside. The architecture is elaborate and the gardens are very pretty. Worth a visit. Recommended.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"Very few in history of the entire mankind would have lived a more lavish lifestyle , than what you see at display at Dolmabahce Palace .

'Magnum opus' at its best .

There is a ticket to be bought , before you get the entry to the place , and I understand that there's a daily quota too .

Location is in Sultannhmet,Old Istanbul only and can be easily approached via the tram . There is a walking distance of 200-300 meters from the nearest metro station .

What you see inside the palace is treacherously beautiful , the intricacies have been so well defined . Do take note that photo clicks are formally not allowed inside the palace but had seen lot many around us clicking at will . Every inch of the palace is well guarded though.

No to forget :

Very eloquent details of all the memorabilia, some would make sense to all and sundry ( no matter from which part of the world you are).

If short on energies , you might like to slightly hurry up in the interim as there is lot to cover . At a leisure pace give yourself at least 2 hours inside the palace .

The outside views are equally mesmerizing , specially the one from the sea facing embankments. Give yourself at least 2 hours to explore the outer perimeter of the palace .

Not to be missed is the govt. controlled souvenir shop inside the palace , its just at the fag end of the exit once you complete the internal tourist circuit walk . Some best of the class and quality souvenirs at display , same quality is rarely available outside in the local markets in Istanbul . Also the price is controlled , you cant haggle but be assured that pricing is genuine . We spend 3 days more in Istanbul after visiting
Dolmabahce Palace, and regretted not busying more from the souvenir place in
Dolmabahce Palace.

Good ides to plan a day while including Dolmabahce Palace, would be to start with the 2 mosques in the morning , follow it up with a visit to DP , and spend the evening at Taksim square . Don't forget to have a fulsome lunch at the Galata bridge ( those restaurants are actually below the bridge).

For anything , don't forget to click against the beautiful sea facing embankment doors and outer ring facade - will certaiunly be one of the trip memories

Do Dolmabahce Palace & Happy Istanbul to you

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,5.0,"Reading a few TA reviews of the Dolmabahce Palace, I‚Äôm astounded by the misinformation. Some reviewers who appear to have seen it from a boat going up the Bosphorus refrain from rating the restaurant because they didn‚Äôt dine there: this is rather like refraining from rating the restaurant inside the Great Pyramid of Giza or the Washington Monument because they didn‚Äôt dine there! I‚Äôll try to steer clear of misinformation in this review.

The Dolmabahce Sarayi is quite modern by Ottoman Empire standards: Sultan Abdul Mecit I built it in 1856, utilizing the Armenian architects Karabet and and Nicogos Balyan, who specialized in Western European architecture, and who seemed to be inspired by Neoclassicism merged with the Great Exposition‚Äôs Crystal Palace, and such modern conveniences as radiators to keep rooms warm. No expense was spared in making the new palace the equal of anything the sultan‚Äôs recent Crimean War cronies, Napoleon III and Victoria & Albert might dream up. The Sultanate was in decline, but there‚Äôs no hint of that in this grand palace.

The palace has given birth to two worthwhile museums which stand a bit further up the Bosporus and are outside the scope of this review: the National Palaces Painting Museum and the Naval Museum. The Dolmabahce main palace is composed of the Selamlik (state ceremonial rooms, as well as some administrative areas for the sultan‚Äôs staff) and the Harem (the sultan‚Äôs personal living quarters, and that of his wives).

Photographs are permitted outside the palace, but not inside it. This is understandable. Theoretically, if everyone refrained from either using flashes or their camera‚Äôs internal light-meter, no harm would be done to whatever is being photographed. But from Rome‚Äôs Sistine Chapel to Singapore‚Äôs Buddha Tooth Temple, if tourists are permitted to take photographs, a significant percentage will fail to follow those rules. Ergo, protecting some of the most photogenic places on Earth means no photos inside at all. However, you‚Äôll find lots of photo ops outdoors, For example, the palace‚Äôs extraordinary Bosporus-front facade (see Facade photo), the Bosporus itself (Bosporus photo), the 32-meter high Clock Tower (Clock Tower photo), the Imperial Gate (Gate photo), the gardens (Roses and Bamboo photos), the fountains (Swan Fountain and Harem Fountain photos‚Äîthe pink building behind the second fountain is the Harem), the Dolmabahce Mosque and its minarets (Mosque and Minarets photo), and even peafowl (Peacock and Peahens photos).

You can choose to go through either the Selamlik or the Harem, or you can go to both for 90 lira. You can wander around individually on your own, or take a guided tour, If you prefer to go at your own pace, you can get audio tours in several different languages, including English. Or you can just pick up a leaflet in your language of choice. If you‚Äôve only time to go to one area, and are not Turkish, I would recommend you see the Selamlik, not the Harem. If you are Turkish, I would recommend you see the Harem, not the Selamlik. But whether you‚Äôre Turkish or not, I‚Äôd strongly recommend you take the time‚Äî2 to 4 hours‚Äîto go through both. The rooms (there are over 200 of them) are all identified with placards, although the identifications are fairly general.

Within the Selamlic, the luxurious Sudera Salon was where ambassadors would wait for an audience with the sultan. The adjoining Red Room was where the sultan would receive them. The Crystal Staircase and the Ceremonial Hall are the two more imposing areas of the palace. The Staircase‚Äôs vaulted ceiling is glass; the immense chandelier above the staircase is cut glass; and the balusters on either side of the staircase and around the upper level are also exquisite cut glass (if you look carefully you‚Äôll see what appears to be upright metal rods in the balusters, easing the burden). The Ceremonial Hall alone, with its spectacular dome, can hold 2,500 persons!

There are several ‚Äútreasures halls‚Äù containing baccarat and Bohemian crystal, formal coffee-ware, tea-ware, ceremonial military swords, medals, and so on: all are identified by the curators. You‚Äôll also see spectacular gowns, music rooms with instruments, a stunning library, several Turkish baths, and grand furniture everywhere, The palace paintings should be particularly interesting to visitors from France and the USA; I‚Äôll explain why at the end on this review.

Although I did strictly comply with the ‚Äúno photographing inside‚Äù rule, I was able to get one perfectly legal photo of the Selamlik interior‚Äîby using a telephoto lens to shoot through the exit door after I was outside. It‚Äôs a far, far cry from what you can see when you are actually inside the room, but even that wee slice of the interior‚Äîa single half-dome and one large crystal chandelier‚Äîgives a hint as to how spectacular the vision is from inside the palace (Ceremonial Hall from Outdoors photo).

The Harem is, in general, less striking than the Selamlik, although there are several huge sitting rooms, and a dizzying number of rooms for the Sultan‚Äôs wives. You‚Äôll see an immense room with huge and beautiful wardrobe cases lined up against every wall. I can imagine a sultan rummaging through one wardrobe after another, getting increasingly frustrated, tearing his hair out, and thinking to himself ‚ÄúGood grief, I know that dark purple kaftan with the gold embroidery‚Äôs got to be in ONE of these dratted wardrobes!‚Äù Except, of course, he‚Äôd simply have a minion fetch it for him.

I‚Äôm not sure being the wife of a sultan was always a pleasant life to have, but I do believe that being the MOTHER of a sultan was a pretty enviable position to be in. In addition to her palatial private rooms, the Sultan‚Äôs mother would deign to receive her boy‚Äôs various wives in a Blue Salon that is almost as stunning as the Red Room where her son received foreign dignitaries.

But the reason why I would encourage any visitor to the palace should go through the Harem, has nothing to do with a sultan‚Äôs wives at all. Rather, it‚Äôs a relatively modest room, with a single bed draped with the Turkish flag: the deathbed of Kemal Ataturk, one of the great national patriots of any country, in history. Other countries have had visionary statesmen (Sun Yat-Sen, Gandhi, Jefferson, and Mandela come to mind) and brilliant military leaders (Saladin, Hannibal, Nelson, and Alexander come to mind), but few countries have had men who combined visionary statesmanship with brilliant military genius: Ataturk did, and the room where his life ended was, for me, a sacred place. The crystal stairwells and grand ceremonial halls may be more impressive, but Ataturk‚Äôs deathbed is far more moving. I believe every clock in the palace is now stopped at the minute of his death.

p.s. The palace paintings: Most of them are from the 19th century French School of Romanticism and Orientalism, with grand cavalry charges, battle scenes, desert caravans, sand-storms and such. Quite a few of the paintings in the palace were painted by Georges Washington, which will astonish many a Yankee visiting the palace. Georges Washington was a name the Marseilles-born Orientalist assumed; he had no idea what his father‚Äôs actual surname was. Georges Washington did travel to the Ottoman Empire for artistic inspiration. He also traveled to the USA, where his brother-in-law exhibited a 360-degree panorama of the Battle of Gettysburg. Washington later lived in a modest apartment in Montmartre; Auguste Renoir later rented the same lodging; I don‚Äôt know whether it was technically a garret. Another contemporary French painter was named Charles Chaplin. You‚Äôll find battle scenes from the Crimean War and many another conflict. One of the battle paintings in the palace is of the Greco-Turkish War. Given the uniforms, I suspect this was the first, 1897, Greco-Turkish War (which the Turks won, beating Prince Constantine) rather than the far more important post-World War I Greco-Turkish War (which the Turks also won). Either victory would have been appropriate to this palace: the first Greco-Turkish War, in a way, was the swan song of the Ottoman Empire; but the second was the birth of modern Turkey. Istanbul is still Istanbul today, not Constantinople, because Kemal Ataturk overwhelmed the Greek army of King Constantine.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,4.0,"We arrived at 10am and there was a long lineup to get past security and also to buy tickets. It costs TRY 90 to get in the main area and the Harem. But if you buy it separately, I believe it'll cost you TRY 60 + 40.

Anyway, they provide garterized plastic to put on your shoes right beside you walk in the palace. They have a lot of items on display, very nice and intricate designs on both ceiling and walls. It's a feast for the eyes. However, my main complaint is that it was very crowded inside. There were some school groups, which made it even crowdier. You also cannot take any pictures inside. And there aren't much information written on the rooms. So if you don't have an audio guide, you pretty much don't know anything. There were also lots of chairs on display, but ironically, there are none for tourists to sit on. Also, their Harem is quite big as well, much nicer than the Topkapi Harem in my opinion. Oh, one more thing, for a place this big, they only have minimal toilets. Expect to spend time lining up to use the bathroom.

Turkey,Dolmabahce Palace,1.0,"While the Dolmabahce palace is an interesting and historical building, I hate to say that a xenophobic employee dampened my experience. I filled out a paper survey that they have but I highly doubt it would ever be read.

First off, we arrived around 9:30 and everyone had to go through security check before they can buy the tickets. It took only 20 minutes in security and another 10 to get to the ticket counter. I wanted to purchase the full ticket at 90 TL. The old man with beard working in the second counter today told us the Harem is closed and that we can only purchase the main palace ticket. When I nicely asked why it was closed, he got rude for no reason and said we could not buy. Then he talked to the next customer behind me and asked him what he wanted. I wasn‚Äôt even finished and he just let what was obviously a Turkish person cut right before my eyes and handled the transaction even though I was still there at the counter. After that person left with their tickets, he tells me, ‚ÄúGive me 120.‚Äù I was purchasing for two. I honestly don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve provoked someone to such rudeness but did notice that there were a large group of tourists (actual tour companies) from another part of the world there at once and he probably got tired of seeing them including myself who looked like people from these group.

Long story short, I was able to get information from other employees there that the Harem was closed and under renovation. The audioguides are a must because there aren‚Äôt that many signs; the content were sufficient. The grounds and building themselves weren‚Äôt impressive.

Go if you like but be aware of the old man at the ticket counter.

Next tip - get the combined ‚Äòofficial palace‚Äô and ‚Äòharem‚Äô ticket as it‚Äôs very interesting to see not only the formal palace but also the Sultans‚Äô private accommodations (harem doesn‚Äôt just mean a bunch of concubines).

It seems the designer of the Paris Opera was brought in to do the interiors which explain its similarity with Versailles Palace in Paris.
The decorations of the rooms are very tastefully and stunningly designed which gives an awesome grandeur visual treat. The variety of the luxurious artefacts placed in different rooms, the exquisite materials used for wall decoration, the beautiful paintings on the roof of the rooms is mesmerising. The 4.5 ton chandelier gifted by the queen of England is remarkable.
It‚Äôs stunning view from the entrance is unique and gorgeous. It appears that suddenly there is an European Palace in Turkey. The location is also very nice as it is on the edge of Bosporus which has further added to the beauty of the palace. The garden is also exquisitely laid, beautifully designed and very well maintained.
Taking photos inside the Palace is strictly not allowed. There is a combo ticket which includes Harem, but the Harem in Topkapi palace is better so it is not recommended. It is better to visit this in the morning, as it takes time to relish the beauty of the Palace and it seems only certain numbers of visitors are allowed per day. After 3:00pm only self guided tour tickets are sold.

Turkey,Kaleici,4.0,"What a quaint and fabulous part of Antalya old town! The streets, restaurants, historic monuments are very intriguing. Highly recommend staying inside the old town for a few days to experience it the right way.

Beach to swim: Mermerli. There are a few on the water docks to choose from but there is a small fee to enter of 40 TL. Water is calm but a bit rocky. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs a great place to relax, swim, have beer and soak in the gorgeous view of the mountains footed by the ocean.

Also check out Adalar Beach Club and Lanthe Beach near beach park. Nice spots to getaway and they have private areas to go into the waters. The swimming area is around a small cove so waters can be calmer than the ocean itself. Lanthe beach has more options for food and alcoholic drinks. Adalar beach club is basic in menu.

There are a slew of restaurants in Kaleici that need no introduction. Just walk, see the menus and go into the most crowded places. Be sure to have either Sarafin or Suvla local wine with your food.

Some great hotels to consider during your stay in Kaleici: Casa Sur, Hotel Aspen, Alp Pasha, Cape d‚ÄôPerge.

I also recommend renting bikes from the hotel and riding around old town. Maybe venture off to Konyalti beach but it‚Äôs 12 km from Kaleici roughly.

For massage I recommend the City Fitness & Spa located at the Ramada Plaza. They usual have sales and got a 60min massage for 40 euros. It‚Äôs just a very nice ambiance.

No loud bars breaking into your dream in the middle of a night, no crowds of tourists leisurely spending their vacation in shops or restaurants, no crowds of shopkeepers inviting you in all languages imaginable to visit their place. Quiet of not silent. Empty if not deserted. Spooky at nights more, especially when you are passing by the many ruins of once beautiful old houses. Your heart breaks every time when you see this agonising glory. Difficult to find decent food too, as you get tired of the ever grilled, deep fried, super sliced and super salty local fast food, the only available for take away. (Hence, check out all the hotels with restaurants. Some of them are open and can serve you). But the sun is still shining. The sea is still blue. The renovated houses look as magnificent as ever.

We called our hotel and they said jump in a taxi, it's a famous hotel, everybody knows it.

We thought this driver must have been from out of town because he didn't seem to know the hotel, punched it into Google maps and still asked for directions 4 times before going doing the wrong street to then ask for directions again

Then we got another taxi who pretty much did the same. Because the tourism industry is dying the taxi drivers all seem to play dumb on famous locations and not only drive the wrong way but dangerous ways and waste your time.

Go outside the gates (Hadrian) and discover further afield on the excellent Tram/Bus systems

After passing the mosque, turn left and you will get to the observation deck from which you can see the old port.
Take a picture, then after the gazebo there will be a staircase, go along it boldly and you will find yourself in the old port.
You need to go everywhere and if your stomach allows you, be sure to take pomegranate juice along the wayüëå.
I liked it right after descending the stairs in front of the stairs leading to the port.
By the way, free toilets (W/S) are located there.

The view point at the ""Toplani"" cafe is where this picture is taken from which allows you to see how much the Romans achieved of which a lot remains to view.
Within the old city walls the narrow streets are adorned with numerous colourful Bougainvillea plants which are just stunning in flower.
Finally if your after those quaint Boutique hotels for a night or two on a city break this is the place ! Everything on your doorstep with Sunshine too, most have their own pools if you prefer to the sea.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"Kalei√ßi is the historic port and walled old town of Antalya. Its name means ""Inside the Kale"" (Kale is a castle or fortress). It started as the ancient city of Attalia, founded during the Hellenistic period, later becoming an important port in the Roman Empire. Kalei√ßi has a mix of historic buildings: Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk, Ottoman and modern Turkish republican, but most buildings date to the late 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the traditional Turkish homes are still occupied by residents, and many have been converted into boutique hotels, restaurants, cafes, and shops selling handicrafts and folk arts. It is a great place to explore cobbled streets, garden parks, historic mosques, traditional Turkish homes (wood with overhanging second-floor balconies), the harbor, and other historic sites. A good place to start is Kale Kapƒ±sƒ±, the main square, with the Saat Kulesi (clock tower), built during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºl Hamid II. Look for the statue of King Attalus II of Pergamon, who founded the city of Attalia around 150 BC. From there, you can enter the old town by walking into Uzun √áar≈üƒ± Sokak, located opposite the clock tower. Kalei√ßi is accessible at all times with no entry fee.

There is a lovely marina which offers boat rides around the bay and the views are pleasing to the eye.
There are many shopping areas, each offering the many fake goods, tops, shoes, leather, bags..they may not be originals but the quality is very good.
I love the banter to negotiate a price and the Turkish people love it too...all amiable, no hassle.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"It's like a proper old city. You get authentic vibes of walking through some game of thrones like setting when you walk down to marina in the congested streets of Kaleici. The old stone houses and random towers, all add to the vibes. Plus, thousands of shops selling eatables to souvenirs to Turkish delights to even rugs and handmade paintings. And hundreds of cafes with people sitting outside sipping on tea or coffee and laughing their heart out. Graffiti on the walls. And the noise of mediterranean water bumping on the shore. It was an amazing experience. You will never get bored walking down these streets.

Just be cautious while buying anything eatable from the shops though. Especially from the shops selling Turkish delights or Turkish tea at dirt cheap prices. I got a box of Turkish delights for 6 Lira from the old city as I thought it was so so cheap. I already had reservations about the authenticity of the sweets though so as soon as I bought the packet, I opened it up and tried it. And it was pathetic. So don't buy anything eatable from small shops unless they allow you to try it first.

Also, Kaleici is very famous for its night life. This is the only place in Turkey where we saw everything light up as soon as the sun went down, Many pubs/bars and restaurants with live music and tourists dressed up for partying. If you like Thailand and Cambodia like partying, this place is certainly for you.

Overall you can easily spend many hours here. Either roaming around the streets or in one of the cafes or restaurants by the road.

Its in the heart of history, so many hidden stories left unsaid. You can see it all by taking one look at the doors and the walls, they all tell stories.

I spent most of my time chatting to local vendors, sipping on Turkish tea and hearing about their existence, the economy and the hidden gems in their home town.

I met so many kind hearted people, its one of the happiest memories I have. A true treasure actually.

Walk the streets, eat the food, talk to locals and live through their stories. This was the highlight of my trip, the people!

This place had no trash on the ground whatsoever. In fact, neither did the whole of our route to and from our hotel, airport, the old town and environs by taxi, shuttle and walking. I went out of my way looking for fallen trash and found none. I wish the whole Middle East were like this. The only other place I saw so clean was Tehran, Iran. How do they get their citizenry to take care??? If there is any trash around, I don't believe it would be its citizens, but the tourists, those who are used to throwing trash out of car windows and onto the roads without a care.

We had a child with us, he really enjoyed the place they shelter cats. A happy place specially at night when you can enjoy street music performances. The only things that let us down were the high prices for tourists. The icecream which is maximum 5 lira for locals they charged us 20 per person!!! Or at the restaurant they charged us more than the menu saying you ordered big dish although no one asked us about the size.
Rule number one in Antalya: Ask the price first
Rule number two: Ask about the details. Size and stuff. Make sure you will get exactly what you want. Not more not less

There are a couple of beach clubs nearby but in August we found the main one so busy, with sun-beds rammed up against each other, that it was not a nice experience.

Turkey,Kaleici,4.0,"Loved Kaleici old town. We spent 8 days here, but to be honest, 5 days is more than enough. Last two days, we spent sitting at the park near the sea reading. Kaleici
is full of bazaars but all fakes, which i hated. I cant think of anything worse than seeing hundreds of identical stalls selling designer fakes. The fake bags were shabby and woe betide you if you said they were fakes to the stall owner.
Mostly pleasant but you got the odd miserable idiot who wanted you to buy without even browsing.
Overall, everything is very expensive. Everyone dealt in euros which made the whole holiday very costly. Liras were accepted but beware when asking prices as they say the first ridiculous high price that pops into their heads. Haggle and bargain or walk away. Dont let them rip you off.
Kaleici has beautiful old ruins, stunning mosques, and a gorgeous marina. All within walking distance. There is even a huge five floor shopping mall called Markantalya Mall, nearby.
Food generally is cheap, but all that seems to be available us donner kebabs. Theres only so much greasy donner i could bear. There is pizza available too but its a bit more pricey.
There is Mcdonalds and Burger Kings and Starbucks there too.
The cobbled streets to the marina were so stunning with overhanging pink flowers everywhere.
Be careful when buying Zultenite jewellery as im not sure if it was genuine.

I found it relatively quiet in the daytime, but in the evening busy with plenty of bars, a few clubs and plenty of places to eat. It is quite tidy with most of the buildings restored, and some in need of TLC. There is a nice place overlooking the harbour offering Chai, Coffee, snacks and ice cream during the day, and restaurant by night. Where Kaleici meets main shopping area of Antalya there is the traditional tram system that goes through Antalya, along the coast to the beach resort area and Antalya Museum.

It's a lovely old town with much to see and admire, must have been hundreds of years as seen by some of the ruins and the stone houses.

Most of the dwellings has been turned into a boutique hotel or a small family run restaurant.

Though life starts late and it gets pretty lively at night. A good blend of tourist from all over the world.

Many restaurant serves good food and most of them are friendly and smily, though you get some bad apples. I find that most of the restaurant serves good food and affordable.

Pilav rice with chicken, add some pickles, tastes is so good and it cost only 7tl. Average cost of a dish arounf 20tl.

Fruits juices stalls at every corner and freshly pressed pomegranate at 8tl and orange juice at 5tl.

Allow at least 1 full day to fully appreciate this remarkable place and to absorb the sights, smells and sounds of a truly remarkable Turkish gem. If you're wondering where to eat amongst all the fabulous restaurants I'd highly recommend Vanilla. If you're looking for Jewellery then I'd recommend Excalibur and if you're looking for a place to stay then Delight Deluxe Boutique Hotel is perfect for a short stay.

We saw Hadrian's gate but the other sights of interest in the old town we couldn't find using the directions and one of the minarets was covered in scaffolding. We rode past on the bus one evening and it looked lovely lit up and had lots of restaurants so may be that's a better time to visit.

It s down hill to the water front and then there is a elevator to return to the upper level. If you have the time a cruise on a Gulet ,which range from 1 to 6 hours is interesting and enjoyable.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"The old town is lovely in terms of views and things to see. Very historic in nature. Wear comfortable shoes as its very rocky and you will constantly be going up and down steep roads, extremely tiring after a while. It took me about two days to explore the whole old town but a day is enough to get get a feel and experience what it's all about.

Plenty of places to eat and dine. There are loads of market stalls going down tot he marina and bazaars around the area. be sure to haggle as the prices they throw at you are ridiculous I paid 20 Lira for two bracelets, walked down the road to a proper shop and they were priced at 3 lira for one or 4 for 10. There are loads of fake clothes and bags, they are not real, even if the shop keeper guarantees the authenticity. if you would still like to buy some I would advice going out of the city centre into more loca bazaars where they are a lot cheaper! I bought a little designer coin purse for 5 lira, though it took extreme negotiation skills. Dont be afraid to walk away as they often call you back at the price you want.

You can walk down to the marina which is nice. You can pay around 90lira or 10 euros or so to go on a little boat trip. Nice trip, though you dont really see the caves or anything close up, thats what the excursions are for.

They have quite alot of bars there too. The people are really friendly and service is good.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"Spent a few afternoons wandering around the Old Town, harbour and historical sites in the Keleici area pf Antalya. There is a lot to see and take in so recommend spreading this over a couple of afternoons or more if you can afford to do so. The old bazaar is good for the usual knock off bargains (be prepared to look around, try on, and haggle like a local:-)We didn't find anyone to be too rude or too pushy.Do however check your goods once in the bag if ypu haggle tp the point of annoying the seller..my other half haggled over a sheesha pipe a bit too much and the vendor took off the front part of the pipe which we didn't realise until it was too late!This was poor but that's probably just that individual.
A walk down to the harbour through more lovely old cobbled streets is a must(or there's a lift that goes down from the road level from the main concourse where the tram drops you off).
Highlight for me was getting off at Hadrians Gate and walking around the Beautiful Old town (10 mins walk from the old bazaar. Worth the trip. We wer based by the museum so tool the old tram to the Old Town which is highly recommended for the experience and views along the seafront (although dont if you are in a rush as they come every half hour so it can be quite a wait).

The Marina is lovely, with boat trips to be booked and more restaurants to eat in, sitting watching the sun go down over the mountains.

Kaleici is a beautiful place to visit and the old town offers many market to shop for gifts at a cheap price. Make sure you haggle for the best price and start haggling from the beginning if you are buying a-lot. This area is walking distance of Mark Antalya Mall and this mall has shop such as MAC, H&M and many more popular brand name shops. In this area you will find many food shops Turkish restaurants and also burger king and KFC.

I purchased a fake Gucci belt for 250 lira, I could have haggled more but i was tired. The quality of their fake goods are perfect. Make sure you go there with enough sleep because haggling makes you tired. You will do a lot of walking on this day you visit Kaleici but make sure you take the lift down to the old town first before you explore the streets and Mall above. You will not get lost, everyone is very helpful in giving directions.

A lot of the things are in walking distance and lots of tourists shops sell all sorts. There is more to do around Antalya if you have the time and energy. Taxis are reliable and trustworthy. Just ensure to ask for a price before you start your journey. A must, is a cost to Konyaaltƒ± beach. About 10 minutes in a taxi. It is a pebble beach that goes on for several kilometres. Suits the sunbathers and swimmers or just enjoying the clean warm water. As a Muslim family, there were plenty of women in burkinis and you can higher small hut for privacy. Definitely worth a visit.

I would advise those who love history, peace and quiet and music and art to stay at one of the hotels here and enjoy the different attractions in Kalei√ßi and then enjoy other attractions that you can easily reach from this place via easily available and varied transportation means (bus, tram, taxi, bike or motor bike or car rentals...) as this is a central place! Enjoy your vacation!

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"I loved walking around this easily negotiated old town. I found the lovely little marina with its tourist ships, fishing ships, a waterfall and views of misty mountains across the water. Sat in a cafe in the shade for ages gazing at the view before i walked out on a very dodgy thin breakwater out into the middle of the little harbour for a few photos. Then i took the lift up to the old town ( how civilised) and walked to yet another Hadrian‚Äôs arch. A walk in the not very good bazaar followed. In all these places i have felt very safe. Lots of tourists here.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed the old town of Kaleici. The narrow streets, which give you a proper Mediterranean feel, with lots of shops and restaurants were a joy to walk!

You will find plenty of variety of shops, including street stalls and bazaar shops! So you can get the fakes at reasonable prices if you haggle to high-quality antique items!

We really enjoyed the fresh juices sold on the streets throughout Kaleici.

I strongly suggest going on a boat tour (6 hours) along the coast. You get to swim in the Mediterranean for about a half hour then continue to see the rest of the sights. lunch is included. Try to get there at least an hour before the boat leaves or you will not find a place to sit.

Turkey,Kaleici,3.0,"We cycled to the old town from our hotel. It's very quaint with lovely winding narrow streets and lots of tourist shops, but beware! The majority of shops you go in to, the owner will follow you round and try and encourage you to buy something which is annoying and puts you off buying anything. Lots of them are also very over priced and it's only when you try and leave that they offer you a better (but not by much!)price. Some shops have obviously realised how off putting this is as we passed one that had a sign saying 'hassle free shopping'! We did actually find one other tiny shop that was completely hassle free but it's a gamble! There seem to be some shops selling nice jewellery and artisanal products together with plenty that sell the usual holiday tat. Lovely views and worth a trot round to see Hadrian's gate.

There are shops/traders on the slopping hill down towards the harbour and most traders ask once politely and aren't too pushy for you to visit their shop. Eating here is cheap but don't forget to tip well. Not a great deal to do for teenagers so you might only want to stay a couple of hours.

Turkey,Kaleici,4.0,"We are staying, for the second time, in the old town. It is lovely with winding streets, shops and restaurants. We love the feeling of being amongst the history and getting lost amongst the old buildings. Virtually everyone you meet is welcoming and friendly. Bargaining for goods is good natured banter. The streets are spotlessly clean and cleaners clean them daily. It is a lovely stroll down the hill to the harbour and there is the benefit of the free glass lift to take you back to the top again. Our favourite place is the beautiful park near the Hidirlik tower.

I would, however, give the following cautions.

Be careful when ordering drinks;
- Some places will give you the expensive Efes and give the locals the cheaper version. Check the menu and point out the exact one you want rather than just asking for a beer.
- The symbol for a lira is similar to the euro. Make sure that the prices you are looking at are liras, especially on the road next to the tram stop or you may end up paying up to 4 times the price!
- We found that a couple of bars aren't really interested in the tourist trade. As you can't get alcohol outside of the old town these bars are drinking places for locals ( especially Kalekapi just inside the entrance!! We felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome!)

Wear shoes with good gripping soles. I nearly slipped a couple of times on the polished ground and saw a few other people sliding about.

The place comes to life from early evening until late into the night, it is very quiet during the day and not all shops and restaurants are open.

We entered the old town from the famous Hadrian‚Äôs Gate & lost ourselves in narrow lanes of beautiful Kaleici, where each door was a craft in itself, blooming flower pots adorned every wall & pretty caf√© d√©cor added vibrant flavor to each of these lanes. We did try out famous Turkish tea served in their exquisite crockery, shopped at their souvenir stalls & also picked up spices from the shops offering wide range of spices including few erotic ones. We further strolled down to the sea front at Old City Marina offering a spectacular view with various boats lined on the deck, tiny stairs from the boutique hotels leading directly to the blue waters giving ultimate de-stress goals. We walked out of this beautiful maze & toured around Tekeli Mehmet Pa≈üa Mosque, Clock Tower & various fashion brand stores adorning the street. We headed back to our hotel by evening, after quickly grabbing, the must to eat Shawarma at the restaurants, on Ataturk Street with trams running on each direction for a tour of historical places.
The boutique hotels in Kaleici aren‚Äôt expensive & best to stay to enjoy the local culture. Also if you don‚Äôt want to walk the entire route, there is always tram available to take you through the main spots, but it doesn‚Äôt go down to the old town.

Just as you would expect- narrow cobbled streets, quaint little souvenir shops and quirky cafes and lots of beautiful, happy, healthy and well-fed looking cats and dogs lounging around.
Yes you do get called in to go into the shops by the owners and they do try and sell you stuff, but at the end of the day its their livelyhood and if you remember how most of their trade is done during the tourist season as they don't get that many people visiting in winter at all.
I travelled with a 10kg hand luggage allowance only and simply couldn't buy any souvenirs apart from a few cheap bead bracelets and a keyring. As I explained myself to the shop owners, they totally understood (most of them speak good English) and they were still totally friendly, even though I had already said I wasn't going to buy anything. I took lots of photos and drank lots of free tea with the shop owners and talked about politics, fashion, weather and all things in between.

Turkey,Kaleici,5.0,"True flavor of ancient Turkish culture. It is an absolute delight to stroll through the narrow cobbled streets of Kaleici. Lined with shops, stores, eateries and accommodations - each unique and quaint.

A foodies paradise - each of the restaurants is unique in decor and as quaint as it can be. Good food too.

Although I did not stay in the old town area, but looking at the hotels there I was compelled to think why did I not do so! They looked so inviting.

For shoppers, Kaleici can be a satiating experience. You can get the most extraordinary souvenirs in addition to the general run-of-the-mill stuff.

One can walk for hours and hours here even aimlessly because each street, each corner has something different to offer. And then you hit upon the sea front with a view seems specially created by God. Lined with cafes and restaurants of all kinds.

The sunset on the sea front at Kaleici is breathtaking. It's a must for all visitors.

If you are in Antalya, Kaleici will be one of your high points for sure.

And up your walk at the Harbor District, try local things, speak with the friendly locals, and you will get a memory of a life time.

Staff were wearing masks, there were some points of sanitiser dispensers throughout, the museum was closed to prevent spread of the virus, and there were limited access restrictions in places like the souvenir shop. Saying that, not all tourists were wearing masks, and the amount of people in main areas like the mausoleum and memorabilia showcases were not monitored.

Turkey,Anitkabir,3.0,"Seems that every tour to Ankara is taken to Anitkabir. It's OK and offers some insights into the hero-worship that Turks have for Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic. But the mausoleum itself is not all that impressive. Built in similar style as the mausoleums of Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong (actually, I guess they came after), it's just a big-columned structure idolizing the founding leader. The mausoleum is stark and bare inside. The most interesting part of the visit was seeing the school groups and how they behaved during their obligatory visits, and the changing of the guard (which was interesting but not as impressive as some other such exercises in other countries). If you have limited time in Ankara, better to plan to spend more time at the amazing Anatolian Civilizations Museum.

Turkey,Anitkabir,5.0,"This is an utterly fascinating place! You cannot miss it, even if you are in Ankara for just a day. Basically, it is the mausoleum of Ataturk, but there is much more to see than just a tomb. The whole place is paradise for photo and history buffs. You enter the central area through a broad road, lined with statues of lions. At the end of this road is a huge courtyard, with Ataturk's tomb on the left and a museum on the right. You need at least two hours to see everything. It would be good if you can budget three hours. Wear GOOD walking shoes, there is plenty of walking to be done. People with a stroller may have some difficulties, there are quite a few stairs. I did not see arrangements for wheelchairs, you may need to check. Little kids may find this quite trying. Also, I don't think this place would appeal to teenagers. But, if you have even a little interest in history, this is indeed paradise. So much information on modern Turkish history, on Ataturk, on his life, etc...etc... And so many photogenic buildings. I went by taxi, the driver dropped me off at the main gate. It was quite a walk, uphill, to the Lion walkway, and then there was more walking. There must be some way to directly access the Lion walkway. If so, you can save yourself a long uphill walk, and also save a lot of time! It is perhaps the most impressive mausoleum in the whole world. It left me with a sense of awe.

For me, a Nordic visitor, the importance of Atat√ºrk is fascinating. The museum around the mausoleum gives you an idea how loved he was and is. I saw many families and couples taking photos Anitkabir on background and studying the museum very carefully.

I recommend this place because its importance for Turkish people, there‚Äôs something special how they talk about Atat√ºrk, the father of the Turkey. Based on what I saw I think he was a man with academic background but he could touch the people of Turkey by the way he spoke. And being a soldier finalized his heroic status.

This museum is a must if you want to learn about and understand Turkish society. My favorite places within this museum are the murals and art galleries. I could stay all day in those rooms alone. It's very impressive. The amount of Turkish influence in advancement with so many fields of study was also impressive. My kids really enjoy running around the square and seeing the changing of the guards. They don't like the museum as much because they get bored but I sure do like it.

Brilliantly built - huge and yet inside surprisingly intimate. We went late in the day so it wasn't crowded but we should have got there earlier - I'd say around 3pm - we would have had more time to take it all in. There's a museum that goes from the right hand side of the main structure, underneath and comes out on the left - do it! It has Turkish Republic history in a nutshell with lots of Ataturk memorabilia. The whole site is full of wonderful 1930s art and sculpture which I wasn't expecting. There's a drama to it all reminiscent of the Russian style of art at the time. Look at everything, it's worth it, but not on a very hot sunny day, there's not a lot of shade outside. Oh, and my son found out skateboards are not allowed on the site!!

His mausoleum, museum and the 3-dimensional portrayal of the hideousness of the war that under his leadership allowed Turkey to become a republic after the fall of the Ottoman Empire is truly representative of the pride and nationalistic spirit of Turkey. It is definitely worth a trip. Count on about 2 hours. As adults we had visited one time and before we returned with our two elementary aged children we created a 30-point scavanger hunt. We selected specific physical things to look for (lions on the walkway), points of interest in the paintings (Ataturk with a hat, Ataturk on a horse) , as well as different reprsenations in the 3-dimensional mural (a soldier with a flag, Ataturk with binnoculars). They recorded each successful ""treasure"" with the camera on their phone. It made for a more interesting time for the children and allowed us to have meaningful conversations after our visit.

The man seems to be always lonely just like all dictators. He has had just co-operators, servants, soldiers, but not friends, no family. We cannot see a human being in this museum just shadows of a very contradictional man. Why is it so necessary to idealize a human being? I think that he and his memory is used for something, but I do not know for what. But it is a fact that the ordinary Turkish people coming in masses into this Mausoleum and take pictures by the ugly painting.

You start by walking up a wide staircase onto the lion road [there were stone lions on both sides all down theis walkway] and far beyond there is a large flag piole with the Turkish flag that can be seen all over Ankara. Then down to a large flagged area with buildings on 2 sides, the road andthe mausoleum making the 4th side. It was a snowy day so I felt sorry for the very young soldiers standing on honour guard all around the area.There is a speach made by Atarturk in from memory 1933 which our interpreter says is coming true today. It exhorts unity and pride in Turkey as being the way forward for Turks. The Mausoleum itself if both impressive and without and frills, the sarcophagus itself is plain stone with no words.

Go early before 9 am, stand in queue and enter as soon as the mausoleum opens, that way you will get the best pictures in the outside grounds. Once you are done with the tour inside, you may get lucky to witness soldiers parade by paying tribute to the founder. Must visit the gardens at the back - it gets busy with school field trips and tourists so get your photos done early on when entering as by the time you come out - the place will be packed!

Turkey,Anitkabir,5.0,"The Ataturk Mausoleum symbolises 2 important points, For one, it is the mausoleum for the highly respectable late admiral Ataturk who fought tirelessly for what turkey is today and secondly, it reflects the spirit of strong nationalism and patriotism of the Turks for their country and for Ataturk.

The place is huge with the main display area on the right which houses Atat√ºrk‚Äôs main mausoleum and it is heavily guarded with scores of his personal belongings, copies of letters from foreign head of governments, titles and awards, huge pictures complete with both written & audio narrations on how he has won the war for Turkey against Greece‚Äôs aggression in the famous war of √áanakkale battle in 1921.

There is a well stored souvenir shop when one can buy memorable mugs, tie pins, t-shirts, caps, posters, replica statute etc of this incredible statesman that commands phenomenal respect of every Turk.

Not forgetting to view the change of guards at every half an hour interval at the open square and it is definitely a beholding sight not to be left out.

Also worth seeing is the section on the left that housed Atat√ºrk‚Äôs limousines where one can see clearly what were the cars he used to travel around in the early 20th century.

So if you are in Ankara and interested to history, museum and culture, I recommned to visit it definitely.

The Mausoleum is in a big square. When you stand in front of the mausoleum, enter the museum on the right side. It is for free and you can get an English speaking soldier who will guide you through the whole museum.
The museum explains how modern Turkey was built and what role Mustafa Kemal Ataturk played in the founding of the nation. At a certain moment, you pass a huge door behind which Ataturk rests.

We made it a day trip to Ankara just to see it, and we were not disappointed! This is a fitting and appropriate tribute to the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey.

I have been to Mount Vernon in Virginia and couldn't help thinking about it as I walked through the museum that has been added. It's not really a fair comparison. Both Turkey and the USA owe eternal debts to their founders, but Turkey would literally not exist without Ataturk. So while you might think this colossus is over the top, it really could not be more perfect. Turkey and the rest of the world needs to remember Ataturk and his accomplishments.

The museum highlights mostly Ataturk's and Turkey's efforts during the war in the Dardanelles, and Turkey's War of Independence following World War I. Many of his reforms after Turkey gained independence were also contained in the museum.

Ankara doesn't have, with this one exception, the type of touristic sights that, say, Istanbul has, but if you are anywhere close to this place, you have to see it!

Turkey,Anitkabir,5.0,"AnitKabir is the tomb and memorial of Ataturk. Mustafa Kemal took the name of Ataturk or Father of the Turks following his rescue of the core of the Ottoman Empire after much of it was taken by foreign powers after WWI and subsequently invaded by a Greek army that wanted to re-establish Greek control over what is now the Turkish coast of Asia Minor. He established a largely secular republic and through a series of strict and sometimes harsh laws and regulations dragged what is now Turkey into a western orientation that exists until today, though with some concern over the direction of the current regime. His laws included adoption of western dress, adoption of the latin alphabet, secular rules, and the continuation of a more modern industrial and economic policy, albeit one that was state centric. Ataturk's greatest legacy was in creating a Turkish identity from the ashes of a multi-cultural Ottoman empire. This legacy included clashes with Turkey's significant Kurdish minority over identity, which has continued until today, as well as repudiation of any responsibility for ethnic cleansing or genocide of the Armenian population in Turkey in the years leading up to WWI. That said, Ataturk created a vibrant, nationalistic, and strongly patriotic Turkish national identity and Turkish citizen by welcoming in Muslims from the former Ottoman territories as Turkish citizens in today's Turkey. The Mausoleum, appropriate since the term originated in ancient Halicarnasus (Bodrum) in SE Turkey, not only contains Ataturk's tomb but also has a very well-designed museum in the lower level that describes Mustafa Kemal's life and the events that he helped shape to establish the Republic of Turkey.

Decent views of the City and the park is nice, but the mausoleum itself and the museum under it are the reason to visit, and they really ate genuinely very interesting.

The many displays in the museum gave us a better understanding of life in Turkey under Ataturks guidance though being Australian it was quite challenging to view the paintings of WW1 from the Turks point of view, especially those depicting Gallipoli and the Dardanelles Campaign. There is much more to see than the war section, we came away thinking the world needs a progressive intelligent leader like Ataturk now.

There are four main parts to Anitkabir, (memorial tomb).
The Road of Lions, the Ten Towers, the Hall of Honour and the Peace Park.

The approach to the ceremonial courtyard and monument, is lined by rows of lions, roses and the centered Turkish flag in the distance.

The location of Ataturk‚Äôs tomb is housed within the Hall of Honour.

There are ten towers within the complex that hold individual inscriptions, corresponding to each of them.

The large park that surrounds the monument is aptly named, Peace Park.

There is also a small, on-site museum that holds personal effects and various memorabilia of Ataturk, so allow a few hours to see everything.

We saw almost no other tourists (or souvenir tat) when we visited - Kemeralti felt like where the locals shop. Prices weren't marked but we didn't any attempt to overcharge us - 10TL for a pack of children's socks, 6TL for tea for two. Only a couple of shopkeepers, spotting us as tourists, tried to tout.

Just like any other local bazaar there is always a scope of negotiation and you still need to bargain here but the prices here are much more realistic than grand bazaar.

Also, the vendors here do not force you to enter their shops or try their commodity. I found shopping in Kemeralti a much peaceful and pleasant experience than grand bazaar. I simply cannot stop comparing the two. Also, you can find almost everything here. It's huge. There are branded showrooms, great restaurants, small shops for souvenirs and there are dedicated streets for specific type of goods. Like there is a small street with only shops selling shoes. There is a street full of shops selling seafood, one with all the restaurants and so on.

Overall you can easily spend 3-4 hours here even if you do not want to shop much.

It is similar to 'covered bazaar' for those who know it. You can find lots of things at good prices. Moreover, the place hides a good number of local prodcts you cannot find anywhere else. This is specifically true for textile items. The merchants sometimes are grouped like fish market or fruit sellers, though you still can spot a fruit bench in the middle of painting material selling shops!
Surely it is worth to visit, but beware it may take all your day.Just limt yourself in time, divide by two then first half go, second half come back to place where you have started.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,3.0,"This market has so much to see. You will surely get lost and found in the hours you spend there. I am sure one can get a map of sorts but I couldn't find one! There is a lot of locals shopping here as well as tourists. Make sure to negotiate and many are happy to provide discounts on purchasing more than 1 product. There is a mishmash of different items on sale from spices, to leather. Some items in this market are cheaper than in Istanbul. If you going with kids I suggest you be extra careful only because its so busy and chances of getting lost would be high as one can get distracted with the many items on sale. People in the market ae very friendly, a lot speak English and assist with directions or a specific item you looking for.

Lots of eat in places and lots of shops accept card payment aswell.

Unlike Kapalƒ± √áar≈üƒ± (The Grand Bazaar) in Istanbul, Kemeraltƒ± is not for tourists but for locals and everyone. This is an open-air bazaar, a labyrinth of narrow curvy streets.

Apart from shops, there are also nice eating places, and I especially like in particular to stop there for a cup of Turkish coffee and Turkish delight.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,4.0,"Kemeralti Bazaar is a huge area, with both indoor and outdoor sections. It‚Äôs basically a neighbourhood unto itself, with mosques, food markets, cafes, clothing stores and shoe stores. The curving Anafartalar Avenue forms its main artery, with dozens of colourful little lanes (sokoks) leading off from it.

Within the Keremalti area, there are numerous snack bars and shops of every description selling just about anything anyone could want. Vendors are friendly and non-aggressive. You can browse to your heart‚Äôs content without suddenly being set upon by a vendor telling you that the cotton shirt you‚Äôre looking at is made of cotton or that the trousers you‚Äôre looking at are, in fact, trousers.

Most of the clothing stalls have nowhere for potential customers to try clothes on and in many cases, items of clothing have no labels on them, so guessing the size/fabric becomes the name of the game. (I got my clothing at a shop along Fevzipa≈üa Blvd., where the items did have size/fabric labels, where I was able to try things on, and where the price of the item was the same price as the same item in the bazaar itself.)

There are also several beautiful mosques in Keremalti, my favourites being the Hisar Mosque and the ≈ûadƒ±rvan Mosque (separates reviews). As well, there‚Äôs the enchanting Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Inn (separate review).

Wonderful place to poke around. Morning is better than afternoon. (Far fewer people.)

You dont have to buy anything but if you do try like I did, you will admire the energy, persistence and industry of the Turkish people. They are also remarkably friendly, helpful and generous. The sights, smells are truly wonderful and for me this is one of the best way to soak up the local way of life.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,4.0,"I've been to so many markets in Turkey, including Istanbul's Grand Bazaar - this is one of my favourites. If you're only looking for fake Gucci jeans and handbags, you may be a little disappointed (although you can ferret those things out), but what you will find is a real slice of the Turkish shopping experience.

As in many Turkish shopping areas, many of the stalls are grouped thematically - so you find yourself walking through a whole section of fantastically ornate wedding dresses and suits, then in an area of textiles. You will certainly know when you've found the fish section (which is thankfully away from the dresses - no one wants a fishy wedding dress).

There are plenty of clothes - ranging from casual wear, kid's clothes, belts and jeans to occasion wear (check out the sunnet / circumcision party wear), and sequinned slinky sheaths that a Disney villainess would be proud to wear.

Also to be found - lots of silver, gold and jewellery shops, electronics, household goods, soaps, souvenirs, spices and cafes. On the upper level you'll find record shops and fleamarket / antique goods.

The most restful place to sit and have a breather is in my opinion the L'Agora Hotel courtyard if you stumble across it. There's no point me trying to direct you to it - the place is a maze. The courtyard has a canopy over the top to shield you from the sun, and the stone arched walls around you will give you a respite from the noise for a while (unless they have live musicians in there).

Although the market is very busy and crowded, I found people to be very respectful with no pushing and shoving as I've had in some 'locals' markets. You don't get to much hassle from shop keepers. There's a fine line between atmospheric banter, and pestering, but this was the right side of that line.

Prices are very reasonable, and we didn't feel the need to haggle. We usually only do that in very touristic areas or if we're buying something in quantity. Otherwise, I think it can seem a bit rude - you have to go with your instinct. But mostly this market is for locals and Turkish tourists, so they tend not to over-inflate the prices to start with.

It will take you several hours if you want to see everything. Even then, I doubt you'd manage it. Even if you don't buy much, it's worth going for the atmosphere.

Most important, do not let anyone carry your bags around, or if you ask anyone for directions it's fine, just do not let them carry your bags around as after they do for a while they will take you to a leather shop and then you will spend your time at the shop when you don't want to buy any leather goods.
Just wander around at your own pace the first time and look around, all the goods are categorised into clothes, dry fruits, bags etc, at the start some are a few mixed shops.
Topten means wholesale so if you want to buy in 10's then you will get a better price. some shops are strictly Topten.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,3.0,"Went to the "" famed"" Kemeralti bazaar expecting something a bit like the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul..but boy was I mistaken!Yes, there are streets and alleyways crammed with any and every type of ( cheap) clothing,leather goods, "" jewellry"", ceramics, kitchenware, wedding outfits, mobile phone covers, nuts, spices, soaps, fish mongers and kebap shops, but there is no real charm to the place, and it all seems like just a big outlet for whatever China can't sell at home. Oh yes..and it is also where you can buy imitation designer goods for a pittance. My wife and I made the mistake of stopping into a leather bag shop, where the owner "" Ali"" proudly showed us his wonderful selection of high-quality, ""best-priced"" ""designer"" ( Gucci, YSL, Michael Ford..) hand bags which he made himself. Around the corner were fake Rolex and Lady Longines watches ..If you have an afternoon to kill, don't mind spending money on imitation goods, or bargaining with the seasoned stall owners, being plied with tea, called "" my friend"" by every stranger wishing to take your money, or being relentlessly pursued by every purveyor trying every trick including guilt to get you to buy something..anything..just name it!, then this is certainly the place to do all that. But, honestly, I would much prefer to shop from reputable dealers on the high-streets where they have price tags and warranties.

While you can find tourist shops selling souvenirs you still find the majority of people being local. It is a place where you can easily get turned around if you can drop a pin where you entered so you can find your way back. Know that if people hear you speak English or another foreign language they might try to take you to some of their friend's shops, just ignore them and keep on walking. Often they get a cut of what you buy and the prices are much higher then they should be. If you buy something that could be classified as antique make sure you get a certificate from the seller so you won't have any problem taking it out of the country, same goes for rugs. Most of all enjoy being among the Turks drink some tea and check out all the things you can buy there, from t-shirts to wedding dresses and much much more!

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,4.0,"The location in KOnak near the Saat Kulesi
Kemeraltƒ± Market is ƒ∞zmir‚Äôs heart and soul, and a great place to get lost for a few hours. There are bargains galore, especially in leather goods, clothing and jewellery. Seek out the flower and bead markets, then stop for a reviving shot of Turkish coffee and baklava in one of the delightful cafes at its core. Anafartalar Caddesi rings the main bazaar area and is its principal thoroughfare.

Within the main bazaar, the glorious Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Han caravanserai (1744) is a much smaller, calmer version of ƒ∞stanbul‚Äôs famous Covered Bazaar. It‚Äôs touristy, with many items from the far end of the Silk Road (China), but good for a wander. There‚Äôs a cafe in the courtyard, where merchants once tethered their camels.

The bazaar also contains Hisar Camii , the city‚Äôs largest mosque. The interior is quintessentially ƒ∞zmiri: the blue-and-gold motifs on the domed ceiling are simpler and less Oriental than classic Ottoman designs.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,5.0,"The kemeralti is where ordinary locals do their shopping & therefore is extremely busy. You can find almost everything here from clothes,shoes, jewellery, wedding items, luggage, fabrics, restaurants, traditional tea/coffee shops, fresh fruit juice ...the list goes on and on! once you figure it out, you will realise that it is divided into seperate areas -ie a part which is mainly shoes or fabrics or jewellery, engraving etc etc. If you are looking for something in particular, just ask one of the sellers and they'll point you in the right direction. Worth knowing too that there are alot of traditional craftsmen here (ive had a brass photo plaque made, clothes altered & even found a vinyl record dealer) You will be pleasantly surprised at how cheap it is. Also worth mentioning, if you are changing money to local currency there are quite a few Exchange shops which give much higher rates than the holiday resorts (Bodrum etc) Like in any big busy city, watch your bag (although many of the locals may very well remind you of this) If you are going in the height of summer, I would recommend going either very early morning or late afternoon as it can be very hot as well as crowded. Also wouldnt recommend going in heavy rain as some of the buildings/pavements are very old and therefore flood very quickly! You really need at least a few hours here to take everything in & there are plenty of lovely eating & drinking places to stop and recharge!

It has all the charm of old Izmir with amazing market buys for super cheap clothes, shoes, bags, traditional food, kababs, Turkish ice-cream, simit YUM! It's crowded and busy - lovely!

It is very close to Kizlaragasi Hani (old inn converted into a huge bazaar now) which has a famous coffee street where you can drink a cup of Turkish coffee and get your fortune read. I have randomly tried a few of them and it is FUN! Some were super accurate and some not.

Kizlaragasi Hani has lots of sweet little shops that will sell you an excellent selection of every single touristy thing you might want to buy. Most quite well priced btw but, of course, do haggle - it's Turkey for God's sake ;)

Take note of the way you go, as it is easy to get lost in the maze of streets.

Most of the shop keepers are relaxed and waiting for business, but there are some aggressive workers in some shops and on the streets. If it isn't negotiable or the shop attendant is too pushy, try another shop.

My wife is Turkish and we are old hands in Turkish markets (I won't say how old). I would rate this market as one of the best in Turkey for scope and breadth of merchandise, which also means that there is a lot of rubbish out for sale. Even with our experience, we still get taken in now and again. Our most recent was buying 3 kilos of old black kernel walnuts after being given wonderfully fresh ones to try. However, my wife got some good textile bargains including a couple items that she had been unable to find in the regular shops.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,3.0,"Kemeralti is a very authentic bazaar area in Izmir city center. There are many alleys, streets, and hundreds of shops selling many all kinds of stuff, from fruit to wedding dress, from souvenirs to kitchen utensils, from shoes to herbs & spices. So, basically you can find everything here at very competitive prices because it's not a touristy bazaar, it's a market where local people go and shop.

I'd recommend to visit a couple of old mosques such as Konak and Hisar mosques, and have a typical Turkish coffee at one of the many small cafeterias especially near Kizlaragasi Han, which is an old Ottoman caravanserai full of souvenirs and interesting stuff.

Have fun.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,5.0,"Plan your visit on foot. Spare at least four hours to spend. If summer time, dress light comfortable cotton ware with casual footwear, adding a large hat and sunglasses. Public transportation to and from Kemeralti is advised and inexpensive. If you must use your car, leave it at the multistory car park building situated right on the corner of Varyant and Konak seaside. Bazaar is a relatively small group of narrow street shops, intermingled with many passages throughout. Almost all streets are shaded (either vine leaves, tree shades, or tents) cozy cobblestone aisles, dotted with authentic coffee shops and all kinds of delicious food and desserts. Majority of structures are century old one or two story buildings that house variety of merchants, small manufacturers, craftsmen and vendors. Near center of Kemeralti is Kizlaragasi Camii, around which you can shop for artifacts, handmade game boards, beads, glassware; rest your tired feet while enjoying a nice Turkish coffee or have your lunch under old trees. As expected at all crowded and narrow gatherings, ensure your valuables are well tucked away, and your purse with your smart phone or bags are not open and loose to attract would-be snatchers or street-smart petty thieves. Latter statement is not based on any statistics, but merely an advice for all people walking around major centers in New York, Rome, Paris, Mexico City, etc. Last but not least, practice bargaining for whatever you're buying. Turks are among the famous bargain loving nations, like Chinese and Arabs. You will enjoy the local hospitality, free gratuities, a glass of tea, whether you're a purchasing customer or not. Izmir merchants are good natured, relaxed, friendly, and talkative...like most Aegean folks are. Enjoy!

With many shops being closed (due to the day being Sunday) there were not so many people, so our walk as well as our in and outs at the shops where easy and very comforting.

The only bad thing about visiting on a Sunday is that the antique section is almost all closed.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,4.0,"We have visited a few places in Turkey and found some (Kusadasi) to be excellent and really enjoyable with a good level of banter, and others (Marmaris) to be awful where you are being bombarded to buy stuff, so when we went to Izmir we did not know what to expect.

We got off our cruise ship and decided to walk into the market. It was the start of the Republic day bank holiday so there were many flags in view and a really nice atmosphere to go with it. We arrived in the market around 10am and were approached by a lot of shop / stall holders touting for our business and as it was the end of the season there were not many tourists around so we did get more than our fair share.

What was really nice was that we did look at a few stalls and bought some items, but we were approached lots for leather jackets which we did not want nor need and we politly declined, and were wished to have a nice day - no hard sell nor pushy attitude and it made shopping in the market very enjoyable.

We did a bit of haggling - but being English we are not very good at it. My daughter wanted a leather purse so we were buying that in a shop and the shop owner wanted to arm wrestle me! (I am a big man and am used to be touched / patted etc in Greece, Turkey and the like) Anyway I won the arm wrestle and got a hefty discount, the shop owner then went to get his friend to arm wrestle me - but he cheated as this guy was left handed. After a few minutes of stalemate we called it a draw and we went on our way much to the amusement of our Children.

We enjoyed walking around Izmir and really enjoyed the market and would definitely return, as an introduction to Turkish markets / bazaars this is a very friendly place to start.

It was a pleasure to be able to people watch from the many cafes in the market, visit the shops and choose without pressure (a simple 'just looking' stops any attempts to pressure you to buy).
Shop keepers remember you from months ago and all will offer a cup of cay to customers who are looking to actually buy something.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,4.0,"The bazaar area is huge, a small portion is covered and more tourist oriented, but the fun is getting lost inside the maze of small streets which can make even a person with a lot of sense of direction get completely lost.
Prices are a bit better than Istanbul, but not as much as mentioned in other reviews, try to find things away from the Han part which is more for tourists... however I fell in love with a carpet there. Price after a lot of negotiation is fair.
Great places to enjoy some tea or coffee.

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,5.0,"Having been to Kusadasi port numerous times, we decided to take the bus to Izmir during our day-long cruise stop here. We went to the Pamukkale (this is also the name of a town in Turkey) Turizm bus company office in the center of town and bought round trip tickets for 28 lira apiece (about $14.) We were directed to a van which took us to the main bus station (to far to walk) where we boarded the bus to Izmir (every ¬Ω hour during summer, every 2 hours during winter)‚Ä¶the trip was about one hour and fifteen minutes. FYI there is free wireless on the bus, and the attendant passes out snacks and drinks :o) Once we arrived in Izmir there was a free shuttle to the Pamukkale office on the plaza in the center of town. We headed straight for the lively Kemeralti Bazaar, wading through the crowds in what appeared, at this point, to be a fairly uninspiring city. We walked in the direction of the port, saw the pink building landmark (a tourist office which is apparently rarely open!) and veered left towards the shopping district and bazaar. This is what defines Izmir! Both quaint inner shops visible down narrow alleys, and outer, more modern shops in the city streets comprise the bazaar. These spread across an incredibly vast area... There are myriad sections with shops that are specific to the items they sell: ballroom gowns, kitchen stuff, coffee shops for a quick Turkish coffee stop, hookahs‚Ä¶ and the requisite aroma of Turkish spices wafting through the air‚Ä¶ the ambiance is colorful and somewhat overwhelming, and thoroughly delightful! We headed towards the middle (the alleys are configured so that it is not too difficult to fine one‚Äôs way‚Ä¶ be observant of the shop displays to help you find your way back), where we came across a large open area with the biggest donner spit we have ever seen! After a fantastic kebab, all the while bantering and taking photos with the jovial wait staff, we headed back to the main square and the Pamukkale office to take the bus home, arriving in Kusadasi in plenty of time to embark the ship. A caveat: we arrived about 40 minutes before the van came in Izmir, as we had heard that it fills up, and that it does. An uneventful ride home, but with a nice interlude as the bus attendant passed out ice cream cups to all!

Turkey,Kemeralti Market,5.0,"We visited Izmir as a port- of- call on a recent Mediterranean Cruise. I'm ashamed to say that I'd never heard of the place before and I had visions of swarthy locals nipping at my heels for handouts as we walked about.
How wrong can you be? From the moment we tied up, the friendly vibes just washed over you. All of the port officials were as helpful and friendly as can be (in direct contrast to those sourpusses at the US border!). Most of them spoke English better than I can and I'm pretty good!
They had free maps, they told us the best way to get into the city , what to look for and they were generally utterly disarming.. the best advertising you can get!
We decided to walk along the beachfront parade to get to the market and it is a gorgeous place, sunny, clean and well kept ... obviously quite a well off town.
While we're on the walk we're treated to a flypast of planes from the Turkish Airforce, seems that we've chosen their National Holiday for our visit ( Oct 29th) . Believe it or not we were allowed to get close up to the VIPs at a rehearsal ceremony and one of the ministers I spoke to was embarrassed to admit (in perfect English) that he didn't know how many years this particular national birthday was celebrating.
Truth from a politician? pinch me I'm dreaming.
He was just as affable as everybody we bumped into on the way to the market , which turned out to be a 45 minute walk.
The market itself is like a casbah, full of exotic stalls selling stuff we've never seen before , it is a bit of a maze with fashion shops and leather stores every couple of doors but you're never too far away from the seaside landmarks. The merchants aren't as aggressive with their sales pitches as they are in other towns I've been to and they were fairly easy to wave off.
We had a cup of coffee somewhere in the middle of all of this activity and while you get the feeling that the market must spread out for miles, it is probably only a half a mile square.
Clothing is dirt cheap there, as a lot of others have commented, and the quality is very good.I couldn't get my head around the exchange rate so I can't comment on the value of the food but a coffee was about the same price it is in North America.
We walked back along a street that was a couple of blocks in from the seaside promenade and it confirmed that this is a well-to-do city , solid buildings , well kept sidewalks and the same friendly people. Whenever my wife stopped to take a photograph, one of the locals usually jumped up and offered to take it for us and they usually wanted to get in the picture too ......a very touching trait unpolluted by tourism.
We didn't stay for more than a couple of hours but it will be a memory that changed forever my unfounded opinions of the Turks , they really were (and are) wonderful, genuine people .

P.S. take change with you, if you want to use the bathroom you have to pay.

I didn't see too many other tourists my first time--it all depends on whether a cruise ship is in port. Be sure to go down the narrow passages into the quieter nooks to find hidden courtyards and enjoy some tea or watch the inner workings of the market. If you're approached by someone and want to be left alone, simply keep moving.

Think of this as a European Friday street market aimed mostly at local people providing, in addition, an interesting view for visitors. Few bargins and few honest traders.

There are lots of showers and toilets which is very convenient. The views from the beach are picturesque of the mountains, cable cars and castle and the sea water is warm and crystal clear.
The most beautiful beach ever and a must if you visit Alanya!

Turkey,Kleopatra Beach,5.0,"Cleopatra Beach is the most beautiful beach I have been to so far. It is made of fine gravel, which I personally adore because it does not sting when walking and yet it is not like sand that it cannot be removed when it is glued to everything possible. Sunbeds are mostly rented from the hotel but can also be paid for at your own expense and I think the price for two sunbeds and an umbrella is around 25-30tl depending on the number of the beach and the person in charge of the sale. I was at beach 7 and everything was correct. Each part of the beach has its own bar where you can buy drinks or ice cream. The very entrance to the beach is tiny pebbles that turn into stone slabs as you enter deeper. We were there for 10 days and there were waves every day, which we like. It may be a little more inconvenient for small children but it‚Äôs not that scary. It is important to go through that first part where the waves break (if they are stronger that day) and the rest is really OK. Plenty of kids bathed with hoses and muscles. The beach is quite wide about 80m and deck chairs are placed away from the sea so you can put a towel in front or bring your umbrella. The beach has a free shower and a changing cabin.

Weather still over 30 c.
Went beach every afternoon.

Didnt bother renting a sun lounger .
Just put a towel on the sand.
You can get right down to the sea with a towel.
Sun beds are set well back.
Great location.
Very clean.
Just a warning as you get into the water for about 10 foot sea has smooth very slippery rocks.
If your not expecting it you will take a fall.
Once you clear the rocks it goes deep quickly.

Extremely long with caf√©/bars strewn along the shoreline we stopped at Bar 18 which was very good, moderately priced with good service.

The beach is extremely popular an therefore busy with the busiest part starting close to the mountain that houses Alanya Castle but the further along the coast you go the less people on the beach, the same applies to parking, on the road opposite you can park for free but the further along you go the easier you will fin the parking.

A multitude of shops, caf√©s, hotels and souvenir establishments are located opposite the beach.

The promenade in front of the beach hosts a multitude of places to get a cold drink or snack and a number of small parks where you can sit in the sun or the shade. On the opposite side of the road you will find vendors selling Camel rides, not for us but we did pay the owner a few pounds to have our picture taken with them.

Turkey,Kleopatra Beach,3.0,"Alanya is a very busy beach town big enough to be called a city.

Hustle & bustle vast amounts of traffic the beaches are best described as sharp sand/ Gritty NOT soft sand.

Fruit & veg on markets unbelievably cheap the rest of the market selling fake clothes are decent quality but best avoided they can be found cheaper in the thousands of shops open til midnight where you can see the displayed prices & avoid the hassle & rip off prices.

Lots of big retail clothing shops reasonable prices but take a walk a couple of streets back to avoid tourist prices just like the restuarants if the Turkish are eating there it's more likely to be cheaper better quality and more authentic.

Travelling by buses are so cheap approx 3TL gor 3 mile journeys from Oba etc, but be warned in summer months & peak times it is like cattle trucks squeezed in standing only & upto 100 people on the bus. Mahmuttlar well worth a visit more Turkish & cheaper than Alanya bus only 3 TL.

Coaches to other towns are totally different very cheap travel to Manavgat 15 TL each way every 30 minutes on ac coach with guaranteed seat some offer free water & coffee NO standing luxury travel compared to buses & so cheap for long distance & great way to see other towns check out just go to Alanya bus station Octogar you can travel to almost anywhere you do not need to buy tourist tours which take you to carpet shops etc, just use the coaches so you are not time restriced.

All in all Alanya is a thriving busy seaside town but think of it as a busy city with traffic thousands of shops open til midnight lots of hustle and bustle with pirate party boats & buses full to the rafters and beaches with sharp sand the sea can be very rough with large waves & get deep very quickly.

We stayed at Bar 15, food and drinks are well priced, with the food being particular fantastic.

They has a shower, changing cabins and loo nest door, which cost a 20pence to use. However it was clean.

The edge of the sea drops down quickly to waist height but then remains a shallow decline the further out you go. As other people have said, the waves are large and powerful, I'm 6 ft 3 and struggled not to get knocked over a couple of times. You can not leave small children unattended.

Did some snorkeling, not much to see for underwater adventures! Walked up and down this beach enjoying the perfect temperature water and sunshine. Also walked the sidewalk near the beach. Both are awesome. During the day there are beach volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts and of course nearer the mountain the gondola taking you up to the Castle! When laying on the beach enjoying the sun, a wonderful breeze carries off the water making tanning enjoyable (I do not particularly like just laying in the sun - but the breeze was fantastic making it very relaxing, just make sure to wear sunscreen and have a timer so you don't burn! I literally dozed off it was so relaxing). The mountains on either side frame the ocean view, with Gulets (ships) of all sizes travelling through the bay regularly that are quite interesting in their design. I've been to beaches in Dominican, Mexico, Belize, and this ranks as one of the best in my opinion!

I made an appointment was asked for a ¬£20 deposit which I found a bit weird! As I had never been asked in 6 years for a deposit before? Anyway I say d I'm looking for a colour and cut and was told it would be ¬£40 and would I pay 50% I said ok. I went back the next day and had 2 young lads apply my colour then another cut my hair then dried it, there where puffs of smoke coming of my hair! Soon it was all over I went to pay and was told that will be ¬£100!! I didn't pay it of course! Anyway we settled the price at ¬£50 which I was still not happy with! But NEXT DAY I washed my hair and couldn't brush it, it was a tangled mess as these idiots had completely fried my hair! I have to pack it with serum or it looks like someone is holding balloons all round it! Totally static all the time! ITS A TOTAL MESS!

Each hotel has a small wooden house where they serve soft drinks for their guests and some of them have also wi-fi. There is an interesting thing about this beach: you enter into the water and under your feet there is sand, after about 3m there is no sand but a rock full of a thin layer of sea deposits which makes it quite slippery. The rock is about 2m wide, after you get off of it there is only sand under your feet. The water is clear blue and in August when I visited it was extremely warm.

Along the beach there is nice walking road, many exotic trees and bushes, fountains... This time we were in the area closer to Damlatas cave, beach number two mostly. In that area sea gets deep fast, very wavy every day (great for those who like it, we enjoyed a lot), the sand was nice with tinies stones, pleasant for walking, natural massage:)) great place to take pictures of sunset, as well as at any other time. Sea is very beautiful, blue and clean.

Well, as long as no tour boats nearby:((( after they pass by, plastic and something black appeared on top of the water. Very unpleasant, like you are swimming in a pool with trash. As boats appear more after 4pm, better to move farther from that area, like to the beach 4-5, there water seemed cleaner... And the sea is not as deep either. Also, beach itself doesn't seem to be cleaned, on first day I collected and threw away three beer cups rusted long time ago, that could easily cut feet, also there are cigaret buds in the sand..

The hotel offered 120‚Ç∫ per person for a ride to saklƒ±kent. That is before we know that you can take dolmu≈ü/minibus to saklƒ±kent just for 20‚Ç∫ per person.
We took a minibus from fethiye, near otogar. Just go to the otogar (terminal station) and ask them to show you the stop to saklƒ±kent. It is an hour ride but really worth the 20‚Ç∫.
Saklƒ±kent park was really really beautiful, the kanyon, the raft, the river, everything. For people who loves nature, Saklƒ±kent park is a must to see. Bring you sea shoes (deniz terliƒüi) and if you want to go rafting, it costs 50‚Ç∫ per person. It was fun but I wish we could go longer in the river. The ride is a bit short, just about 30 minutes. Bring your waterproof phone case to bring your phone at the river. We didn't bring one, we had to buy one. 10‚Ç∫ and 5‚Ç∫ for students to go to the Saklƒ±kent Kanyonu. It is a must to see. A lot of people put the mud on their face as a face mask.

For the minibus, it goes once in every 30 minutes, the last bus from Saklƒ±kent will go at 19:30. Don't be late unless you want to spend the night over there.

As the level of water rises during winter months, visitors can enter the canyon all year around only the deeper parts in the summer. 4 km (2.5 mi) of the canyon are walkable after April, when most of the snow in the Taurus Mountains has melted and passed through on its way to the Mediterranean Sea.

You can get the bus from Fethiye return for 30TL, bus stop is around the corner from the main bus depot outside the white mosque (ask the bus driver if unsure). You definitely need water shoes, but you can buy them really cheaply outside. 20TL for the cheapest shoes and they were actually really good. Or if you're short of money you can buy second hand ones down the road. It costs 9TL entry for adults, under 6 year olds go free. The first bit is probably the hardest, getting across the river. However it's a great experience, just make sure you have correct footwear on or else it can be dangerous.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Really loved Saklikent river which is a beautiful light blue and turquoise river between a valley. We had a long walk and trek in the river which was very cool in the really scorching hot summer and was really refreshing. My advice to other travellers would be to be cautious of the type of footwear- do not wear slippers that can be easily broken as the trek in the river entails fast water currents and rocks. Wear special shoes adapted for water. We had a lovely time with my family and fianc√©. Us the young ones went for the trek in the water and the older ones stayed in the caf√© which was in the form of wood houses in the river. Really nice day overall. It is a recommended attraction in Seydikemer (Fethiye).

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"Establishments do not accept credit card you have to carry cash. Which we did not because we have been warned not to! Because water stream at the entrence of the valley was at the level of my knee and we‚Äôve been informed that it will reach almost chest level at a certain point(I am 6‚Äô0‚Äù). Since TL is not water proof we left our cash in the car. After you pass the powerful water stream at the entrence, you take a long walk and I mean a looong one. And during this walk water stream is not a problem because it becomes very thin and height of the stream is 1‚Äô0‚Äù at max. We did not come across with that water stream of chest level and down further we go it all started to look the same. So we turned all the way back. By the way, two small rocks fell from up above while we are walking, although they did not hit us I recommend borrowing barets at the entrence they are free of charge. One last thing, rocks you are walking on are very slippery I highly recommend wearing seashoes. Flip flops will make the experience much harder.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"My family and I traveled to the gorge by bus.
I recommend, be sure to cross the mountain river and go into the gorge, to overcome some distance (of whom there will be enough). I advise you to pay the guide if there is a lot of water in the gorge (it‚Äôs safer and calmer, and you‚Äôll get clear instructions). Shoes are best taken with rubber.
The length of the gorge is 18 km, it is unlikely that you can go all completely. Even if you manage to walk a couple of kilometers, your impressions will remain unforgettable. You need to go meaningfully and carefully.
This is my most unforgettable and vivid impression of Turkey.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"The park, which contains a natural wonder that must be seen in the region, like Saklikent Canyon. Some parts of the road from the main road to here have also been made and it was fine. When you arrive, the staff who try to attract you to the car parks of their restaurant welcomes you. But I still found a free car park, I think. When you get out of the car, there are restaurants with left and right, some of them are cooling places on summer day. Here you can relax on the return. Here, M√ºzekart does not pass, you enter the area by buying tickets from the box office and a magnificent canyon welcomes you. Immediately after entering, you walk through a narrow bridge and reach the place where the water flows and you can go down to the canyon. It is strongly expressed that you have a hard hat on your head here. These hard hats are abundant in a box there. In this region, you flood the ice-cold water and start seeing the canyon. Although it is not easy to pass through this entrance area where water flows fastest, it can be full of fun. Passing by holding onto the existing rope and you have to be careful not to fall. After passing, you walk and enjoy in the imposing canyon in the water that flows lightly. I did not go to the end, even though I proceeded quite a lot. It was a really nice experience. I would recommend it to everyone.

You do not need any special training to do it and the views and photo opportunities are richly rewarding. Several tips: good shoes and comfy clothes for walking through knee-deep cold water, waterproof cameras only, by all means - go to the WC before entering. And the main point: try to reach as farther in the gorge as you can! The deeper you get inside, the more beautiful the surroundings get!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Visited here for a second time recently, having first visited five years ago as part of a Jeep Safari. The Jeep Safari in itself was brilliant, but Saklikent was the highlight for us, and we wanted to go again to spend some more time there - you can feel a little rushed on the organised group tours as you have to travel from location to location, and don't always get to spend as much time in each place as you'd like!
This year, however, we booked a private excursion through Volume Travel and we assumed this would just involve the hiring of the minicab and the driver to get to and from Saklikent, but we couldn't believe it when Ibrahim, our brilliant guide, offered to accompany us all the way along the gorge (despite him not bringing any swimming shorts!); we would have been unlikely to have ventured as far in as we did without him!
I highly recommend taking a good pair of water/beach shoes - nothing that can easily come off your feet - as the water does run fast in some places, and the rocks can be quite slippery. Water shoes are available to rent there for a matter of a few lira, but they aren't the most comfortable - you're definitely best to bring your own. If you do venture further up the gorge, be aware that it does get quite deep, so wear something you're prepared to get wet up to your hips in, too!
Aside from the gorge itself, for an additional fee, you can opt to zip-line across the river, or raft down the rapids. Across both of our visits, our whole family have had a turn at the rafting, for which there are a couple of price options, depending on how far down the river you'd like to go. The first time we visited, 5 years ago, it was a month or so earlier in the season, and a lot busier. For this reason I actually found the rafting a little daunting as there were so many rafts (and paddles!) everywhere. It looked a lot more enjoyable this year, with the river being so much quieter (almost deserted!) mid-October.
There is a restaurant on-site, which although very inexpensive, really isn't the best quality. There are others round the corner, a little further down the river which we would choose to go to next time.
A fantastic day out for the whole family to enjoy. It would be high on our list of places to return to (yet again!), next time we're back in the area.

As far as I know this canyon is 17 kms long and you can walk it all over if you have time. The water is cold which is cool to get cooled in the hot waether ;). There is a rope to which you can hold and walk in the water to access the gorge. There are also places around where you can eat and drink. You can also have adrenaline sports such as rafting and bungee jumping.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"From Fethiye white mosque take dolmus to Saklikent, it's the last stop so just look for the sign on the window (for cheaper dolmus tickets purchase Kenti Kart from any kiosk/store and add money on that instead of buying single ticket from the bus; Kart costs 8trl and gives you 1-3trl off every ride, you'll just need to tell the driver where you're going and then swipe the card on dolmus, it'll show you fare and remaining balance).

The trip from Fethiye to Saklikent takes about an hour, buses leave every half hour and the last bus from Saklikent leaves at 19:30. Bus ride will take you through many nearby villages and the dolmus can get rather full during the trip but that's part of the authentic experience for us.

There are changing rooms and toilets (1trl) before the entrance; entry to the gorge costs 6trl adult, 4trl student. You can buy ocean shoes right by where the dolmus stops, or rent them right at the beginning of the gorge itself. There will be people offering to guide you through the gorge but it's not at all necessary as the trip is not very demanding physically, just apply the usual caution and if not sure, check your step before taking it.

The mud is rich in minerals and used by locals so feel free to get it all over you for the entire hike. You'll be able to easily wash it off in the water or small waterfalls that you'll pass. Saw bunch of locals carrying out the mud in bottles even :)

Be prepared as in wear shorts/tank top or swimwear, either rent (10trl at Saklikent) or buy ocean shoes beforehand (15trl in stores in Fethiye), and pack your valuable items in ziplocks or similar into your backpack. You will get wet but entirely possible to carry your backpack so it won't soak.

After the hike, the buffet nearby dolmus stop is a great place to chill and snack. A good plate of tomato-garlic sauce, aubergines, rice and yogurt sauce cost 20-25trl. Local pomegranate juice is a delight, small bottle cost 10trl and is more than enough.

Nearby is another, much less visited gorge called Gizlikent, 20 minute walk uphill from Saklikent, didn't visit this time but will eventually.

All in all would recommend doing this trip independently rather than paying 5x price to a tour company, but different strokes for different folk of course.

You start out the trek into the gorge by walking on a narrow wooden walkway (with railing). Not far in, one must decide to stay on land or continue on in the water. Most of the access to the gorge requires walking in the water. This would not be good for someone with balance issues. There are many people at the mouth of gorge.

The gorge is accessed via a walk along a riverside platform and because of the crowds it wasn't clear how to enter the gorge. I went in the wrong section which was very rocky with fast flowing, painfully cold water. I had to turn back. The correct access point had many people coming and going with locals wearing flip flops, carrying children etc. I recommend taking a decent pair of water proof shoes as the pair that I rented were uncomfortable I didn't bother going back down the main entrance but my grown up son and daughter did and they enjoyed the walk into the gorge.

We went purely to walk through the gorge but there are other things to do there if you enjoy zip wires & riding down the river in a rubber ring! Places to eat and watch the river and relax are also available.

You walk across a bridge to get to the gorge and you then have to scramble over slippery rocks to get into the very fast, icy cold river! I would strongly advise wearing rubber shoes, you can hire them at the gorge. We went with TUI and they advised us to wear yellow helmets in case of falling debris do we did. We were the only people with hats on! I wore a swimsuit with a short dress over it and that was ideal attire. My husband wore shorts and a top.

Once you are in the river, the water went to the top of my thighs, you hold onto a thick rope to help guide you into the gorge. It is then a mixture of shallow water, slippery rocks, sandy mud and fantastic views of the gorge.

Part way along we met an official guide who tagged on to us. Maybe we looked up for an adventure and were wearing the right gear. Who knows, all I know is we could not of got to the very end without him. From here on in we were treated to explore the gorge to the end waterfall. You will need to be up for an adventure to get there. Lots of clambering through small holes and climbs of 3-4 meter on slippery rock, deep water and very sticky mud to navigate. In my opinion this should only be done with an official guide who knows the area, and is going to turn themselves into a ladder (literally) for you climb on their legs and shoulders to get up steep slippery sections.

We got to the end waterfall something not many can say. A great achievement for us and to swim in and under the waterfall was a great experience Our guide then got us safely back, where we were more than happy to pay his fee for treating us to a true adventure. Thanks Jan (John) you really made our day.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Only a 40 minute drive from Kalkan (taxi return trip 340TL) this natural site is truly beautiful. You walk/wade through the gorge so swimwear and wet shoes are a must. Also a waterproof bag for valuables (phone, money etc). You will get wet !!
Highly recommend the separate activity based from the restaurants of tubing down the river, safe but lots of fun
Main advice is get there EARLY. We got there at 9:30 and that was perfect

Tip: take minimal stuff with you as walking through water etc was hard carrying a bag with towels etc in (we packed prepared as didn‚Äôt know what we needed) really all you need is a camera - the views are breath taking!

Loads of local eatery options there too - we had an amazing meal on the water!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"We parked for 6TL, and entry is 24TL for 2 adults and 2 children, so pennies in total for a half day out.

Get there by 10am as the crowds were there by 12.30pm who were terribly unpleasant - 4th August...heaving by then. People brining strollers too...who does that!?

So we had a great day as we got there early, but take good grip water shoes, as health & safety is non-existent.

You walk up the flowing gorge which is so beautiful and steep almost in a cave the whole way. Take a waterproof camera too.

We then came out and went up the other end of the village away from the restauramt with sofas on the same flowing gorge which everyone goes to, and you will find a very lazy restauramt seating style with hammocks and sofas on a small stream. The food was so cheap and the remaining day was so relaxing. Free bucket of bread with meals too.

Go in a tour and I suspect it would be exhausting, so go private (car rental ¬£25 a day)

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"This was just a quick visit. I would have preferred more time here as it was all rushed if you wanted to enter the canyon/gorge and also maybe float down the river in an inflatable tyre with paddle. It appears to have extended since my last visit with multiple zip wires on offer also. Can be a right sun trap. I would have liked to have gone to the gorge but only being allowed 40 mins to get there and get back to our jeep put me off. If you want to spend a decent amount of time here I would book it as a separate trip. Can be quite costly by the time multiple people do multiple activities. The gorge was only 8tl to enter which is just over a pound and the river paddle was a tenner per head. I dont know what they charged foe the zip line as I didnt do it.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Most trips to Saklikent are through tour operators and include lunch. We went once with Intrepid tours and ate in the river which had seats in the river, and a second visit with Survivor 4x4 jeep safari, where we ate at the top of the gorge and walked down to the waterfall, but then drove to the main bottom of the gorge.
Access to the gorge is about 6TL and is worth it. Once past the small waterfall, you can trek up as far as you want (4km).
At the bottom part they offer zip lining across the river and ringo rafting / tubing down the river. Both are priced at 75TL but you can haggle down if you're a family etc. We got it for 60TL each (2x adults, 2x teens and 1x eleven year old). Tubing is well worth it. Ziplining is short and like a mini go-ape. The kit is a little old and ropey.
Go, you won't regret it!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"The gorge walk was a great trip but not for the faint-hearted or anyone who is not up for an adventure. That said people of all ages and physique were enjoying the challenge.
Parking is free of charge and it's not expensive to get in - 8 lira per adult, 4 lira per child/student. It's also worth planning ahead just a little.
So some ideas to consider:
1. Get there as early as you can - ok, we went there during Turkish holiday time so there were hoards of locals but actually the fact that this wasn't just a tourist trap for unwitting foreigners was great. Doing the gorge before rafting down the river meant we missed a long queue for the gorge.
2. Don't take loads of gear with you. Get a waterproof pouch for a phone, money and car key. You can buy a pouch in one of the stalls for 15 lira.
3. Footwear: wear jelly shoes. Flip flops and sliders are likely to come off and then you'll be barefoot which wouldn't be good. Trainers would also work but they will get muddy.
4. Clothing: whatever you like but you will get wet. Even if you only do the first bit you will go into water up to your knees at least. Shorts and tee shirt are fine. We saw some topless men but if you're going right into the gorge you should have a tee shirt on.
5. Helmets are available for you to pick up and wear. Few people did take them and for most people they aren't necessary. If you're planning on going deep into the gorge it would be better to be safe than sorry.
6. Once you're beyond the entrance and in the reception area there are guides who will offer to help you. Again a deep exploration of the gorge would warrant hiring the service of a guide. I can't say how much they are because we didn't use one. Consequently we got to a point where we could work out the route but not the method for conquering it. That was the point of our return.
7. Prepare for the unexpected. A lot of the time you will be walking through muddy water unable to see where you are putting your feet. The rocks can be slippery and it's not unusual to step lower into water than you expect!
8. The first water you enter at the start is fast flowing and very cold. Once you are through that the water is slower and not so cold.
9. Don't forget to stop from time to time and look up and tale in the view. The rock formations are stunning but if you are always looking at your feet you won't even notice them!
Enjoy!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic site. Even the ride to the site, drive by little villages, etc.. are part of a really nice experience. The canyon entrance has plenty of facilities and activities to prep for a long hike or do white water rafting or simply get rest. The canyon itself is amazing, easy hike on the man made pathway which then turns into a moderately challenging hike in the water. In any developed country, the authorities would prohibit hiking through thigh deep white water which is perfectly fine and allowed in here, and that's also what makes the experience fun. I noticed it's quite common to apply the natural clay as face mask or write stuff on marble rocks with it. It's also very pleasant thing to spend the day there when it's extremely hot, as the canyon is well protected, and the white water is very very cold. Must experience.

Been in the park for 5 minutes and it had already cost me ¬£65. Kids enjoyed the zip wire which took you over the river and then a bus ride back. Rafting was quite enjoyable, the water was a beautiful shade of turquoise and COLD!! The only downside was all the life vests we were given for the rafting absolutely stunk of BO. Another downside was the amount of flip flops which had fallen off people's feet and lay abandant on the river bank. Also thought the park was far too commercialised and took away the natural beauty of the place. Would I go back? Probably not, but the rafting was fun.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,3.0,"We did the day excursion from Calis five years ago with Seaside Travel and then again this July with Focus Tours. The Gorge is worth a visit and we enjoyed wading through the water for the short time we had there. Last time we went the 'Seaside' guide gave us lots of information about the gorge and then afterwards at Tlos too. He walked round with us part way to show us. This time, having booked with Focus they subcontracted out to a company called Moibus. The guide Deniz told us very little indeed. He simply asked if we wanted him to come over and help us buy our tickets. He completely left us to it and at Tlos too. We all got home early after being treated to a visit to the obligatory carpet factory too. All in all I'd recommend a visit but the guide and company you choose to book with does make a huge difference.
My kids enjoyed the dingy ride down the gorge five years ago. We decided it was too expensive and too rushed this time for all of us.

It‚Äôs a great place to visit but it has become quite commercialised in the past 10-15 years. Tickets to enter, stalls to go through, camera photos, official guides. Some of the charm has been lost but still a great experience.
Don‚Äôt be stupid and hand carry your iPhone! It will get wet or broken. Do wear loose fitting clothes that can get wet - they will. You do need to be quite fit to get through some of the areas where boulders have fallen and the water is rushing. With some help, most able bodied folks will get through.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"Beautiful location and only 8tl entrance fee. We didn‚Äôt have a guide and managed fine. It would be really difficult though for people with mobility issues or small children. Can‚Äôt believe that we saw so many people clambering over the rocks and into fast flowing water while carrying babies!! Or people attempting to walk through fast flowing water and over slippery rocks wearing 3‚Äù heels (not joking!),

The gorge is beautiful and worth seeing. It‚Äôs just such a shame they don‚Äôt limit the entrance numbers. There‚Äôs no health and safety to speak of and we didn‚Äôt see any facilities for first aid.

The cafe inside the gorge is self service and tea/coffee/cold drinks are available at ok prices. Be prepared to be sitting next to chain smokers though, nobody seems to care less about passive smoking!! By the time we left I felt like I‚Äôd passively smoked 200 cigarettes!! So much for the fresh mountain air!

We‚Äôve been to the gorge on the weekend and it is so crowded it seems unsafe. It‚Äôs worth visiting during the week and going earlier. Rubber beach shoes are a must and can be hired inside the gorge for 5tl or new pairs can be bought for 20tl. We bought ours as ¬£3 seemed a small price to pay to avoid verrucas or fungal nail!

You can taxi as well if you want. No need for guides or to book with anyone, just show up pay and do it on your own. Now about payment, no credit cards and no Euro taken. Go with Turkish Lira, July 2019 is was 8tl for adults and 4tl students/ kids, very affordable. Also, take water shoes, water socks, decent sandals you do not mind getting wet. You will only be in water up to you mid thigh, depending on your height. No gad checks, so waterproof bags are a good idea for phones, etc, there are merchants selling waterproof pouches to wear around your neck if you wish, many people were buying them. We used common plastic bags and my back pack and had no issues. Rental shoes are available and also for purchase, 4tl to buy and 3tl to rent. Food and drinks available decent enough selection, no need to pack a lunch, we were there for four hours due to bus schedule and that was enough time certainly if you are walking in all the way. About one hour travel time by bus each way via Kalkan. We were caught without lira for the day and managed to find someone to convert euros with. Also did not notice the pay as you go, literally at the Ottogar washroom, guy not impressed I had no lira and both myself and daughter really had to go, skipped out and pretty sure was being cursed at in a Turkish.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"After reading reviews (apparently not well enough) my husband and I decided to make the trip out here from √ñl√ºdeniz. We didn‚Äôt intend to really swim or anything, just wanted to hike it and see the gorge.

We read that water was at most knee deep but that was far from the case. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal but had we known better we would have worn clothes we were ready to get wet in. At some points further in the gorge the water was as high as waist level and we were jumping on top of boulders and then back off them into deeper and muddy water on the way back.

We didn‚Äôt make it all the way to the waterfall but plan to return next time wearing better clothes and go all the way. We didn‚Äôt hire a guide and found that if we came across a challenging spot we could just wait around and watch how others (including the guides who are familiar with the terrain) approached it and follow suit.

We worse open toed hiking sandals and found those to be sufficient. The water was really cold at the very beginning but once you get past the part at the very beginning with water rushing over boulders the water got warmer.

Whilst the entrance fee is a bargain, when we went, the upper gorge was closed off, I assume because the waters were too high. However, it didn‚Äôt obviously say this anywhere at the entrance, so we paid for a 3 minute (admittedly very scenic) walk through the canyon to a small grass bank. This was the end of the road and we went back, total time in attraction - 8 minutes.

After you exit the gorge there are restaurants serving fresh Trout and chips whilst lounging on a platform over the river. You can hire a ring to float further downstream which is fun.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,3.0,"We went with some friends to see the gorge first and then went to eat in the riverside chill out area.

The Gorge: Not suitable for anyone with mobility issues or back problems! You need water shoes (some areas provide them for a small fee, but they‚Äôve been worn by other people).
The rocks in the water are very slippery and uneven, the water is very cold as well. Nice to go on a hot day, very refreshing and in the deeper areas, you can rent inflated rubber rings and oars and go rafting! In the back entrance to the gorge, there are lots of steep steps, which is a massive task for elderly, low mobility and young children.

The river-side chillout areas are fantastic, you can order food and drinks and relax - it‚Äôs really nice and cool if you‚Äôre not up to the gorge.
It‚Äôs a massive site with lots of areas to explore and chill and there is a children‚Äôs area to explore also!
If you want a certain area or attraction, there are staff dotted about, just ask for assistance.
This place is excellent for active people who want a good day out!

Just by the main water crossing, one of the official guides latched on to us, and it turned out to be the making of the day.

We probably would have turned back when the water pools started to get deeper, but with his expert help of the terrain and ‚Äúhelping hands‚Äùat critical points we made it all the way to the waterfall. He took our rucksacks at times and took some fantastic photos of the two of us.

There was no cost to the guide, but we gave him a fairly generous tip at the end (which he negotiated upwards!). It was such a great decision to take him - it turned a day out into a real adventure that we will remember for some time to come.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Visiting Saklikent was a highlight of our holiday. We paddled and waded through water along the gorge. Much was easy, but some parts tough and strong hands needed to clamber up and over rocks, or across deep sections. Afterwards we enjoyed the cafe beside/over the water. Good Turkish pancakes and 'breakfast'. And we should have gone rafting if we had allowed time.

But if you take one thing from reviews: DO GET THEIR EARLY. By the time we finished walking, it was heaving. Many local tourists don't make it so far along the gorge, dressed in full clothes, flip flops and yes with handbags. But the more central part gets very crowded and can't be avoided. Go with water shoes or hire them (or trainers that you don't mind submerging), and expect your clothes and stuff to get wet. It took us about an hour to get to the first waterfall. I understand there are more further along, but the rock blocking the path at that point is totally unascendable for normal people.

Rafting in tubes is run by private companies from sites near the Park entrance. It looks fun - about an hour to go down river and get brought back. We also stopped for a mud bath at a cafe on the road out - worth trying for a few lira.

The dolmus from Fethiye cost 12.75 lira each way and took about 1 hour. Entry was 7 lira for adults and 3.50 lira for students. You can rent plastic/jelly shoes and helmets but I don‚Äôt think they were useful for those who rented them. I wore hiking sandals and although still slippery at times, they did the job very well. I do not recommend plain sandals or flip flops!

You start off on a little bridge above and to the left of the gorge and at the end there are snack bars. This is where you can decide to watch everyone or actually enter the water yourself. At this point, I was just going to watch but the adventure gripped me and I went in! The water is freezing cold and goes up to the knees but it‚Äôs only for a short distance. You can help yourself with the use of a rope as the current is quite strong.

Once across, it‚Äôs like a pebbly beach and there is only a bit of water here and there. The sights are spectacular! The further you go, the more water there is and the deeper it gets. I gave up once I entered a pool that went up just past my groin. To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure how far I ended up going but I did spend almost 2 hours at the gorge.

Don‚Äôt keep anything in your pockets, keep your phones and cameras in a bag high up on your back to avoid getting them wet if you slip on the rocks in the water! Enjoy!

There is a possibility of going down the gorge on rubber rings and some zip lines and you can get food and refreshments. However at around mid day it got very busy with large queues at the entrance and toilets etc. We had a few women, I passed on my way back, still heading up the gorge, so most on the bus have them to thank for the hour sat in the bus waiting, after which we missed the slot at the very busy restaurant; where we had some average food and an over priced drink (No Alcohol served n the place). The gorge itself was quite impressive after walking along the side and over the rocks through the freezing cold water. Take a pair of crocks or similar so you can easily rinse them off although they hire some fairly poor plastic shoes.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"If you have not been before then this is a must. The main attraction is the gorge and a walk up the mainly dry riverbed. That said the first few hundred yards involve crossing a shallow river so you will need suitable shoes.

Other options include rafting on large rubber rings from Saklikent several mikes downstream - this is a really great family excursion and is safe for all apart from young children and the elderly.

The main disappointment is the government run catering facilities which dominate the entrance to the gorge. They have invested nothing on this in the last 30 years in the knowledge that they have a captive market and has become seriously tatty and reminiscent of what you would expect 40 years ago. Unfortunately most tourists are forced to use these facilities either before or after an excursion as it‚Äôs the only option if you want to eat or drink on the river. For us this is a missed opportunity in such a beautiful location, there needs to be some commercial restaurants here to compliment the venue.

2. Leave everything that you don't want to get wet in the car. You don't need a swimming suit. We hiked with our cloths that later dried very fast.

3. Parking is 5 lira. entrance is the 7 lira. children 0-6 free of charge.

4. You begin with a short walkway above the water. then you reach the springs.

5. If you have young kids (like us) - this is the point were you should hire a guide. we did and it was an excellent decision. would not have made the whole way without him. he helped us with the kids, and knew exactly where we should put our feet, where it is deep, and where the kids could slide.

6. You need to cross the river in knee-deep freezing water to reach the gorge. The water in the gorge is not freezing (the springs are at the entrance to the gorge) and most of the way it is ankle or knee deep. But there are some pools to cross which are chest-high (kids need to swim).

5. You walk as far up the gorge as you like, and then return the same way. We reached a point where you can only continue by climbing up a waterfall with a rope. I guess this is where most people head back (we did).

It gets very busy, so if you can arrive before 10am, you'll avoid the crowds. Definitely the best way to enjoy walking up the gorge. A small charge to enter the gorge, I think it was about 20TL per person. Take shoes you don't mind getting wet and are grippy (not flip flops), or you can hire 'jelly shoes' once inside the gorge for 4TL (I think). Some are also on sale near the car park for about 10TL. You will get wet, at least up to your knees, possibly more depending on how much water is flowing, so dress appropriately. Most of the walk is dry but depending on how far you want to walk (about 2km to the 'waterfall' where you have to stop - it's a very small waterfall). Lots of clambering up slippery bits if you want to and you can swim in some of the pools along the way. Or you can pretty much stay dry and not go so far up. The water is freezing. The rock formations are beautiful, the sides of the canyon smooth and glistening in the sun. If you arrive later, you can get stuck with coach trips and organised tours, etc.

After you walk back, get on a tractor inner tube and float down the river, where a van will pick you up and take you for an optional mud bath before taking you back to the start of the gorge and the car park. I think this was about 80TL for a group of four for a 45 min trip. The company by the official car park which we used) is marginally cheaper than the group operating from the other side of the river. The ones we used didn't insist on wearing helmets either.

Plenty of places to eat at the Gorge, traditional Turkish low seating on platforms over the river mean there is natural 'air con'. Food is very average but fine. The setting is lovely. Although, again, if you get there later, it can feel a bit over-run. And it is very touristy.

Would definitely recommend it as a day away from the coast. Whole family had a fabulous time.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"My top tip is get there early, it is a good day out but it gets very - very busy, there are various things to do, zip wires, rapids in the tyres, but we went to walk the canyon, make sure you get someone to explain the rules/way in, not all speak English and my Turkish is limited but just about got to understand. The walk up through the canyon is nice and cool makes sure you where trainers or water shoes as you feet will be wet from the moment you set off, if you want to go all the way up to the water fall then make sure you are prepared to get wet. We went up the gorge around 09:30hrs made it all the way to the water fall. The amount of rubbish thrown around is disappointing to see and fag ends, the water fall was perhaps also disappointing with a lot of rubbish around and even a big black drainage pipe wedged behind it not stunning !!
The walk back down though we noticed the arrival of helpful Turkish lads who were now engaged in helping you the awkward rocks/pools and then asking for tips, they had removed the helpful ropes that were in place when we went up, it was also getting very crowded, it is not a wide area towards the end with the amount going in and flowing out if they all got the end it was going to be a big queue and very crowded, glad we did the walk first but it was lovely and cool, the water at the start / end is very cold, like icy cold. Overall a good experience and day out, plenty to do when you return to the park area, we used a local guide from Kalkan which would be my other top tip, we had no worries about parking, he took us straight in, we were dropped right at the gate, all payments were sorted we just enjoyed the time there and then went onto other places in the afternoon.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"We last visited here twenty years ago and have noticed that the entrance area has become much more commercialised. There is a massive car park, lots of cafes and numerous shops. The river itself seems a bit lost amongst them.

We visited as part of a private family tour taking in tlos and gizlikent gorge as well. The organisors also arranged for us to do the rafting down the river on rubber boats. This was great fun and probably the highlight of the day. We sat in rubber ring boats and floated down the river for about a mile. Again as in all of turkey there was no health and safety rules so this made it more fun as it was all a bit dangerous. We were then driven back to the entrance.

We then went into the gorge itself, however so were what seemed like 20 thousand others. This made the whole place seem overcrowded and less fun. I would advise an early visit if you want to experience the magnificence of the place. However it is still a special place, but has become too popular for its own good.

Absolutely empty at the time - perfect

By the time we can back down at 11 it was packed

Amazing experience when quiet

We had a guide (which is a bit of a swizz really) but he guided us right up the last few steep and slippy bits to the waterfall (2km point where you have to turn around)

Excellent morning

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"After visiting Xanthos, our jeep safari went bounding down the back roads towards Saklikent. Our first sighting of the river was at the side of the road a couple of miles out from the main park. A little way up the road and our driver pulled off the carriageway and into the river for a little off road water driving which was unexpected, but amazing. A short ride into the park we decided the first thing we should do was rafting. Helmet, check, life jacket, check, rubber ring and paddle, check. Chuck yourself into the ring and off you go down stream with the tide pretty much meaning you don‚Äôt have to do anything but steer, and spin. Really fun start to the day. Onto the gorge. Make sure you wear beachwear as you will get wet, so many people looked like they‚Äôre going for a night out. The gorge is busy but it doesn‚Äôt spoil the walk or the shear beauty of the rocks caverning above you. There‚Äôs a couple of points that you need to do a small climb but there‚Äôs people that will help you. The prize at the end is a waterfall which you can refresh in before making the journey back. The restaurants in the park are a good standard and you can relax on the cushions or even in a hammock by the side of the tranquil stream, you might also see a peacock. We had a brilliant day at Saklikent Milli Park, I strongly advise you visit.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"We decided to visit here on our two week holiday and I am so glad we did, it is so cheap for the entrance fee and parking, we decided to hire some of the jelly shoes as it is not advised to wear flip flops and I agree as some of the rocks in the water are very slippery. Which was a bargain at 4TL! When you first go in this is the busiest bit as everyone is sat down, I loved the benches in the water you could sit on. It was shaded too so it cooled you down in the heat. Was lovely! We eventually tried to make our way down, and we were being hassled by a guy trying to sell us all sorts of things do please watch out for this! He was trying to be helpful, helping us down but he was there touting! This didn‚Äôt put us off as once you are actually walking in the gorge it is even more stunning. Walking near the water fall was hard work though, everyone holding onto the rope at the same time was a challenge!! On the way out we went for some food on the beds on the river, I really enjoyed this but it was slightly confusing how to order etc. I absolutely loved this place!!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"It's one of the biggest attractions in the area so unfortunately it will ALWAYS be busy! But the further you go into the gorge, the quieter it gets. After walking for about 5 minutes, you reach your first mini waterfall which weeds out the tourists from the hikers! You'll need proper rock shoes (which can be bought for 10TL in the car park). Flip flops will be washed away in the fast current at the beginning. Be prepared to get wet!!! Take valuables with you at your own risk. If you plan to hike to the end (Apparently 4k but it can't have been more than 2k) you'll need to leave phones/cameras in the car or have waterproof pouches for them; water levels reach up to belly height in some places.

You don't need to waste money on a guided tour to get here. Just drive/taxi and it's self explanatory when you get there! (Taxi's are so cheap, it'll likely only be 30TL max).

Toilets and refreshments on site. (1TL charge for toilets).

The signs outside aren't brilliant so your not too sure what to take in with you, towels, more money, cameras etc... nobody ""claims"" to speak very good English ( ok this is my ignorance as I don't speak Turkish). You pay your money to walk the Gorge, once the other side you are told that you cannot walk the river without a guide, totally understandably. You ask the guide how much? They reply with a price, which is reasonable, you proceed to ""shoe hire"". We then overhear another tourist arguing with a guide over the price once they had returned, they had been quoted 7tl per person, the guide was trying to demand 120tl per person, slight difference in price!!! It set alarm bells ringing for us as we only took a small amount of money in with us, when we questioned our guide his English got very bad that apparently he didn't ""understand"" what I was saying, more alarm bells, so in the end we declined going on the river walk. He ranted at me and chucked my shoes at my feet and walked off to find the next lot to rip off!

Foot outside the gorge is pretty decent. Nothing special, but the the prices are fair and the portions are plentiful. Fresh squeezed fruit juice is available, too.

The public minibus/dolmus from Fethiye was supposed to be only about an hour, but due to crowding was more like 1h45, so budget time appropriately. Cost from Fethiye was something like 15 lira, give or take (can't remember exactly, but very reasonable given the distance.)

There is a walk up to the beginning of the gorge around the rocks on a wooden walkway - very sturdy and no problems. Then you hear the amazing noise from the waters coming from the gorge. A few sprays of welcoming water on the way. You may need to rent some shoes to walk on the rocks up the gorge - you also have to hold onto a rope as the waters are a little bit deep and fast flowing. Once on the gorge you can escape the blistering sunshine as it is mostly shaded - which is a welcome.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Went here on a half day trip with an excursion group from hotel.

This place is amazing. It takes about 40mins (for me anyway) to get to a curtain point then you walk back the same way you came. I think you can go more, but that includes some climbing, as it gets more slippery and advance physical body strength, to what I saw personally.
Any age can turn up for this place, but I recommend from 3/4 years up for a child and a good leave of fitness of elderly folk as at the beginning they is strong waterfall that you need to cross, to walk along the Gorge and at parts along the trail as some area dip quite deep too. I watch a little small girl almost got submerged in a pocket the father didn‚Äôt see and quickly yanked her up as they was both shocked by all. Also the water is clear and quite cold in some parts too.
You need really good level of foot wear too, as the rocks can be quite slippery. I wore good travelling sandals and was slipping around with the small rocks getting under my feet. So trainers your willing to get damaged or those sea shoes you can get that has a plastic vase at bottom. They do hire shoes and hard hats for the day of 4 lire‚Äôs and they wash the shoes after you‚Äôve used them too.

What I‚Äôve been told you can do water rafting there too, but I didn‚Äôt see it, so it maybe up the river from the gorge need to ask when you visit the place.

This area Of Turkey is supplied with millions of gallons of water from the mountains, and even in mid summer there is water flowing everywhere.
We were brought here given a trip up the Gorge(upstream) then had a very nice lunch, then drinks by the water to relax for a while.
Remember a small coin to use the toilets .
After we were offered the choice go downstream in a rubber ring or drive the short distance and meet up with the rubber ringers as they came down stream.
But remember this is fresh water very cold from a mountain.
If you go on one of the Jeep trips to here, be ready to get WET!

Expect to pay to enter Gorge. It was only 6TL each which is nothing. I had to buy some water shoes too because they warned that to enter the Gorge we needed to cross the river and it would wash off sandals/
Flip flops. They were only 10TL but bear this in mind and perhaps wear something you don't mind getting wet and will stay on your feet.

You can do all kinds of activities in the Gorge - zip wire, kayak or a bungee jump. These are extra - I think between 40-60 TL for zip wire and kayak or 200TL for bungee.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,2.0,"I think we should have woken up earlier and got out of our beds at dawn for this trip. By the time we arrived, it was busy ( 12pm). But by the time we left (3pm) it was positively heaving. So we decided at 3 pm to give the promised rafting experience and rafting queues a miss and head to Patara beach to escape. It felt a bit like a 'Chessington World Of Adventures' experience/ ordeal - but in 35 degree heat. To be fair, the 1000 m trip along the gorge was ok. Although the hundreds of other Turkish tourists all doing the same, slipping and sliding past each other in the narrow crevice, kind of spoilt the natural beauty of the place. Plus the 5 lire rubber river shoes we thought we needed ended up giving all of us red raw heels/ blisters. I did keeping saying to myself..' this is an experience our 3 children won't forget'. And we did have a laugh as we drove away, through the hoards of people eating awful, self service, food on shabby sofas immersed in the river, thinking they were doing the cool thing. We passed loads of empty, dusty, hot safari jeeps in the car park and were thankful for our air conditioned hire car. We also had a laugh that we were fooled into hiring a guide who pointed to a large bill board at the entrance to the gorge who said we needed a guide ( for 70 lire) if we wanted to reach the waterfall. The picture in our minds of the gushing waterfall at the end of the long trek kept us going through the heat and along the rocks ( and our guide helped us over the larger rocks with the same words for 1000m ' very slippery. You ok?' ) Which became like a comedy mantra for our holiday. It turned out that the waterfall after 1000m, which as able- bodied people we could have reached without a guide was just a large boulder wedged in the gorge with a trickle of water. To reach the big waterfall , for which we realised we had actually paid, we would have to abseil up the lethal looking rock, using an attached rope. We watched a few strapping local lads floundering and failing and decided we would have to give up on the idea, much to the outrage of my 13 year and 12 year old daughters, who realised they had been conned. ' Maybe later? maybe next year?' Is all our guide could say in his defence. No. Maybe not next year. Unless we get up at the crack of dawn and complete a mountaineering course in the meantime...

Take shoes that you can get wet and have a good grip. You can buy or hire rubber shoes at the entrance if you forget.
The entrance fee is only 6 lira per person. You buy a ticket at the booth and then head for the entrance where there are security checks.
Walk along the wooden walkway and see the first spectacular views of the gorge. Wade through the icy water (there is a rope to help) and then walk up the gorge to the waterfall. The walk is stony and wet but not steep. There are a few places where a guide can help you up trickier places for a couple of lira. The walk to the waterfall (just over a km) is well worth the effort.
Great photo opportunities and you can also have fun with the impromptu mud puddles!
We left the gorge at about 11am and it was starting to get busy - glad we made the effort to get there at 9am.

It is best to go earlier in the day as by midday it was very busy and therefore you have to walk in single file along the platform.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"Saklikent is a beautiful gorge that allows you to walk up a path partially submerged in water. Arriving early in the day is a must (we got there around 9am) since the more crowded it gets, the more cramped and less fun the experience. Be sure to park as close as you can, opposite the entrance.

Entrance fees are cheap, but if you are with small children as we were (ages: 8,6,3), you will need to hire the services of a guide who are super-useful when climbing up the gorge. After a short walk (2 min) on wooden planks, you will arrive at a small staging area where you can rent plastic shoes for the water part, recommended if you do not have your own - stones can be slippery and you need good grip. You will then cross a relatively strong current of freezing and knee-deep water into the gorge. The walk in the gorge is about 2km, back and forth. We were there in August so the water in the gorge itself was not deep. Climbing up was easy enough but there are some points where you will need assistance, especially with kids.

Summing up - a lot of fun, great experience for the kids, and a nice escape from the August heat.

Please, do not take your belongings(cellular phones, cameras, sunglasses, etc.) with you, because they will get wet.

You might be offered a helping hand by a 'guide' in a yellow helmet - they are super kind, but really looking to help you along your journey in the hope of a tip! Do use their assistance if needed, but make it clear you are fine on your own thereon!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Visited here with my teenage son who wasn't particularly looking forward to what he thought was going to look at a river with his dad. His mood changed pretty quickly after arriving and we both had a great day(believe me he isn't easily impressed).
Upon arrival you walk along a raised platform in quite stunning surroundings before entering probably the coolest water crossing you will ever experience, once through the water crossing(which was around ankle to knee depth when we visited) you walk through the wider part of the gorge. The further you climb the narrower it gets and at some points becomes a bit more challenging. Suitable footwear is essential which can be hired for small cost at entrance.
If you are not planning travelling far through the gorge due to mobility there are floating platforms with tables and chairs where you can have lunch and drinks. There are also water rafting trips on the river which we didn't try but looked enjoyable.
We arrived early to avoid the organised tours(jumped on dolmus beside Fethiye mosque) as looked like it gets very busy as day goes on but by all accounts late afternoon is also good time to visit.
Entrance cost to gorge was 6tl which was less than ¬£1.50!

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"We visited saklikent and walked the gorge and had a go at the tubing. To walk the gorge you need a very good pair of shoes ... you will get wet and rough ground to walk over. Flip flops are a definite no no. If you want to complete the walk it is quite hard going in places ... we had the help of a Turkish guide, who we tipped and think it was worth it. He was able to point out the rocks under water, deep holes and where to step to get up the steep rocks and gave the odd helping hand. You can do it on your own but it is tricky. At the end you will reach a small waterfall ... nothing wow ... but we enjoyed our walk.

For the tubing we paid 30tl each for about 30/45 minutes of fun. You basically sit in a rubber ring and paddle down the fast flowing river. It's not particularly deep just the odd boulder to dodge. We had a guide come down but were pretty left to our own devices ... he was quite handy for photo taking though. In previous years they just met you at the end with the van to take you back to the start. All in all it was fun and would highly recommend.

There are lots of places to sit and have a drink by the rivers edge which is nice. Toilets on the other hand were disgusting!

The gorge is a wonderful place to see, but steer clear of the catering.

Where you once could get reasonable food served to you while sitting at the water's edge it is service of the worst. Staff at the counter are not friendly. They almost reluctantly take your order. You wait for it at the counter then take your order to the table. The food is not good. Even a simple Turkish pancake verged on the side of inedible. Prices are not cheap.

The toilets have to be some of the most unsanitary experienced.

Our trip included a lovely buffet lunch, the food was good, lots of chicken, salads and veggies.

This is an inexpensive experience starting with a walk through a river which, dependent upon the time of the year, can be knee to waist deep. I should add that you normally cross in groups all holding hands as the water is fast flowing. Having crossed the main river you walk up the gorge which is spectacular. If you are you and fit you can go about two miles up the gorge but most people go about half a mile. You needn't worry about getting wet as you soon dry out in the heat. Afterwards you can go to one of the many lovely restaurants at the entrance to the gorge and sit with with you feet in the water, with a cold drink while discussing your experience.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Beautiful gorge, can enjoy without having to plunge into the water if it's not your thing. A few tips which I found online to be useful, plus a couple of my own.

If you do take your phone and valuables, take a zip lock bag to keep them waterproof.

If you have your own waterproof shoes such as beach shoes then take them, otherwise you can rent a pair of jelly type shoes for 3 liras. If you do rent, go for a slightly tight size as it'll keep the small stones out somewhat and you'll be far more comfortable (as my husband wished he had)

Go as far as youre comfortable and be sensible and safe. There are local guides who can help you and they expect 5-10 lira payment. We chose not to take a guide, but found that one announced to several small groups who had gathered at a place to take photos, that it was too dangerous to continue on. He then led them all back, he had started off with just one small group and left with about 5 groups in the end. My husband and I came to the conclusion that he was a little business savvy and increased his business substantially. We decided to go against his advice and continued on without much further difficulty, but there will come a point where it's too difficult to continue. Our tour guide explained that everyday the depth and strength of the currents differ.

There are lockers which are free to use, so take a change of clothes as you will get wet (the first part is the worst, it's deep and freezing!)

The zip lining is a lot of fun, 3 short zips for 45 liras. Great value for money.

A very nice place to spend a few hours

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Before going, ensure that you have footwaer which grips well in water because 99% of this walk is in cold water, sometimes crotch-deep, sometimes knee-deep. When you first cross the stream, the intense cold really hits you since it is crotch-deep, but it is definitely worth it. I'd recommend taking the raft down the river afterwards with the mud bath. Great fun.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"In April it is still very cold and the water is higher than summer and the current quite strong. We hired a guide and he took us in almost to the waterfall. The place was extraordinary. Without the guide we would never have gone as far as we did. He knew exactly where the water was shallow and deep. He held our 7 year old daughter's hand most of the way and helped the rest of us in and out. It was truly a great experience and I would definitely do it again. He charged 100TL to take us in, but we split it with another family who also wanted to go. And that is a good suggestion in my opinion. Save yourself some cash.

You can take a leisurely tour by yourself. Be prepared to get wet. Shoes are rented at the gorge. You will need them. There are many other activities to do here apart from the gorge tour. You can zipline, raft down the river, mudbaths or just relax in restaurants hanging above the water. Loved the experience.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"Poetry In Motion and Challenge in a Gorge. It‚Äôs breathtaking! It‚Äôs Magical
.
Saklikent is around 40 km east of Fethiye Canyon in Saklikent National Park which is about 18 km long, almost 300 meters deep, interesting and fun,
Challenging, steep, narrow and unbelievably mysteriously beautiful!

Need to be agile for this, soon as you enter, the Gorge simply take‚Äôs over. Overwhelming feel and gigantic rocks simply look majestically poetic!
Rocks are rocks you can pick one up and skim-throw it across the water but some rocks are mountains. Saklikent Gorge is a mountain range and it stays where it is!
Its beauty leis in, from bottom to top in contours and mineral rich water flowing through it.
No turn is like the previous one you have just come around from.
Once inside it don‚Äôt believe you are seeing zombies if you come across people covered in mud, mineral mud to be precise. Many people believe in healing properties of the minerals found in mud and water, many will cover themselves with it.
Your stamina, energy reserve is tested here, walking through water sometime up to your waist and climbing over some boulders is physically impressive. In order to continue your journey to the water falls and into the canyon, about 2km distance from the entrance. There around the corner comes a pool large enough, where you will have to swim across to the other side.
.
If you wish to take up the challenge of at the least making it to the water falls,
Here is what you will need to take with you:-
Aquatic wear is highly recommended!
Bottles of water
Swimming shorts + water friendly shoe that will stay on your feet and have a good grip as you walk against the water rapids and on small & large rocks.
Clothes you don‚Äôt mind getting wet may be a set to change into afterward.
Swimwear
Camera in a waterproof bag.
Sun block cream
Money in Turkish currency.
.
Not a Healthy Walker?
Take a good look inside to appreciate the sheer beauty of the Gorge but taking up challenge walking deep into it is not recommended if you are not a healthy walker.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,5.0,"The gorge is very impressive. We decided to hire an official guide to go into the canyon to the waterfall; you're not supposed to go up without a guide and I certainly wouldn't recommend you try unless you are an experienced climber or caver. When we entered the canyon I hadn't reckoned with having to wade through water up to my chin (in fact I swam) and there were several tricky places where I need a bit of help (I'm 5' 2'' and 61) but the sense of achievement when we had completed it was immense. Murat, our guide, was brilliant, he even carried our bag so nothing got wet. The gorge is worth visiting even if you only do the made up walks at the lower end but f you are reasonably fit get a guide and do the whole thing, you won't regret it.

Turkey,Saklikent Milli Parki,4.0,"We spent a few hours at the Gorge Saklikent in the late afternoon.

We walked over the bridge to the Gorge entrance. The scenery was breathtaking, especially the huge crevice in the rock. We were surrounded by vast sculpted walls towering high above our heads and the sound of water rushing through the ravines, felt magical. It was an awesome experience.

We then sat by the river, opting for the bank rather than the seating areas on wooden platforms suspended just above the rushing waters. We relaxed on the Turkish rugs and cushions under a shady tree and watched those who chose to participate in the white water rafting and zip line across the river.

If you like less commercialised then visit Gizlikent waterfall instead. Just a few kilometres away from Saklikent and free! Remember to take good water shoes to both places the rubber shoes you can rent don't really do the job. Old trainers are by far the best.

The mud is supposed to have some sort of magic, and we passed people with mud facials, but no one in my group tried it. We just did the hike, but there is also rafting and other activities available.

Alas as my wife cant swim we couldnt go any further, but enjoyed the the yelps of people crossing through the freezing water,some of the reactions were hilarious. They have also done a great job with the entrance area, you can eat on a floating deck on the river, or come down the river on an inner tube.There were plenty of places to eat and drink, and for us a little extra- one of the bars was manned by an exact lookalike of our son,that was another good photo.All in all a place not to miss.

First you have to wander across the rickety bridge and then you wander down into the freezing cold waters below!
I mean seriously this water is colder than ice, it will fade your tan to a perfect blue or purple colour until you actually get blood back in your feet again.
It's a nice touch that there are photographers dotted about and will take your picture which you can look out for later in the day - and buy for a small cost.

You can wander for so far until you can go no further a lot is quite tricky, but at the far end you will definitely need specialised climbing equipment.
There are some spiders which we came across that seem to sink into the little pools of water, was a great laugh for the people who were scared.

I'm not a fit woman and have lacked confidence since becoming a single mum but getting up this gorge gave me back my guts! We didn't actually make the last bit.

A guide joined us although wasn't requested. The walk became more and more difficult and at one point we needed to swim. The mud was like quicksand - when you went into it then it was difficult to get out of. The journey to the 'waterfall' was beset with difficulties - dangerous for the infirm and was disappointing after such a difficult journey. We were fortunate to have a guide helping; although unfortunate in another sense for without the guide we would have turned around. What was also unfortunate was the charge for the guide - not spoken about at the start of the journey but at the end when an amount of money was offered because of his helpfulness during the journey but this wasn't considered enough.

I would return to Saklikent as it is a beautiful area but wouldn't again venture to see a waterfall that was small and not worth the effort.

Even if you know nothing about sailing or yachts, you cant fail to admire some of the fabulous gulet boats with their tall elegant masts, and polished wooden hulls, or the magnificent array of leisure craft and glamorous yachts moored along the seafront. They are the stuff of dreams - and James Bond movies! There are plenty of restaurants and bars with views of the waterfront at which to enjoy a meal or a refreshing drink. But choose carefully where you spend your money. These big, impersonal eateries are in a prime position so are not cheap. And they know most customers are just passing through and unlikely to return.

Next to the bazaar area and we never got hassled once by the shop owners which really surprised us.
We then made our way back to the port with a lovely stroll through the marina in the sun admiring the very large and expensive looking boats.
If you get the opportunity to visit Marmaris don't pass it up, from our experience it's well worth it.

Turkey,Marmaris Marina,4.0,"We were staying a few miles out of Marmaris, but took a trip in one day to do the 'bazaar' thing and have a wander along the front. The beach gives way to a marina where all the touristy trips and local water taxis do their thing.

Most surprisingly though, is carry on walking and around the corner is a lovely marina with boats you can only dream of owning, bars and restaurants by the dozen and some beautiful sculptures and public art. Such a relaxing place by day and the bar owners - like everyone we met - were happy, engaging and offered great value drinks and food.

By night it is much much busier and we discovered that Bar Street is just behind too. No reason not to go though and it is a wonderful place to spend some time even if you are not out on the town.

It seemed that everything was on offer, but not 'in your face' tourist noise and mayhem, rather a well managed area with something for everyone. We will be back - soon.

In the end we went in one bar just to get some peace. The views are beautiful and we loved looking at all the yachts and fantasizing about who owned them and what it would be like to own one.

I'm not really a boat person, but i was in awe looking at some of the boats. There is also a section of posh shops in an area on its own, which is nice to walk through. Even though i haven't been there at night, the area leads onto a lot of quirky bars and is very much near the Grand Bazar. Very much worth a look round.

Turkey,Marmaris Marina,5.0,"We LOVE Turkey. So much so, we have holidayed in many locations there 16 times in the past 17 years.

It's fun to visit Marmaris' Bazaar and to enjoy taking home such high quality goods at amazing prices - though the constant haranguing by every single trader can get tiresome, but of course it's their business to do everything they can to get you to buy from them, not from another trader selling the same goods.

Apart from Bazaar shopping, nothing else in Marmaris ever attracted us - until we stayed at the Imperial (the opposite side of Marmaris Bay).

We took the 30 minute water taxi which docked in Marmaris Marina. We were really impressed with it. As we walked from the marina towards the Bazaar, we were so surprised at how beautiful that end of Marmaris was. Definitely far more high end than anything we'd seen on many previous visits to the other end of Marmaris.

Turkey,Marmaris Marina,5.0,"I'm writing this review about a year after visiting Marmaris Imperial hotel, not because I have anything negative to say, it's just that I have been on so many other holidays since visiting Marmaris that it has made me appreciate just how good it is.

The food is amazing, we were well fed every night with fresh choices and a variety of different cuisines.
Most nights had a theme of cooking and a chefs corner where they would prepare and cook the food in front of you. It was always lovely and a nice touch.

The location is perfect, you have the choice of laying by a pool, sitting on a jetty or chilling on a private beach. We went in the height of August and there was always somewhere for us to sit, no matter what time we got up. We're not in to the whole - getting up early to reserve a sun bed - thing. So that worked well for us.

If you're in to you water sports, there's plenty you can have a go at while you're there,
obvioudly at an additional cost.

We loved our holiday and this hotel and are hoping to return.

There are various food outlets but by far Roberts Coffee shop is the best both for the high standard of Coffee/food and views of the marina. a local had advised me to go there if I liked coffee and if I wanted good views of the marina. Roberts always had a good crowd when I visited but I was always able to get a table. The food and drink are excellent and good value for money not the cheapest but not expensive either. When I visited the lower part of the building was popular but as I previously a local told me to go upstairs for the views. The atmosphere was great nice music friendly staff the upper floor was great auir con and great views I was by myself and dont think most of the other tourists were even aware that the place had an upper floor I spent a good couple of visits chilling out and relaxing. well worth taking the time to find Roberts.

Turkey,Marmaris Marina,5.0,"Marmaris actually has 2 large and one small marina.The largest one with over 3 000 yacht capacity,the Yat marina is a little bit out of the town,where you travel by taking a dolmu≈ü minibus.It take s about 20 mins from the center of the town.The second one Netsel Marina is at the end of the long quay in front of Marmaris.The third one is a small one tucked behind the Marmaris port,which itself is tucked to the eastern side of Netsel Marina.Then there is the municipality s shore tieups,seen in the pictures above.In Municipality tieups,there is electricity and water but the rest you have to fend for yourself.However on the other side of the road there are many restaurants, and the next street behind the resturants is the Bar street,which is true to its name.In this short note I shall describe Netsel Marina a little bit,where I kept my boat for for more than 10 years,and still yearn for the time I passed there.This is a full size marina, though Yat Marina can handle larger boats,Netsel is good for 25-30 meters also.It ha s good restaurants (on the expensive side,if you choose the ones overlooking the sea).And shopping again expensive, in a shaded area behind the restaurants.There is a market right in the entrance,MIGROS,with a large choice of daily necessities.However town shopping is nearby and the larger shops offer delivery service.There is satisfactory boat servicing.and above the two floors of the shops a small number of small apartments,for the lucky owners who bought them in the 1992-93,during the building stage of the marina.They look at the boats from abave.The marina is like a vacation village at the end of the town quays,with a life of its own.We do visit it from time to time whether to have a cup of coffee or something to eat gazing over the many boats.Give it a try when you are in Marmaris

Turkey,Marmaris Marina,4.0,"The visit to the Marina was more of a ‚Äúflying visit‚Äù as we were on our way to Rhodes on the Catamaran.

Staff are friendly, ticket desk was slightly slow but this is for obvious reasons such as being peak season.

Passport control also was rather busy, but again, this is due to staff carrying out due diligence for security purposes.

I would recommend however, that when there is lengthy queues at the Passport control that there should be barriers in place to prevent the frequent queue jumpers as this was very frustrating to experience, especially when waiting 30-45 minutes.

The marina is very clean, water provided which is especially useful on sunny days, and as previously stated staff are friendly.

Turkey,Marmaris Marina,4.0,"Turkey should be renamed ‚ÄòHassle‚Äô after how each & every shop owner will go to any length to get you in. I‚Äôm proud of how I look, but have never been called Rambo so many times nor had my tattoo called on as much as walking back to the port to go back to Rhodes. There is an array of boats that line the area, with shops & bazaars all around. You can buy anything from original copy Mulberry handbags to diamonds for very good price as you‚Äôre always their first customer so this must bring them luck today. There is a pier you‚Äôre not allowed to go on which was lovely for a sandwich & the bins are disguised with fake grass with pots for cigarettes on either side. Each shop is worth a haggle & every one will want to tempt you inside. Be careful of the exchange rate where there is a price as they‚Äôll do you for it if they can. They all know a cousin with shop they can do you best price for whatever it is you‚Äôre looking for, the Scottish guy in front of us said the bar owner just wandered until he saw the first shop with a handbag in. To be fair, it‚Äôs well kept & there was a police presence which was reassuring. The warble of the call to prayer takes over so just be aware, but enough people carry on their normal lives without rushing off to mosque. It‚Äôs clean & well kept, of course no free WiFi but easily traversed if you have to consider this before you go. Oh and the duty free, just blows my mind. You‚Äôre only allowed 1kg of tobacco still but it costs less than your handbag, whilst the perfumes are cheaper in Boots back home.
I also loved the rubbish statues that littered the streets all around the marina, in particular an octopus caught my eye. Have to say, for all the hassle & nonsense Turks are very grateful when you do spent your hard earned & will look after you if you do sit down to eat or drink.

Take care up the steps as they are a bit uneven in places. At the top we were pleasantly surprised with the small but well kept bar. With two or three viewing areas where you can sit for a drink (you need one by the time you get to the top) or a meal while your views of the marina and Marmaris are superb. We could have sat there for hours watching the world go about it's business but we had other places to see and the thought of going back down those steps with one to many drinks was a worry!!

There are two types of tickets:
Normal Ticket for: 105 TL where you have to wait in the line for nearly 30 mins and exchange your cable car mod way (not a direct trip, yet the whole ride in both cars in almost 25-30 mins including the exchange)
Fast Track Ticket: 225 TL, where you skip the line and don‚Äôt wait plus it‚Äôs a direct ride
The above prices are for a round trip
The car itself is meant to accommodate 8 pax yet mostly are used by 6 only which is more comfy, views during the ride are amazing
The main drawback is in the stations where there is snow outside the floor is really slippery and many fall incidents happened including myself leading to some injuries; so it‚Äôs important to take care of this as inside the station we have no skiing gear and any snow on the floor makes it super slippery and leads to such incidents

Very important tip: if the teleferik stopped moving at any moment you should not get panic.. it usually takes a few seconds to move again.. I guess that such stopping happened due to some safety restrictions due to the wind speed sometimes..

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"This is gonna be the most complete review about how you get to bursa teleferric i hope. first you should go to yenikapi IDO terminal and take a ticket for 31 liras to bursa. (i think there is same in eminonu terminal but I'm not sure) the ticket is cheaper if you can buy online and you don't have to wait in line but it does not matter much because the line is not long for bursa. The ships are hourly but i recommend you go early because it's a long way and you need time to enjoy the very beautiful teleferric and catch the last ship for getting back to Istanbul. When you reached bursa buy a bursa cart and top it up with about 20tl for each person. You will get off the ship in bursa ferry terminal if you take IDO ships or Mudanya terminal if you take BUDO ships. Anyway at both terminals you have to take buses with number GY1 (at bursa ferry terminal) or M1 (at Mudanya) to get to metro Emek station. get off in Osman gazi station walk few minutes to bus station and get on bus number S2. It will take you to teleferric. You can take the same way for return in the same way. About two hours in ship and 1.5 hours to teleferric so it's kind of long way but if you like traveling on the blue sea and passing between olive trees it will not make you tired.
Teleferric ticket is 67 tl for adult. 130 tl especial ticket.( you don't have to wait in line and just your family in cabin) it takes 50 min to go and return if you don't want to stay up there for a while which i don't recommend.
Hint: in the teleferric a Turkish woman told me there is bus from istanbul to bursa ans takes about 1.5 hours and 30 liras. But I'm not sure because of language barrier.
Hint: exchange your money in istanbul you hardly can find a place in bursa. But shopping is much cheaper.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,4.0,"Bursa is a city in the northwest region of Turkey, lying in the foothills of roughly 2,500m-high Mount Uludaƒü near the Sea of Marmara.

The city is known for its mosques and historical sites from the early Ottoman Empire. It's nicknamed ""Ye≈üil Bursa"" (Green Bursa) owing to its many parks and trees, as well as its dramatic mountain backdrop.

You take the teleferik or cable ride to go up the mountain and see the entire city. At the top of mountain there are some souvenir shops but the best shop was where we got hot and spicy misir or corn.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"For many people who visit Turkey, making a stop in Bursa isn‚Äôt much of a consideration. Nearby ƒ™stanbul not only serves as the gateway to the country, but it ends up being a primary destination. Most people do not make the easy, couple-hour trek south to Bursa, and those who do usually only make it a quick one- or two-day excursion. Even some popular travel guides tell you that Bursa is only worth a quick day trip.

I would strongly suggest otherwise.

Though ƒ™stanbul is certainly an enchanting city and there are a few essential things that all tourists should see and do there, I propose that Bursa actually makes a better destination to plant yourself for a few days and really explore and experience genuine Turkish culture. So, once you‚Äôve spent a day or so in ƒ™stanbul gaping in amazement at Hagia Sophia, strolling across Galata Bridge, and eating fresh fish in a caf√© overlooking the Bosphorus, get yourself straightaway on a fast ferry to Bursa and stay for a few days.

From the top it takes about 20 minutes down to the cable station but it's truly a sight to behold. The views from top are absolutely stunning in the winter time where mother nature shows off her assets by way of endless trees capped with snow and some river down on the forest floor. Make your way to the top and enjoy a steaming cup of turk kahvesi alongside the fire.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"I had an awesome trip to Uludag using Teleferik Cable Car from Istanbul.
I am sharing on how to make a day trip to Bursa / Uludag from Istanbul for the benefit of readers.

While there are a number of transportation options for going to Bursa, using the ferry boat is a popular and cost effective mode.

There are two ferry companies operating from Istanbul. IDO operates between Yenikapi (Istanbul) to Guzelali (Bursa). BUDO operates from Eminonu (Istanbul) to Mundanya (Bursa). Details are available on their respective websites.

We (a family of four, including two young kids) took the BUDO to Bursa. The ticket counter is at the pier in Eminonu. If you book online, you can get promotional tickets at lower price. I tried doing that but somehow the transaction kept being unsuccessful. The ticket price is 30TL per person (adult / child above 5.5 years) one way. Once you get the ticket, you board the ferry that has two decks and a small cafeteria inside. I took the first ferry (0830 hours). The ferry ride took about 2 hours.
Once at Mundanya port, you can go directly to the Teleferik station using bus F3. The bus is stationed right outside the BUDO pier at Mundanya. Ticket can be purchased from a small tuckshop located right next to the bus station for 6 TL per adult.
The bus journey took 45 minutes. Once at Teleferik Station, you can get the tickets at the ticket counter. For 2 adults and 2 children, we paid TL 200 for the roundtrip (TL 60 for adults, TL 40 for child). The elevation of the mountain is 2500 meters, but the cable car length is 8.4 km. You can have a photo taken against a green background at the cable car boarding area, which will be later available for purchase for TL25 with a modified background of snowy area (3 options are provided).

The cable car is safe and even is high crosswinds, the ride remained quite stable. Once you reach the intermediate station, you have to disembark and take another similar cable car to further go upto the mountain top. The intermediate station has a small market place, toilets and refreshment area where you can freshen up and purchase winter wear. As soon as you get off the cable car, some salesgirls approach you with your photo printed on a glass plate, available for TL80.

The next cable car takes you to the mountain top, where there is another station that has a few restaurants and cafes. Toilets are also available, charged at 2 TL per visit. Winter jackets and ski equipment is available there on rental basis.

After some sightseeing and enjoying in the snow, we took the return cable car at around 1400 hours and reached back at the Teleferik station just in time to catch the F3 bus parked at the station. Bus tickets are available at a few shops in the marketplace a few hundred meters from the bus stop.

The return journey also took about 45 min. While at the BUDO pier in Mundanya, we bought the tickets from the counter and embarked the ferry at 1700 hours.

It was a short trip to Uludag but thoroughly enjoyable and at the same time it was not too taxing on the kids.

Hope this helps anyone looking to make a similar day trip to Bursa / Uludag via ferry.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,1.0,"We were supposed to go down the mountain using the teleferick on 29th dec 2017 evening around 6PM, due to rain and heavy snow too many people stormed the building at once. There was only 1 security guard who was unable to control the crowd, and he simply closed the doors and was opening the doors once in a while which made the people crazy and it was extremely lucky that no stampede took place. We were very scared with young kids as there was very real chance of stampede and injuries were possible.

The security guy did not care about the families with kids and was unable to manage the situation, but he did not even call for back up.

Overall we were very disappointed and scared of the teleferick service on that particular day. The authorities must do something to control the crowds in such situations if they want to avoid a major incident happening at his place (Specially the entrance building)

We took a private car from Sultanahmet to Bursa/Uludag as my son wanted to play with snow for the first time in his life. We departed early at about 8 am and we reached Bursa about 3 hours later. I suggest earlier departure will shorten the travel time as you can avoid long traffic at the Asia bridge. We spent about 45 minutes at Bursa Bazaar and please buy Bursa souvenirs here. You wont find the same items in Istanbul. Bursa is also popular for its silk scarves. From the bazaar about 15 minutes drive up hill and we were on our way in the cable car. At early December, this is the only place nearest to Istanbul where you can enjoy snow and ski. Becareful tho, the prices for souvenirs etc are expensive at the cable car rest areas.

Our first visits were cancelled by high winds and the construction of the New Telefrik. It was a wonderful trip to the top. The trip is divided into two stages, each approximately 4.4 km in length. First stages (with an intermediate non-stop turning point) takes you from an elevation of approx. 250 m to approx. 1600 m, in 10 to 12 minutes ride. After reaching first stage, where most activities are available, you need to change the cabin to reach the second stage located a further 4.4 km away at elevation 1800 m. Uldag Peaks at 2,500 m at some distance away. The second stage is where hotels and ski resorts are located. It is worth to climb to the second stage in the summer as well, even though there is no skiing or snow. Overall, you need about 45 minutes to go up and 45 minutes to come down to allow for the long ques. This does not allow for the time you spend at both stations.

Most activities are at the middle stage/station where there is small gift shops, coffee shops, food outlets, as well as several restaurants. Some restaurants where you can do your own grilling (restaurant provides the grill, flaming charcoal, your meat selections, plates and utensils). They can also grill for you at same price. The prices were reasonable and comparable to regular restaurants in the city. Other activities include renting of small RTVs and hiking.

From Istanbul, it's a wonderful 2-hour journey by road and ferry across a beautiful lake. The city is up on a hill with stunning viewds of the surrounding areas. Lots of historical remains especially on the history of the Ottoman empire.

The market is best. This was where tired travellers rest after their very long journey along the Silk Road. You can still find the water fountains where they quench their thirst and the mousalla to pray.

The cable cars are clean and as they are mostly constructed of glass, you can have very nice view of the surroundings. This is world's longest Gandola ride. When I took the trip there was dense fog during part of the travel. At the base they have nice restaurants and coffe shops.

The ride up is slow with lovely city views.
You stop at first station where you can get off or continue further up to ski centre.
At first station is numerous restaurants and self buy meat and barbecue restaurant which I found super awesome.

The second ride takes you upto hotels and ski centre where one can hire equipment and have some serious fun.

Please note they do have closing times depending on weather and if you arrive late just before closing time it's very very congested.

Wear appropriate clothing and shoes for snow as it's not easy to walk and one can get seriously injured.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"I was really looking forward to the teleferic and it didn't disappoint. We visited in October and it rained everyday with fog on the mountains, so we took advantage of the only day where we could actually see the mountain to go up.

We took bus 15 from Ataturk Cad (If you don't have a BuKart, buy a Tek Billet (single ticket) from shops and kiosks that have a 'Bukart' sign for 3TL, prior to boarding). Search for burulas for more info (the website is in English as well as Turkish).

The teleferic station at the bottom of the hill has a good selection of shops and it's clear where to buy a ticket and how to get on. We didn't have to wait but I am sure that you would in summer. The trip up is great. I felt alarmed at first, but you soon get used to the height. We saw the fog roll in next to us as we went up, but after a while we passed the foggy area and when we stopped at Sarialan station the air was incrediblely clear and clean.

We went for a walk rather than take a bus up to the hotel area, but there were lots of buses waiting if you wanted to carry on up.

There is a mosque close by and it was pretty amazing to hear a prayer being sung, surrounded by pine trees. There are some nice looking restaurants and cafes and I saw mountain bikes for rent. There were lots of picnic benches and places to sit down.

Once back down, there is bus stop right outside and you can buy a Tek billet from the kiosk as you reach the road.

This really would be a lovely day out in summer and I am sure you could spend all day there. It was still good in October and I suspect it's great in the snow!

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"Undoubtedly the highlight of my Bursa visit - whether a slothful couch-potato or someone interested in stretching your legs in the adjoining forests this is a MUST-DO! The two-stage cable way offers panoramic views of Bursa and surrounds but the final stage offers a journey with a thrill a minute!

The service is professional, efficient and value for money - an unparalleled experience when compared with other cable way experiences internationally. The bonus is the option of taking a 10km return trip hike, through mainly sub-alpine conifer forest, to the Uludag ski resort. Even though the current resort development is an absolute eye-sore and blight on the natural environment it clearly caters for a need. A special thanks to the elderly couple from Bursa, at one of the many recreational areas close to Uludag, who kindly shared their lunch and a chat. They warned me about the dangers posed by wild dogs but the dogs were only encountered on my return at the Teleferik picnic area. Perhaps a nasty accident waiting to happen!!

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"Bursa Telefrik

This was the most amazing memory i had about my recent trip to Turkey, the Bursa Teleferik rises up for more than 2400 meters over an 8 Km course that changes from uphill course to horizontal to perpendicular upwards, the view is magic, and worth every TL paid.
let me give you some important tips about how & when to reach there starting from Istanbul : you will have to go there by a fast ferry from Kabatach harbor ( for 50 TL round trip), which covers the distance to Bursa harbor in about two hours, there is another 70 KM from Bursa harbor to the Telefrik, you can take the bus ( for an 8 Tl) just in front of the harbor which will get you there in about 90 minutes depending on the traffic as the bus will have to go through the crowded Downton, Taxi can cover the distance in about 45 to 60 minutes but it will cost you between 80 to 95 TL depending on the course, so it is very important to start your day early if you want to enjoy this trip.
The Telefrik ticket is sold for 20 TL (one way) or 30 TL (for a round trip) and there is also a ticket for a family (husband , wife & 2 children).
You can also get to the top by car to enjoy the forest views and then get down in the Telefrik or vice versa
The Telefrik journey itself takes about 20 minutes in each direction and at the top there is a wide open forest area with some restaurants, souvenir stores , WC are also available. it is cold up there so remember to take a coat with you - that is in the summer- but in the winter you can get up there to practice ice skiing.
At the top you can pay extra 3 TL to get another Telefrik to the summit, I didn't use it but I heard it reaches a small village on the summit
make sure to know the exact times for ferries leaving bursa back to Kabatach, because if you miss the last one you will have to get back to Istanbul by bus, this will take about 4 & half hours.
there are other attractions at Bursa that you can find on the internet ( if you have the time).
Some tourists book 2 nights at a hotel in Bursa to enjoy it in a more relaxed way.
Enjoy!!!!

The journey took about 4-hours each way by coach and ferry until we reached the famous teleferik that took us all up the mountain where people enjoy skiin. On our way to Bursa however, we were lucky enough to stop at various very important shops where we purchased Turkish delight, fruit teas and oud (oil based) fragances that were of extremely good quality at low prices. Bursa was covered with pure white snow and it looked perfect and enchanting indeed.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,4.0,"That's a great way to get to the mountain. You can take a lot of pictures while coming up and down. As we were going up, our cabin had five people total and coming back, we waited for people to leave so had the cabin to ourselves, thus had a chance to take even better pictures. Little scary for me as I am afraid of hight, but overall, much better than expected. From the previouse reviews I understood we could go all the way to the hotels area this way, but as we arrived to the picnic area, everybody had to leave cabins. They were not going any further. We considered they were repairing something and started walking around. Beginning of May there was plenty of snow in the area! Part was cleaned, or snow melted already, there were tables to eat, places to cook bargeque. However, we walked further, on top of the snow, took many pictures, seen nice stream, crocuses blooming at the places were snow melted. My friend, while checking phone near pine tree and standing at one place for a while, suddenly went under the snow up to the waist:))) that was funny, but need to be careful at times of snow melting. Anyway, as we looked up, we saw cabins started moving further from the picnic area to the hotels! Guess, they let dolmus drivers to make some money from time to time by not sending people all the way up by cable car. So you pay additional three lira per person to get to the hotel area. Apart from this issue, the trip to Uludag was great.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,1.0,"We took Teleferik up to Uludag on Jan 1st 2015 after spending NYE in Bursa. The regular price for a roundtrip costs 30 tl. However, we were charged 50 tl each (group of three) because my boyfriend who bought tickets is a foreigner. We objected because there were no signs or directions that officially said they were allowed to over charge us. Moreover my boyfriend has been an official resident of Turkey for 17 years but that also didn't make a difference to them. Although we asked multiple times for them to show us any official sign to prove what they were doing was legal, they simply couldn't. It's a shame that small minded people still see foreigners as an opportunity to rip off. 20 tl difference might not be that much money but officials working at Teleferik shouldn't have the right to charge people as they see fit. What they are doing is wrong but even if they decided to overcharge foreign tourists, they should at least make it official it with signs.

Turkey,Bursa Teleferik,5.0,"I will start may review with the trip from ƒ∞stanbul, if some may need this information. Everything is sooo simple. The pricec as 2014 Turkish Lira.

If you are coming from Istanbul, Take the sea bus from Kabata≈ü to Bursa (Mudanya). 22 TL and 01:45 hrs. Buy your return ticket in advance as last 3 Seabus in a day always full. When you leave the bus, there will be a bus waiting for you (F3) to Teleferik (Cable car). 6 TL. F3 bus is always synchronous with Seabus. You can.'t miss it. 45 min more and you are at the Teleferik station. (You can buy bus ticket at the port building but be quick for the que.)

Teleferik station is very well designed new building. The toilets are exceptionally clean with hot water. This hot water is very nice if you have cold hands.

Round trip is 20(10 TL one way) TL and 15 min. The cabins for max 8 people. But it is big possibility you can ride as a lonely couple if the time is after 11:00.

It is fast and the angle is too high. You feel that you are really climbing the mountain. If no fog the view is priceless. There is a cable change station but you saty in the cabin. And after 15 min you arrive to Sarƒ±alan. There are few facilities at sarƒ±alan like Pala Restaurant but my recomendation is take the dolmu≈ü(A kind of minibus for 15 people) for more 10 min to the Oteller B√∂lgesi (Hotels area) with 3 TL.

So, if you start from Istanbul, totalliy 41 TL and 3-3,5 hrs you are at the Hotels area of Uludaƒü.
ƒ∞f you start from bursa, you can go the down station by public transport or taxi. It is in the city.

You can walk, ski, dine, if you like stay at hotel etc. But bring gloves and wear well. Have you phones fully charged for lots of pics.

If you go to hotels area, please consider you need to take dolmu≈ü again to Sarƒ±alan. The latest return time is 08:00. But my recommendation is return just the weather start to gets dark. In that time, the view from the cabin is priceless. You can see Bursa with city lights but not completely dark.

If you will hop on F3 to seabus port, check the time for your return time of ferry. It is 2 in a hour. So if you arrange well you can arrive to Istanbul very quickly.

Enjoy !

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"First of all this castle is not all about castle. It's also an under water archeological museum. You can examine interesting belongings that are centuries old inside this wonderful castle! I highly recommend it, it's a great opportunity to learn more about the castle and belongings that have found around Bodrum (English and Turkish languages are highly used while describing the items and objects). Also you can enjoy your time with amazing views and learn about people that have lived in this castle centuries ago. The castle is free for children under 18, Turkish teachers and for ones who has museum card (which is 60TL and works for most of the museums in Turkey). Others should pay 65TL. I recommend you to buy museum card instead (It's available for 1 year).

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,4.0,"Relatively well preserved. Currently undergoing restoration works, which affects the access of visitors in certain areas. Entrance fee: 65 TL. In the summer season (April-October) it is open from 10:00 to 22:00, although I hadn't found this information anywhere on the net. Monday is closed (unverified information). It houses a small archeological museum, Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archeology, located in rooms placed in different parts of the castle. Not very spectacular, interesting, though. They also have a small cafe in the inner courtyard (they have no beer ...) and at least one peacock that wanders freely there.

We're glad we visited whilst we were staying in gumbet.

However! We do not believe it was worth the ¬£38 we paid for 4 adults and 2 children.

The toilet facilities were also not cleaned and looked like they hadn't been cleaned for some time.
A few very suspicious looking marks wiped across the back of the toilet door and stains all over the walls that looked like they had not been cleaned for quite some time!

Can they really warrant asking people to comply with covid guidelines or even charge the amount they are charging when they clearly have not deep cleaned the facilites since the pandemic?!

I recommend to go there in the afternoon before the sun goes down. Then the atmosphere is best, especially if you are a photographer. The views of Bodrum and the glittering sea with all the boats can be overwhelming. Sometimes a lot of visitors hustle around, so you need to be patient if you want to take certain motives as photos. In any case there are a lot of romantic corners. - This time I paid 68 tl entrance fees for the castle and the underwater museum. Go there early enough because you might need two hours and more for your visit. Construction work has been going on in the castle for quite some time now. Two cranes might spoil your view ...

The fortifications and rooms are intact and represents those of castles during the Crusades. The view from the ramparts are great; you can see the entire city and harbor of Bodrum and also the Greek island of Kos, which is 7 miles off the coast. This castle is constructed with stones and blocks from the Tomb of Mausolus (one of the 7 wonders of the Ancient World). The history of Bodrum (Halicarnassus from the Carian League) is a must to see.

Seeing the underwater archaeology museum was my main reason to visit bodrum on this holiday. On arrival you need a card or lira to pay, they don't take euro so i had to go and change my currency when everyone else takes euro, I thought this was ridiculous for a main tourist destination. You can see the walls, the mosque, the courtyard which has a very old tree and some interesting sculptures and two rooms which have shipwreck artefacts. Everything else is shut. No information is provided about the castle so if you do go in, try downloading Wikipedia so you have a context, this does make a difference as until I read this and retraced my steps I hadnt noticed all of the carvings up high on the walls and I then started spotting bits of the mausoleum that were used to rebuild it.

Castle is at far end of Bodrum harbour at end of a small isthmus. Entrance is from the walkway alongside the harbour.
Great views and lots to take pictures of. An exhibition on artifacts found in a shipwreck was there although mostly seemed to be a collection of amphora. A small religious site is a lovely place to see with great air conditioning. A huge collection of artifacts on show from Roman and Persian statues to canonballs and anchors and all sorts of carvings.

The walk there through the main shopping street isn‚Äôt particularly nice.
The shop owners (mostly selling the same fake designer clothes/bags etc) hassle you no end. They are very insistent/forceful you go in their shop, I have heard of people being forced to buy things once in there but I don‚Äôt know for sure.
I did see a few people get drawn into conversation with the shop keepers usually with ‚Äòlet me show you something in here‚Äô & led in by the arm.

The underwater museum contained many amphorae - all similar- and one old boat. Much hype about very little !

Lots of interesting things to see and we liked that story boards erected throughout tell you all you need to know about the history of the castle and its contents. Plenty of battlements to climb which afford spectacular views across the bay and out to sea or inland !!

Was also good how rooms had been converted to include the boats dredged from the sea or to show off the amazing glassware and artefacts.

We spent a good few hours here and it really is worth a visit. Gorgeous peacocks within the grounds but we were a little disappointed you don't get a guide booklet included in the price but then again this is Turkey!

Also one word of caution, we looked on the Bodrum museums website under fees and opening hours before we travelled. We were informed the entrance fee was 20 TL to enter however it was actually 30 TL when we got there however the differential is minimal and didn‚Äôt affect our enjoyment of the day.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Once upon a time, centuries ago, this was a crusader's castle. But the Turks don't seem to mind, and apart from building a minaret on top of the chapel they have been to a lot of trouble to maintain it. They are working on it today, unloading bags of cement and putting up scaffolding.

We spent two or three hours clambering around the battlements. I suspect that it is rather like my grandfather's axe - dad replaced the handle and I replaced the blade - as it seems in too good condition to be entirely original. The minaret I mentioned is the only obviously new feature - a French naval bombardment in 1915 knocked it down and they built a new concrete one in 1997. I hope they give the muezzin a ladder as the door is 5m above the courtyard

Bodrum castle is now officially the Turkish national institute of underwater archaeology. And the Turks have been very good at recovering ships and artifacts from the bottom of the sea. Unfortunately most of the exhibitions had closed for lunch when we were there, but I was delighted and astonished to find a display of tiny fragile glass perfume bottles. Stuff like that wouldn't survive eight minutes in our house, yet this stuff is eight hundred years old or more

The chapel I mentioned is now full of a reconstruction of a boat filled with amphorae from around the Eastern Mediterranean. The courtyard has a selection - big, small, fat, thin. Oil, wine, cheese, wheat - the amphora was the shipping container of the ancient world. Every city made them in their own style.

At the top of the tower are some open air Turkish toilets, though they are no longer available for public use. At the bottom of the tower is the dungeon. Nice touch.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Bodrum Castle
The Knights of Rhodes started this impressive castle after their capture of Bodrum in 1402 AD. The castle, which is situated on a rocky island in the east of the main harbor, occupies the area nearly 180 by 185 meters. The approach to the castle is done through seven major gates. A short ramp in the north of the castle leads the visitors to the first gate where there is a warning about against spying. Nearly 250 coats of arms, which stand witness for the Christian occupation of the castle is one of the greatest collections of the coats of arms related to Knights of John.
Although the first walls were built by German architect Henrich Schelegelholt between 1415-1437, the castle was renovated so many times to hold up with the new ballistic weapons. During these renovations, the Knights of Rhodes used carvings, architectural pieces, and pillars of the Mausoleum, which had been apparently destroyed by an earthquake. Italian Tower was constructed by architect Ancelo Muscettola in 1436. The fosse has begun in 1476. John Candall built the British Tower in 1480. Pierre d'Abusson did the most recent adjustments in the castle between 1476-1403.
The Castle houses one of the finest museums of Underwater Archeology. Don't miss it...

The view from the higher parts is the best in Bodrum. Excellent for taking pictures during the day.
There are explanatory signs around most parts so you can understand the background story.

The museum wasn't of much interest to us in particular since we have seen most of the exhibited items in Lebanon.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"One place of Bodrum that no visitor to this great city should miss is the famous Bodrum Castle (aka Castle of St. Peter), which overlooks the harbor and the international marina. This castle was constructed by the Knights of Rhodes in the 15th century during the crusades of the middle ages, and it was given the name The Castle of St. Petrus, or Petronium.

Occupying over 30.000 square feet at its base, construction of this castle took years to complete. The castle was built partly from the left remains of the mausoleum of Mausolus which had collapsed as the result of an earthquake.

The entrance of the castle is through the first door situated in the northwestern corner. There are 7 doors before you reach the inner castle. The northern and western sides are double-walled. The thick walled structure with a sloping roof at the west side is a cannon blockhouse. All the towers and various places in the Castle of Bodrum have been converted into exhibition halls for the Underwater Archaeology Museum. The Bodrum Castle is open to the public and it houses Bodrum‚Äôs remarkable Museum of Underwater Archaeology and also hosts several Turkish cultural festivals throughout the year.

Visiting hours: 9.00am ‚Äì 4.30pm
(12:00 noon-13:00 pm some Halls are closed except Chapel, English Tower and GlassHall)
Entrance Fee: 20 YTL (Free for Children).

The buildings are well cared for and there are a couple of kiosks around to get a drink but unfortunately they were closed when we visited so it is advisable to take a bottle of water in with you. There are toilets inside and a few seating areas for a rest from climbing around. Small children should be supervised carefully as there are a few areas where accidents are waiting to happen.

60 Turkish Lira entry fee for two adults was well spent.

The castle is a beautiful building with spectacular scenery surrounding it, inside is the museum of underwater archeology which detailed the maritime history of the mediterranean and exhibits included ship wrecks found locally and the items found inside, including glass and amphorae.

The castle buildings are in good condition and a good few were open to view the insides, so it was possible to see how people would have lived inside the castle walls. It was interesting to learn more about the castle and some information was given over the animals found inside the castle and the myths and legends surrounding them.

Perfect for archeology and history fans, particularly those with any knowledge of the crusades and the order of St John who held the castle. We loved it!

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"This place is by far Historically interesting. The different populations that have been ruling in this area makes it really interesting to spend some hours. Don't forget to check the small room thru out the castle. You can use your phone as support but also with the things on display there is a explanation. There are some stairs you have to take. So wheelchair and people with difficulties in walking it is somewhat more difficult to get around.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"This castle and it's exhibits will keep you cool. There's plenty of shade and the indoor exhibits are air conditioned. In fact, it's probably the coolest place to be in Bodrum on a hot day!

The views of the harbour are stunning, there are lots of well presented exhibits and no need for a guide. There is plenty of information in English.

Allow 2-3 hours to see it all.

There are some very steep bits though. Definitely not wheelchair friendly and if you have a baby buggy you're going to struggle, big time.

But definitely worth a visit.

The castle is way bigger then what it looks and you would need some hours to fully explore.

During my visit I had a feeling that I was a child again going on an adventure! The way the exhibits and room are presented takes you really on a journey through time.

In every room you could follow very easily a story, into medieval knights, to ancient Egyptian ships, to Greek tombs, to Ottoman dungeons, to underwater excavation!

The courtyard of the castle is also really beautiful, with beautiful gardens, peacocks and turtles running free around you.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,4.0,"The castle was built by the knights of St. John. The third one if it's type after Jerusalem & Rhodes. So very interesting architecture & construction. It's located on a promontory & so has fabulous views overlooking Bodrum & it's pretty bay. Easy to walk to from a cruise ship too, through the very varied market!
There is an audio tour apparently, although we actually did a guided tour & it has to be said that because the contents of the castle is rather random both the audio & guided tour come across as random & inconsistent. I think if you go knowing that there are things displayed here that have little or nothing to do with the knights of St. John, then you won't be disappointed.
For example they have an exhibition of a Bronze Age barge & another about Queen Aida, (Alexander the greats step Mother) I don't know her relationship to the castle but it is still very interesting. They (university of Manchester apparently) used facial reconstruction to discover what she looked like. They have some of the treasures found in her sarcophagus on display here too.
There's also the British Tower, which again is very interesting but alongside the flags & shields of the knights of St. John is a pirates flag... but I'm no expert, so who knows!
The castle is also bigger on the Inside than it looks.

This is a great historical monument. The castle is in great condition - allow 2 hours for a high level visit to cover all the grounds and various sections of this large structure. If you are a history buff, you may want to allow more time. Difficult to walk - young and old were seen huffing and puffing but not impossible - we saw many seniors (60s to 70s) - go slow, wear very good walking shoes with good traction - sneakers would do nicely. Go on a nice clear day to get the most of the phenomenal shoreline and ocean views. They only take credit card and Turkish lira (cash). Close to lots of shops and restaurants - within 5-10 minutes walking distance. About 20-25 minutes walk from port of Bodrum.

Inside, we found it average, it is more of a museum to shipwrecks etc and there was little feel of the history of the original building - it is completely renovated.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Superb castle with great variety of things to see. My 14yr and 12yr old sons were a little skeptical at first, but became pretty impressed!
Very good historical journey broken down into easy to assimilate, bit-size chunks via the various towers, different galleries and levels within the castle. Vast array of artefacts from old underwater civilizations and wrecks covering an excellent array of amphorae (covering numerous different civilizations and spanning many centuries), an impressive ancient glassware collection (one of the finest in the world), various coins, jewellery and gold. Superb views of Bodrum, sea, harbour and hills from the ramparts on almost all sides (I recall 3 but maybe the 4th as well).
Lost of ups and downs, climbing and so forth, so not for elderly and less mobile.
Allow minimum 90mins (otherwise you'll skim too much).
Well worth a visit.

Galleries have air con. so good to get out of hot sun for some cool air.

Lots of artefacts including brilliant glass exhibition, amphora, Byzantine merchant ship, coins and some jewellery, statues and remains of the 'Princess of Caria'.

Note: if you go to the Dungeon you must come back up the same stairs as you go down.

The castle is not suitable for anyone with limited mobility.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"The Castle of St Peter is quite a sight - and offers beautiful views of the harbor and the town of Bodrum. We visited with a guide as part of a cruise excursion. From the pier where we docked the ride on the boat was just 20 minutes of scenic views. Unfortunately for us our guide was given 46 tourists when half that number would have been easier to manage - and for us more pleasant. It was a crowded day and the many rooms become a bit overloaded. The mausoleum for Aida includes some of her jewelry, which is beautiful to see. Small rooms throughout the site showcase old coins, glass, pottery, jewelry and other artifacts recovered from sunken vessels. The tower of England was open and was something to see, too.
There are quite a few steps and the paving is uneven, so comfortable shoes are helpful. Some of the restrooms are old style, meaning that instead of commodes there might be a porcelain hole in the ground -- not for me but luckily the facilities with commodes were not far away. I would like to come back when not on a crowded tour to learn more of the crusader history, which was difficult to hear given the size of our group and number of other groups around us.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Fortress of Halikarnassos is a stronghold built by the Hospitallers, or Knights of the Order of St.John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta). The fortress is situated by the safe natural harbour on the coast of Asia Minor as near as possible to the island of Kos, with a strategic position by the strait separating the island from the continent. This fortress together with fortress of Kos, situated on the other side of the channel and also built and belonged to the Knights, were co-working in order to control the traffic through the strait.
By the time of construction, the fortress was placed on the small island with natural defensive moat, but later on it was incorporated with the mainland.
The castle houses now an Archaeological museum, the entrance to both is from harbour promenade of Bodrum, right beneath the castle rock. There is a museum shop on the grounds, as well as shaded cafe with outdoor serving, surrounded by old columns, statues and picturesque remains.
The castle territory is not very large but rather hilly with steps up and down. There are two well-signed touristic routs, one shorter and another long, through the area. Lots of birds are dwelling freely in the castle, most rare are families of peacocks, we spotted some 5-6 adult birds and lots of chicks. Beautiful surroundings, lots of antique statues, flowering trees and bushes, very spectacular views of both bays of Halicarnassos - do not miss this attraction!
Entrance fee is 30 Turkish Lira per adult, open all weekdays. Allow some 1,5-2 hours for complete sightseeing.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,3.0,"My husband and I visited the castle as part of a cruise excursion. It offers beautiful views of Bodrum and some interesting history. Give yourself between 1 to 2 hours to tour the castle. The many rooms displaying artifacts are quite small and get crowded with large cruise groups. The grounds are well-maintained with beautiful flowers. You may see a few peacocks roaming around as well. There are a significant number of steps and inclines to traverse, so wear good walking shoes.

Some of the highlights include the ancient coins, jewelry, and glass gallery. Unlike others, we were underwhelmed by the reconstruction of a ship's hull. Overall, it was not an amazing excursion, but it gave us something to do in Bodrum.

Tip: If you are cruising and arrive to the castle by boat, we recommend not taking the boat back. My husband and I were able to take a leisurely walk back to the cruise ship port. The walk took us through the popular shopping area, where we were able to eat, buy souvenirs, and have afternoon tea.

Another plus is that you get fantastic views of Bodrum city from the castle. Great place to grab some photos on a sunny day!

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"After a couple of rather eventful days of sightseeing around Bodrum peninsula and a visit to Didyma during which our rented car broke (Blue Car Rental Co., Bodrum-beware!) we decided to visit Bodrum on the third day as it was only some 20 min. away from our hotel in Torba. It was a bit difficult to find a car park there and they charge a lot for it but not more than in the EU. There we visited the remains of city walls but the main attraction was the Castle of St. Peter built by the knights of St. John in the 15th century. Entry-25TL(5GBP)
The castle has been partly rebuilt and looks quite impressive now. It has been situated on a pretty high rock over the port of Bodrum or Halicarnassus as it was known at the time of its construction and before. It is a very attractive and sizable piece of medieval defensive architecture with a curtain wall, gate, numerous towers, ramparts, and moats. It reminded me of a castle we saw in Alanya. Similarly, the view from the castle is truly spectacular. In the castle grounds, as you stroll among many ancient statues and architectural details, reliefs etc. but also ancient trees and garden you come across a number of very interesting exhibitions mainly relating to maritime history of the region with ancient ships lifted from sea bottom with their cargo: glass, copper, amphorae in all shapes and sizes, some jewelry and other artifacts. The exhibitions are on display mainly in the castle towers: German, Snake, English, French, Italian and also in the Chapel converted into a Mosque at some point. We were quite impressed and would recommend the Castle any time despite the heat. Beware however as the opening hours of the exhibitions vary and some can be still or already closed when you come. Naturally there is a souvenir shop, a small and nice shaded caf√© and clean toilets, should you need it. Excellent idea for an interesting afternoon!

The dungeon was probably our favourite bit. You could feel the history. There is sufficient information around to know what is what. We didn't do a tour or get the audio equipment. We read about the bits that were interesting to us. We also enjoyed the coins and jewellery... And the views!

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"The castle was built by the Saint Jean Knights between 1406 and 1522. It was built over even older Turkish and Byzantine castles [Doric times (1110 BC)]. Turkey is a melding point of cultures. The Knights Hospitaller (another name) were a military order who's headquarters were based on Rhodes. As they worried over the threat of the Turks they built this castle as a base on the mainland. The castle is in remarkable condition and has been used to great effect by utilizing the towers for remarkable exhibitions of Marine Archeology and artifacts. There is a lot of climbing up and down as the entrance and the exit is the same. I particularly liked the English tower with ancient chain mail and evidence of how they lived. It also has an interesting dungeon with a story about the original Barbarossa's imprisonment. Well worth the price. Get the combo ticket so you can see the Mausoleum of Maussollos where much of the materials came from to construct this castle. Saves money.

The rain turned into a bit of a storm and at points we were walking through a foot of water as we wandered around the castle.

It was fascinating though. Throughout the castle are rooms with displays relating to ship wrecks and the history of the area. It's called an underwater museum... It's not actually underwater... But it came close on our visit!

The relics are well preserved and there's so much to look at as well as taking in the size of the castle.

The layout of the castle, the towers and the botanical garden are all worth seeing.

Do make sure you have some time, as visiting involves some climbing (with breathtaking views) and it could be hot and tiring. Worth every minute, though just for the castle and the views.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,4.0,"Well worth a visit as a lot to see once inside. Not all areas are wheelchair accessible and, being an old castle, a lot of steps if you want to explore it all. Great fun for children who like history and places to hide. Plan to be there at least two hours, longer if you want to explore it all.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Visited about 20 years ago with my girlfriend (now wife) and this time round it was just me and my eleven year old daughter. Very enjoyable all round. Pleasant drink in cafe before exploring at our own leisurely pace. I think it has improved in 20 years, can't exactly pinpoint why but it has. Was definitely the right thing to do getting there early as not only do you have the run of the place it's also cooler. I asked my daughter out of ten what her rating was and she said 8 and it would have been 10 if it hadn't been so hot!

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"This castle is right on the Aegean Sea, and walking along the castle walls provides many opportunities to capture stunning panoramas. I loved exploring this castle, because there are just so many different things to see. What's very helpful are the arrows that guide you (red for the long tour, green for the short tour). We opted for the short tour, as it was incredibly hot the day we visited (38C), but we still managed to see a lot. Definitely a worthwhile attraction, and afterwards, you can go shopping for souvenirs as you walk back towards the city centre.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,4.0,"Built in part using the ruins of the Mausoleum, this historical oddity is fun to wander around, but there is a lot of stuff that goes unexplained: there seem to be a lot of pieces moved here from the mausoleum that are laden with meaning, yet remain simply scattered about. Skip the dungeon, it's tacky and not worth the climb back up.

Entrance fee is 30 Turkish Liras for both the castle and the ancient maritime museum! If you have euros you will have to swap them for the Turkish currency because euros are not accepted in the castle!

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,4.0,"it is a fabulous attraction and so intriguing with such rich history and stories to tell. Its huge!
then why O why do they shut all the exhibits for lunch break from 12.00? if this is their your system its fine but should at least warn us when buying the tickets.
also whey do sell the combi ticket for both visits to St Peter's and Mausoleion at TL60.00 each.
but again they never tell you Mausoleion is quite a walk if you are not familiar with the area. We got lost so many times on the way so we finally gave up and caught a taxi from Mariner for bout TL10.00. also in Mariner there is a tourist information centre (near the 1st mosque from St Peter's. their map is quite accurate and free. )

Our visit coincided with the arrival of a cruise ship.
Overheard comments such as ' where are we' and ' couldn't they have put in more elevators' from some of the ' cruisers'
Well elevators could have been useful ( but not at all practical) as many of the steps are of a disproportionate height and are very demanding.
The underwater museum is part of the attraction and together they offer a very good day out.
The English Tower was furnished in a way to suggest that it may be available to hire for functions?
Great views all around Bodrum but beware that on hot days the trip is quite a challenge.

Nice grounds, but might be difficult for someone who requires a walking aid such as a cane, walker, etc. A lovely peacock walks around the grounds. The dungeon was difficult to get to, with steep and sloped steps to it and in the end wasn't interesting enough to have bothered with it, my advice is to skip it. Makes for a nice afternoon activity. The bathroom facilities were excellent and plentiful, good to know if you have children.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Most obvious symbol of Bodrum and a high point for any history buff, the castle of St Peter has a dramatic position and wonderful views from the higher levels. The Knights of Rhodes built the castle from parts of the ancient mausoleum of Halikarnassos so it is a multi faceted archaeological site. As you walk around you will see remnants from the days of the Knights such as coats of arms moulded into the stonework. The castle is a cheap visit, also containing the underwater museum of archaeology. The castle is on many levels however and people with mobility issues may find some of the lower areas such as the dungeons a bit of a trial. The whole site is a sun trap and is hot all day.

I didn't know the castle and the Museum of Underwater Archaeolgoy were the same place, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that we didn't have to buy two separate tickets for the visit.

Anyway, the museum displays were great, but my favorite part was going up the castle wall and getting the panoramic view of the area. You can see the beautiful harber and the beautiful city of Bodrum up there, which were indeed stunning. and when you are tired, you can sit down somewhere in the well laid out garden and enjoy the flowers and the cool shade.

Love this castle. Would definitely love to go back for another visit if i ever went back to Bodrum again.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Awesome museum when you consider the age of the artefacts; many dated B.C. The items are well presented within each of the castle towers and therefore it's not too heavy going as you intersperse each section by a wander through different parts of the castle grounds and ramparts.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,4.0,"The Castle of St. Peter in Bodrum was built from early 1400s by the Knights of St. John. The castle was constructed using marble columns, green volcanic stones & other items from the ruins of the Mausoleum of Maussollos, which was destroyed by earthquakes in the 12th century.

The chapel was amongst the first structures to be built. Each language had a tower built so you can see English, German, French towers in the castle; as well as a Snake Tower.

The castle came under the attack of the Ottomans around 1522 and after its capture, they erected a minaret on the chapel and converted it into a mosque. The castle has been used for various purposes - the Turks used it as a military base, and a Hammam was added later. The minaret was destroyed in 1915 by a French ship and reconstructed in 1997.

The castle now houses the Museum of Underwater Archaeology which is superb and has artefacts from BC times.

Turkey,Castle of St. Peter,5.0,"Firstly let me say that the museum of underwater archeology is IN the castle. We didn't know this before arriving. Cost is 25TL entrance fee per person.
It was incredibly hot when we went (42 degrees C) and we were glad we took some water as the only cafe was shut- do take some water.
There are many many steps so it is not a visit for someone with walking difficulties - it is certainly not wheelchair friendly.
We saw a wild tortoise by the Spanish Tower and some peacocks if you have kids that like that sort of thing.
The other tip I would give is spend the extra on a verbal guide (15TL each) The tour is so much more interesting with one but you have to hand over some form of ID (one per party) which they keep until you return the electronic verbal guide- not a problem but go prepared. If you have headphones, you can plug them into the guide.

We went on at 4pm and just got round in time by 6.30 pm when it shuts (if you don't have the guide you will do the tour quicker but you will miss so much interesting information.)
In summary if you love castles, love cracking views, love museums and don't mind climbing hundreds of steps, you'll love this visit for between ¬£6- ¬£10 depending on if you get an electronic guide.

I would not recommend the castle for people with mobility problems as there are a lot of steps some of which are about knee high (on a short person like myself).

The castle is absolutely beautiful with sumptuous trees in the courtyard areas and as it's stone there's a lot of shadier areas to hide from the heat of the day.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"I totally agree with many other travelers here that entire Cappadocia is a worldwide unique place, so I wont waste your time here explaining how wonderful it is (I'll do that in separate attractions reviews).
Instead, I'll point out here useful info I learned while planning our trip, and from our experience on the ground.
- plan to spend 3-4 days to see everything this unique place has to offer (we did it in 3 days, but needed a serious rest after that down on the coast - 4 days would be more relaxed),
- best airport to arrive is Kayseri. This airport is much bigger than the closer Nevsehir airport and has more frequent and better (and cheaper) connections with rest of Turkey. From Kayseri airport, Goreme and Cappadocia are an hour drive,
- DO rent a car at Kayseri airport. It is pretty cheap and cars are brand new - I used the ""Avec"" local company - great. You will need a car to explore the area as attractions are scattered in a 100 km radius in all directions. You'll save yourself money and do the sightseeing in comfort, not depending on groups and schedules. Roads are very good, with good signage, maps are working and petrol price is a bargain,
- if looking for a hotel with a pool to cool and relax, make sure it has an indoor pool (even in mid August when we visited morning and late afternoon air temperatures are insufficient to have a pleasant outdoor swim - 15-20'C, and also the outdoor pool water is NOT heated),
- I suggest ""Anatolian Houses"" hotel - terrific in every way, and so authentic and original, has both - indoor with hammam and sauna and outdoor pool (read that separate review),
- restaurants are feast for eyes and stomach, plenty of them - it is really difficult to go wrong with that,
- DO BUY the ""Museum Cappadocia"" Pass. It enables you to skip the lines in front of each attraction, and it saves you almost 50% of the fees you'd pay separately. It can be purchased at any site entrance. It pays of just after 4 visits out of 8 included (see my pic),
- there's no need for any organized agency tours if you have a car. Everything is well posted and explained in brochures and plaques at every site.

The National Park, a UNESCO site, but a bit of a catch all really, it is not a specific area.

The stairs leading to the chapels inside the caves were pretty narrow with no handrail in several spots along the stairs. There was only one way to enter and to exit making it quite crowded at times. As it was snowing during our time there, the stairs become slippery too.
You surely need to wear suitable shoes for walking as you need to go through quite a few flight of stairs to visit the ancient chapels inside the cave.
Also be mindfull of the narrow stairs if you are travelling with young children and/or elderly people.
Please noted that ut is forbidden to take pictures inside the cave due to risk of the camera flash damaging the centuries old painting in chapel's wall. Kindly only take pictures when you are outside of the caves.

Particularly beginning from the second century AD, some Christian priests pulled in the consideration of adherents. Subsequently, you can see a few houses of worship created in caverns. A few caverns are under rebuilding and some of them like ""Karanlƒ±k Kilise/Dark Church"" requires additional section charge. At the door of the open air museum, you can visit to the trinket shop, bistro, and rest rooms. I for one like the bona fide bistro in one of the caverns.

Especially starting from the 2nd century AD, some Christian monks attracted the attention of believers. Thus, you can see several churches developed in caves. Some caves are under restoration and some of them like ""Karanlƒ±k Kilise/Dark Church"" requires extra entry fee.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"G√∂reme National Park (Turkish: G√∂reme Tarih√Æ Milli Parkƒ±) protects nearly 100 km2 (39 sq mi) of rocky, water- and wind-eroded landscape with a network of ancient, interconnecting underground settlements; it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Volcanic eruptions 3 to 9 million years ago from nearby Mount Hasan and Mount Erciyes deposited layers of basalt and thick beds of tuff (volcanic ash solidified into a soft rock). Since then, erosion has carved the area into a spectacular landscape of plateaus and high hills, dissected by streams and steep-sided river valleys. In places where the soft tuff is overlain by hard lava there is a fantastic landscape of multi-colored cliffs, rock towers, pillars, tent rocks and fairy chimneys. With only 38cm of precipitation each year, there is little vegetation except in the river bottom lands. Early settlers carved the soft tuff into dwellings, stables, storehouses, and places of worship. The earliest Christian monasteries in the area were the 4th century anchorite communities, following the teachings of Basileios the Great, Bishop of Kayseri, Turkey. Monks and nuns inhabited cells carved in the rock and offered religious services in tiny churches. Later, the communities took refuge together in underground villages to avoid attacks by marauding Arabs. Three of the most-visited areas in the park near G√∂reme are:
-- G√∂reme Open Air Museum (just east of town), with cave churches and frescoes from the 10th to 12th centuries.
-- U√ßhisar Castle (southwest of town), a fortification carved into a large outcrop, with panoramic views from the top.
-- The landscape at Pa≈üabaƒü Valley (north of town) is known for its ‚Äúfairy chimneys,‚Äù (cone-shaped rock formations).
There are hiking trails and back-country roads allowing exploration of the more remote areas. Viewing the area from a hot air balloon at dawn is a sublime experience. Water, sturdy foot gear and a guide are recommended if you venture into the back country. The park is open at all times with no entry fee.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,4.0,"As we visited Turkey on a tight schedule, we had planned the trip and booked our hotels, so it is ashamed that we did not get to spent more time in Cappadocia. It is an extraordinary place with so many history and beauty. We visited Goreme on a rainy day, so our photos end up looking gloomy.
But it was still special to get to see all the fairy chimneys up close, we never would though we will get to be there in person after seeing the place only though photos. It was magical, and we had the honour to visit one of the chimney house, to have tea and talk to the house owners. It was a wonderful experience.

Many number of rocks that were carved into churches, cafeterias and dormitories. Very fascinating to see the architecture. One giant rock with caves that was the male dorm and another giant rock for females.

The churches have murals in their interiors. It's unfortunate that murals are eroding due to people either scratching them off, taking photos with flashes, and just sheer volume of tourists. The humidity caused by the breathing of tourists also contribute to the erosion.

Although flash photography is not allowed, there were some ignorant tourists taking photos with flashes. So I informed the security sitting outside the entrance.

There is one church that costs an extra 10-15TL to get in (I heard it has more well-preserved murals).

It really is quite amazing to see a university carved into rocks that accommodated more than 2000 people studying the bible.

U can also take the Red or Green tour which shows the Underground cities and how the people lived so many hundred years ago.. The whole town with burial areas were underground.. Amazing network of tunnels and stairs that u dont realize that Derinkuyu goes down to 60metres below ground !!

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"When you visit Turkey, Cappadocia is an absolute must. At first site you will think you are on another planet. Though the region has developed a lot over the past 10 years in regard to hotels, restaurants, you are in a World Unesco Heritage Site and National Park which is highly protected. The village of Goreme itself is, in my opinion,.the most charming of the five villages in the province though you cannot really count Nevsehir as it is actually the capital city of the province and not village like at all. Goreme has the highest number of Fairy Chimneys and churches in the region so I highly recommend that you make your Cappadocia base in Goreme. There are numerous restaurants where you can feast upon absolutely yummy traditional Turkish food, but I would wander up into the old side of the village and simply ask where yo ucan find the restaurant where 'Top Deck' is the chef. He and his wife create excellent dishes you will never forget! Your days can be filed with hot air ballooning (very worthwhile - recommend Cappadokya Balloons), go horseback riding, take a 4 wheeler, absolutely visit the underground cities (at least one of them), the hot springs or just enjoy walking through the valleys. This is a photographers paradise with sunsets and sunrises not to be matched. Though many of the farmers have moved away they are still to be found just outside the village and have many a story to be told.

We came late morning and it was already very crowded which made the experience not as enjoyable. To view many of the rooms, prepare to line up. And once you are inside, you are expected to keep moving with some rooms not allowed for photography.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,3.0,"There are several cave churches to visit in this open air museum complex, one or two of which are simply stunning.

However, the museum is incredibly busy with masses of school and tourist groups meaning you have to queue for every church - and some have an attendant inside barking at you to keep shuffling along meaning you can‚Äôt really stop and look at anything properly.

I guess if you get there when the doors open it might be a better experience, but if you‚Äôre on an organised tour, this won‚Äôt happen.

All photography is prohibited in the caves, meaning you can‚Äôt even take home your memories of those beautiful frescos. This seems excessive as stopping flash photography only should be sufficient.

We did not even decide, discussing what option we wanted. All of the sudden, the guys approached me from the back and lifted me up without my permission, putting me on top of the camel (I was wearing a super short skirt and everyone can see my panties inside). I was screaming. Another guy lifted my sister up to another camel right beside me. The guys pulled camels for a walk. They asked for my phone to take pictures for 2 mins. It was very forceful and we both had to end up paying money for both ride and picture. THIS IS A SCAM. And it left us with a horrifying feeling after visiting Goreme museum. I wish this service is being taken down because not only it scams tourist on a regular basis, the camels there are very old, unhappy, aggressive and treated poorly. This service gives me the wrong impression of Turkish people and I think the government should take time and examine this because the service is right in front of the national museum and innumerably levies so many people.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"Had a wonderful time at the Goreme National Park in Turkey, and was mesmerised by the awe inspiring rock formations.

A complete one day visit to this great national park, with different observation points in the Pigeon Valley, Urchisar Castle , with a Jeep Safari and a Hot Air Balloon ride created a lasting memory of this beautiful Cappadocia region in Turkey.

The famous fairy chimney land is created after a volcanic eruption, and the rock formations were formed by the forces of nature through the erosion by the wind and rain condition.

A ride by hot air balloon into the air to see the vast area from the sky is an exceptional experience.

Our jeep safari brought us into the Rose Valley and we could see more of the unique rock formations in this area.

A visit to the Kaymakli Underground City showcased the life and living conditions in the subterranean chamber of the people with the construction of cellars, church, and kitchen in those tunnels.

This is the main highlight of anyone's visit to Turkey. To save time, it would be great to fly to the Cappadocia region with two airports nearby. They are Kayseri and Nevsehir Airport.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,4.0,"This open air museum is worth a visit to experience the authentic cave structures of the area. It is dedicated to a Christian settlement of monks, priests and nuns who lived there around the 3rd century. There are about a dozen small churches and cave rooms, some with their original paintings which are now quite faded and in need of restoration. But restoration has begun and it will be more interesting in years to come. It cost 45 lire ( about ¬£6 ) at the time of our visit . There is also an additional 15 lire to visit the dark church where the paintings are naturally brighter but we didn't opt for this. Or you can hire a headset for information at an extra 15 lire, but there are written explanations outside of every structure which we found sufficient.
The site itself is very steep with slopes and steps so may not be suitable for those with mobility issues.
There is a small coffee shop at the top of the site which is a very traditional Turkish style- not much seating if more than about half a dozen people are there.. Drinks here are expensive compared to outside the site and further down the road- 10 compared to 3 for the same drink! But you pay for the ambience !

There are numerous murals and small coffins and it is hard to believe that people could survive here, We were fortunate in that it was a warm, dry day but we knew people who had visited the day before and were drenched in a sudden thunderstorm - there is no shelter apart from the gift shop. It was free to enter but there is a small charge to enter one of the churches. I would advise wearing sensible shoes suitable for uphill walking and certainly not flip flops that some girls were wearing! The gift shop was very nice with a good variety of items to buy. We were there for 2 hours, but all very enjoyable. There are guided tours if required and some seats around the park if you need a rest.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"This place is absolutely beautiful. You can see different constructions into the caves and learn a lot. You can go by yourself or into a tour. I went into the red line tour, but I would enjoy more going by myself as there are different explanations with the audioguide that you miss with the only one hour that you have with the tour. Although the shop outside is quite expensive, you can find high quality souvenirs not easy to find somewhere else.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"During our visit to the Karanlik Kilise, which houses the most complete and stunning of murals in the complex, the staff in-charged was trying to coax a few liras out of visitors by inviting them to touch the murals. And some tourists did. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE MURALS, AND DO NOT TIP THOSE THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO.

Unlike the rest of the complex, these delicate murals have survived centuries intact. The last thing they need are our greasy fingers wearing them out.

On the review of the museum, the complex remains impressive but overrun by tour groups (many of which are from China). Visiting in the early morning and late afternoon should be more intimate, when crowds are reduced.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"The landscape is fascinating, and the open air museum is good. We want folks to know that aside from lodging and food, you do not have to spend a lot of money here. You can have a wonderful time without a balloon ride, without guided tours, without a guide, without a ""Turkish night"", without a haman visit. We stayed 5 days and had a fabulous time. We, walked, and used the dolmus. Got a great feel for the area and its people and enjoyed it immensely. We did not support the overpriced tourist services. Do it yourself and have a great time, but do a lot of research before you come.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"In a spectacular landscape, entirely sculpted by erosion, the G√∂reme valley and its surroundings contain rock-hewn sanctuaries that provide unique evidence of Byzantine art in the post-Iconoclastic period. Dwellings, troglodyte villages and underground towns ‚Äì the remains of a traditional human habitat dating back to the 4th century ‚Äì can also be seen there. Located on the central Anatolia plateau within a volcanic landscape sculpted by erosion to form a succession of mountain ridges, valleys and pinnacles known as ‚Äúfairy chimneys‚Äù or hoodoos, G√∂reme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia. It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic and a must-see while in Cappadocia.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"Goreme is the best city to use as a base for exploring Cappadocia. The town is next to the famous open-air museum and lots of picturesque valleys are close...walking distance, or at least hiking distance. The town itself is picturesque, and there are lots of good places to eat, have a drink, and meet other travelers. Australians like it, you find them running bars and coffee shops.

I usually stay at Heybe hotel. It is reasonably priced and offers solid comfort. Some of the rooms are better than others but none are bad. The breakfast is excellent (especially if you want to sample the local dried fruit) and the rooftop restaurant where they serve it has good views. People like to stay in ""cave"" hotels, in rooms carved out of the rock, but I personally don't see much point in paying extra for that. Still, lots of good hotels in Goreme can give you a cave room if you want one. Heybe can't, but it is just as good and a lot less expensive.

A couple of blocks down the street from Heybe are all the tour offices. You can book tours for all of Cappadocia and start and return practically next door to the hotel. As for the sites near Goreme...the hotel will drive you to them, you can walk around for a few hours, and then they will pick you up, without charge.

Cappadocia gets chilly in the fall, and is downright cold in November, so it's probably better to visit in temperate months. You don't need to reserve any tours, just your hotel. You can rent all kinds of transportation and book anything right in Goreme.

I recommend you stay for at least three days, and take two or three tours besides walking to the open air museum and at least one of the valleys...Pigeon Valley starts very near Heybe and is a great walk. You probably ought to see Uchizar, which is at the other end of Pigeon Valley, and one underground city. In my opinion, it doesn't matter which underground city, they are much alike. The idea is exciting, but apparently people rarely if ever lived in them and there is remarkably little to see so I would just take a tour that includes one...maybe Denizli. Don't go to Cappadocia thinking ""Underground cities---Wow!"" On the other hand, the cave cities, above ground but carved out of the local stone, are all fascinating. All of them are worth your time but the Goreme open-air museum is the best by far. It's not that big...you can see it in an hour or two and come back again if you wish.

Even if you're old like me you need exercise, and the local Goreme valleys are great places for walks. The rock formations in the valleys are remarkably photogenic, and each valley is quite different from the others. You know best what shoes you like to walk in. I use top-of-the-line running shoes for Cappadocia...they provide support and the ground isn't treacherous. A bit steep sometimes, for me at least.

Goreme is full of tourists and expatriates, but it doesn't come across as a tourist trap. It is enough out of the way to attract sophisticated tourists. There are no cruise ships, and I find that makes a big difference. People have to seek it out, and the foreigners who live there do so because they love it. So there is an ambience, it's a real place.

I won't recommend restaurants, but there are several near the Heybe that I like. I often have a local specialty, a stew they cook in a pottery jar. When they serve it they break off the lid. It sounds touristy, and of course it is, but they don't overcharge for it and it really is a traditional food of the area. You can get fancy versions in Istanbul, in the Aksaray district, but usually you have to order a day in advance and pay quite a bit. In Goreme it is a routine everyday thing.

I haven't taken a balloon ride. I am afraid of heights and while airplanes don't bother me at all I can't be sure balloons wouldn't. Friends tell me it is a chancy thing...once in a while the balloon doesn't go anywhere, just hovers. And they are kind of expensive. But I will say this. If you are staying at the Heybe and happen to wake around 7:00AM and look out your window, the hundreds of balloons will have you reaching for your camera.

Turkey,Goreme National Park,5.0,"The hole place look like a fairy tale. It is interesting to hear the history about the place and as the vulcanic lava formed the caves. The paintings we can see inside some of the caves are very pretty and the hole place is awsome. I never heard about any other similar place in the world. A ""must go"" place. Awsome! If you want, you can drink a raki in your way out or you can take a Picture with a camel for 10 TRL. Cool!
