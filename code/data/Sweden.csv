Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Amazing to see the scale of this hand made huge sailing man o’ war.

The exhibits were gone very well. Must see.",Sep 2021

Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"This is quite a famous museum in Stockholm and I can understand why.

The best views were definitely from the top floors.",Sep 2021
Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"The ship Vasa that sank in the 1700 was recovered and restored in the second half of the twentieth century. The Vasa museum holds this restored ship. It is definitely worth visiting the museum to see the size of the ship and learn about the recovery efforts. The twenty minute free movie sums up all you need to know. This won't take more than an hour. So, you can combine this with a ferry trip, Viking museum and a relaxed stroll.",Sep 2021

Sweden,Vasa Museum,4.0,"Vasa was a really nice museum! You can listen to the audio guide on your own device. They really did their best to create an experience and I must say they have succeeded. When you enter the museum, you can see the Vasa right away, to me it was quite impressive. You’re able to look at the ship from different floors and distances. There also were exhibitions about the people on the ship, how the ship is being preserved, etc. I’m not too interested in those things, but it still was fun to learn from.
You can make the visit as long as you want; it took me less than an hour to look at the ship from all possible angles and also look at some of the exhibitions",Aug 2021
Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"I wasn’t sure to visit this museum. I thought: just another ol’ ship.

Boy, was I wrong. This is such an interesting museum. The lay out in very well done with tons of history. I learned a lot about life then in Stockholm.

The ship is AMAZING to see. So impressive. The explanations are available in several languages.

I actually spend 2,5 hours in this museum. That’s how much I was absorbed in getting to know more.

Definitely a museum to visit if you have young adolescent children.

Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"We visited Vasa about 15 years ago and was impressed, it didnt disapponit on this ocassion. We think the exhibition has been added to as new knowledge is uncovered.
There is an educational film on the recovery at the start which sets the scene. That 98% of Vasa is the original adds to its impressiveness, The research into Vasa; the meaning behind carvings, the paint colours, other finds and how the sailors lived it also clearly displayed. We viewed Vasa at diffeent levels and admired it in awe again!
We spent 2 hrs here and if it wasnt closing time, we could have been here longer.
Although Alcogel is deployed throughout and there are signs for 2m distancing and we were there at a quieter time, the pandemic seems to have been forgotten. Not a fault of the Vada museum of course but this seems common throught Stockholm.

Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Very very interesting museum, first you can watch a short 17 min movie about the story of the vasa, than you can walk around.

Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,This place was very nice and so attractive i wish to visit again and again with my family members so as to enjoy together.,Jun 2021
Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,This is one of the coolest museums I have been in. The Vasa is huge and the museum has five different levels around the ship to give you different views.

Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Stunning museum. A big plus for the fact that they have included a section dedicated to women’s role in the era the museum covers. Loved the fact that due to the pandemic, less people than normal were in the museum. Gave one ample opportunity to really study the exhibits. Also I’m sure it’s better for the ancient ship",Jun 2021
Sweden,Vasa Museum,5.0,"Large museum with an interesting story behind the magnificent ship. Impressively displayed, in a beautiful location.",Apr 2021

Sweden,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,5.0,"Impressive Denmark-Sweden connection.

Sweden,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,5.0,This road was so attractive and so wonderful. when I come again to visit the place I will invite my best friends to enjoy the place together. thanks,Jun 2021
Sweden,Øresund Bridge - Öresund Bridge,4.0,"I'd always seen this bridge from the airplane so I figured I'd go and see it up close once in Malmo. Bus # 4 takes you there from Malmo Central Station - takes around 20-30 mins. The area around the bridge is very pretty, especially in spring, with lots of flowers. You can walk real close to it and underneath. I wish I could cross it on foot. They have open days but they are quite rare. The views from there are just spectacular.",May 2021

Sweden,Liseberg amusement park,5.0,"With the covid restrictions the queues were very reasonable, we waited 30 minutes maximum in any physical queue. With the virtual queues we didn't feel as stressed either to go on every ride non-stop. Much better than our trip 2 years ago.

The restaurants are on the pricier side but the quality in the seafood place is very good.

Overall a very clean park.

I do recommend!

Sweden,Sofiero Palace,5.0,never disappointed to come here in the summer. Beautiful flowers and breeze from the sea. Strongly recommend,Jun 2021
Sweden,Tropikariet,4.0,"It's a old industrial brick building, so the first time we arrived we were hesitant that we where at the right address. Once inside it's a fantastic place to get really close to the animals. Each floor has it's on themes and my kids could have spent the entire afternoon by the aquarium in the basement if I'd let them.

The main downside is the cafeteria. It's not so terrible that you have to avoid it completely, but if you have high expectations on food I suggest eating someplace else after your visit.",Apr 2021

Sweden,Stockholm Old Town,5.0,"The Gamla Stan is a great area to explore.
