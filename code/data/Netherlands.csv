Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,This was my first time to the Rijksmuseum. It did not disappoint. There were many other treasure in addition to the Rembrandts. I was particularly taken by the conservation process of The Night Watch. The painting in inside a large glass box and the people studying the painting can be observed as they work. A volunteer answers questions about the process as well as providing photos of the different scanning techniques,Nov 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"This is a magnificent museum with incredible collections. It's a must see when visiting Amsterdam.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I spent almost 6 hours there and time just flew by. It’s a bit difficult to navigate the space, but the quality of the art work are top and they are beautifully curated and presented. I especially enjoyed the current exhibit of “Remember Me” in the side wing.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,2.0,"Night watch has been torturously poured over by computer wizards for 5 years. I suggest they do their computer wizardry at night so the rest of us can just admire the master painting.
I like having a free audio app. However, there were no words that guided me from place to place so I was usually lost unable to find the highlighted item in the tour. Lastly, the timed entry may have been critical at certain times of year. Now, it seemed ludicrous that people were being sent away with a half empty museum because they're smartphones do not have international service and could not buy their tickets online. And, a little disappointing that the whole museum shuts down at 5:00

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,1.0,"What the Rijksmuseum doesn't tell you on their website is that in order to access the Museum Shop or the Museum Cafe you must have purchased an entry ticket of 20 Euros !!

I understand the need to control the numbers of people access the building during these times of Covid but there should be some accommodation. Tickets can be checked past the access to the shop and cafe.

Of course, this won't deter people from going to the Museum, which is incredible of course but just a notice to the public since the Rijksmuseum website doesn't advise that the shop and cafe are not accessible to everyone

I appreciated the way it was layed out to not have numerous options of where to go next to be able to see everything.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,3.0,"This is a huge museum, with wonderful gardens displaying many works by the American Ellsworth Kelly. The Vermeer paintings are worth the trip. I would focus on the rooms displaying these master works and spend less time on subsequent eras of painting. The collecting has not been as deep or broad, and it shows. The worst part of the collection is 1950- 2000. First of all, it is impossible to find in the building -- I had a map but had to ask two attendants how to get into the two attics containing the ""collection."" What is displayed is not a good representation of the development of art through this period. It is obvious what is the heart of the museum.

Even if I live in Amsterdam, I still enjoy visiting once in two months and still get curious and excited about this museum. What makes the Rijksmuseum one of the world’s most famous museums is the fame of the masterpieces in its collection.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,3.0,"It was impressive. The size- and. the organisation of the museum was fabulous inside. Waiting time was ok, but i found the lines to be disorganise and disruptive. It’s important to make a reservation online and within a feasible hour, u less you are with a member, otherwise you waste time in the waiting line (as they do not distinguish the differences). However, it’s a nice experience with alot of beautiful artwork and historical education. The museum is smaller than first impressions. They have a lovely cafe inside, which serves good food and beverages suitable for vegetarian/vegan. .",Jun 2021

We downloaded the app on our phones and brought our own head phones and followed the highlight tour. An easy walk of about two hours with lots of nice info about the paintings, most of them are spectacular. Afterwards we browsed through the museum on our own. It was not very busy,so easy does it.",Nov 2020
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"With the reopening of the museum on Wednesday 18 November 2020, we decided to visit the following Saturday. If you want to visit, you need to book a time slot and a ticket. The line outside looked longer than on the pictures, we were i after about 10 to 15 minutes of waiting.

While there are virtually no tourists, it still wasn't as quite as I hoped for (a bit of a contradiction, I know). But we had a wonderful visit, admiring the wonderful paintings of the Old Master. The Peace of Munster is one of my favourite paintings to look at. The level of detail is truly stunning.

What I love the most about the Rijksmuseum is that you can get really op front and close to the works of arts and admire them, without being followed around by paranoid security guards of paintings being behind plexiglass. And if you like the works of the Old Masters and oil paintings from the 1500s till the 1800s, I find only the National Gallery in London to hold a better collection. Also taking in to account the fact that it's much bigger thus more space.

All in all a wonderful visit. If you are able to visit, go. The museum needs your support and perhaps it will never be as quite and without tourists as the coming months!

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"Absolutely a fantastic museum to visit, but please decide in advance why do you go to such a rich museum with numerous pieces of art? don't even try to cover all the sections, all the ages, all the knights of the brush. There are two options: 1) to have a nice and pleasant walk among all the beauty 2) focus on something particular - this will help from becoming tired.
Anyway, I will visit it again and again at any chance.",Nov 2019
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,This week the museum has special activities for children. We chose a free book that took us along the 17th-18th centuries (Golden Age).

Rijksmuseum is home to some of the greatest and most famous works of Dutch art and history; notably The Night Watch - Rembrandt van Rijn's most famous painting.

With more than 8,000 paintings and objects on display spanning 100 rooms, Rijksmuseum is worthy a few hours of your trip in order to explore.

After racking up your step count, grab a seat in Rijksmuseum's gated garden (open daily between 9am to 6pm). Host to plenty of attractive plants and flowers, sculptures, and water features, the garden is a surprisingly tranquil place away from the hustle and bustle.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,A must see. We always talk about the wonders of the world and I dare to say that I saw some in this museum. How can somebody paint and catch light on the canvas? How can somebody paint acne where people still look alive although it has been made hundred or more years ago? These wonders of art can be seen in abundance in the Rijksmuseum.,Sep 2020

Well worth spending a few hours here as there's lots to see and so interesting. Loved the Waterloo painting and the Night Watchman. Surprised that masks weren't mandatory but did find Amsterdam lacked a lot in this respect and now we have to quarantine in UK. Got back just in time. Cafe was great with lovely coffee and a great choice, and good social distancing. Beautiful building, well displayed and lovely gardens but the chairs were really uncomfortable there.",Aug 2020
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"Despite coronavirus, we had pre-booked tickets and the staff were so helpful though we arrived a bit late for our timeslot - (walking from Centraal station takes longer then you think at the moment as there are building works which cut off routes near to the Rijksmuseum. )
The good thing is, is that the museum is enormous and you can always see where you need to be if you look up to the skyline.
There is something there for everyone, even lukewarm art fans like me, as it's in two sections on three floors.
You have to go down (or up) to get across as it were - but all the artists' major work is there - if you push me I'd say Rembrandt, Vermeer, Caravaggio etc.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"One day is not enough. The museum is very well constructed and guides the visitor through the history of Dutch art via two 'routes'. We didn't manage to do both routes and after completing the first one we were thrilled (although we did the last part of the 'orange' route - the more clerical phase - at a fast pace). Nevertheless, the curators managed to give us all a good overview of the work of the various Dutch masters.

Expensive at 19 euros a head, kids free thank god! It is a massive museum, mainly full of art. However, there were lots of other antiquities like furniture. It was a joy to stroll around, lots of variety. Also prompted much meaningful discussion with 11 yo on a variety of topics...paintings being the social media/propaganda of the day, etc. Rembrandt's were impressive. The building itself is also super impressive, with hugh landings full of stained glass windows and wall friezes. We spent the whole afternoon here and really enjoyed it. It's so huge that we didn't see everything. The modern art on the top floor is not to our taste, each to their own. I would highly recommend a visit here. If you visit one museum in Amsterdam, make it this one.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"We visited with a pre-booked ticket and the staff were very friendly and welcoming despite the lockdown restrictions. There was hand sanitiser everywhere and you have to leave your bag in the cloakroom which was very simple.

The museum is very well signposted to see the different attractions. We went around the entire thing and the attractions are very pleasant. One of the main focuses is the Night Watch by Rembrandt which is very impressive and well documented for you to peruse.

We had a coffee in the cafe which was very friendly and welcoming selling vegan cakes and soft drinks.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"The Rijksmuseum is incredible. One of the top collections in the world. Building recently renovated in a way that enhances the art. And now with only 2000 visitors a day allowed in to promote social distancing. Typically, visitation has been closer to 10000 visitors a day. So this is the time to visit.

Tickets need to bought in advance with a designated time slot.

Photos are currently not allowed in the museum.

The Gift shop sells Rembrandt Face Masks. A timely addition to one's wardrobe.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"The building itself is fantastic. Beautiful paintings and a lot, a lot of artefacts. Way more than you can absorb.

I am not someone really into art, but enjoyed the Rijksmuseum a lot. If you are with kids, ask for the booklet you can get for free at the central reception desk in the main lobby. With this well set up book not only the kids will enjoy the Rijksmuseum. I learned a lot via this book also, which made my stay more memorable also.

We stayed about 2 hours, but you can stay here for days.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"We had to book a timeslot in advance as the number of visitors they accomodate at any one time is limited as a corona measure. Upon entering the museum one of the host asked us if we had reservations for the Caravaggio (sculpturer) and Bernini (painter, both Italian) special exhibition. We told her it was fully booked when we wanted to book it online, but she todlus if you to the ticket office they may have availabilities. So we got into this special, temporay exhibition, as a free bonus. Great hospitapity, thanks for the tip! The Caravaggio and Bernini exhibition was amazing and so is the whole museum. Their collection is incredible and it is displayed in a beautiful setting. A rainy day well spent!

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"Our first visit in the new reality, our third overall. We booked the Monday 9am slot, free entry with Museumkaart.

The new timeslot booking process worked well. No entry queue, self scan was simple, free lockers for your rucksack.

Our plan of attack was Gallery of Honour then an audio tour of 1100-1600 highlights. I'd imagine most regulars come armed with a plan as this place has an over whelming collection.

The Night Watch is still fenced off with the scanning frame in place but the scanner head doesn't obscure the work anymore and nobody was working on it.  Sadly the wonderful A3 information cards are a Covid-19 victim!

Before the audio tour we hit the cafe for our first time.  Very professional there - one way system, QR Code self order/pay, separate serving table.  Cappuccino £3.40.  The view makes you appreciate the glazed roof and strange caging which few visitors probably notice.

Audio tour was free on the wonderful Rijksmuseum App.  

The highlights audio tour was fine. But you can also enter an item number in the App if I want to read more info. I'd say you get more info that way, especially if the item has been restored.

Somehow 3 hours went by. But that's the magic of the Rijksmuseum!  

They've coped well with the new rules and at no time did we feel unsafe BUT we went early.  If we had gone at midday our experience may have been different.  I'm sure face masks will soon become compulsory at such venues if they are to stay open.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"We spent about four hours at the Rijksmuseum - enough time to see the main sections (at a reasonable pace) but not enough time to see the exhibitions too. Some really well known artists and pieces of work - but some equally unknown and interesting sections.

I’d recommend working out which sections you want to spend more time in at the outset, to avoid missing or rushing the things of most interest.

Also - they seem to be strict on time so if you’ve booked in advance - make sure you can definitely arrive on time (or slightly early to allow for queues) or you’ll miss out!

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I almost didn't go to this museum. I saw that it was highly recommended but after going to the Van Gogh museum I wasn't sure I wanted to spend more time in a museum (even though I highly enjoyed my time at the Van Gogh museum).
Last minute we booked the tickets online (night before) and I am glad we did. This museum is incredible. Each floor has a collection of art from a different century, from ancient times at the bottom to modern art at the top floor.
This museum is very large and if you want to see all of it you may spend about 6 hours or more, depending on how much time you take for each piece. Make sure to see the art you are most interested in first, so that you are at your peak energy level.
The traveling exhibit at the time of our visit was incredible. Caravaggio-Bernini (Baroque art from Rome) pieces included highly famous paintings and sculptures and was my favorite part of the museum.
There was only one Van Gogh painting so if you're interested in his art I would recommend the Van Gogh museum next door.

Well, it didn't. Cruise again more training.

Also, there is an app available for the visit and it's very useful to go directly to the parts of the museums that is of interest. And of course, there's the hall of fame whene masterpieces of Vermeer and Rembrandt and all of the other major artists are exposed in a single place, with all the explanations accessible to the kids.

The museum also has well defined rooms for different collections,and even the halls and corridors between the exhibitions are works of art.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"The tours can be booked online (at an extra cost to the entrance, this one was 5 euros). However, if it is fully booked online it is worth getting there a bit earlier and asking if there have been any cancellations to allow you to join the tour. That's what I did and was able to join a guided tour much to my delight. We were a modest group of about 8 which made it easy to follow everything and ask the tour guide if we had any questions. He was an art student, very knowledgable and it gave us insight into the exhibits that we would not normally have had. Highly recommended, and if you get there early (I always go at opening time) you can really discover the museum at its' best before the inevitable masses arrive. (The tours are approx 45 minutes but you need at least a morning here to look around, and the coffee shop is great for a break if you need a rest before continuing to explore the wonders if this fabulous place. )

I ""joined"" the museum before I left - it was not that much more and boy was it worth it. It got me in and out in a jiffy and a cloak room attendant almost to myself - which doesn't sound like a big deal until you realize that line can cost you over 45 min. or so! It has all the amazing Holland painters of course and then some. Well worth the price. p.s. I also took a ""tour"" which was great - Anna was an amazing guide!",Feb 2020

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"We had a limited time in the museum so decided to split up and all decided to use the guide in different ways. I chose to follow two themed tours, firstly the ""highlights"" then the ""music"" tour. It took some time to get oriented but then quite problematic when the paintings were far apart. The interactive map was confusing and even got my current location wrong almost every time I used it and consistently said I was a floor which I wasn't. I wasted a lot of time looking for the next picture on the tour after virtually every painting. If it had been more user friendly then it would have been good value at 5 Euros per person.",Mar 2020

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"This is a large museum with a varied and impressive collection. We splashed out for the one-hour guided tour and have no regrets. Arnold took us through the Rembrandt exhibit (usually a separate admission but the tour took us through as part of our admission) spending time explaining specific paintings and their meanings. His knowledge gave us a deeper understanding of this master painter.

Arnold explained the history of the building, recent renovations and other interesting tidbits about various pieces in the collection. The tour finished at Operation Night Watch, the research and conservation project for Rembrandt's 'The Night Watch.' This is a massive undertaking, done with great passion. An expert was available to answer questions about the project and her knowledge is extensive.

We had lunch in the cafe after our visit. The experience was delightful - swift, attentive service and yummy food. Don't let the long entry line deter you. It moved and we were seated within 15 minutes of queuing.

We booked online, directly through the museum, which saved all the important things - time and money.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"We bought the tickets + audioguide directly at the museum’s own web site. There are handy lockers which we used instead of queueing the garderobe. We got advise to start from the 2nd floor where the most important Dutch art is presented (Vermeer, Rembrandt etc.) and that was clearly the right thing to do, because the museum is so huge that you are likely to miss something anyway and those paintings at the hall of fame you most surely don’t want to miss. We were lucky to visit also the special exhibition by Caravaggio and Bernini. After four hours examining art we had very nice lunch at the museum cafe / restaurant. Don’t forget to take a look at the impressive library!

Another nice touch was the restaurant- there is so much to see, it’s lovely to stop and have a glass of wine halfway through, especially in such beautiful surroundings.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"We spent several hours here most enjoyably here on a cold and wet February morning.
Helpful staff to help you find desired gallery / painting.
Most appreciated were the large laminated cardboard information boards. Available in a number of galleries, they explained details of some of the paintings in an area of a gallery: little details you might not have noticed; customs, traditions and historical features, whose significance would not be known today. Most interesting and informative, they greatly added to our appreciation of paintings.

We stopped at one point to get a drink and cake - delicious and seated in good time. Staff are very attentive.

Before we arrived, I also had an issue with tickets as the museum had taken my money yet not sent me the tickets. This was dealt with before we visited (just emailed), when we got there they printed our tickets for us and there were no further issues.

The museum itself was very busy, the earlier you get there the better! Lots of school visits and groups visiting. However, the museum is so big no where was too overly crowded.

We would definitely visit again and recommend, just make sure that you have plenty of time to look around as it does take you ages, just getting lost in pieces of art.

Some highlights for us were the great hall, dolls house and the library!

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,2.0,"There is no question of the quality of this museum or the quantity of excellent art work. That said, the experience is horrible. The place is simply overrun by tourists who feel no need to even attempt to whisper or silence their phones. Plus, the museum doesn’t stop children who are far too young for this type of museum from entering, who then proceed to cry and fuss. Likewise, the museum staff feel no need to ask patrons to whisper because they themselves speak in loud voices. If I ever visit again, I will only do so with noise cancelling headphones. I don’t understand how anyone can enjoy art amidst a constant cacophony. Shame on this historic and beautiful museum for not even trying to create an atmosphere in which one can truly appreciate its art.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"The Rijksmuseum is one of the world's great art museums, with a stellar collection. The museum went through a major renovation in 2003, that took almost 10 years to complete. The results were fantastic, making the museum far more accessible and easier to navigate. The collection features objects from 1200–2000.

Many of the museum's best works are from the Dutch Golden age. Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer are just a few of the great masters on display. Here's where you'll see Rembrandt's famous ""Night Watch"".

The galleries in this museum have a warm and inviting feel, that makes this museum enjoyable to walk through. The museum also has objects from the modern era, as well as a small Asian collection.

The Rijksmuseum has both a restaurant and cafe, as well as a nice gift shop.

An adult ticket runs approx. 20 euros. The city of Amsterdam offers several tourist cards that will get you free entrance and avoid the ticket lines. It's a very popular museum. I ended up going three different times over the course of my trip, spending a few hours each time. There's a lot to see.

It looks at the narrative and dialogues on reality and eternity, religion and beauty between the pious Spanish and the protestant, liberal Dutch society of the age.

An amazing place and an experience, whether near death or not. A must see, must visit experience.

We took the lift (after waiting ages) to the top floor and started there so we could take the stairs down. I would not recommend visiting with a stroller on a very busy day.

Despite the crowd, the visit was really pleasant. There was lots of time to look where we wanted, when we wanted. The art is magnificent. There are hosts/hostesses/security everywhere who can help you if you have a question. The temperature in the building is on the warm side.

We spent nearly 3 hours and saw only 2 floors. looks like we will have to go back

Sadly enough, Night Watch is being xrayed from left to right and top to bottom, so the area is completely glassed in and you can only admire this marvel from a significant distance, but still, it is unreal. And there is so much more to see along with special exhibits that I lucked out on, of Velasquez and Van Gogh. So what can ask for more.",Jan 2020
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"So much to see in this museum. First of all, ticket lines get pretty long inside. I found a stand right outside of the museum near the food area that sold tickets for thee same price without any line.
There’s a ton of things to do right outside of the museum. The area itself is really cute.
The line getting into the museum was very fast. Be prepared to walk ! The museum has multiple levels, and every level is a different theme to see. The elevators are the slowest ever ! So be prepared to walk the stairs.
You must see the library inside. It’s so beautiful !
Give yourself some time because I it will take a bit to see it all. They have a cafe inside for small snacks and drinks.
Small tip: try to use the bathroom before you get inside. The bathroom is at the bottom and the line is the longest line you will wait in throughout yOur Amsterdam trip.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I did not allow close to enough time for this and was there 90mins. I rushed around a bit and didn't get alot of time to just chill and soak it up. Suggest minimum 2 hours more like 3 if you want to see it all.

So much to see, really valuable place. Loved the Van Gough and Rembrandt but some obscure ones like the pic I posted. It was jarring at first but the story changes everything.

The story (from Roman antiquity) is about Pero and Cimon. Pero has been sentenced to death by starvation but was kept alive by his daughter Cimon who would visit him in prison and secretly breastfeed him.

The story is about ultimate self-sacrifice and charity.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"The signage in this museum is limited and tricky to follow. The (gorgeous) building is built with a bike path running through the middle of it, so you cannot cross from one side to the other on certain floors without going outside. That means you must go to a different floor, cross, and then move up or down to the floor you are actually trying to find but, again, this is not clearly indicated. Seems like an easy fix, and a common problem, as we saw loads of people in the same situation. Thankfully, museum staff are very helpful in pointing the way if needed.

On researching, I saw that the Rijksmuseum had a free app which allowed you to listen to the Audio Guide for free.

I found the museum incredibly interesting, and the artwork was spectacular. The layout was good, and in all honesty it was one my most enjoyable museum experiences.

The toilets were very clean (with an attendant) and plentiful.
There was an amazing exhibition on and we had no problem getting tickets (free with admission price) for this straight away, even though we just arrived and paid on the door. (Think it was €19 each). I always feel honoured to be part of a temporary exhibition which is thoughtfully designed and assembled (the paintings are gathered from various sources).
One of the most intriguing paintings is that of the Battle of Waterloo by Jan Willem Pieneman (1824). There was an amazing collection of paper art (models of villages and buildings, with people). When I return to the beautiful city of Amsterdam, I will definitely re-visit this museum.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,3.0,"I feel guilty to leave a less-than-glowing review for such a world-famous museum, but in honesty my experience was poor. Apart from the rich collection itself ...

• The collections settings seemed constricted, and with a large number of visitors it felt slightly claustrophobic.

• Some areas are too dark for the pieces presented, especially considering the large crowds.

• Clearly not enough ventilation for the number of visitors allowed.

• The visiting-path is confusing and it can test your patience.

• The central foyer, an oasis of a large high-ceiling space is unfortunately littered with junk constructions midway.

• The reception queue/info point could be much better organised.

A positive note is the stained windows… absolutely gorgeous with, for instance, a portray of Plato among its philosophers, scientists, explorers etc. Kudos also for the multimedia material.

Personally, it was a disappointing experience – the above affected my ability to enjoy the collection, which is surprising considering the Dutch are usually ingenious and efficient to solve problems. Sadly, not here.

So, if you come in the opening hours, you may get to view it somewhat closely, even though it is not positioned at a certain distance from onlookers.

Their collection is breathtaking with highlights such as Night Watch, Waterloo, van Goghs self portrait, and so, so many more. The line to get in was easily 2 hours long so I would definitely recommend pre-booking your ticket and getting there early. Also keep your eyes out for side entrances that may get you in quicker. We didn't get a private tour however I would definitely recommend getting the app as you could basically have your own tour by just using the app. It has a lovely little gift shop and a restaurant. I could easily have spent 4 days just in the museum so wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking. This will be a highlight that I will always remember for the rest of my life.

The Rembrandt exhibition was stunning, and ostensibly the area where 'The Night Watch' was located was the most crowded area. There was some sort of school trip on the day we visited so it was rather noisy.

On 27th I could have booked tickets online but felt maybe I should pay full price to support them. Boy was I glad I didn't! The queue to buy tickets was eye watering so we looked over the way to the other longer queue to discover it was for persons who had pre-bought tickets! Ridiculous! Then we decided ok we'll just visit the shop and buy some memorabilia and maybe coffee. No sir, ""you must queue"" to do that.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I had a great time at the Rijksmuseum! There was a great array of Dutch masterworks including some big ticket items that are all conveniently arranged in the one viewing gallery. They had special exhibits on that were free with the main entrance tickets, but you had to book in a specific time to enter them. While I was travelling in November and this wasn't a problem, I can imagine in summer that this would be something that you'd need to do either very early in the morning or pre-book to make sure you can get in.

There is a wonderful and comprehensive audio guide that goes through the majority of the main paintings and I would highly recommend it. It costs 5 euros to get the handset BUT if you either link into their free wifi or pre-download the Rijksmuseum app, they have all the exact same content but FOR FREE. So I would definitely recommend doing this and bringing along your own set of headphones to listen to it from your phone. A note though, I had an old iOS update and therefore it wouldn't let me download it so had to buy an audio guide anyway which wasn't a huge issue. You can easily spend 3 hours or more here depending on how long you like to go through everything.

There’s three important works of art by Van Gogh in this museum that the Van Gogh museum doesn’t have so I recommend checking it out. There’s free coat check and the entry tickets were affordable.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I visited this museum with my brother and, prior to going, we thought we would need to identify which paintings we wished to see as it is a big art gallery. Well, we need not have worried ourselves about this as it was all wonderful. We spent about 3 hours going from floor to floor and we never tired of what we saw, some of which is of course well known but other exhibits were very new to us and very engaging - I can't recommend it enough - it helps if you buy your tickets before you go.",Dec 2019

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"This is the most incredible art museum; and I am reviewing as someone who usually has a totally flat reaction to art museums. As in, ""Yeah, you're a really great artist; I'm very happy for you. Can we leave now?""
The range, chronology, variation and beauty of the artwork is mind-boggling. I'd circle one room's collection, view the sculpture, ornaments, statues in the middle, then pass to the next room. The museum is so huge that I ran out of feet pretty quickly (it was on our last day of sight-seeing). However, just as I'd see an Exit sign, my eye would catch sight of another collection, and, with a ""Wait!! We haven't seen that!!"" off we'd go to a new room. We walked and viewed until we just couldn't take another step.
not only was I stunned by my reaction, my SO, who is no art museum fan, was as awed as I was.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"The collection, as I know from experience, is priceless. I visited with my Mum who has trouble walking and cannot stand for too long. The rollator made available by the staff at the round reception desk was much appreciated. We were, however, hugely disappointed with the lack of 1) catering facilities 2) toilets 3) lockers and 4) lifts. 1) there was only a basic and pricey coffee shop offering muffins and such 2) queues even on a fairly quiet December day 3) my locker was almost pounced on when I vacated it and 4) a waiting time of 5 minutes for the lift is NOT acceptable. After the expensive refurb you have totally missed these opportunities. I would not come back for these reasons despite the superb art.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"A beautiful museum in itself...and huge! You could easily spend several hours here just wandering around all the floors and rooms taking in all the stunning and amazing artwork of centuries past. I was actually footsore by the end. Even in November it was extremely busy, probably due to the Rembrandt collection. If you buy your tickets beforehand, you'll still need to queue for another ticket to allow you into this collection and you'll be given a time slot. The queues were quite long for dropping off coats, bags, etc but they went down quite quickly. The restaurant was extremely busy too (with queues to get in). Despite that, I would recommend a visit.

go to the lockers opposite the cloakroom, not the cloakroom itself which always have a long queue.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Emotional experience visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. I just read the book last year for the first time.

The Nazis murdered over 100,000 of the Jews in Amsterdam. Authoritarian populism starts with the dehumanizing of groups of people. First they are banned from certain places & activities, then they are marked, then they are shoved into ghettos, then the murder starts. This progression was highlighted in the Dutch Résistance Museum, a good compliment to the Anne Frank House.

In this time, 2021, humanity needs to be aware of & vigilant against creeping right wing authoritarianism. It can happen again.

Day 1 was with Katja giving us a walking tour of the city and she gave us so much information in a friendly way and also made us taste local snacks on the way like Herring and eel. She did not rush us and we felt like we were with a friend.
Next day Rudy drove us through the countryside in his luxurious Mercedes van and we stopped and strolled through many little villages, then went to Markem a beautiful fishing village, we also stopped at dairy farm, wooden shoe factory, Edam, Volendam, Gouda, ka Steel de Haar, Delft, Monikerdam, Nijmegen and the windmills. All in the next two days, driven once by Rudy and once by Katja. On the day we were to board our ship, Rudy picked us up from our hotel and dropped us off at the port even though we asked him to do this last minute.
They are also multilingual and spoke fluent English as well as German and Portuguese. Highly recommend Rudy's Taxi to anyone visiting Amsterdam.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This was truly an unforgettable experience. To be immersed in the history of Amsterdam but in a moving and informative setting was an excellent experience. The audio tour was also well done and easy to follow.

The only comment I have was that there were far too many people welcomed in during our slot especially during Covid. It took away from the experience as it felt overcrowded and there were people who were not following social distancing (which is not the museums fault) which could be avoided if less people were welcomed in.

Another point that was really great though was the security bag drop. It allowed for a better experience rather than carrying around a bag and phone etc.

As a conclusion, well done to all the staff who were highly pleasant and to all of those who have proceeded to keep this museum as being both informative but also sensitive to the nature of what is being represented.

There were still a lot of people tho and you need to book your tickets early still. There were people who showed up on the day itself wanting to get tickets but were refused since tickets for the day were already sold out. We ourselves got our tickets about 2wks before the trip cos we booked as soon as they opened up their tickets purchasing again with the easing of lockdown(not bad considering you normally have to book months in advance)

The tour itself includes a free audio guide in a language of your choice but prior to visiting, I recommend knowing more about the life of Anne Frank beforehand to really appreciate this experience much more.

Don't expect much from the museum, it's very simple and come here simply for the experience of seeing first hand the place were Anne Frank and her family (and a few others) lived in hiding.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,3.0,"Anne Frank's story is harrowing and a massive part of Amsterdam's history but I was a bit disappointed with the museum. I haven't read Anne Frank's diaries so the visit to the museum was a whistlestop tour but it all felt a bit hectic and disorganised. We went while on a mini cruise so booked our tickets as soon as they were available (a month or so ahead of sailing), and had to queue outside. It starts off quite well where only the people in the allotted time slot are allowed in the house but once you're in, it seems a bit of a free for all and we didn't even get to see her diaries at the end of the tour as we just couldn't get near them. We took about an hour going around but I wouldnt have spent more time there and also be aware of booing if you have any sort of mobility issue as there are large and very steep steps to negotiate and I didn't feel safety was a priority - I understand they want to keep it as authentic as it was but it just felt a bit like a hazard around every corner.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,3.0,"I have been to Auschwitz & such places leave individuals with different impressions. Though places are somber and dark, people will react differently. Though Auschwitz also doesn't have many plaques and is much larger, you still leave impressed upon.

Now it was my own misunderstanding that there may be furniture or a recreated annex which there is not. However the huge rooms felt bare with a few plaques or quotes on walls and some small dialogue videos. Parents with children running around and being loud definitely distracts from trying to understand the silence and tensity that the Annex 8 endured. It also felt disrespectful and I'm not talking toddlers.

The last room next to the shop was my favorite part. The detail of their prior neighborhood & people they knew to put a larger context of the world oustide the annex and other Jews provided more information than the whole of the Frank part which is the namesake of the musuem. If you're in amsterdam-go to see the rooms but even in Corona time, quite busy and too many people pushing you along or not following walking paths and you feel rushed along.

The huge rooms felt more catered to large crowds without enough information - a bit sanitized. I think they should limit size of groups and put more information in the rooms. I know you listen to audio guides but I left thinking it's good I knew alot before hand. Once you're in the annex-you see the bookcase from afar and feel interest to see where they actually lived and original counters remain. not that you need to crowd the actual rooms with posters and signs.

But smaller groups allowed in would allow one to take in more of the experience and the hugeness of the new additions feels empty, cold, and rushed.

Disappointed but don't want to be disrespectful to the horrors that happened.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"What a gorgeous place with so much history!
The whole experience while visiting was so surreal. The audio cues as you explore more and more of the house are so interesting and really take you back to that time and how they must have felt!
I love how the history has been preserved in such a way that gives you that wave of nostalgia even though you weren't there!
You are not allowed to take pictures inside of the attraction which is fair but unfortunate as I would have liked to have more to remember it by. However the gift shop is large and has so much you can buy, little things like postcards and bookmarks as well as The Anne Frank Diary in all different languages and plenty more.
It can get incredibly busy so I would definitely suggest buying a ticket ahead of time if planning a visit.
All in all I really enjoyed my experience here.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This musuem was amazing, i enjoyed it so much. It is a real example of what happened during hitlers reign and tells you so much information about what happened. The musuem tells a story from when you walk inside the doors, it was a real eye opener to have a first hand experience of what it was like. The tour itself was also good as you can walk round at your own pace. Wheel chair users would find it difficult to get around this musuem as there are steep steps etc. However it is amazing for the price. I am planning on coming back to Amsterdam soon and i would be silly not to visit this place again. if i could rate it 10 stars, i would.

What I didn't realize was that this museum is built around the original home of the Frank family. I have to say that the authenticity and feeling of the home really upset me.

Due to UK Government restrictions we were unable to visit The Netherlands and requested a credit note.

The museum drew my attention to their Terms and Conditions. They do not refund or exchange for any reason other than their own.

We are very disappointed with the museum's stance. Another attraction in Amsterdam is refunding us, no question.

Contacting the museum they said that there is no way for a refund or voucher for another time. I found this pretty bad that I had just lost the money and there was nothing they were willing to do about it and gave the same generic reply for both my emails.
This was no fault of my own and I am definitely going to book some flights when they are available again as I understand that tourism is important.

You cannot help but feel what they had to go through for those years and a great sadness that they were discovered.Rooms are as they were left with displays and an audio recording at each one.The living quarters were very basic and as you walk around how they managed not to alert anyone below beggars belief.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,1.0,"Boring. It's interesting, but nothing more than you already know about Anne Frank. Unless youre particularly spiritual, there is no sense of connectivity with Anne or the period whatsoever. This is facilitated by the fact you queue to get in and follow a crowd around inside the ide. It lasts about 20 mins and its basically a bunch of placards on the wall highlighting inconsequential items that youll forget about as soon as you leave. Annes biggest recount of her experience was her diary, which we've all read. Id have expected to get a sense of space and perspective having visited the house, but this cannot be captured with a queue of tourists moving through, and even if it could it would be unsensational, as everyone knows already what it feels like be in a confined space. My advice to the makers? 20x the price, make it exclusive and prioritise authenticity. My advice to tourists: don't bother- read the diary, close your eyes and imagine a horrible and cramped situation with the enemy sniffing about constantly, and you'll have a more authentic experience than 'Anne Franks House' which is only Anne Frank's in history and not in memory.

Pointless.

It was very busy whilst we visited, which meant you had to wait a little while to read or look at the exhibits, however this just gave us time to take in where we were and contemplate what a struggle it must have been for the Frank family and others who were in hiding here.

I read the diary years ago and have a read a few books about Anne and her family but I was not prepared for seeing the house and the annex in person. How they managed to survive in hiding for so long is truly amazing.

The exhibits were informative and easy to follow.

I would wholly recommend anyone visiting Amsterdam to visit and experience this place as memory to Anne, her family, the others who hid there and all the Dutch Jews who were persecuted by the Nazi regime.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,3.0,"Considering how much we looked forward to going, and how much we knew of Anne's story - this was a BIIIG disappointment. But on the other hand, if you're all the way over there, you should go. Just be prepared to be underwhelmed. Crowded and slow moving tour groups. The inside of the house is gutted -at Mr Frank's request,s like empty rooms - so its hard to get a feel for actual living conditions. The crowded tour ends with a peek at the diary and the one she rewrote, which was a little interesting.",Aug 2019
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,Bought our tickets online in advance as I wanted to see the Anne Frank House after reading the tragic book. You can book a time slot and you need a couple of hours to get around it especially if there are a lot of people. With an online ticket there was only a tiny queue to get in and there was plenty to see in the House itself and the museum part afterwards. Some people might find some parts slightly claustrophic going through the bookcase door and up the steps but we were glad we went for the experience.,Mar 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"My family members enjoyed this, I didn’t love it. The crowds and queues within the house were such a distraction that I just didn't want to be there. Nicely curated, but try to get tickets for off- peak hours. We went at 4pm.",Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"First thing I have to say , I did not do my research on this tour. PLAN AHEAD!!!! At least 6 months so you know when, where and how you can get tickets. I let my mom and my aunts plan this trip and this was the only downside. I was VERY lucky. I was able to get in on the same day by entering the early morning online lottery . I was using my phone and 2 computers in the lobby of my hotel I was trying for 4, I got 1.

They will not let you in the doors unless you have a ticket. You can't even shop in the book store or gift shop unless you take the tour. I ditched my mom and my aunts for this. We spent 3 weeks in Europe This was our last stop. The entire trip all I did was talk about this tour. I was excited I even got a ticket.

If you go in the fall or winter like I did, check your coat. I did not do this. As you climb into the attic, its very steep and it jammed with people. The air is HOT. The entire tour is auto and is scanned in each room you enter. It's done in many different languages. No pictures or video is allow. It's an emotional experience as well. This is not something you post on Facebook or add to your vacation video. There are plenty of postcards, books, and many other items in the gift shop. If you are in Amsterdam, Netherlands this is a MUST DO!

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"When we planned our Amsterdam itinerary on our European Holiday in the summer of 2019, visiting the Ann Frank House was our #1 attraction. We believe this is the most historically significant, and in light of the current political environment in the United States, the most relevant site we could visit in Amsterdam.

We heeded the TA advance and pre-booked our tickets well in advance, so we arrived secure in knowing that we had reservations and wouldn't have to deal with the masses of people who descend on the site looking for day-of tickets. After arriving and checking in, we were in the queue for the first room within five minutes.

The tour itself is self-guided, with an audio guide which takes you through the various rooms of the house in which Ann, her family, and the others sheltering with her from the Nazis stayed. The rooms get crowded, with bottlenecks occurring in most rooms, leaving you with ample time to read the signage and other historical information on display in each room.

The most moving part of the tour is the walk through the actual hidden bookcase and up the stairs and into the cramped living spaces where Ann and her companions sheltered for more than two years. There are no audio cues for this part of the tour, and you are left walk silently from room to room reading the descriptions of the spaces in the silence in which these people lived their lives. A truly moving experience, and a well-designed feature of the tour.

The tour ends in room with displays of her diary in the various languages into which it has been interpreted, and a great video loop of various people, famous and otherwise, explaining why Ann's story is so important. The small gift shop at the end has a nice selection of various literature, including of course her diary in many different languages.

This should be the first and most important site-seeing stop on your Amsterdam itinerary. Those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it, and Ann's story is a poignant and unfortunately, timely reminder of the horrors of Nazism and the far-right.

A thought provoking, sobering experience as you walk around the building where Anne Frank and her family & friends secretly hid for two years.
There is no furniture but an exhibit in miniature to show you what it was like.
There are still Anne's posters of film stars etc on the wall, some faded but they're original and protected.
You walk through all the rooms apart from the attic, but they have a mirror so you can see the chestnut tree mentioned in Anne's diary.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,We took this tour. And i am thankful for the guide to elaborately explaining the situation and we could sense the pain they faced. It was heart touching,Sep 2019
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and sign up for the pre-tour lecture to get some context. I read the Diary of Anne Frank when I was in elementry school, which was decades ago. Out of all the places we visited during our trip, this was where we experienced the ugliness of tourists (VERY dishearting to say the least). You must walk in a single file line to move about each room, but there wasn't a lot of moving so others could see/read, etc. Maybe that is the way the world is, but just go in with the expectations to be jousled about and you will be okay. I would recommend doing this in the early evening, so you don't have to do anything else after that (besides having dinner). It is very well done and emotionally exhausting.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Get your tickets in advance in order to avoid disappointment! I cannot recommend this experience enough, especially if you have school age children who have read Anne Frank's diary or learned about the Holocaust. We went to the first tour of the day at 9am, so it was not crowded. We were given excellent audio guides which greatly enhanced our experience. Everyone is let in by the time on your ticket, so you will generally stay with the same group of people. As you move through the general tour, you will go up very narrow stairs, so keep that in mind if mobility is an issue. You are taken through the offices first as you get background information, and then you go through the bookcase into the Frank's home. It was so touching to see the pencil marks on the wall to measure the children's heights, as well as the pictures that Anne glued on the wall of the bedroom. You feel that you know the family, so it is a gut punch to go back down and see the video about the Gestapo coming in. I would also like to mention that the gift shop is very tasteful and sells only books and literature rather than tacky souvenirs, which is as it should be. It appears that the negative reviews are mostly based on the lack of advance tickets and the crowds that go through the museum during the high times of the day. You can make this a much better experience for yourself if you get your tickets online far enough in advance, and if you either go first thing in the morning or at the very end of the day.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Booking this tour was difficult as the tickets go on sale at 09;00 AM and you go into a queue and if lucky you get a ticket , if not try again tomorrow.
Once you get in the lack of room in the actual house is amazing, the stairs are narrow and steep and the rooms cramped. Once on the loft it became a little bit of an eye opener to realise you are looking at artefacts from the family and hearing her fathers voice, seeing his face as he tells the story. It is actually kinda harrowing to consider he was the only survivor.
All in all it’s a must see for visitors to Amsterdam, as it shows the sacrifices, made and the dangers faced during the war.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We found out that the house is a very busy place and line ups are very long. We were told to book before going, and we did, and it was a good thing! There were hundreds of people lined up that did not pre-purchase tickets, hoping for no-shows. You book on the actual Anne Frank House Website, and you pick your timeslot to arrive. You walk in and find a very heavy security presence. They give you a head set and you start the tour by yourself. Everything is there but most of the furniture is gone. The information is very good with the head set. At some point you need to go up a narrow stairway and doorway. You will find pictures and at the end you will find display case full of artifacts and the real diary that gave us a big supprise that I will not spoil. At the end you can buy souvenirs.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"We arrived on time which is essential as the tours are very regimented and keep to a strict time schedule. The short lecture at the beginning was fascinating and explained much about the Dutch experience of the 2nd world war, and how and why it had all come about. The tour of the attic was extremely crowded and I found it quite hard to absorb the atmosphere. I had read the diary and was looking forward to my visit, so was a bit disappointed to be fighting my way around with so many other people.",Mar 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We were very lucky we managed to visit here, as on visiting the website I was surprised to learn 80% of all the date days we were in Amsterdam tickets were sold 2 months in advance with the other 20% being sold on that day between 9am and 10am. So I packed my iPad as we had free wifi in the hotel to see if I could get 2 tickets while we were there in Amsterdam. Well Monday to Wednesday I was unsuccessful, but on the final day Thursday, before we left for home on the Friday I managed to get two tickets for entry at 2.30pm. We arrived slightly early on again another cold, windy and rainy on and off day, so were very glad when we were told its ok you can come inside and join the que. Before not too long we were given our Audio devices told to put supplied hand sanitizer on our hands and let through after scanning the vouchers off my phone already checked once before to start our tour. I am not going to give too much away other than to say you are not allowed to take any photos or video and be prepared to get upset by the horror of how these young children were treated by the Nazi's. And please god that it never is allowed to happen again. Although I have to admit when some young ladies kept continually laughing and ignored the do not touch signs of the priceless memorabilia we were allowed to share with our eyes. As there were no staff present I had to say something although I have no idea if their replies were good or bad in their own language they used, but from then on they neither touched or laughed so it made me feel Anne Frank had now got the respect she deserved in her last hiding place before being discovered and died. We personally found this so moving and also afterwards realised that a little girl by writing her diary had allowed the world forever to know how she and so many others had suffered just by being born Jews! Why I wonder they do not look any different to us and all I know are good hard working people so why did the Nazi's fear them so much they had to get rid of so many just doesn't make sense to me at present, so a trip to Krakow is needed to try to understand why!

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,Every human being should experience this! The Anne Frank House speaks to much more than the young girl that Anne was and the experiences that she endured. This is a story that speaks to the human experience that all of us travel. Anne told her story well within the pages of her diary. That story coupled with the ability to realize her verbiage while walking through the house where it all happened is overwhelming.,Aug 2019
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This is a monument that is a must for travelers. Pictures are not allowed inside the museum, but the statue of Anne Frank is right around the corner from the main entrance. I paid €10,50 or about $11.50 USD in advanced and I booked it in January, which is recommended in general. I was lucky enough to still be allowed to go to the historical site prior to the closures. Everyone gets a little handheld that works by holding it next to markers and is a self-tour with audio. I personally went through it slowly and it took me almost 1.25hrs. That is 1.25hrs of holding in all the tears I had because it is a reminder of WWII, a reminder of the genocide of innocent people. I am glad all the other attendees that came through also stayed silent while in the Secret Annex. It's also breathtaking to see some of the original parts of the annex from that time what how things were made. Not only do I learn about Anne, but also about her family, post WWII, who else stayed with her, and more. They also have books for sale and they are not that expensive either. There is also coatcheck and backpack check for free, just don't lose your ticket.
If you are handicapped, I did not notice any alternative way for one to get to the annex. There isn't much room in the hallways for wheelchairs or large walkers. The way up is also very steep.

Yes the stairs are steep but weren’t as bad as I imagined. I’m not in the best shape and was able to go up all of them just fine but an elderly person may have trouble.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"It's been a while since last time I was in the Anne Frank House. Things have improved greatly over the years. There are no more lines. Buy the tickets on line.

As a work of caution I looked at the ticket availability about a month before my trip and there were plenty of openings. I waited and booked a ticket 3-weeks before going and availability had dropped about 80%. Book early!

As it worked out I had an evening tour at 7:00pm. Have not done that before, an it is a different experience. They do have the audio devices, but no headsets. You can bring your own to use - the audio device uses the standard single prong type.

The tours are fun and it is a bit crowded. There are some bottlenecks along the way like when you move from the old business through though the passage behind the book case into the living quarters. It is still worth the experience. I find not bing in a rush helps.

Be aware you can only book online. Myself and my partner thought we could book them 3 days before but there were none left. Fortunately the museum release a few extra on the day, so after waiting a few mins in an online queue at 9am, she managed to grt a few last minute ones.

We wasn't sure whether to visit
1. Because I was worried being a bigger/fat/overweight girl whether I could fit/manage the stairs behind the bookcase etc (6"" 155kg)
2. As my husband was unsure he would find it interesting

Well it was fantastic! Anyone worrying about the stairs that is overweight don't! You're fine, as long as you can get up normal stairs, you will be ok. Our apartment stairs were worse than the bookcase stairs! It's wide enough and not too steep, so you can take your time. It wasn't too busy as we went first thing in the morning.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,1.0,"We reached out to the Ann Frank House once our flight was cancelled due to coronavirus (we are coming from the US), along with the hotels we were staying at and the car rental we had. Most of the hotels were understanding (some needed a little more time to go through the motions) but in the end everyone was flexible with understanding due to the global scale of coronavirus, the warnings to NOT travel to limit the spread of the virus (especially considering two of our children have autoimmune diseases), and it spreading rapidly in Amsterdam (and Germany where we will be before we arrive), Ann Frank House was cold and unwilling to issue a refund. We even asked for a credit, as we do hope to make this vacation in the near future, and they weren’t even flexible there. This isn’t a random cold, sickness, even family death that we are asking them to consider for us solely. This is going on world wide and we no longer have any means to make it into the country due to the airlines taking the necessary means they needed to take by cancelling the flight. Disappointing way to teach and share an important part of history.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Buy your tickets on line. I did the pre-talk about an extra €5 but was worth it to get your head in the right space to appreciate your walk round the historical site. Prepare to queue to leave your coat, which they seem to prefer you to do. Only a couple of euros. They only let a certain amount of people through at any time so all though a backlog occurs, naturally some people are slower or take longer to look at exhibits, it didn’t get unbearable.

As I say, get your head and heart in the right space and then take everything on board and feel what these people went through. Thought provoking and emotional.

Sat in a classroom with one of the guides for 30 minutes before we entered the house, he really knew his facts and presented the full history of how the Frank family lived, before during and after these events. The house itself is very touching and you can understand why so many people come to visit every day. Very moving experience.",Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"The museum is a must for an Amsterdam trip. It is well organized and includes a multimedia device with essential information.
Even though I knew a lot about the Frank family, I found out a lot more about their experience as well as other details about the lives of Jews in The Netherlands during the second world war.
I highly recommend the ""Introductory course"" even if you know your history well.
I thank the museum for doing an amazing job of preserving the Anne Frank House and teaching the current generations of the atrocities that happened not too long ago.

The half hour education session before the house tour was really well done (with multi-media visuals) and provided excellent context and background information. We toured the house with the complimentary audio guide, which is a terrific addition. The story is heartbreaking, but the message is one of hope and remembrance. As Anne Frank said: “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.”

Note that tickets are only sold online and you should plan in advance to be sure you get it.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"I think it goes without saying, but the Anne Frank Haus is the seminal experience of Amsterdam. So here's the down low:

-- You must book ahead. Find out what day you want to go and when those tickets open up online (usually 6 weeks ahead). Book as soon as they open.
--It's very popular, so you will spend some time in lines, especially in the part of the museum that is the actual hiding place.
--Steep stairs and small spaces. This isn't for the mobility-challenged.

That being said, it was an incredibly well-curated and touching experience. It spurred discussion amongst guests and has stuck in my mind. Please go.

The have multiple different language speakers to choose from that you scan at different areas in each room. Each time you scan an object you hold your speaker up to your ear and it tells you the history/story behind everything you’re seeing as you go along.

-Book early tour. We booked the first one of the day, meaning no crowds outside the actual house (to get photos) by the time we finished there were quite large crowds gathered outside and surrounding

-Definitely recommend the talk before the tour. Ours was extra special as our guide’s mother was one of the evacuated German children during the war (to the UK). Amazing! She was excellent incredibly knowledgeable

The house is designed as a path, which makes you perfectly identify with the anguish and mood that Anne, her family and other families involved have experienced. The Nazi persecutions have been a wound that will always remain open and this is a place not to forget it. But it's not just a message for that era. The sense that derives from visiting the Anne Frank House is a universal message to the world that cries out for peace. For this, it should be mandatory for each human being to come here at least once in a lifetime.",Mar 2020

The rooms are left ""as is"" - when the Germans cleaned it out after the Franks were forced out - so there is no furniture, few personal items etc. but that just adds to the shock of seeing where 8 people lived for almost 2 years under the most trying of circumstances. I would recommend the World War II walking tour in conjunction with the Anne Frank House as it give you a lot of perspective.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,3.0,"Booking in advance is very helpful as there are limited time slots available due too the high demand of visitors. Also beware that if you are bringing a backpack you will be asked too leave this in a cloakroom, staff are not very clear about this first. The tour is audio based and you are provided with an audio device but no headphones so i would reccomend bringing headphones to hear the audio clearer. Being able to visually see the house that Anne Frank and her family stayed in helps put her situation into persepective and allows you too imagine her experience. There is a lot of information available to read about the Frank family and the people who knew or helped them. Anyone wanting too learn more about jewish people who lived in Amsterdam will find this museum interesting. There was a large amount of people visiting at the same time i was which slowed down how fast i moved around the museum as its not a very big place and the steps are very narrow and steep at times. Finding the museum is fairly easy, i took a tram from outside Amsterdam Centraal which was 10 minutes and its a one minute walk from the stop, walking is about 30 minutes which i did on the way back.

I was so happy and chuffed as they said they hardly do that and my god was it so worth asking because it def exceeded my expectations on how amazing it would be! Most eye opening experience I've ever done! It's defo worth €10! such a reasonable price! headsets are free too!

I reserved my tickets online a month or so in advance of my trip after determining how many days I would be in Amsterdam. Showing up for my assigned tour time I cringed at the long lines but the staff was efficient and you quickly moved into the museum and picked up your audio guide (included in ticket price). Then you slowly make your way through the museum with your audio guide moving you from room to room and story to story. Only downside (which is unavoidable) is that you often are in a room with lots of people... while most are respectful there are always those obnoxious people that disregard all rules of common curtesy by crowding in front of you, talking loudly, or taking photos when told not to, etc. It just is what it is, but as much as you would like to kick them in the shins I suppose that's not very polite or respectful either... haha! Don't miss this incredibly moving experience and take the time to reflect on the impact of what hatred and fear do to tear people apart. Heartbreaking...

Do bear in mind you can only book tickets online and 80% sell out 2 months in advance. The remaining 20% are sold on the day from 9am online. You will need to ‘queue’ to purchase them and can get in the ‘queue’ before 9. The website says if there is more than 200 people in the queue don’t bother as tickets will be sold out, however I started queuing online at 9am in a Sunday and it started saying there were 670 people ahead of me. Within 15 mins I was at the front of the queue and was able to buy 2 tickets for 7pm that day.

You get a free audio guide included in the price (€9.50) which tells Anne’s and her family’s story as you walk round the house with the secret annexe.

You get to look in the annex where they hid itself which is interesting and also see and hear video and audio from those involved.

The website releases 80% of tickets 2 months in advance and holds back the remaining 20% for day release at 9am. As our holiday to Amsterdam was a last minute booking, all early release tickets were gone. Our first attempt we logged on at 8.55 and were 700th odd in the queue (website states if you are higher than 200th in the queue there is no point waiting). The next day we were 3rd in the queue at 8.30, after 5 mins we were taking back to the ticket page which told us no tickets were available. Confused, we kept trying to get back in the queue assuming it had chucked us out. Eventually we got back in the queue and was now 257th! We persevered and eventually got back to the ticket page again still stating no tickets were available.

You have to book in advance and they are very strict about that and timings. So if your slot is 6pm they will only let you in at 6pm (even if it is raining, no shelter). It is a very secure building and you have to give your bag and jackets and collect them after the tour.

We paid extra to get an introduction to the history of the Frank family and the Second World War. This was beneficial as you could understand more when looking in the rooms.

We spent just under 3 hours there and it was so factual and interesting but there is alot of reading and NO PHOTOS are allowed.

The Anne Frank Huis was more of a museum than I expected. It was well laid out and translation was provided for most of the exhibit. We couldn’t enjoy any of the films because we didn’t get the audio tour, so that was a bummer. I expected to see more artifacts... one of the coolest things were the photos that Anne and Margot decorated their bedroom with. It was also cool to see their kitchen space. It was difficult to get a sense of the actual house just because of the amount of people

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,Interesting and moving tour of Anne Franks House. Advance ticket purchase is necessary but no queue and plenty of time on the self guided tour,Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We would highly recommend a visit here although ensure you've booked tickets well in advance online. The tour was about 1 hour in length and was self guided. Although there were lots and lots of people, the area was well respected and silence added to the harrowing atmosphere. Video clips, audio narrative and leftover items all added to the experience giving an realistic insight to the horrors and fears of young Anne Frank's life.",Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We didn't think we would get in. The tickets were sold out for our day and we even waited on an online que in the morning, still to no avail. For some reason my friend decided to check the website later in the afternoon and there were tickets. It is a sad and heavy museum to visit, but it's a feeling and experience you don't forget.",Feb 2020

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Really important place to visit if you want to get into the war history of Amsterdam. Very touching, sad but informative.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,1.0,"Very disappointed, got up and made sure I was one of the first people waiting for tickets some 30 minutes before they were released, got to selecte the tickets I wanted just to be kicked back into the que meaning I then waited a further 40 minutes to find out there were no tickets left. Very disappointed",Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"We visited Anne Frank's Huis on a Wednesday afternoon. We booked well in advance so did not have to queue to get in.

Before entering I was told my camera would need to be put in my bag and checked along with my coat. No issues with this, I can understand why they don't want backpacks and wet coats dragged through. Obviously I'd have never taken pictures in such a sad place.

The trip around the house and warehouse took around 1 hour 30 and is broken into 3 stages.

You seen many items and learn all about Anne, her family and the other people who lived with them and tried to hide them.

The most moving part for me was when you enter through the hidden passage into the attic rooms they lived in. There are still postcards on the wall that Anne pasted on to brighten up the room and pencil lines on the wall to measure the children's height. Very sad.

I have read reviews that the place is too commercial but I thought the subject was treated with the respect it deserves.

If you struggle with stairs you may have issues getting around the house as there are many steep stairs to climb.

You see the famous diary as you leave and I got goosebumps as I looked at it, a really historic document.

There is a tasteful gift shop as you leave, mainly selling copies of Anne's diary in many languages.

The only sour point for us came at the end of the day once we grabbed our bags and coats, we stopped for a moment to check our map to find the best route back to central station as it was pouring down outside. A rather rude man demanded we get out, we were not in the way and had paid to be in the museum. This did not ruin the visit though.

This house is a lasting example of mans inhumanity to man.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Went to alone as husband had visited previously.

Was able to get a ticket on the day waited in the online queue for 20mins as very popular. I advise to get a ticket in advance.

Entered and was able to check in my coat free of charge and they provide bags for your wet umbrella.

Given an hand held audio and was able to go around the museum simultaneously.

Doorways and rooms can become narrow and crowded..but gave you a real essence of how Anne Frank and her family lived.

Also made you see how eloquent she was in writing her dreams and thought process, and gave me insight into other peoples stories during the holocaust.

Definitely made me reflect on life itself.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"It's an immaculate museum, with lots of exhibits in perfect condition and lots of information. The audio tour is informative and useful, and completely free. The free cloakroom is also a good idea.

There were some bottlenecks moving between the rooms, but that's understandable given how many people are in such a small area.

One negative we did have is that one guard on the door wouldn't let us in 30 minutes before our time slot (to me, a normal time to arrive before something pre-booked), but another guard did only a couple of minutes later.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"The tour starts with a history of the Frank family and the story behind the secret rooms.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Thought provoking, a must see and value for money! Brings the whole Anne Frank story to life.

Only downside was that everything was free flowing then the tour came to a stop about half way round due to the queues through just a couple of rooms causing it to get incredibly hot and claustrophobic. Staff could have been on the ball more with this bottleneck.

Advice you MUST book well in advance and I mean at least a month. If you leave it until you arrive in Amsterdam you will NOT get in!

If you have mobility trouble and stairs then this isn’t the visit for you as the stairs are steep.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This review pertains to purchasing tickets for the museum tour + introduction program. Be aware that it appears that this type of ticket is not available for every time slot for every day. I an planning to visit the museum on April 20th. Since much is written about tickets selling out fast, I decided to get online just prior to 6 AM (EST) so I could get my choice of time slots as the calendar opened up at 12:00 Amsterdam time. Minutes later the calendar for April 20th being available, I clicked on it and the only time slot listed was at 21:00 hours. A short while later time slots starting at 17:00 till closing became available. I was interest in a morning time slot, so I kept clicking thinking maybe that the morning slots are made available last. Finally after 4 hours I gave up and purchase tickets for just the museum tour. For several days afterwards I checked on the availability of intro tickets for April 20th, and never was a morning to mid-afternoon time slot listed. Today, after 4 days, the web site shows no availability for that day. I want to pass this experience along so that other travelers don't spend a lot of time trying to get tickets for specific times.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Very informative experience and moving in parts. We were surprised how much of the original house/warehouse and annex was still there to see (but not touch).

It was really interesting how at every point on the tour you could see where you were in relation to the original house. The whole story makes you think and is an emotive experience.

You have a free audio guide on the tour which is informative and the tour is self guided meaning you can spend as long as you want in each room.

You aren't allowed to take photos anywhere on the tour, however we did spot a few tourists taking some sneaky snaps.

You have to book this in advance! There are no tickets on sale on the day and turn up during your time slot as this is when you are let in to the museum.

Some rooms are busier than others such as the annex, pages of the diary and pieces of history about before they moved to the annex.

We still had some unanswered questions, staff were friendly and informative. If they did not have the answer they could point you to an alternative.

Would recommend, just make sure you book on the website in advance to secure a visit.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"The Anne Frank house is a biographical museum dedicated to the Jewish wartime diarist, Anne Frank. The building is located near the Westerkerk, a Protestant church near the Prinsengracht canal in central Amsterdam. During WW2, Anne hid from the Nazi's with her family and four other people in hidden rooms at the rear of the 17th century house. The area was known as the secret annex. The museum opened in 1960. It has preserved the hiding place and houses a permanent exhibition of the life and times of Anne Frank. It is an extremely popular tourist attraction and its essential that you book tickets on line if you want to ensure entry. The audio tour is excellent and leads you through the house, telling her story as you go. A must do tour when visiting Amsterdam, highly recommended.

Our slot was 17.30-17.45 and we arrived just before 17.45, we had to queue for about 20mins to get in but after that, it was pretty smooth getting round. The audio tour is a must as the videos don't have sound so it's the only way to know what is being said.

Simply because, this place does such a great job of putting a face and a story to the names of MANY victims of the Holocaust. Standing where they stood and hid made the experience so much more real and the entire museum is quite impressive. I elected to attend the program they offer before the museum tour when buying the tickets online - which I would suggest doing it available - it provides even more background on the Frank family, giving much needed context and history to Amsterdam and the treatment of the Jews there.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"I was not planning on visiting Anne Frank´s House during my trip to Amsterdam. I did so after my sister insisted a lot that I do so.

I will now admit that it was the highlight of my time in Amsterdam, nothing to be cheerful about but a very serious reminder about the past through the eyes and words of a young lady who had to suffer a lot during her short life, someone who surely had a bright future and was very cruelly deprived of it.

Do go, walk around the house and try to imagine what it must have been like for them. It will make a lasting experience on anyone which will be a constant warning about the past and how to prevent this from happening again.

Ensure you book an entrance as soon as possible, 9am (opening time) is the best one. Please refrain from taking pictures, not only is it forbidden but this is not a place to do so. You can buy a very nice book at the end of the tour for a very reasonable prices whose proceeds will be put to very good use. This book contains images of the house, pictures of the Frank's Family, their protectors, etc.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,Absolutely brilliant museum. The audio tour is amazing and if you are interested the whole time. I think that they need to manage how many people visit at one time as there was periods that we were waiting to move on to the next room and we were waiting for people to move on. That didn’t take away from how great it was and how much you admire the Frank family.,Nov 2019

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"As soon as the trip to Amsterdam was booked, we knew we needed to visit Anne Frank’s House.
We booked are tickets online before our visit. The free audio guide provided was extremely informative and allowed us to learn more about Anne, her family and the History of the house.
We both learnt so much which we didn’t know previously and would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Amsterdam.
At some places the rooms did get slightly crowded so you will need to be patient but it didn’t effect the overall experience.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,I definitely recommend paying the extra 5 euro to have the introductory programme first before entering the museum. Even if you know about the history it really gets you prepared for entering the Annex and museum. A must see when in Amsterdam.,Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"I highly recommend the tour with introductory program, very informative and good prelogue to entering the museum. Spent 2,5 hrs in the museum in total and it really was a breathtaking experience. Booked the tickets about a month before. A must visit when you're in Amsterdam :)",Feb 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"I came here with my husband who is Chinese and had never heard of Anne Frank before and didn’t know anything about her story. For this reason, I decided to book the 30 minute introduction before the tour so he could understand more about the story before starting the tour. The lady who gave the introduction was extremely knowledgeable and gave us a detailed history of the Frank family and their life in the secret annex and what happened to them afterwards. During the tour, we received headsets, which could be activated at different points of the tour. It was fascinating to visit the secret annex and find out more about the family’s experience during their time spent there, as well as afterwards. It’s shocking to think they were just one of many Jewish families in the same situation during the Second World War. I remember their was a thick book towards the end of the museum which had a list of all the Jewish people who were killed before or shortly after the war. This really put things into perspective. I believe it’s important to visit sites such as these to find out more about some of the darkest periods of history and ensure they are never repeated.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"A second visit and still an emotional experience. Stark yet informative, the House stirs many emotions and also educates. The audio guides build up to the attic gently and describe Ann Frank's life and personality together with life in occupied Amsterdam during WW2. The house is subtle and stricking in equal measures. The exhibits are thought provoking and educate. It felt crowded as you move through the house but I feel this allows you to share the experience with others around you and allowed for conversations with people I didn't know from different places. We especially liked the exhibition on the ground floor which allows you to interact with the Franks' apartment and learn about Ann's school friends. There were stories of others who went into hiding too, which were very interesting. I shed a tear but it is reassuring to know that Ann Frank will live on forever.

This is a must visit. 80% of tickets are sold out for three months in advance. 20%of tickets are. Sold on the day via the website. We missed out the first time we tried but were persistent. Don't try to get them at 8am, the sale online starts at 9am so jump on then and be patient.

Still one of the most eye opening, thought provoking and emotional places I have visited.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We couldn’t visit Amsterdam without visiting the house which Anne Frank and her family hid in during the war.
The audio guides are full of info without being boring and overwhelming. They explain each area you are in well. Despite it being a busy place you still get the feel of how they must have felt living in a small area of a house for so long. There are recreated photos of how it would have been set out. There’s not much more that could be done to make this better. Definitely recommend. The tour took us just under an hour from when we walked in the door. We read most of the little info plaques throughout the museum. Getting to view the original diaries is pretty incredible. They have a free cloakroom for coats and bags as bags are not allowed around the museum. Tickets must be purchased online prior to arrival.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This museum is frequently sold-out; however, if you visit their website at 9am sharp on the day of your visit, some last-minute tickets are released for sale. I was fortunate enough to score one of these. Two types of tickets are available — one “Ticket +” which includes a 30-minute introduction prior to your tour, and the standard ticket which includes just the walking tour through the house. Although, I would have preferred the “Ticket +” option, it was not available the day of my visit.

The museum itself is a self-paced walking tour that includes an audio device (available in multiple languages). As you walk through each room, you scan a barcode, and the audio device will read to you for approximately 1 - 2 minutes per station.

I expected to see the house arranged as if had been in the days of Anne Frank’s hiding, but only a few original articles remained in place. There are photos in each room that show how the rooms used to be arranged, and I imagine the museum would be far too cramped if the furniture remained. Despite this, however, the story of Anne Frank is incredible, and the experience is a very somber reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust.

I was very humbled by my visit, and definitely recommend taking a tour of the house if you have an opportunity to do so.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,1.0,"There was this old man (worker) who kept harassing me ON MY BIRTHDAY only because I was holding my phone while doing my audio-guided tour in the museum. He was expecting, more like hoping, I would break the rule and take photos while inside the museum. Is he for real?! Has he not heard of Google Images and documentaries on the life of Anne Frank? Why on earth would I want to take photos of such a sad place?! I respect Anne Frank’s experiences too much to do such an unnecessary thing! By the way, they should check their security footage on 06.Feb 2020 from the 09.00 batch of visitors. I saw a teenage girl (Spanish-speaking) took photos of the attic using her phone. She was doing it directly in front of their CCTV! This judgmental old man should stick his nose on their CCTV footage instead!

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"The tour of the Anne Frank House was very interesting but also very sad. To think about the 2 families in hiding, in that small space & what they had to endure to remain undetected is truly unimaginable. I, like millions of others have read of the plight of the Franks, & Van Pels, but to actually visit the annex where they remained hidden for much of the Second World War is another experience entirely. Even with a preregistered time slot (you have to book your tickets online the same day as your planned visit, early in the day, as soon as the online box office is open), expect a wait of about an hour give or take to enter the house and museum. Even so, the wait was well worth it. A truly moving experience. May we learn from the past, so as not to repeat our mistakes. The Anne Frank House still stands as a lesson for all of humanity, three-quarters of a century after the horrific fate of the Franks and Van Pels were sealed.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"The entrance is round the corner via a glass fronted lobby. The museum itself is made up of lots of empty rooms with information on the walls about the Frank family and those who helped them. There isn't quite as much detail about the family as I thought there may be and these rooms didn't really offer any new information if you already know the story. The actual rooms are accessed through a tight and steep staircase, the rooms are unfurnished (Otto's wish) and there are photos of what they looked like during the time the families were there. There is no access to the attic where Peter stayed. The cases with the diaries could do with being in the centre of the room as this area was a bit of a bottleneck. I'm glad I went to see it and I hope the exhibition can be expanded to tell us more about the day to day of Jews in Amsterdam before, during and after the war.

I got chills walking into the annexe. The free audio guide is very insightful and useful along the tour. Although sometimes it restarts itself so it can be confusing to know when to move to the next room.

Don’t expect a photo opportunity as understandably photos are not allowed anywhere. Also beware of the extremely steep steps at parts of the tour, some steps are maybe just 15cm deep so you have to walk up sideways clinging to the handrail. Also no backpacks are allowed but using the cloakroom is quick and easy.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Wow I'm so glad I chose to visit the Anne Frank House during my first trip to Amsterdam. It was inspirational, eye opening, and really makes you think about the events during that time. You can almost feel Anne's presence in the home with how well preserved the space is- to the point where the original kitchen counter was intact. There is a short 30 minute educational piece in the beginning by staff which is great to refresh on the history during this time period. The walk through is individual with a headset (which I preferred). Make sure not to bring large bags as there are some narrow staircases (though there's also a cloak room you can always check bags and coats prior to entering the home). What an experience overall- it really was a major highlight of my trip.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,2.0,"Already knowing the outline of the sad story, I didn't learn much at all from the visit. Due to the size of the rooms & volume of visitors, one is obliged to funnel through slowly, waiting to enter and leave the rooms. Would suggest that there was the option for further information on the audio system to fill this time for visitors. The only interesting original item / exhibit is the bookcase with old files hiding the door to the entrance of the hidden rooms. The rooms are dark (windows completely blocked out), quite small and empty. I spent a lot of my visit (whilst queuing) wondering what Anne Frank would have made of the museum and whether she would have considered it exploitative. I think it would work better in a different location. We were there for about 50 minutes, though had one moved freely from one room to the next it would take half an hour.

You have the choice to get an audio device and in each room you scan a section on the wall and the device starts talking you and explaining the theme of the room. The whole museum is set out really well. It is definitely worth taking the time to visit this amazing place.,Jan 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,The story of Anne Frank a young Jewish girl and her family trapped in Holland in teh 2nd world war. The tour takes you through the history of the family and the house including the annex where t hey hid for 2 years. The museum gets very busy and you have to book a timed ticket before you arrive. The interpretation is well done with a comprehensive audio guide included in the ticket.,Jan 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We visited Anne Frank house recently. It is well located and easy to get to however is recommend booking a group tour in advance as the queues were long for individuals lining up. The tour is excellent and starts with a presentation by a tour guide who runs your through Anne franks life timeline and family history. You then move into the actual Frank home. This part of the tour was moving, confronting , awe inspiring and just so sad all at once and to see where she and her family lived in secret for all that time was deeply moving. To see Anne’s bedroom and the actual pencil marks they did as they recorded the kids heights as they grew up moved me to tears (and many others)and the stickers her father Otto placed on her small bedroom wall are still there too. We were able to go through the whole hidden part of the house where they all lived which was superb. A word of caution for the elderly or those with bad legs ankles some of the ladders going between floors are very steep so take care. All in all to learn that they were captured 4 months before the end of the war and were placed on the last train to the concentration camp and all died except the father just broke my heart. Anne frank and her family were extraordinary and we left there feeling privileged to have been able to visit this sacred site. You can feel their presence their and it is just so special. Well worth it.

I had read the Diary of Anne Frank as a young girl and I reread about half of it prior to my trip then read it after. Reading her diary, seeing the secret annex, really put it all together. I'm glad I thought to do that. I am so glad we did the tour, it was something that really moved us all.",Oct 2019

The first part was a video/history lesson given by one of the guides. Very informative and worth the extra money for that extra 30 minutes. It was a very moving experience, however crowded with people once you entered the house/annex. Just following the person in front of you. It was amazing that they survived unseen for so long in such a space.",Oct 2019

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"It's so important to remember what happened during ww2, and the Anne Frank House does a great job of preserving the history and of course telling Anne's story.
A must do in Amsterdam!",Jan 2020
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,2.0,"As many others have said, make sure you book online. Based on my experience, I would also suggest going first thing in the morning or whenever it is less busy. I knew it would be a popular place to go but I was totally unprepared for just how busy.

We opted for the additional presentation at the start, which was very informative and upsetting, to the point where I almost didn't want to go into the house anymore as I felt it would be too sad. Once inside however, we were literally walking around the house in a single file snake of people and any feeling of emotion vanished.

They need to drastically reduce the volume of visitors that they allow in. This house should be a solemn monument and symbol of WWII persecution, but there are too many people so you can't take it in properly and really think about it. I would have liked to have spent longer in each room, but you're very aware of the queue of people behind you, so you have to constantly keep moving at a shuffling pace. It's not even because the annex itself was small, as the queuing continues even after the museum space opens back up.

People were also allowing their kids to talk loudly, in a place I think should be treated with quiet contemplation, as well as letting them run around in the newer, spacious museum part of the building. Totally disrespectful.

I feel many people visit this as a 'tick' off the tourist to-do list, without respecting what the house stands for and the real people that lived this life. I'm in two minds because visiting and learning about places like this is important, but the museum needs to massively reduce the amount of people they allow in.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,4.0,"Firstly I didn’t experience the negative aspects many attribute to the booking/ticket system. I didn’t book in advance and I suppose this is still the best way to make sure you are able to see this historic place. I joined the online book on the day system and managed to get tickets the same day at a decent time. Only took 10 minutes. Arrived 15 minutes before my allotted time and virtually walked straight in. It was crowded inside and the group of people I was with were all polite and there was no bad manners or disrespectful. So I suppose that was just luck. It is small inside and no facilities for anyone with walking difficulties or for those who find stairs a problem. But it is what it is. It can’t be made more spacious or have a lift - It wouldn’t be genuine. Takes about an hour to see it properly and listen to the audio tour. The Café at the end is pleasant and surprisingly not a rip off. Worth a visit, makes you think, very somber place. But is literally only about the Frank family and not the millions of other victims of the Holocaust. You need to go to Auschwitz to learn and pay your respects to them.

Netherlands,Markthal,5.0,"The MarktHalle is only a few years old, but has become an icon of Rotterdam in that time. It holds about 100 stalls and shops, all selling food items or culinary equipment. What makes it quirky, is the fact that the walls are actually apartments, with people living in them and with Windows facing down into the main hall. The inside of the walls have been decorated with a massive mural depicting food, but because the walls are curved, too get the perspective right, the mural has been 3d etched onto hundreds of metal plates, which have the been mounted on the walls and ceiling, probably making the world's largest Jigsaw puzzle. It is very effective, and the computer generated images look correct from any angle.

Take a walk through the hall, and see the massive variety of prepared food, ingredients and fresh produce, stop for a coffee, ice cream, or cake, or even a full the course meal at one of the many streams with seating areas on their roofs.

Well worth a visit.

The other reason to visit the Markthal, is of course for it's many restaurants and food stalls. There are a number of different cuisines to choose from. I sampled food from three different eateries and a forth for a glass of wine. The countries represented were the Netherlands, Spain and Indonesia. None disappointed. My favorite was the Sate Lounge.

There are also stalls selling chocolates, sausages and many other things. There's even a grocery store in the Markthal.

The Blaak Station is the closest Metro stop.

Good for lunch, dinner and drinks.

I have visited other food markets, where I was greeted by enthusiastic sellers, who believed in their products, that they made themselves and/or knew everything about.
How different it was here; a 18 year old girl, behind the counter of a cheese stand, more interested in her phone, instead of customers. And the stand had only the commercial cheeses.

Netherlands,Markthal,3.0,"The overall structure of the building is something to marvel at... but you get over it after a few pictures.

Other than that it’s just a food hall with plenty of different food options at relatively reasonable prices. There are also a few restuarant options as well.

Apart for the restaurants seating is limited so it can be challenging finding a seat during peak hours.

Also sells produce like fruits, nuts, meats and cheeses etc.

All in all, plenty of food options but I’m sure Rotterdam has a lot more to offer. If you hadn’t made the trip all the way there to see the building it’s unlikely you would go all the way there to eat there.

None available so we walked around downtown. 8 miles worth. Went to City Center and could never find any signs with Hop On / Hop off bus stop. There is no map of the route (only 6 stops), just a square with the four stops named but nothing showing where these stops were.
Again, can’t evaluate because never stepped foot on the bus once.perhaps next time, supply a larger fleet of buses and not run the 30 minute between buses and leave passengers with purchased tickets hanging.

The outside market was our favorite 'markt' out of all 10 or so that we saw during our visit to the Netherlands. Outside, you can find a large variety of produce, seafood, flowers, food, junk shops, clothing, handbags, and more. (Our second favorite 'markt' was in Haarlem.)

Seeing the Markthal only takes 15 minutes, but you will want to plan for at least 1-3 hours of snacking time. (It takes time for the vendors to cook the food.) Plan to spend 30-45 minutes to explore the outside markt.

If you are in Rotterdam, make sure this destination is on you to-do list.

Netherlands,Markthal,4.0,"When you surf the web and try to get some insights abut this place, through their website or the numerous videos on youtube, you always need to keep in mind that this is a marketplace and hence, it is inevitable that you find crowd.
With that said, the first obvious feature of this place is the architecture and the design. A 40 m high-horse-shoe with residential units and offices, while the market on the ground floor is a celebration of spices, perfumes and colours.
There is something for everyone: Halal hot dogs, fresh juices, macaroons, cheeses and tapas bar. There is a shop where you can buy kitchenware, included all-you-can-dream-of everything BBQ, from the knives to the posh and not so posh grills/smokers.
Allow 2 to 3 hours, whether you're a gourmet-connoisseur or a fan of marketplaces and street food, this place has definitely options for all of us.
If you're visiting from out-of-town, Markthal is 5 minutes on a bike, from Rotterdam central station.

There are a variety of street food sellers and other stalls like cheese shops, bars and restaurants. It’s a fun place to hang out and, according to the Dutch man I was chatting to at one of the food stands, has a proper market sometimes too. Prices were reasonable but €1 for the toilet is pretty extortionate! Most of the public loos in Holland are chargeable though but a euro seems a bit excessive.",Apr 2019
Netherlands,Markthal,5.0,"I am relatively frequently visiting the markthal as I love the atmosphere. Every time someone comes for a visit this place is a must go to.

This time we stayed there for a bigger lunch which included 3 warm dishes. The food was excellent.

This building is absolutely vast and it does not resemble anything we have seen before. Strangely it is quite an interesting building. Inside there are numerous shops or shop fronts with a huge variety of foods and other goods from many cultural backgrounds. We walked around and looked and tasted a number of foods. Prices are not necessarily cheap but they are not too excessive either. The quality appeared to be good enough in most cases, although some items looked far from fresh. Several shops had seating available for customers, others had standing room only. The vast ceiling was amazing. The art work was unusual. The whole thing was quite an experience for us.

stay in Rotterdam. Once at night to check it out and have a drink at one of the lovely bars - it was Saturday evening around 6.30 pm and things were closing up for the night. We went back on Sunday for lunch and it was busy. It reminded me of the Boqueria food market in Barcelona for the huge enticing choice and quality of foods. We tried the poffertjies but they were a little
disappointing and stodgy. There was a delicious flat bread pizza and amazing cheese stands. We ate on the top level and enjoyed the atmosphere and the views over the rest of the city including the Cube houses. Highly recommended.

Netherlands,Markthal,5.0,"The Market Hall is like an one stop centre shaped like an inverted Letter U which houses offices, residential, and permanent market stores below.

The place is all covered up and therefore warm in winter and you could see all along the Arch openings and windows which form part of the offices and residential alike.

There are a few levels down from the entrance housing various types of shops and the ground floor has a semblance of a market place with produces and a fair number of restaurants.

Right outside the Market Hall are rows of stores like a flee market selling all types of clothing, fruit and local produces and cheap food.

And for those on a budget, you could have 3 pieces of fried fish for 6 Euros... and a piece of grilled chicken drum and thigh for 1.30 Euro... Tasted as good and fresh but at a fraction of what you paid inside the Market Hall..

Overall, an interesting experience and kudos to the Dutch creativity !!

Most are booths with very limited seating if any, but unused outlets have been converted into small seating areas. A couple of fully fledged restaurants on the outer edges do have a dedicated seating area, plus some have an upper tier for dining. The building has offices and apartments on upper floors. There’s a supermarket and a few smaller outlets underground plus extensive car parking. Prices are highly variable.

Netherlands,Markthal,3.0,Nice architectural go at an event hall/place combined with business (?) and residential development. Impressive view. The food hall - inspired on the Barcelona Boquiria and Les Halles de Lyon I guess - misses authenticity as it is a planned development mostly housing food chain concepts.

Netherlands,Markthal,5.0,"We visited the Cube Houses first before coming here.
I am amazed by the variety of food/dessert/snacks here. Definitely much better than the food market in Eindhoven.

We walked around first to check out all the stuff and see which one we would like to have. I seriously can't choose because I wanted to try everything. We settled for Vietnamese food and planed for some dessert later.

The vietnamese food we had was rather normal, I wouldn't say it's good just average. After, we were too full to have dessert :(
I would suggest to order a little bit from different shops so you get to try as much as possible.

Also if you would like to get fridge magnet as souvenier, there's a shop one floor below and i found a really cute magnet (attached picture) for Euros3.50. I would suggest to get magnets here instead of at the shop near Spido Boat Tour, their magnet cost Euros3.99 and it's the common squarish kind. They have other designs too but I was much more attracted to the one I got at Market Hall.

The colours inside match the colours reflected throughout the market stalls and the eating places.

But our ship's shuttle service took us to this Markthal and allowed us to roam around this area. If you're looking for things to buy, stay outside and shop at the outside vendor stalls as this Markthal is 100% food only. You get a good variety of different ethnic foods at a very reasonable price. We were surprised at the reasonable food prices in Rotterdam after experiencing Amsterdam, where food prices were astronomically high. Many of the food items here cost less than even the U.S. ! The building containing these individual food vendors is pretty unique in that the roof is a large circular dome unsupported by any sort of pillars or beams. The walls of the roof is colorfully painted with food items. The glass exteriors of the front and back entrances reflects the surrounding structures which makes the view quite interesting. On the lower level, there's a supermarket and 3 lower levels of garage parking. A very interesting stop in Rotterdam...

Netherlands,Markthal,4.0,"The Markthal is a mixture between “street” food stands, fixed restaurants and some random stores set in a bazaar style, which is immersed in an apartment building.

If you are wondering what to get for lunch or dinner this place can point you in the right direction, you can find a wide variety of food in this place.

Some options that I remember are the Japanese restaurant, the Tapas place, Italian, Turkish pizza (shawarma), hamburgers, local desserts, wine stores (with the possibility to drink in), Chinese stores, fries (French fries) stand, butcher, spices and cheese stores... a lot of them scape my memory but, definitely go there if you are in the Rotterdam downtown area.

By the way, at the lowest level you can find a drug store, a wine store and a convenience store.

Netherlands,Markthal,4.0,"Not knowing what to expect I parked downstairs and followed the signs to the Markthal. First, there is a big Albert Heijn supermarket that puzzled me, but once arrived in the big hall that was quickly forgotten.
As you come up the escalator, you find yourself in a colourful arch packed with foods from around the world. I first simply walked around to see what was on offer.
Butchers, bakers, fishmongers, fruit-and veg stands; all of rather good quality and variety of quality within their fields. A stand with just hams, cut directly from pork's legs on display- each prepared differently. A stand with just spices stacked in perfect pyramids. A stand with the most beautiful fish prepared for you on the spot. A stand with just Belgian chocolates. Ice cream. Donuts. Tapas. Croquettes.
Futhermore, restaurants to sit and eat at and shops. A huge chinese supermarket (really; bring all your money: buy everything!) with an upstairs restaurant and lots of cookery books. A kitchen utility shop (go bankrupt there). Etc, etc.
In short: spend a day shopping yourself senseless, max out all your credit cards, call all your friends and share all this fantastic food on the spot or at home.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,4.0,"Fabulous building worth a visit in itself. The paintings are beautifully displayed and the downloadable app gives good commentary throughout. One thing which detracted from our visit was a large party of 6-8 year olds who were split into a number of groups. Their teachers seemed to think they had priority over all other visitors and sat centrally under the most popular paintings for quite some time talking loudly when other people were wanting to enjoy the paintings in peace. As soon as one group left “ The Girl with the Pearl Earring” we and others hurried across to see it to be met with another group determined to take the exact same spot as the previous group. The teacher even asked us to move away. The problem was repeated in the Golden Room where all the children and teachers took over the entire space whilst children read out loud at length while others scrabbles over the furniture. The group did spoil to some extent not only our visit but that of other adults wishing to enjoy the place in peace.

Last but not least there was an exhibition of Nicolaes Maes, apprentice of Rembrandt, on the second floor. Also perfectly accessible with a lift. I between we had sme drinks and gave our son a bottle in the restaurant.

Very good visit, the only thing that did surprise me was the size of the museum. I found it rather small. Smaller than I thought it would be. But still, the collection is very special and worth to see. So go and visit the museum. You won't regret it!

But its totally worth the trip! there you will find famous pieces by Vermeer (the girl with the pearl earring) and Rembrandt (The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp).
The lines are usually small and fast.

they offer audio guides in many languages.
they will accept the dutch museum card, and sell it there as well. This card will allow you free entrance in many museums in Holland as well as let you skip the lines whenever there is one.
you cannot enter with a selfie stick or expanding tripods, you are allowed to take pictures with cellphones and cameras, even DSLRs.
the museum has lockers for your coats and backpacks, with a returnable 1 euro coin system. you need one euro coin to release the key to the locker. When you bring the key back, your coin will be returned to you.
Big backpacks are not allowed inside, you are also not allowed to eat inside the Mauritshuis. there are elevators throughout the building, however some of the doors fell a little tight (for passing with a wheelchair) but there are walkarrounds.
SINCE YOU'VE MADE TO THE HAGUE: make a day out of it, go to the beach of scheveningen if its sunny, stay for a couple of drinks at the grote markt if that's something you're into, check out other places like the MUSEON, Ominiversum, Madurodam, there are a bunch of things to to !

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"Nicolaes Maes: Rembrandt’s Versatile Pupil

“Tourist in Another Country” by Jodie Gould

In honor of Rembrandt & the Golden Age Year, the Netherlands has launched special exhibits in many of its most prestigious art museums, including Mauritshuis in The Hague. The ornately-decorated 17th-century mansion is home to hundreds of oject d'art and paintings by many Dutch masters. The Nicolaes Maes exhibit, which runs from October 17 to January 18, 2020, is the first international retrospective of one of Rembrandt's most talented students.

Known for his scenes of ordinary life and displays of emotion, his ""Old Lacemaker"" portrays an elderly woman in her kitchen beside pots, jugs, and utensils common to the period, lost in her lacemaking. Paintings like this fill the viewer with a sense of peace and calm. But Maes also had a provocative side. ""Eavesdroppers,"" shows the lady of the house listening gleefully behind a door as her maid canoodles with her boyfriend. Vermeer’s ""The Girl with the Pearl Earrings,"" a portrait of a young woman in exotic garb, turban, and pearl earrings, follows you seductively with her eyes like the ""Mona Lisa."" Also worth seeing is a large-sized painting by Paules Potter called ""The Young Bull,"" which shows a farmer watching over his cattle from behind a tree where (it is said) he is pleasuring himself. Yes, there was soft, bucolic porn in the 17th century. #maes #rembrandt #mauritshuis #dutchmasters

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"The Mauritshuis is far more intimate and accessible than other Dutch museums like Amsterdam's Van Gogh and the Rijksmuseum. You can get very close to The Girl with the Pearl Earring, The Bull, The Goldfinch, etc. before the guard runs over and barks at you ""Arms length!""

We arrived at the museum at 10am. However, unbeknownst to us it was the day parliament was to be opened so the museum was closed until 3PM. So just after 3 we were one of the first to get through the entrance. While others milled about we went straight to the 2nd floor to see the masterpieces. It was at least 15 minutes that we had the gallery virtually all to ourselves. Even after that there weren't more than 5 or 10 people around the Vermeers and Rembrandts. Maybe we just lucked out regarding the lack of crowd.

While it's much smaller than the museums in Amersterdam Museumplein, the experience is much more enjoyable. You don't have the throngs of people with audio tours doing their zombie walk through the museum. A great place to spend an afternoon with the Dutch masters.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,4.0,"This is one of the 'must-see' art museums people usually visit in The Netherlands. We enjoyed it. The building is lovely, but the museum is a reasonable size. We weren't exhausted by the end of it. We spent about 2 hours casually moving through the museum. We did not make use of the free app-guided tour, but if we had, we probably would have spent a little more time.

We arrived at 10:00 on a Sunday in mid-September, so it might have been slower than if we had visited in peak tourist time (like a Saturday in August at 13:00). When we were there, it was not very crowded and we could stand directly in front of each painting if we wanted to.

All of the art in this museum is from a similar time and style. For some, this could become monotonous, even though the paintings are excellent and famous and beautiful. There are a lot of portraits and still-life paintings. If that's not your thing, give yourself permission to visit one of the other fantastic art museums in the city.

Young kids will get bored. Don't drag them to this.

Would recomment this way and then take yourselves around the other rooms. The pictures are of very high quality and are generally a celebration of Dutch contributions to the 17 and 18th centuries gathered by Willem V, though with some later additions/loans. A truly wonderful exhibition in beautiful surroundings, well laid out and (in end September 2019) not particularly busy. Photography is permitted but pictures are difficult to reproduce becuaes of the natural and artificial lighting. Wheelchair users can be accommodated and larger kids may be enthralled by the bugs and beetles in the still lifes. Brilliant.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,4.0,"This is a lovely, well curated museum; I've been twice and it has fabulous art in a lovely setting. My main complaint, is that its just too expensive, so many people will opt not to visit it, and I believe art should be for everyone. An adult ticket with the audio guide is $21. I understand that they offer free admission days, but many tourists aren't there on a specific day; they may have just one day to visit. I hope management evaluates their pricing, as this is much more expensive then many other museums of the same caliber.
I also hope they evaluate their audio guide. The content is excellent, I love the humorous comments on several paintings, but its not very user friendly and certainly isn't intuitive.
Definitely go, its a wonderful museum, but they could make it more accessible to all by lowering the price of admission.

You don't need to be an art-lover, history-buff or a museum-fanatic to be impressed by the pieces displayed in this building.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"I know you might not believe this but we enjoyed the Mauritshuis even more than the Rijksmuseum. The Mauritshuis is smaller just 16 room but each one packed full of treasures. The audio guide is fabulous. They have audio for about half the works. In addition for all the working including the ones without an audio they have a basic write-up about the piece that includes the artist, date it was painted description and background. We spend a solid 6 hours working through the rooms and enjoyed every minute,

The museum houses the Royal Cabinet of Paintings which consists of 854 objects (not all displayed at one time of course), mostly Dutch Golden Age paintings. The collections contains works by Johannes Vermeer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Paulus Potter, Frans Hals, Jacob van Ruisdael, Hans Holbein the Younger, and others. Each room has quality works to take-in and enjoy. The building itself is a treasure built around 1640 and situated next to the Binnenhof and adjacent to the Hofvijver pond.

You can purchase your tickets on-line or at the museum. The audio guide is $3.50 euro additional (well worth it) or you can download the audio to your phone. They have both lockers and a maned coat closet for your things. THey also have a small gift ship, a cafe, and restrooms. Finally they have a seperate part of the museum for kids/families but we did not visit this section.

The crowds are much smaller than for example the Rijksmuseum so, even though the rooms are small you can enjoy examining the artwork in a much less crowded environment. Given that The Hague is an easy 50 minute/ $14euro train ride from Amsterdam I'm at a loss for why more people don't visit this museum.

Here you don't have to run to see the whole exhibition ,like in big museums ,the rooms with nice chandeliers and dim light are easy to explore...I first entered the big gate ,using then the lift to go down the big entrance hall ,underground ...I found a generous space for visitors ,I used my museum card and I started to admire the masterpieces of the Golden Age .For me the stars of the collection are Rembrandt ,Vermeer with View from Delft ,The Girl with a Pearl Earring ,Jan Steen .The collection covers historic paintings ,portraits ,genres scenes ,landscapes ,still life .
All the iconic paintings of the Golden Age are there for the joy of your soul ...I was lucky to be there and to see the special exhibition of Rembrandt celebrating 350 years from his death ,where they put the entire collection on display.

Obviously the star of the place is The Girl with a Pearl Earring by Vermeer. Just like the Mona Lisa it is rather smaller than you imagined, but it is still very good to actually see it as an original. Having said that, I thought the Rembrandts were really excellent to see and the famous self-portrait. The star of the place for me though was the Two Women with a Candle by Rubens. The colours and use of darkness to bring brightness is amazing.

Don't get me wrong at all, I am not an art bufff at all and know practically nothing about it, but I can appreciate amazing things when I see them.

Although you can sign up for special tours in Amsterdam that include a day trip to the Hague, Delft, Leiden, etc. it is very easy to do on your own for a fraction of the cost. The Hague is a one-hour train ride from the Amsterdam Central Station. Once in The Hague, it's an easy 10-minute walk into the central historic district. Having been to the Mauritshuis many years ago, I was very eager to return to see their fabulous collection of Rembrandts and especially their Vermeers. If you haven't seen the film ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" I'd suggest seeing it first because the original is in the Mauritshuis. This is a small museum with about 300 paintings on display, so you won't tire of museum-itis. You can literally see most of the collection and still concentrate of a few of the greatest paintings in two or three hours. This is one of the greatest collections you'll find anywhere and it should not be missed.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"My husband and young daughter visited the Mauristshuis and were very impressed at the beautiful seventeenth-century building and the outstanding collection of art which spans from the 15th century to the 18th century. The Mauristshuis is really a remarkable collection of unique Dutch art, spanning four hundred years, and you need to allocate a few hours to really walk around and take it all in. The range of art shows you life of the ordinary people in Holland, the country side, animals, cities food and beautiful foliage and flowers.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"We made a day trip to Den Haag from Amsterdam recently and spent a couple hours viewing the outstanding Netherlandish masterpieces at the Mauritshuis (€15.50). Opening hours are 1pm to 6pm (Monday) and 10am to 6pm (Tues to Sun) with extended hours to 8pm on Thursday evenings.

This is a small museum yet what you find is one of the finest collections of early Netherlandish and Golden Age artworks in the world. You'll be able to enjoy masterpieces by the likes of Old Masters Van Der Wyden, Rubens, Holbein II, Rembrandt and Vermeer, whose most famous masterpiece, 'Girl with Pearl necklace' is housed here at Mauritshuis

The collection is found within 7-8 gallery rooms on two floors of a beautiful historic building, perfectly suited for the collection of works on permanent display. During our recent visit, there was a special Rembrandt exhibition that was rewarding to view during the visit.

We also very much like the Brasserie Mauritshuis cafe as well. This is a nice place for cake and coffee or tea after a couple hours of viewing art. Do try the Hazelnut Cream cake from Maison Kelder her in Den Haag. This is unique and delicious and something you'll only find here The Hague.

Recommended.",Jul 2019
Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"In the heart of The Hague we found this compact collection specializing in the Dutch paintings from the Golden Age. Here you have the chance to study masterpieces such as Vermeer's View of Delft or Girl with a Pearl Earring, Rembrandt's various masterpieces, The Goldfinch by Fabritius or The Ice Scene by Avercamp. As it is quite compact it can get crowded, especially around the more popular pieces.

But the compact size was perfect for a family with a young child as it was more than big enough before patience ran out. We tried out the children activity pack, but it was a little bit too advanced and big for a small five year old to get the full use of it. But he had the opportunity to make some masterpieces himself and there were some good hints for discussions around some of the artwork.

There is also a cafe and the usual gift shop where you can find all possible spinn-off articles from the more famous paintings.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"I visited The Mauritshuis, The Hague and The Netherlands mostly just to finally see one of my favourite paintings (now maybe The favourite) - The Girl with a Pearl Earring, magical masterpiece by Vermeer.

I arrived early in the morning to wait for the museum to open. I had bought tickets in advance so once the doors opened I could rush upstairs where the painting is located (you can see it on the map on their website). This way I did have quite nice amount of time to spend time enjoying The Girl with the Pearl Earring all bymyself.

To my surprise the painting is ""protected"" only by a little fence that is very close to the painiting. This was an extremely positive suprise and I praise the museum for this. In contrast e.g. you can barely see Mona Lisa in Louvre behind all those glasses and masses of tourists.

After viewing the painting I started going around the rest of the museum, plenty of other magnificent art there to see in an enjoyable compact museum so you don't need to spend full day there to see pretty much everything.

I also decided to send home some postcards from the museum and the lobby staff was very friendly, one of them even took my postcards and promised to take them to mailbox! And they apparently did since I know people got my greetings.

So all in all 5/5 just for the experience of seeing Girl with a Pearl Earring up close, everything else was plus on top of that. Highly recommend! The Hague an easy train trip away from Amsterdam.

The Mauritshuis has rooms full of Rembrandts, offering an opportunity to compare his depictions of Biblical and mythological subjects and to study his portraits.

Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is here, hung to display the artist's masterful use of light. The explanatory text explains that sh was an imaginary figure, (The best-selling eponymous novel, presents her as a Vermeer's servant and sometime assistant.) Reproductions of the picture fail to quality of the light on the girl's face and on the hug pearl. Peter Paul Rubens' ""Old Woman and Boy"" is here, as is Hans Holbein II's ""Portrait of Robert Cheseman. triking a comic note, Jan Steen's lively ""As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young"" shows adults making merry and, in the process, teaching children bad habits.

The Mauritshuis is really a nice museum, not too big but wel facilitated for their size. Parking can be a bit difficult for tourists however there is a paid parking lot under the square called PLEIN. The entree fee is not really cheap and with a family it can be quite expensive all together. (15,50 euro pp).
A lot of Dutch masters in the Mauritshuis, with of course gezicht op Delft and the girl with the pearl, but these paintings are of course from Vermeer and not Rembrandt from the exhibition.
Overall nice experience, but just as you expect also really crowded.....

First, even with a ticket, we were forced to stand outside in the freezing cold for 5 minutes only to enter into a half empty entrance area. There was no reason to hold us outside. Then they made us wait in line for the special exhibition. I was told it would be 30-45 minutes, but the wait was over an hour in the end. Surely with a bit of organization, they could have allowed guests to book a timed entrance. There could be an option to give numbers and be notified by text or beeper when there was space to go in. But there was no consideration of guests. The guards joked as though it was funny. Get it together. There was no warning on their website of extraordinary waiting times. I arrived 2 hours before closing, and I would have come earlier if I’d known the circumstances. What a waste of time and train fare. And just to top it off, they don’t even allow you in the gift shop at the end. It closes before the museum. So I couldn’t buy anything for my work. I work in the museums in Amsterdam, and even in peak busy season, I’ve never seen a mess like this. I will discourage this museum to my clients. They have no respect for the time of their guests and are not capable of managing a very small crowd of visitors.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"From my very first visit back in 1998 to my first oil painting class last week (Nov 14, 2018), this museum is at the top of my list! Even before its remodel, I have always loved coming back to this museum. Its as if someone has just moved into this stately house, hung their most prized works of art and the furniture is about to be delivered. From the Girl with the Pearl Earring to the Goldfinch, the Mauritshuis is the place to experience the Best of Dutch paintings from the Golden Age. With my latest discovery that they offer beginner and advanced painting classes (*Double check that this is still offered at the time of your visit*), it's reclaimed my admiration even more. I truly enjoyed my experience learning from a professional how to paint with oils. My only question is how could you NOT love the experience to take a class at the Mauritshuis?! If you have a chance check out the museum as well as their classes. I wish more museums offered this!

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"This is the site not to be missed in The Hague. Traveled on a train from Amsterdam, which took about one hour. The museum is about a 15-minute walk from the train station.

The setting is truly beautiful. A welcoming guard greets you at the gate as you enter the museum courtyard. The building is stunning, and the pond behind the building only adds to the luster with its graceful swans. What an experience!

I especially came to see Vermeer's ""View of Delft"" and was not disappointed. ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is in the same room, but I had already seen it at the Frick in New York.
There is one other early Vermeer as well. The paintings are displayed exquisitely against an old-world wallpaper.

Rembrandt is another highlight, especially the ""Anatomy Lesson"" painting. There is also some very interesting information you learn about his ""Homer"" painting if you listen to the Audio Guide, which is very good.

Had lunch in the cafe, which was excellent. The only negative is the stairs. There are too many and not enough access to lifts. However, this is a minor complaint compared to what you will experience if you love Old Masters and Dutch Golden Age painting.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"We were in the Hague chiefly to see the Mauritshuis collection and stroll the area of the Binnenhof, where the parliament for the Netherlands is located. We were not disappointed. The collection consistes of 841 objets d'art, mostly paintings and furniture. There are Rembrandts, Vermeers (the Girl with Pearl Earring is housed there), van Dykes, and works by Holbein the Younger and many other Masters. One that stands out is Paulus Potter's 'The Bull' of 1647, which depicts a pastoral scene with a young bull painted on a monumentally heroic scale! There was also a temporary exhibition, 'Dutch Paintings from National Trust Houses' (to January 6, 2019), which shows works by Dutch Masters working in England for aristocrats during the 18th century, when many moved abroad due to an economic downturn in the Nederlands. The admission is reasonable at 15.50 euros, and the size of the Mauritshuis ensures the whole collection can be viewed. Best to go early, as around 2-3 pm the museum approaches capacity! The house itself was built between 1636 and 1641 by John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, Governor of Dutch Brazil.

I was absolutely blown away by the beauty of the actual building, and mesmerised by the art inside.
It does not have to be a very long visit, we stayed approximately an hour and admired the art, my favourites being The Goldfinch and The Girl with the pearl Earring. Some absolutely amazing floral paintings here too. Not so keen on the anatomy one featuring doctors studying the cadaver.
Parking is close by in an underground car park which cost us about a fiver.

I was staying in the Hague recently as we were attending a private dinner at Mauritshuis. Before the dinner started my friend and I were extremely fortunate and given a private tour of teh major works of the gallery by the gallery director.

All of the works are, of course, fabulous. The Girl with the Pearl Earing is an obvious 'have to see' but the Rembrandt collection is just unmissable. Incredible works from a broad spread of time in his life. Remarkable!

I think the fact this museum is in Den Haag as opposed to Amsterdam means the crowds of tourists aren't as ferocious, which means admiring the works of art is a much more relaxed and enjoyable experience.

Walking through the museum is pretty intuitive, with the rooms marked with arrows and the museum map showing you where highlight paintings can be viewed.

As long as you don't stand too close to the paintings (there are metal lines marking standing limits along the ground), museum staff are happy for visitors to take pictures (without flash).

Unfortunately the temporary exhibit was closed when I went, but I think a new exhibition may be opening up soon.

For visitors who may need assistance walking, the museum has lifts and wheelchair availabilities. Tickets can be bought online or at the museum.

Also a lovely Rembrandt of an old woman and a child, he lighting his candle from hers - so touching in its symbolism. Everything about the place is wonderful - even the fabulous shop (look out for the rubber duck with the pearl earring - the daftest souvenir ever!) and the brasserie. A truly memorable visit.

I will admit that the entire reason we chose to visit The Hague was to come to this museum to see Girl with a Pearl Earring by Vermeer. She was in the very last room we entered and she was more than worth the wait. The museum wasn't crowded late in the afternoon on a Friday, so we had time in front of her all to ourselves. What a great experience!
It wasn't obvious to us, but you actually go underground at the front of the house to reach the entrance to the gallery, the bag check, and the shop. It is a nice shop, by the way, and postcards of many of the paintings are available for 1 Euro each.

There were many other great paintings by artists besides Vermeer though. Rembrandt features highly. Another great painting was the anatomy lesson.

There is an app to download to your phone which gives additional information on each of the pictures.

The restaurant is spacious, clean, serves good food, is reasonably priced, and the staff are friendly. If you only visit one place in Den Haag, this should be high up the list.

There is also lots of construction by the university. We finally found the visitors information by the library and even got lost with those directions. Just beware. Our other mistake was not checking to see if they had WiFi (which they do). When you come in they tell you you can use your cellphone for the audio if you download it. About half way through the museum, I realized I could download the app and it was so much more interesting. There are lots of pieces of art and most have some audio to go with it.

It is loaded with wonderful Rembrandts, Vermeers including the incomparable Girl With a Pearl Earring (the Dutch Mona Lisa—actually, better in my view), The Goldfinch (featured in the terrific book), several Hals, and many others.

It's easy to find Mauritshuis Museum ( I took 24 bus from Central Station). Watch carefully the buildings in your way to the museum. the Palais of Justice is sooo beautiful.
The museum it's impressive by the building itself and the collections are very important for the Dutch golden age.
Sincerely I was impressed by Vermeer ""View of Delft"". Indeed he was the masterof light and shadows and here you can see that.
Also Rembrandt famous ""Anatomy Lesson"" it's good to be able to see it.
I think it's a place you cannot miss if you are in The Hague. Actually most of the people consider it The Place.
Don't forget to buy The Hague transport pass from the Central Station- HTM. It's a huge economy.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"I came here because I wanted to see Vermeer’s “view of Delft”. I could not believe how close to the painting one can stand. “Girl with a pearl earring” was also on eye level. The whole museum was beautifully laid out, not too large. We arrived shortly after opening at 10am and there was no need to queue. The audio guide which cost 3.5 euros was excellent. I was impressed with the lady who explained it to me. Her English was exceptional.
There is a brasserie which can be accessed from inside and outside of the gallery, so a good meeting place to rejoin up with friends. It means people can go round the gallery at varying paces.
We then enjoyed the No 1 tram to Delft. The stops are clearly announced. You can get off at Prinsenhof and cross the road, and follow the sign to museum. You are then able to amble round old Delft. If you miss that stop, the next is Delft station, and you can get off there. On the way back to the Hague, you can get off at second to last stop, by the casino, which is very near Tourist information on the opposite side of the street, if you need help getting to Central station. If you stay on the number 1 tram, the last stop is perfect for Mauritshuis museum. It would be a shame to stay just in The Hague and not go out to Delft where Vermeer lived all his life. It tram is easy and only tales 26 minutes.
By the way, I noticed the Mauritshuis is open late on Thursdays. It closes at 8pm.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"This museum certainly doesn’t have the international reputation of certain world-renown European art galleries, but let me be the latest to tell you that it deserves one. I was really impressed.

It’s not a huge museum—less than 20 rooms total. One nice feature is the choice between renting an audio guide or downloading the free app to your phone and using that to hear/see the guide. I chuckled several times at the guide’s description of PG-13 material.

As for the art, it’s all top notch. Reubens, Rembrandt, Vermeer are the superstars. Plenty of other masterpieces too. I was surprised how consistent the quality was throughout; there were no low points.

I’m not sure how long this will go on, or if there is an ongoing series of exhibitions like this, but on the day I went, you could view staff restoring a 15th century painting. Amazing! And a first for me. No special ticket was needed to see that separate exhibit.

Also the Brassiere served a delicious sounding menu and which turned into a very delightful dinner meal. After 6PM, we literally had several galleries to ourselves at times, and were able to view the works, lingering where and when we wanted to. So many works from Rembrandt, more I think than we found in his home in Amsterdam. The stairs were beautiful as we climbed between the gallery floors, hand carved wood. A few windows let you see the world around you, just as you would if you lived here as if it were a private home. The entry is newly done and offers a gift shop and elevator. Some salon style rooms overwhelm with vast numbers of works and leave you wishing a ladder was provided. Photos allowed, NO FLASH.

Definitely a must for any art lovers!,May 2018
Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"I agree with all the positive comments, this is an outstanding museum for several reasons:
**Its got the goods...fabulous art: 9 Rembrandts, 3 Vermeer paintings, several Jan Steen and countless Old Dutch Masters
**Manageable! Spend 2 hours at a leisurely pace and you've seen the best
**Fantastic audio guide. Either use you phone and download the app for free or rent the audio guide for 3.50eu. Explanations are just the right length, informative and often essential to understanding the subtle meanings of some paintings, especially Jan Steen. Also provides pictures of paintings before/after restoration or the landscape of Delft now vs. when Vermeer painted it. Very well done!
**Curated; the art is not only outstanding but the entire setting is wonderful; beautiful building interior. Be sure to check out ceiling and chandeliers.
**Guards-not often mentioned except with they negatively impact a viewing experience. In Mauritshuis the guards were ever present; I appreciate that! Some guests just get too close to the paintings; you need guards to keep an eye on everyone! These guards were present but not annoying or overwhelming. They were approachable and professional. Well done!
**Purchasing tickets was fast and friendly.
Nice café, clean bathrooms although very small, lovely gift shop.
Easy access from train station.
Its all just too perfect! Thanks for the lovely experience!

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"The material on WikiTravel was a bit reserved, but I would say that this is an excellent gallery and well worth the EUR 15 entrance fee. (Or worth the MuseumCard, if you travel to Amsterdam later in your trip.) The collection is exquisite and well organised. The free Android app is the best I have seen, with both pictures and commentary text for all paintings, well organised by rooms, and audio commentary in many languages for many of those. Also, the presentation (furniture, carpeting, lighting more like an upmarket hotel than an art gallery) and the proximity to the seat of the prime minister (across a canal) adds to the experience. I have definitely left enlightened!

Beautiful building housing all those wonderful paintings, busy but with plenty of time to stop and gorp at Rembrandt's virtuosity and Vermeer's precision and handling of light.

The most famous work is the ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". You should reserve 2 hours to enjoy all the works of the museum.

What a delight to be in a small museum that was a former house/mansion after visiting so many large museums! It reminded me of the Frick in NYC. Although there were a couple of high school groups and other travelers, the museum wasn't terribly crowded. While it was crowded by The Girl with the Pearl Earring, I was able to see it up close (stunning!), and it was no problem to see any of the other Vermeers, Rembrandts, Bols, Hals, van Ruysdaels etc. It's a wonderful museum where we spent a delightful couple of hours. BTW, we got the Museumkaart and it made all of our museum visits so much easier.

This museum is small, so not as overwhelming as huge museums like the Rijksmuseum or Louvre. In a 90 minutes or so you can enjoy fabulous works by VanDyck, Rembrandt (The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp), ""The Bull"" by Potter, an extraordinary collection of Dutch still lifes, and the wonderful Jan Steen histories. The descriptions of each painting include English translation. The staff are especially helpful and the entrance fee is more than reasonable. Did not try the highly-rated cafe but it was very busy.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"We took a day trip by train from Amsterdam to Den Haag (The Hague). First of all for those that hesitant to take a day trip by train, it is important to understand that there are two train stations in Den Haag and you want to take the one that goes to Den Haag Centraal. For tourists it is probably safest to pay the small extra fee and buy your ticket(s) at the ticket counter to be sure that you are going to this station and not Den Haag Hollands Spoor (usually abbreviated as Den Haag HS) as it will make for a longer walk. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Den Haag Central to the museum. Be clear as to your route as you will reach an area where the sign for the museum is angled making it difficult to chose the best route; we chose poorly and it added a couple of blocks that was not pleasant in the wind and rain.

The museum is a gem and a must see for anyone interested in Dutch and Flemish art. The museum is a must see for five reasons. First, the outside of the building itself is beautiful and historically interesting, having been originally completed in 1641 by the Governor of Dutch Brazil. Second, the interior of the building is amazing and of interest by itself for a visit. The large home is the perfect backdrop for the collection in contrast to many galleries in other museums that are sterile. Third, the views from some windows of the water, waterfowl and old buildings is stunning. Fourth, the museum is small enough (16 rooms with about 800 paintings) that you will not get overwhelmed by ""too much art"" and you can take time to study and absorb the art. Finally, the collection itself is outstanding. Our favorites were Vermeer's ""Girl with Pearl Earring"" (arguably better than the Mona Lisa), Vermeer's ""View of Delft"" (perhaps the greatest Dutch cityscape?), ""Laughing Boy (Frans Hals), ""The Goldfinch"" (by Fabritius, a pupil of Rembrandt), ""Night Scene"" (Rubens) and the ""Young Bull (by Potter); however, there are many other great painting there. There is also a cafe/restaurant for when you get hungry or tired.

The virtual tour was shorter than other tours Why? Who knows. The altarpiece was magnificent. The rest was lacking in any type of spiritual renewal. Ghent, itself was dirty and many of the shops were closed. Instead of spending the day in Ghent, following the Rick Steves self guided tour, we scurried back to Bruges.

We got off the tram at Gravensteen and walked through the old town ending at Korenlei and Graslei. This entire stretch is so beautiful with lovely architecture, bridges, canals, churches and is also full of cafes, restaurants and various shops. Some of old buildings have the date of construction engraved on the facade. Most of the tourist attractions of Ghent are all in the city centre.

We also discovered in the Koren Market area lots of metal discs embedded on the street which were depicting the lifestyle and culture of the locals of yesteryears.

Unfortunately we had to leave Ghent before it got dark and we could not get to see the lit up town, specially Graslei & Korenlei, which I believe looks stunning at night.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"To start with, I regrettably did not try any of the infamous Belgian waffles while I am here...

Bruges (first, being the furthest) followed by Ghent (before proceeding to Brussels and back to Paris) were my destinations for a day-trip plan from Paris and they turned out lovelier than I have imagined. Do check out my Bruges review if you are doing similar planning. Do refer to my photos taken for a quick summary of the attractions and activities you can cover in a good 3-4 hours worth of exploration, all consolidated in this bite-size review.

Similar to Bruges, I love Ghent for its accessibility, walk-ability and actually found it strange that Ghent is not gathering as much love as Bruges or Brussels.

The crossover of eras, marked by the mixture of historical canals, medieval buildings covered by a well organised public transport system of trams really makes traveling in this city an experience of much romanticism.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Plot an itinerary: You may think this is a 'duh sort' of advice.. While the city is very walk-able and you can't exactly get lost here, the planning of your specific route can be essential for ones that are coming on a tight, half-day trip. It is very easy for you to miss out, with many attractions just around the corners or close-by.

Personally, I used google map to plot out my itinerary and loosely explore around. Definitely set an alarm like I did so you are conscious of the time - to get ready to move on especially if you are on a tight schedule.

2) Navigating: Generally, the mode of getting around in Ghent is by tram. Getting off at Gent-Sint-Pieters station, you would need to take the tram to Korenmarkt and start your adventure there in the center of Ghent.

You can grab a tram ticket from the machines but if you are staying for a few days, you may want to head to Lijnwinkels(kiosks) to grab the 1 or 3 days pass which cost € 7.5 or € 15 for unlimited bus/tram rides on their services. Tram within Koremarkt is especially accessible as it covers routes within the city center that brings you to various attractions readily.

On another important note, ask the locals for the Direction that you should be taking the tram. If you are unfamiliar with the tram system here, the map really was not of much help as I took the tram in the wrong direction and had quite a dilemma as i traveled all the way to the other end.

3) Gears: Dress comfortably, equipped with good walking shoes. Camera is also a no-brainer for this picturesque city.

4) Recommended to do: As with Bruges, try the waffles (while i personally did not have any waffle, I am pretty sure all the waffles here are good). Grab some Belgian chocolates and get on the canal cruise.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,2.0,"The city including its center is gorgeous no doubt and we have been coming here probably >50 times.
The problem today is the mobility if you are a tourist or on business and have to take your car. I have EV which at least allows me to get into the city. Great but why are the few loading spots reserved for shared vehicles only? Secondly there is an ununderstandable system of one ways and restricted areas developed by some kind of genius that even the GPS cannot absorb. Count for at least 100 euro a day in fines ( I suspect this might be the city’s objective in the end). In the end we couldn’t get to the hotel, there was no parking space and when we finally got in and out of an astronomically expensive public lot (vrijdag markt) we ended up getting fines for driving in and out of the parking lot. There must be some local demonish mind acting here? Geraard den duivel maybe ?

So make sure Ghent is part of your next trip itinerary.

Lovely boat trips from a few points in the city will take you on a sedate trip to the city highlights. Lots of wee chocolate shops and plenty eateries and pubs. It’s a student town and lots of them can be seen walking around town carrying books, wearing berets, discussing loudly existentialism versus the benefits of contactless payments on the trams and getting hammered on Belgian beer. It’s not a cheap city but nowhere near the Scandinavian countries. From the railway station get the tram to Korenmarkt and your on the edge of the medieval town. We only used one taxi but thought it was overpriced . The driver didn’t even have the meter running.

Then the right one, but roadworks stoped it from taking us where we wanted to be. When we got there, though, there was no doubt that we had arrived, and that we were right to want to be there.

Beautiful buildings, human scale, open squares, plenty of places to sit, have a beer, and watch the world go by.

We wandered for a while, clicking away with our cameras. This view here, that medieval building there. A castle. A guildhall. A view of the side of a square that could have been unchanged since the 1500s. And churches, churches, churches.

After a while, we started to look for a place to have a drink. No problem finding several of those. We settled on one, just before the rain came. Sat under an umbrella, sipped on our beers and watched the summer-time tourists scurry around.

Before we left, we got very detailed directions from our waitress about how to get back to the station. Across two squares, past old buildings with modern stoes inside, to a tram stop. Back to the station in no time,

A historic town of outstanding cultural significance and natural beauty. Ghent has to be seen to be believed. Every bit as pretty as Bruges and not so far away from Brussels.

The centre is compact and contains most of the main sites you must see. It has lovely old pedestrianised streets ,spacious squares,individual shops as well as chains,

My wife & I parked our car at Brugge station (€3.50 all day) & got the train to Ghent (€12 return). First thing I just say is the train journey is so easy & a great way to get to Ghent, especially from Brugge.
We walked from Ghent station to the centre which took around 20mins (medium pace). We could have got the tram but wanted to walk & soak in the city.
The outskirts appeared to be like any other city & wasn’t much to speak about. However the centre was lovely. The buildings were beautiful & of the same style as Brugge. I will say it was very busy whilst we were there which is annoying as too many tourists just take away from the beauty.
We had a lovely coffee & waffle/pancake on the river, enjoying the autumn sun.
Probably won’t return to Ghent unless another family member wants to who hasn’t been.

We did the morning tour with Katia and really enjoyed it. Right from the start Katia was welcoming, engaging and funny. Her knowledge of Ghent was extensive and she delivered the information in a way that kept one interested, partly because of the fascinating little historical stories she wove into it. She also gave great tips about unusual bars and cheap eating places. We were very glad we did this tour as we felt we had made very good use of our short time in Ghent. Well done Katia!!

Ghent is often over shadowed by the likes of Brussels and Brugge . But it’s as history filled and photogenic as both of those cities , if not more .
I suggest getting off at Ghent Dampoort station, as it’s only 10 minute walk to the historic centre as opposed to the larger Ghent St Pieters station. Which requires another tram to get to the city .
There is plenty to see and also boat trips to be had .

You can buy the card at the Tourist information on Sint-Veerleplein 5, Ghent opposite the Gravensteen castle. The tourist info folk are super helpful and really passionate about their city.

The guildhouses, the wheat market, the Gravensteen (interactive audio guide), cobbled streets, bridges, flowers. Truly worth a visit. The boat trip here is an hour long and worth it.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"This gorgeous medieval little city is jawdroppingly beautiful. A photo opportunity on every corner. The churches, the belfry and the lovely castles are all so very picturesque. An absolute must is to take a boat ride through the canals. Extremely informative and scenic. It also helps if your guide has a great sense of humour as ours did. We were there on a Sunday so not too much was open. There were a few market stalls, a chocolate shop (thank heavens) and quite a few cafes were open. So thankful for the chocolate shop. Couldn't imagine visiting anywhere in Belgium and not being able to purchase one of the things they are famous for....and it was soooo delicious!!!! Our tastebuds for having a party! Getting back to Ghent....a definite must do for all travellers to this part of the world. Wouldn't spend too many days here as I feel 2-3 days would be enough to take in all it has to offer.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,4.0,"We have been reading lots about Ghent and the beautiful old city. Now being here I can confirm it is beautiful but also quite small. Have read about folks coming here every year because there is so much to do...... regret I do not agree. 2 or 3 days at most is all one needs to see all that Ghent has to offer. The altarpiece, the churches, the abbey, belfry and the 2 castles take no more than 2 days in total. Do take a boat ride through the canals for a different perspective and do purchase the 2 day Ghent pass so that you can just wander. The pass also gives you free access to the tram, the water taxi and includes a free 40 min boat ride. It is well worth the 30 Euro cost

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"We stayed in Ghent as a base, then visited Bruges and Brussels from there. It was a great decision. Whilst both those cities have their attractions I loved Ghent more.

Bruges is as beautiful as you expect, but so busy with tourists and expensive... which leaves it feeling a little ‘unreal’. Brussels is a wonderful city but like all very big cities can be a bit overwhelming and impersonal.

Ghent had beautiful architecture, which when lit up at night transforms it to something wonderful. It feels lived in and friendly. Prices are more reasonable and it’s not as crowded. I felt safe exploring.

An important trading and merchant city, the streets and squares are full of historic and characterful buildings, which we enjoyed exploring even though it poured with rain one day that we were there.

There is not just medieval architecture to see. The city has renaissance, baroque and 19th century architecture, with a little from the 20th century and, bang up to date its new Market Hall at its centre.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,4.0,"The city centre are quite lively during the morning and it has a romantic atmosphere at night. Although the center is not nearby the train station, the tram outside the train station can take you to the center. Although, look both way before you cross the road, as I found the tram/ transport a bit chaotic. Also, the team ticket machines doesn't have English. So get your Google translate ready.

Furthermore, I like the iconic churches and historical buildings. It gives a gothic atmosphere at night. Plenty of pub around and you can never say no to Belgium beer.

Although this city are quite student focus, yet there are a lot of tourists around. At no point that I feel out of place.

Food is not a problem as long as you sit down before 9 pm. As most of the place doesn't serve food after that time.

Ultimately, this is a charming city and a place for a weekend trip.

We ended up taking the train to Ghent and spent the day leisurely exploring the city center. It was perfect. We walked through some of the usual tourist standards, but the highlight was really just wandering aimlessly through the market streets, squares, and surrounding neighborhoods. On the September day we visited, our wanderings intersected with a lunchtime concert, booksellers by the riverfront, a political speaker, and a few outdoor cafe rest-stops with great drinks & views of community squares.

Friendly people, great buzz, and easy to explore with or without an agenda. Well worth a day trip, and we'd happily return for some time in Ghent.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"We recently spent several days in Bruges making a day trip to nearby Ghent where we stayed much of the day sightseeing in the City Centre. To be honest, it is best to spend at least a couple days in Ghent to explore the city properly. However, if you have limited time, you can still make a nice day trip here from Bruges.

Train journeys from Bruges take approx. half an hour. Tickets can be easily purchased at the Bruges station using the ticketing machines. Purchase a return ticket so you can save yourself the trouble when ready to return from Ghent. Arriving at the Ghent Station, there is a convenient tram (line 1) linking the station to the city centre. Just exit at Korenmarkt and you are right in the heart of the city centre.

During daytrips to Ghent, you should be able to comfortable manage visits to St. Bavo where you see the famous Ghent Altarpiece, St. Nicholas and the Ghent Belfry (allow extra time if you want to climb) while being able to see other important and impressive buildings around the city centre, such as Stadhuis and the Royal Dutch Theatre.

You can walk over to St. Micheal's Bridge for outstanding views of beautiful rows of historical guid houses that line the canal at Graslei and Korenlei. From here you will also find great views back towards the city centre as well. A browse of Korenmarkt and visit to the medieval castle called Gravensteen are also worth the time if you have it to spare.

Allowing time for lunch, an afternoon coffee break and perhaps some souvenir shopping, the attractions will likely fill up a good portion of your day, especially if visited leisurely. You can then start thinking about your return journey to Bruges. Just return on tram line 1 back to the Ghent Staton and catch the next train going in the direction of Bruges. There are plenty so you won't likely have to wait long.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,If you're planning a trip to Bruge you would do well to extend your journey an additional 45 minutes (if you're driving) to Ghent. Just 90 minutes drive from the Port of Calais it's well worth a trip to. It feels slightly larger then Bruge and is just as photogenic. Many markets and squares and restaurants and bars here - just not many ATMs! We went to a bar that only took cash so had to find an ATM and there only appears to be one. I've never queued so long to get some cash! When the sun goes down the town comes to life in a different way and the bridges and castle/cathedral are lit up beautifully.

We didn't do much of the touristy stuff in the city and I loved the city much more at night. But it was also a rainy January day, so wet and busy can take a lot of charm out of any experience. So I am very happy we went back for the evening stroll. You should too!

Customer service non-existent, even though it is quite expensive to eat in. Cannot get over the fact that in some places you need to pay to use the toilet even as a customer :)
Even if it is a tourist attraction, quite a lot of restaurants do not have menus in English. Pedestrians seem to have fewer rights than bicycle users :)
Waste of time and money for us.Would not reccommend it

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"We went after Christmas, and the whole place still felt full of Christmas spirit. It is such a pretty city and was well worth going to for the new year celebrations. It is not a huge place but there is more than enough to do and see for a long weekend. There are loads of shops, churches, castles etc all of which are very interesting. There are also lots of bars and different beers to try, with all sorts of different levels of alcohol. I can also highly recommend the cuberdons, traditional Belgium candy that comes in purple cone shapes. I bought them from a stall in Korenmarkt and they were little drops of heaven. I highly recommend the Gravenstein castle tour and a boat trip.

So much to see in such a small area. Waterways, beautiful buildings, fascinating history, great food and amazing beers.

We were there for New Year Eve. Amazing fireworks. City fairly closed up on 1st Jan but plenty restaurants open and plenty to see walking the historic centre and Christmas markets.

Van Eyck Mystic Lamb impressive though preferred rear side of tryptic. But the gems are the city's mix of old buildings - grand, impressive and quaint. Stylish shops too.

A visit to Ghent should be high on everyone's bucket list. Great for a short break even when drizzling.

I`ve seen so many picutres of Brugge and heard so many stories of beautiful scenerey and a lovely atmosphere. It is sure true what they say about Brugge. But, it definately goes for Gent as well, if not more! In my opinion: you`d miss out if you don`t visit Gent.

Gent is probably one of the most beautiful cities I`ve ever visited. Spectacular in daytime - Magic in the evening. Don`t miss the beautful scenery and the lovely lights at nighttime along Graslei and Korenlei. This city is a must see and highly reccomended!

We had a choice to visit Brugge for a second time, or Ghent, and the choice we made, to explore Ghent, was well rewarded. To me, it is even more impressive than the admittedly beautiful Brugge. Walking through literally centuries of history, seeing facilities (like the medieval slaughterhouse), buildings (like the centuries old castle, that dates back to 1108) and beautiful canals and streets is a fascinating and worthwhile undertaking. On the way, enjoy some sweet treats ('noses' or Ghentse neuzen), or sit down on the canal bank with Warme (=Warm) William, and tell him your sorrows. You will not regret any of it.

The city itself had a mix of really old buildings with really new or newer buildings.
It's very pretty and the river gives it a calm effect. Maybe because the trams and bikes are not down there.

Some of the attractions are payable and a little on the expensive side for us. €10 each to enter the castle. The cathedral is free and there is so much history in there your head will hurt.

The only downside are the trams and bikes. For a visitor they are a distraction in the city center especially when you are not used to them in your own country. The chances of being run over are pretty high.
Saying all that it well worth a visit especially the cathedral.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"Ghent is overshadowed by its touristy and better known Flanders neighbor, Brugge. With that said, we found the city center and medieval core around the river and castle every bit as beautiful as Brugge and the biggest plus: a lot fewer tourists.

It is a university town and city that doesn't have to rely solely on tourism like Brugge. We based here for 3 days and loved the beautiful, medieval core of the cities center.",Sep 2018
Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"there is a very nice square in the center of Ghent close to St Baafs Cathedral which is worth a visit. There are some cafes each side of the square. There is also the Laken Hall on one side of the square which i believe one can visit and a Church which is not far from the square, which has some very nice paintings inside by some important Flemish artists. The church is also worth a visit if only to see the paintings hanging on the walls.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,1.0,"Whoever the politicians who run Ghent are they need to get their enthusiasm for bikers into perspective! Mankind has been a biped for hundreds of thousands of years and walking is the most natural exercise possible that utilises ALL muscle groups. It is also free of mechanical equipment so no bikes to litter pavements, block doorways, endanger pedestrians. The politicians zeal to woo bikers in Gent and in Belgium has led to cyclists assuming pre-eminence among ALL road and footpath users - hand signals are almost NEVER given to drivers and pedestrians are expected to give right of way even on shopping streets. Lord help us when the young careless bikers of today start driving cars with the same lack of road safety sense that they display daily. Then try arriving at St Pieters train station in Gent - when you've finally found the signs you will have to walk about 800 meters down steep ramps to find the cars under as tunnel. Meanwhile the service vehicles of the utility nationalised companies park right outside the station where the taxis ought to be. In the rain, pulling suitcases on wheels the downward walk is hard but departing means hiking up the gradients. If you are less that fully mobile and fit GIVE GENT a MISS even though it is a beautiful medieval gem. If they don't make you welcome there are many other cities to enjoy!

Fast forward through the early 2000s and huge changes came about. The river was cleaner and more attractive. The city center became car free however, you need to keep an eye out for the trams that pass through. Since it is a university town it has a very special buzz.

We loved everything...the beautiful canals,a castle dating from 1100’s was a block from our door. We visited a couple gorgeous churches and were surrounded by beautiful architecture. The restaurants were vegan friendly & very good. Of course a great selection of beer, chocolates, French fries, waffles!

Now do not get me wrong, do your research and you will find a few good places, but important, DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST.

Netherlands,Canals area,4.0,"Despite what Aussie websites may say, compared to the wonders of Amsterdam the Utrecht canals may come as a disappointment. But, when in Utrecht, the canals area is certainly worth a visit especially because the canals have a special feature. Their banks have two levels. Besides the street level, there is the level of the ‘wharfs’, much closer to the water. In medieval times, traders constructed storage rooms under their houses connected directly to the canal banks, thus limiting the effort needed to load and disembark goods. Now these wharfs have been turned into as many shops, cafes and restaurants. The last time we visited Utrecht, it was raining and there wasn’t much going on, but on a previous visit in the summer some years ago we found the area teeming with life. Sometimes even too much so.

Netherlands,Canals area,5.0,"We visited the canals area south of City Hall on a Saturday in April, and we found it quite crowded with a mid-day three-ring-circus atmosphere (boat rowing and a tightrope walker). It was exciting to hear the arrival of boats even before you saw them with the coxswain shouting orders to the rowers who were variously straining on the oars and pulling them in before going under a bridge. The shops sold items that were unique but not cheap. We couldn't resist entering the shops, but we bought very little. The Oudegracht in this area is narrow with compelling views from the bridges. We feel that the canal area will be as crowded as the Amsterdam canals are today, so it would be good to visit while it's still fun.

It's a great place to eat and drink. Some places have terraces outside right up to the canals edge. Some even have seating areas below road level along by the canal. There is such a lovely, convivial, relaxed vibe about the place.
It's also a real shopping hub and that brings those throngs I mentioned earlier!
The real joy comes in just wandering around the area with no especial plan in mind. Its just so beautiful and should be the first thing you do when in town.

Netherlands,Canals area,4.0,"You immediately observe that the canals in Utrecht are different from those in other old Dutch cities. There are two levels: one close to the water with storage capacity like cellars, the other at street level with housing. The system could only be developed after -by mid 13th century- the authorities were able to control water levels.

Gradually the core of economic activity in the Netherlands shifted westward. 17th Century cities like Dordrecht, Enkhuizen and Amsterdam could handle larger vessels that were able to cross the big oceans. The wharves with cellars in Utrecht look small compared to the VOC warehouses in Amsterdam. Still the system in Utrecht is testament to the creative spirit and technical skills of mediëval Dutch people.

Netherlands,Canals area,5.0,"The Oudegracht, or ""old canal"", runs through the center of Utrecht, the Netherlands. It starts in the southeast of the city. Here the Kromme Rijn (the original main bed of the Rhine river) and the Vaartse Rijn (a medieval canal reconnecting Utrecht to the newer main stream of the Rhine, the Lek) arrive to meet the original moat of the fortified town, and the Oudegracht goes from there into the center of town.

Parts of the Oudegracht follow the original flow of the river Rhine, but there is some disagreement on what parts. The northern part is most likely an early canal (app. 1000) connecting the Rhine section to the river Vecht.

The southern part was started in 1122, after the water level of the Rhine in Utrecht dropped because of the new dam at Wijk bij Duurstede. The ground excavated was used to raise the sides of the canal, to reduce the chance of flooding.

When the city's system of locks was finished in 1275 the water level was constant, enabling the creation of permanently dry cellars and new quays at water level, hence the typical wharfs (Dutch: werven) below street level. Warehouses used to line the canal.

Today many of these warehouses have been converted into restaurants and cafés. Especially those with their terraces at nearly waterlevel are very nice spots to sit, eat, drink and relax watching all the movement above and around you.

You'll love Utrecht!

Netherlands,Canals area,5.0,"Utrecht is a medieval city with deep roots into the times of the Roman Empire. (If you want to know more about that, go and visit Dom Under on Domplein.) Its city centre is demarcated by a circular canal called ""Singel"" (Moat). There used to be a defence wall on the inside of the canal, which almost completely disappeared, but for about half its length (2,5 kms) was replaced by a park (Zocherpark) planted in the mid 18-hundreds by Mr Zocher, a famous (landscape) architect. Its varied and very old trees make for a beautiful scenery which is protected as a national monument. There you can walk over well kept footpaths and you will be joined by joggers and baby walkers.

Inside the circular canal you will find two basically north south facing canals that show Utrecht's history as a trading place, called Oude Gracht (""Old Canal"") and Nieuwegracht/ Kromme NIeuwegracht (""New Canal/ Bended New Canal""). The water (of what essentially is the old track of the river Rhine called ""Kromme Rijn"" (""Bended Rhine"") is adjoined by loading and unloading platforms or wharfs. You will see the warehousing facilities under the roads along the canals called ""werfkelders"" (wharf cellars). On Oude Gracht the wharfs are frequently used as terraces and the warehouses often as café's or restaurants.

The middle part of Oude Gracht forms the heart of the city centre and forms a very dense shopping area with lots of food and drinking places. Lively, even in the worst of weather.

The southern end of Oude Gracht on the eastern side is called Twijnstraat where you will find eateries, and fashion shops alongside local shops. Getting there from the heart of the city, you will pass may quaint bric-à-brac shops, galeries and non-chain shops of varying nature.

When you are tired of the noise and eating smells do go and visit Nieuwegracht and its surroundings, including the Zocher Park I mentioned above. In this area you will enjoy the medieval quality of Utrecht at its fullest. Walk in the direction of Lepelenburg, a public area within Zocherpark. On summer evenings you will find many groups enjoying the weather and a take out meal. Take a closer look at the bandstand. The lower side shows a panorama of the medieval city centre viewed from the circular canal. Above it is a recent one. The originals you can find in the Utrechts Stadsarchief. I should mention that this area is called Museumkwartier, Museum Quarter. As its name announces, you will also find Utrecht's main museums here, including Nijntje (Miffy) Museum.

If you ask yourselves how I know all this: I live here. So ignore any association with a particular visit.

There are nice canals, and some old architecture, but Utrecht is more of an active commercial center. We parked at Westraven P&R outside the city. The €5 parking fee includes tram transit for up to 5 people from the P&R to the central station and return, where we could walk to the old city. It is otherwise a busy city to drive into to park. We visited St Martin's Cathedral (Dom Church), which has impressive architecture but not very impressive decoration. Interestingly, you can easily see that the Catholic icons that once inhabited the Church were destroyed I the 16th century during the Protestant revolt. We opted not to walk up the 450 or so steps to the top of Domtower, but the tower is impressive to look at. There are a few other highlights in Utrecht, such as Museum Speelklok and the Centraal Museum but we did not have the time to visit either. If you have plenty of time visit Utrecht. If not, you might enjoy Rotterdam or Leiden more.

Amsterdam springs to mind as the most famous Dutch ""canal"" city and Delft is worth a visit, but also Utrecht can be proud of its canals. The Utrecht canals are charming and they have the advantage on canals of other cities that they have lower banks, giving access to former warehouses, which almost all are converted to canal side restaurants. Luckily, the subsequent Utrecht councils, which have destroyed so much Utrecht heritage in the last quarter of the 20th century with their ambitious city renovation schemes, have mostly overlooked the canal area, which at a point at the ""Stadhuisbrug"" has an impressive ambiance..

Once the flooding was under control several hundred years ago, the wharves were then converted into warehouses and loading points for boats.

To go round will take you about 1 hour by boat and perhaps 1,5 hour if you have to peddle yourself.
The bridges and the view from the canal is really beautiful. There are many old buildings you can see much better from the canal then when you would walk next to them.

Netherlands,Canals area,5.0,"My memories of Amsterdam are of fun walks with my family along the many canals in this City; the canals had an abundance of ducks and swans, and they and a multitude of birds eagerly awaited being fed by tourists. The lovely architecture, the colorful homes along the canals, the houseboats, the larger tourist sightseeing boats, and the paddle boats all add to the uniqueness that is Amsterdam. One must be alert when crossing the busy streets filled with bicycles, cars and trolley cars; in Amsterdam the traffic has the right of way! Our hotel was centrally located so we could walk to all the fine restaurants, museums, shops and sights; plus the hotel had delicious and plentiful brunches. I loved all the long, narrow, and some back streets with colorful shops on both sides, loved the night life, the openness, the acceptance of what many do regardless. The smoke cafes were interesting and we went into one or two; not my thing, but interesting experience nonetheless. Amsterdam, a most charming and colorful City - a City to put on your must visit list!

Challenge yourself and take a walk up the tallest church tower in the Netherlands, the Dom tower. Rent kayaks for as little as €4, take a boat ride or (dare to) jump into the beautiful canals. After living here for 6 months, the best way to have the full Utrecht experience is to rent a bike! Utrecht is crazy about bikes (if you haven't already noticed), with safe cycle lanes, traffic lights dedicated to bikes and even digital parking...it couldn't be safer! Word of caution: crime is very low in Utrecht but bike crime is extremely high!

My advice:
Ear, drink, bike and be merry!

The canal areas are quite beautiful, the city is very clean with good cafes and bars. The homes around the canals are so beautiful, you can't take anything less than stunning picture.

Utrecht also has great train connections, so you can easily enjoy Utrecht and then take day trips to all the other cities.

The guide was full of knowledge and the tour unlike anything I have done before. We did the Zonneberg Tunnels. If you arrive by car, it is not very well sign-posted, so don't park at the bottom of the hill because there is a car park at the top and lovely old cafe/restaurant with wonderful views/",Aug 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"Very cool to see these passages underneath the city and surroundings. Fortunately, we chose the tour in English, but our tour guide spoke super fast. The pace at which we moved through the caves was also fast, giving little time to do any exploration or ask about some other works of art that our tour guide didn’t address. I think the war tour would have been a bit more interesting than the art one as the art is relatively new in history terms. If you suffer from claustrophobia then this visit is not for you. I suffer a little bit, but asking to hold the lantern (& my husband’s hand who helped me through my initial panic) got my through the first part, and when it opened up to higher ceilings, I was alright. In the end, glad we did it.

All four sites are excellent and well worth your time. All involved a guided tour except the Kazematten Tunnels which was self guided and for that reason not as informative as the other three sites. The caves are not actually caves but mines created by miners mining limestone used for building works. The mines are amazing with many charcoal drawings on the limestone walls. It is also quite cold in the mines with the temp around 11 degrees celsius - great when the outside temp is up arounf 35c to 40c.
This group of mines and tunnels is a must see to further understand the rich tapestry of history that Masstricht has to offer.

In this place there is millions of years of history.
The rocks itself were used nationwide for building houses and making cement.
There have been several major historic discoveries like dinosaurs, drawings and other items.

The caves have played a major role in several wars, during which they were used as shelter, houses and escape routes during WW2.
Traces of battles, and escapes are left everywhere, most interesting beeing the huge crater left behind by French troops who tried to blow up the Fort Sint Pieter above, or the carved names of Jewish people escaping from Maastricht during the 2nd World War.

Not just for us adults of different nationalities but also for our kids who she made sure to involve by having them carry a torch, helping to keep time and count our group members at the start and the end of the tour. Since the kids went in front, they got to decide which direction to take. Something that pleasantly surprised me as it clearly showed that this tour can go in any direction and the tour guides (need to) know what they talk about from any point of these caves.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"My wife and sons (ages 16 and 12) took both the Fort Sint Pieter and Grotten Nord tours.

Both tours started on schedule.

The pace of the tours is very brisk and the routes are well-crafted.

Our tour guide, Willie, was PHENOMENAL. He moved seamlessly between English, German, Dutch and sometimes French. Our tour was designated English, but the majority of the group was German, and Willie went out of his way to include everyone. His knowledge of the fort and the caves and Maastricht and the history surrounding them was incredible. As was his sense of humor and presentation. No questions were asked which he could not answer very thoughtfully. More important than his knowledge of the area and its history was his LOVE for the area. He was passionate about his subject material and that was readily apparent. He loves Maastricht. And I enjoy seeing through the eyes and heart of someone who cares.

I learned a tremendous amount on the tour as did Sara and my sons. Sara has been to Maastricht a few times (this was the first for myself and my sons) and thought the tours as interesting as any of the many other things she has seen and done in Maastricht. My sons absolutely enjoyed the tour...not bored at all due to Willie and the pacing of the tour.

Very interactive tour. Not just a walk and look and listen.

I cannot recommend these tours and Willie enough.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We really enjoyed our ""North Caves of St Pietersberg Hill"" tour of the limestone mines under Fort Sint Pieter. It is chilly and damp, so bring an extra layer of clothing. As stated on their website, the starting location for the underground tour as well as the fort tour is at Luikerweg 71, 6212NH, Maastricht. There is a sign in the spot where your tour assembles. You can buy tickets at the building next to the restaurant or buy them in advance online. (We purchased ours online to be sure the English tour at our desired time didn't sell out.) The website also lists the start times for Dutch and English tours. The tour lasts about an hour.

The mines are very fun all by themselves; they are dark and creepy and sprawling. But it is also fun to see some of the charcoal and etched art on the walls. Our fantastic tour guide, Sander, explained the history of the mines, telling stories of prior users and residents. We even got to see how the blocks were cut and try it ourselves.

I recommend combining the underground tour with the Fort Sint Pieter Tour. Both were lots of fun as well as informative.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,1.0,"I was first there in 1986. It was called the Chalk Caves and the tour was all about how people and the hidden Jews lived there. I saw the small hospital with the beds, etc that the tour guide on 08/2019 said was closed off. I saw underground sleeping areas and eating areas with the actual furniture, etc. it was all about WWII then. They have eradicated the history and made the caves all about an entirely different subject. Pretty sad. But that is what liberals do...eradicate the truth! Very disappointing to say the very least.",Aug 2019
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We are very pleased to have booked the North Cave tour. It had been recommended and we weren’t disappointed.

Our guide, Wim V, was highly amusing and made it all very interesting with stories, dates and facts.

The light at the end of the tunnel was welcoming!!! Great experience.

Definitely a must-see & book, whilst in Maastricht.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We were taken by a very knowledgeable and humorous tour guide from the area of Maastricht who showed taught us all about the history of the tunnels, their dimensions and their usage through out history such as the Napoleonic Wars, the Second World War and even much earlier times before the unification of the Netherlands. Additionally, one can learn about the engineering, intelligence and effort put into building this. It is hard to believe what a farmer is capable of, astounding nonetheless. You also get to see some interesting paintings, while taking an adventurous stroll in the dark.",Sep 2019
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Visited the North Caves today after a quick city stop in the centre. The kids (8 and 10) loved the hour long guided through the tunnels (not actual caves) and the guide was brilliant. We were lucky that we only had 7 in our group and we were 4 of them

Quick fly through the history of the tunnels, hoe the farmers started cutting out blocks of sandstone which was then used to build the churches and walls of the city. Also saw the vault where the Nazis hide lots of artwork during WWII

Couple of things to bite. Have to pay for parking but it’s only 20 cents an hour, and in the tunnels it is a constant 11 degrees Celsius all year round. Only in there for an hour so we did it it’s shorts and T-shirts

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,These are not actually caves but man made tunnels made into the limestone plateau near Maastricht. Underground the rock is soft enough to be cut and completely porous as the well informed guide demonstrated. Once outside and dried it hardens and can be used for building- so much so that there is a 200K network and all entrances except1 are blocked to prevent fatalities which have happened when people got lost inside. Of interest are the wall drawings eg the Dutch royal family.,Aug 2019
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"This was a very interesting excursion. I had done some reading prior to my arrival and so I knew what to expect, more or less. But listening to the guide share while underground provided a different and fascinating perspective. Learning how the underground tunnels had been used over the centuries was enlightening and seeing the various artwork and accounting on the walls was a bit of a surprise.",May 2019

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"These limestone tunnels are worth the visit. You get a nice overview of some of the Maastricht history, and you will be amazed at the efforts of the farmers who worked tirelessly to carve stones for a living! Our guide was humorous, informative, and patient 👍🏻 It was chilly, but not unbearable.

We took the 9 bus from the train station, and the bus driver kindly alerted us when to get off. Then it was a short walk around to the right and up the hill. The Maastricht people were super helpful and friendly 😊

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,To be honest when I originally planned this trip out I did not think it would be as fun. However it was one of the best experiences I had in my 10 day trip to Netherlands. I took a north cave tour with Michael as my tour guide who was very experienced and funny. The entire tour was enjoyable I didn't even realise time had run out. Definitely should try the tours.,Aug 2019
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Gyselle, thanks for helping out on the phone for not only helping us to rebook once but twice ... thanks to you we arrived in a very good mood ... two of the four of us had been here before ... but our guide Wim made it a different experience fro all of us, but a nice one. Being a geologist and being able to easily move a round in a quarry in a wheelchair always is a special treat. For other wheelchairs users it is a bit ""offroad"", and slightly up and down but easier than cobbled stones in the center of Maastricht, some pushing help was greatly appreciated.
It a very nice combination of geology, to see a fantastic section that gave the Maastrichtian geological stage it´s name and culture which greatly influenced the surrounding area.
The ""Dutch-Belgian- Italian-UK-Swedish"" party.
(The only negative thing is getting to the restaurant in a wheelchair, as it is steep and no suitable parking spaces are available at right level, this could easily be arranged the personal we talked too did not seem interested to help at all.)

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I don't want to spoil the fun, so rather than thelling about what we saw, I'll give out some tips:

- Bring a jacket.
- Bring comfy shoes, preferably not white -uneven ground.
- Baby trolleys allowed and possible to move around
- Dogs allowed (at least service dogs, as I saw one)
- Pictures allowed, also with flash.
- Doable for the walking impaired (I myself walk with a crutch)

Our guide was Lukas.

I was disappointed at first when I heard that they weren't actually caves, but rather tunnels, but once we got it and saw and heard about them, I found it fascinating. A great ending to our roadtrip around Holland.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,3.0,"It’s hard to get to the tunnels. We got our tickets on-line and had to take a taxi from downtown (15 Euros) to the underground. On the way back, we had to take a tourist boat back to Maastricht. It costs 17.85 Euros per person. Heard from others that they got a combo of the cruise and underground together. If this is the number one attraction in Maastricht, the city should make it more accessible?

The tour we had was ok. Wish the guide provided more background and history. Glad we only did one tour out of the three.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"My brother is living in Maastricht, and raved and raved about this place. While I assumed something impressive, it far surpassed even his hyperbole.

We went later in the day, and the tours seemed smaller – which was a perk because our tour guide was able to really engage the group. Her name was Tatiana Oliver, and has been guiding tours 27 years in the caves and throughout Maastricht, and impromptu tailored the tour content, which was a delight to experience because we really connected with a truly local voice who was enthusiastically invested in the lore and history of her home. If you get ""Tania,"" you're in for a treat.

The only flaw was how short the tour lasted. You are not at all rushed, but keep in mind these are vast labyrinths with endless tidbits of fascinating history, construction, and lore; you really need a LONG time to comprehend such a magnificent place. It is so fascinating, the entire group felt like they could stay and learn for hours. In fact, when Tania announced the tour was ending, there was an audible disappointed sigh from the group.

Yet, alas, the tours last roughly one hour, and you are not allowed in the caves without a guide. (By the way, it makes a LOT of sense to not allow curiosity adventurers into the caves without a guide, because even in recent years there have been deaths because it is literally impossible to know your way around, and you are in literally hundreds of miles of pitch black. Yeah, so don't begrudge needing to stay with the tour guide.)

Do not under-estimate the chilliness of the caves. It is always chilly down there.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"The caves were first referred to by the guide who took us on a walking tour of old Maastricht, and we felt it had to be followed up. A good value tour combines a bus trip, boat trip and a tour of the north caves. From the point of disembarkation, the walk up to the top of the hill meet our guide (Ruud) was steep and not suited to the less able-bodied. Thereafter, the walk to the caves was flat. We had no idea what to expect, but the next hour was just fascinating as Ruud regaled us with stories about how the caves were originally formed by excavation for building materials. During the Second World War, plans were made to move the entire city underground. We marvelled at Dutch efficiency when we were shown a plan of the underground city which matched the streets and houses above. As we walked through the dark tunnels, we were shown fantastic drawings on the walls and also what would have been chapels and kitchens, had the underground move of the city taken place. The piece de resistance was an underground vegetable garden started by the guides. We have no idea how the guides find their way around the tunnels without passing each other with their groups! This tour is a must-do, and strong shoes together with warm clothing are required to navigate the tunnels safely.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"The tour of the ""caves"" was included with a short boat ride so we were happy to give it a go. And I'm really pleased we did; it was fascinating learning about the history of these mines which date from Roman times. Most interesting of all was finding out how they planned to evacuate the whole city of Maastricht to the ""caves"" in the Second World War. Our guide was excellent and the temperature of the caves was a constant 11 degrees, a welcome break from the blistering heat outside. A jumper or cardigan is a must. Floor surfaces are uneven so you have to take care - they provide a few lamps for visitors. I would highly recommend the hour's tour.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We went to Maastricht for the Andre Rieu concert. We were unsure what else there was to do in the city. However, we wandered past the last remaining medieval gate of the city walls and down to the fort. Right beside the Fort is an entrance to limestone tunnels that have been excavated over many years by the local farmers for the lime stone. However, they became a place to hide in and to smuggle goods and people through during times of war. Precious works of art including The Night Watch were stored there during Nazi occupation. Our tour guide, Vim V was excellent and very entertaining. Be sure that you book the tour in the right language. We also toured the fort with the same guy.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"The tour of the cave takes about an hour. It is the first cave I have visited that is open to the public and has no lighting. The group received a total of three small lamps from the guide and the recommendation to stay close together, because in the darkness one can easily get lost in the several hundred kilometers long corridors. The ground was very uneven, the ceiling partly very low, so that one had to be careful not to hit the ceiling with one's head. As usual in caves, it is cold there, the humidity is quite high.

Despite these shortcomings, the visit was fun and very informative. The relaxed and funny manner of the guide, who also addressed children in such a way that it was interesting for them, deserves to be emphasized.

So down into the tunnels we went. And what a fantastic tour. Our guide was entertaining and informative and lucky for us, knew his way around the maze of tunnels like the back of his hand. At one point he switched the torches off - and it’s the first time in my life I’ve experienced complete and utter pitch darkness.

There were 2 lanterns being carried during the tour..quite spooky but in the best possible way..parts of the cave are quite low if you are tall and the ground is uneven in places so wear comfortable shoes..it was quite cool as well. Would definitely recommend this tour..it was a highlight for me😊,Feb 2019

Me and my wife had limited time in Maastricht and decided to visit underground of Maastricht. We learnt a lot about history and had really good time. The guides were super nice and they answered all our questions. The group was around 25 people and this was perfect size. This experience was quite exciting and sometimes misterious. It took around one hour.

We saw underground chicory field. It was amazing to see. There were very small bats but all sleeping.

We started at 12:30 with fortress and finished around 15:30 with mines. Both of our tour guides (Ed and Wim) had very specific, funny and entertaining way how to present the facts and make the tour great.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"We did the combo tour of the fort and the caves. Both are different, so while you're there you might as well do both. We had a different guide for each, but even though they must have done the same thing a lot of times, it felt fresh and spontaneous.

On both tours we learned things we didn't know, and about 1h15m per tour is not too long to get bored.

From the city centre, it's about a 15 minute walk.

We really wanted to do the Underground tour, we weren't too bothered about the Fort at first. We were very wrong. Both the Fort Tour (done by Guide Marcel) was excellent. He was really passionate about the Fort and Maastricht in general. Excellent tour!

The caves tour was done by Karen (We think that was her name), Karen was mad, good mad. She let us all walk through the dark and showed us the bunker which was excellent. She was very knowledgeable with the right amount of humour.

We'll be back next time we're in Maastricht.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"We arrived on the last Friday in September for a 12:30 English language combo-tour. This cost €12 and included a tour of the Fortress followed by a tour of the North ‘Caves’ (Actually old limestone workings). Since we hadn’t got a car, we accessed the fortress via Bus 9 which left Vrijthof Square and dropped us on Mergelweg at bus stop Maastricht, Sint Pietersberg in around 15min.

Having alighted the bus, we expected to see some ‘tourist’ sign showing where the fortress was, but alas. Thankfully bus passengers and the driver gestured the route up when they saw us looking lost.

Anyway it’s a short stroll up a mild slope until you reach the ticket booth (which is maybe 50m to the left of the Fortress, adjacent to a cafe/restaurant). We’d already bought our tickets from the downtown Tourist Information Office.

So, we waited for the bell and then congregated by the brown ‘Fortress’ signpost. At this point, Joe, our guide for the hour or so, introduced himself.

The tour itself was great and involved an initial chat outside the early 18th century structure, before entering through a locked door, then heading down steps/through tunnels under the dry moat to the first internal chat.

I must say, the whole experience might have been embellished by some tour guide-operated sound effects, such as distant drumming or cannon fire? We also concluded that as well as seeing the various cannons, it would be great to also see a musket, complete with loading paraphernalia.

We had about 20min between tours, which was not quite enough time to get food, so maybe Maastricht Underground should consider giving more time in-between tours, say 45min?

The charcoal drawings in the caves were fantastic, and the secure wartime art vault was fascinating too. Just an idea, but the 'cave' experience might also be enhanced if some of the branch tunnels were subtly lit so as to amplify and give a feel for how extensive the system is. The 70m 'total darkness' section was cool.

All in all a great few hours exploring subterranean Maastricht, and many thanks to Joe for the passionate, humorous, informative and perfect English tour.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Visited the fort and the caves Sept. 16, 2018. The fort guide Willy was awesome. He filled the 45 minutes with super interesting of stories, knowledge and humor. Willy has a crystal clear line of logical reasoning, which made the stories/knowledge very easy to understand and digest. Stories/knowledge included why the fort was built here, how it evolved over time (mainly due to French assaults), how the soldiers defended the fort, why there were 6 holes (2 heights, 3 directions), how to reload a cannon, and some basic info on a howitzer. If all this reminded you of bad memories of school, then Willy also had great sense of humor. (I can even remember a couple of jokes a week from the tour, e.g. We are at 15x meters above sea level!! (which is a big deal in the Netherlands.)) Willy is one of the best tour guides I have met. Super fun.

The cave portion was interesting too. It is surprising how many things were hidden in the caves. Tour guide Kitty also gave us a chance to walk in the dark, which was fun and terrifying at the same time.

In sum, it was fun. Wear comfortable shoes, and be prepared for dark environments. The caves were cold (~12C) so be ready. Also, if you are travelling by public transportation, it takes around 10~15 minutes to walk up the hill from the closest bus stop, so if you are leaving from Maastricht main station, then leave at least 45mins time to get there.

The guided tour through the caves was also very impressive, but this group was too large for my taste. This meant we had to wait a lot for people who got behind or who wanted to take pictures. Our group also included some children and other people who didn't understand English, so the explanation sometimes got lost because they talked through the guide's story.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"The Maastricht Underground tunnel system is located by the Fort of St. Peter just south of Maastricht. There are Dutch and English guided tours with a combined Fort/Underground ticket at 10.40 Euros per adult.
The Maastricht Underground is a man-made labyrinth consisting of 80 km of tunnels, which was created over the centuries, for extracting blocks of limestone to be used in the construction of buildings. People having lived here during troubled times, Napoleon has visited it and it once housed the Dutch national art treasures during WW2 (The Vault).
When we entered the Underground it was wonderful as the temperature was a cool 11°C compared to a hot +32°C outside so I was happy to be there. The guide had a lamp with him to lead us with a person from our party also having a lamp at the back of the group to make sure no-one got lost. The guide pointed out all the art, inscriptions and graffiti that adorned the corridor walls along the route. We were also shown the methodology by which limestone was mined and transported to the surface and then we visited ""The Vault"" where the Dutch national treasures were stored during WW2.
Our guide was excellent in giving us plenty of historical information and stories about its past. This was a thoroughly enjoyable visit.

We also enjoyed the Underground but if we had also had Chantal for that tour (unfortunately she had another group), we know that the experience would have been even more enhanced.

Each tour is about an hour and indeed a warm jacket is needed in the caves. I felt sorry for the two small boys that were in shorts and t-shirts.

The Fort focused on the historical significance of the Fort and how it was built. The Underground focused on the history and painting that were on the walls.

The guide was excellent (thank you so much Joe 315!) and brought the history of the caves to life for us and our kids (ages 8,10,11 and 13). Bring a warm sweater even if it’s boiling hot outside. Highly highly recommend this tour.",Aug 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I really liked my visit there. I didn’t expect anything but really enjoyed the tour.
It’s very interesting to know how they built the cave and learn all history about it. Make sure you wear closed shoes and long sleeves
It gets really COLD when you go deeper.",Aug 2018

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Both tours were absolutely excellent and I would recommend them to anyone- young and middle aged - we spent all afternoon there and had an amazing introduction to the History of Maastricht .
We booked them both after seeing them on Trip Advisor, but did find it impossible to actually book on line and ended up calling on my mobile.",Aug 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Visited the Maastricht Underground last week with my friends during our trip around Netherlands and really loved the experiece. Learned many new things, cooled down a bit and experienced the true mysterious magic of the underground.
Shout out to Eric, who was our guide and did a really good job!",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Really interesting walk through the tunnels with cool guide Erik. Loads of new information and very impressive guidance.
I will just recommend taking jacket with you, inside is around 10°C :)",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"In the middle of a heatwave we went down into the Maas tunnels ably guided by the informative guide Win V. The tunnels are 11° all year so they were great in a heatwave, but perhaps bring a jacket otherwise. A very interesting history. And slightly unnerving walk in pitch black. Recommend ✌️",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"A 5-10min upslope walk is needed from the pier to the tour meeting point if you are traveling there on the boat tour. The tunnel has lots of history and our tour guide, Edwin L conducted a very engaging tour. Recommended if you are in Maastricht.",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,Maastrich underground was interesting. It can be chilly so bring a sweater Our tour guide was very good. The history of the area and how it came about was fascinating. The pictures on the walls are cute. Be sure to stick with your guide. Two elderly ladies were at the end of the group and couldn’t keep up. They did finally find us. We did the joint tour with Fort Sint Pieter. A joint ticket works out cheaper than doing them separately and they are in the same location. I recommend both. If you have time for only one do the fort.,Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We were here on 23rd July and had a really good tour of the man made tunnels by Chantel. The place is pretty amazing underground with nearly 8,0000 tunnels and you really get a sense of how hard people worked on their construction. Highlight for me was the vault where important paintings were save in WW2. A lot of the experience was down to the guide Chantel, excellent",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"Combination tour of Maastricht man-made caves and fortifications
Quite a long walk out of town if on foot and up the only hill in South Holland!
Cafe on site selling expensive bottles of water
Chantelle led an interesting tour of the man-made caves, in English
Tour is ok for all ages with reasonable mobility - some paths are a little slippery and some bending is required but nothing is too arduous
Take a jacket - it’s cold in the caves!
Tour lasts approximately one hour.
Joe led a small tour of the fort in English - tours in other languages are available
Joe has extensive knowledge of the strategic political and military history of Maastricht which made the tour relevant and interesting
We are in out 60s and we found both tours very interesting
Families with kids may get more from the cave tour as Chantelle makes it fun for them, especially when all the lights go out!

Recommended: combined tickets with Fort Sint Pieter.",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"It's advertised as 'caves' but in reality you are taken underground into old limestone mine. Our excellent guide Bas (da best!) takes you through this maze of purposely dug out tunnels, and explains in a fun way the century old history behind this mine; from the Romans, to World War II, till what's been going on in the mine recently. Oh so interesting, and definitely worth a visit. You can combine it with a visit to the fort too. That's what we did. But if you only have time for one, I recommend to visit the limestone mine. Oh, and wear good shoes (it can get a bit bumpy) and bring a light jacket; it get's a bit cold down there. At the premises is also a restaurant.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Today we took the kids tour for kids aged 4-7 with tour guide Richard. Our 10-year old daughter with Down syndrome, who will usually not go anywhere near anything dark, was immediately comforted by Richard, who took her by the hand and led us into the cave. The kids enjoyed the tour a lot and also all the questions from curious parents were answered by Richard with ease, as he has a great deal of historical knowledge.

If you're looking for something to do (with or without kids) around Maastricht, a cave tour with Maastricht Underground should be high on the list !

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,We spent a mesmerising time under the hills anyway. Excellent guided tour through the north caves to learn the story of limestone mining in Maastricht.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,Visited the tunnels whilst in Maastricht and had George as a tour guide. Found this very enjoyable not quite what we expected.

Our guide George was very informative (and entertaining!) and he did a great job of sharing the history of this “cave” and the events that have taken place there. Was so glad I had read reviews that suggested bringing a jacket as it gets a little chilly. Extremely well priced and well worth an hour of our time. After our tour, we enjoyed a nice lunch at the chalet - good food, reasonably priced. Definitely recommend!",Jul 2018

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We booked this at the last minute as were so pleased we did. Lots of info on the boat, they dropped us off at the underground, which is a must do experience. It is a bit of a walk from the meeting point to the underground ‘caves’. It was really hot weather when we were there early July 2018. Lots of history. Our guide was very good. After the tour we had lunch at the restaurant. Lovely food. It was lovely to see that lots of people were having lunch or just a drink and no one was on their mobile phone sitting opposite each other! They were all engaged in conversation!",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,2.0,"We booked online for the Combo caves and fort. Upon arrival 50 mins prior to the tour starting we checked with tour office as to where to go for the combo tour. We then sat down and ordered lunch that took 40 mins to arrive. We scoffed down lunch and met at the meeting time at 2pm as instructed. The same man from the tour office met us at the meeting point and He said what tour to which I replied we were on the English tour, he told us to follow the guide and pointed in the direction of the English guide. The caves were very nice and we enjoyed the cave tour. We then reported back to the tour office to confirm the meeting point for the second part of the tour and were advised to meet in the same area to which we did. Upon arrival there was no English Fort tour only caves. We reported back to the same man in the office who said bad luck it was your fault you went on The wrong tour (even though he sent us on that tour) we can’t help you and we do not do refunds, end of story!! Rude and unhelpful beware when booking this tour!!

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"The master of storytelling, our guide Chantal brought the history of Maastricht alive for us. Learned about the origination of the amazing mass of underground tunnels, how people lived, the history in the limestone from prehistoric times, the salvaging of art during WWII and the discovery of dinosaur bones that supported Darwin’s theory. A must see in Maastricht, bring a fleece as inside temps are 12-14C, had folks w/ canes & in wheelchairs able to navigate. Walk in the total darkness was eerie & exciting. Thanks Chantal!!",Jun 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"The underground caves are actually more a set of hundreds of man made tunnels, part of a quarry.
The tour takes an hour with a guide that gives explanations on the place and it’s history. Our guide was great, unfortunately I don’t remember his name ( something like Jerald or jack:)).
He had great stories. The sketching on the walls are really impressing.
The temperature is around 10-12 degrees Celsius, during our visit it was very hot outside so the cool environment was nice, but recommend to take a jacket.

If you are claustrophobic keep away this is not the place for you!

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"To start with i had read a lot of good views about it and they all were true. The visit to this cave is must .
If you want to go by train then drop at Maastricht station from there take a bus route 9 though you can ask the bus driver also they are so helpful will tell you all the details . From taxi it will cost 30 or more euro from Maastricht station to the cave. So it's better to take a bus the whole day pass cost 6 euro I think you can take any bus the whole day.
There is an excellent resturant right at the gate of the cave which serves delicious food.
There ceaser salad is amazing. I suggest you eat after the tour relax and enjoy the place.
There is a view point also walking from the cave that also is a must see. You can ask the ticket person he will guide you where to find the place. So if you are late and next group time is after 30 mnts you can see the place.
Over all a must visit to these caves.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We had a really good time visiting the underground tunnels. There's an English tour everyday at 2PM. Our guide Jake was knowledgeable and passionate throughout the tour. Each tour is unique depending on the tour guide. We got to see the cave arts and the places where local farmers hid during the Napoleonic wars. Jake provided excellent explanation on the history of the tunnels and added a lot of colour to local history. All in all highly recommend if you are around in Maastricht. It's a 30min walk from the town center area. You can rent a bike for the day for 5 to 10 euros at the train station if you want to bike there and explore the surrounding areas. The prices for the tour are very reasonable and definitely more than worth it!

Firstly, a shout-out to our tour guide Chantel (not sure how to spell) who did a wonderful job at keeping us laughing and entertained through the 1 hour cave tour. The tour consists of basically heading 30m+ under ground and wandering through the tunnels. You'll see artwork and hear many stories of when the systems were used. Tip: bring a jacket as there is a constant temperature of 11 degrees Celsius which will likely be cold for most individuals in a shirt. Otherwise, enjoy!",Jun 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"We were too late for the south caves and we thought that it would not be possible to see the caves. We booked a river cruise and were pleasantly surprised when they gave us the option of deisembarking to see the South caves instead. Edwin the guide was wonderful and knowledgeable, and gave us many interesting stories about the history of the caves. Experiencing the total darkness was great as well.
We came to know that it was possible to book a combined boat/cave ticket only after we reached the caves. The tourist office and the cruise ticket office need to be more proactive in giving full info to visitors. Would strongly recommend",May 2018

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I highly recommend going on a tour here. We had an awesome tour guide named Bas who was from the Netherlands, but gave the whole tour in perfect English. He told us all about the history of the ""caves"" and how the French came in and tried to take them back but they ultimately stayed with the Dutch. The coolest part was when he had the people in the group that were holding the lights shut them off so there was total darkness. The limestone / flint walls blocked out the sound so there was total silence and darkness for about 2 minutes before he had the lights turned back on. It was a very fun and unique experience that I will not forget with my friends. If I return to Maastricht in the future I would absolutely go on this tour again!

We were not expecting to see the place where 800 works of art from Dutch museums, including Rembrandt's Night Watch, were hidden during WW2! Amazing.

She explained the history of the grotto and surrounding area. The guide had a really good feel of what people wanted to know. She asked if we would like to walk in the dark, by just following and touching the walls. The experience was unbelievable. This is definitely a must do tour if you are in Limburg. The cafe at the entrance to the grotto has a great variety of food and drinks at reasonable prices.",Mar 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We did both the Fort and the tunnels (English tour). The guides for both portions were excellent and both provided lots of details and historical context. Sadly I did not write down their names.

Great views from the Fort but footing can be tricky.

It was quite hot outside but cool in the tunnels. Liked the art produced on the tunnel walls. We saw Bunker 9 where paintings were hidden from the Nazi. And our guide did the walk in the dark for our group.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"This weekend I've attended a combined tour of Fort Sint and the surrounding underground caves. it takes approximately an for each tour. and small break in between if you decide to participate in both since the prices are not that high comparing the quality of the tours. Both tours are amazing i have to say the underground caves tour was really informative and interactive. Our guide was in his late 40-50, so he really had tones of information back-up stories.
One thing is that the tickets are not refundable but interchangeable, which means if you came a bit later due to traffic or bad navigation, upon your reservation presentation the Museum team will provide you later options. which means if you missed your tour by few minutes you can still take later ones. Great service from the team!

Additionally there is a great Cafe that seats on the hill and having a small snack or coffee break with some traditional Dutch Bakery will make your day even more satisfying.
if that was not enough if you follow the singes and pavement road into the park zone away from the town in 1km 10min you will reach Limburg sightseeing were you get an astonishing view from the hill on the limestone excavation sight! you can look from a platform on top or go down the stairs along the hill!

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"This is the second time I have taken the cave tour but added the fort this trip since my husband was with me this time. We had a female guide (sorry I don't remember her name). She was very knowledgable about the fort and its history. The cave tour was good, but having taken it before, I was waiting for our guide to have everyone turn out the lights and walk together in complete darkness as well as visit ""the vault"" Unfortunately, our tour did not get to experience either of these experiences. There was another tour in the cave and they passed us to do these and we went a different way. The caves are really interesting to visit and our guide did a nice job. However, if you want to experience walking in complete darkness and visit the vault ask your guide in advance. I was disappointed that my husband didn't get to have these experiences.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We had to travel almost 3 hours to get to Maastricht, and this tour was the main reason. It did not disappoint! We did the tour of both the fort and the underground, and had Paul J. as our tour guide for both. I'm so glad we did! He led the tour with humour, energy, and was keen to make sure we had a great time.

The fort is impressive, and feels like a step back in time, but the underground is the star of the show. Drawings etched in charcoal are scattered around the cavernous pathways through the stone, and it's surprising how many interesting things there are to see and do in the caves.

A highlight was when we were given the chance to walk a corridor without any light, experiencing 100% darkness (unlike anything you'd experience above ground).

Great value, and a must see if you're in Maastricht!

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"My parents in law did the tour last year and strongly recommended it, so on a icy cold and sunny Sunday we hopped on the boat to go and see the caves. It was a nice 20 minute boat ride on the river Maas and a short walk up to the restaurant where the guided tours to the caves departed. It was so worth going there! A fantastic guide ~ Dank je wel Richard! ~ who made the tour very informative and also entertaining. As well as my parents in law ( from New Zealand), we strongly recommend this unique experience! Tot Zins and greetings from a Kiwi and a Bavarian :)",Feb 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"This was definitely one of the best guided tours I've ever had! I visited the North Caves and Fort St.Pieter. Our guide, Paul J., was extremely professional and very entertaining. He made sure we had a wonderful experience and got to ask all the questions we wanted about each site. His jokes helped make the historical facts he told us very memorable. It was a great atmosphere, and despite being a big group, we got the chance to learn a lot and enjoy the tour. We even had the opportunity to experience a few minutes of complete sensory deprivation in the underground caves. It was pretty intense, but really worth it! I definitely recommend this tour with Paul J. You haven't really seen Maastricht until you explore these sites.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We popped in on a flying visit to see the Fort and caves as they were Maastricht's number one destination. Both the Fort and the caves lived up to expectations. Our first tour was of the Fort and David our guide was very entertaining and obviously loved showing people around. We got a full explanation of the history in English and you get to go through the whole fort from bottom to top ! Next we moved on to the Caves and again we had a fabulous guide called Gerard / George (not quite sure why he had 2 names but he was lovely and again very entertaining!). We went underground and again the tour was very interesting and a little scary at times. We went with our 7 and 12 year old boys and neither of them were scared even when we had a planned total blackout (you don't need to do this bit if you don't want to but it was well worth the experience!) The stories were fascinating and I would highly recommend doing both tours and in that order ! Thank you David and Gerard for making our Maastricht visit so memorable !

In here you can know a bit of history of the region, physics, art, geology and even biology, in a completely different environment.
My guide was Miriam: super wise and fun!
I definitely recommend it!",Feb 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Willy was our tour guide and he made the experience very worthwhile with some comedic relief in English. There was so much history about the tunnels, which are over 800 years old, that it is helpful to have some background information before going on the tour. Walking through the tunnels in complete darkness for a short period of time was very interesting and really made the experience exciting as you walk a centimeter a minute (seemingly) in total darkness. I wish there had been more lighting because around every turn there was something interesting to see— a collapsed tunnel, charcoal art and huge cavernous ceilings. Definitely worthwhile, especially if you make the most of the guide and ask a lot of questions.

The guide was a lovely Dutch lady in her 60s. Seemed a bit crazy.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We almost missed this attraction because our Air B&B host thought it was something ""for children"" which wouldn't be interesting -- how wrong! There are very few places in the world which offer an extensive network of underground caves, let alone well-maintained and bursting with history. Don't miss this! The tours are an easy 90 minutes with reams of historical information provided by knowledgeable guides, but, just looking around as you walk the paths is enough of a marvel given the breadth, vastness and age of the space and subterranean galleries.",Jan 2018

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"This was my third visit and not one tour was the same. Every time a different route and new information and stories. If you had to listen to all the information at once, you would be down there for many hours. It was a complete surprise to see witlof and mushrooms growing in the caves and to learn that they grow them for the restaurant.
Our guide Eric was very informative, and he nearly had me jump out of my skin with his bat story. I will definitely be back next time I am back in the Netherlands.
Cheers, Gabriele, Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2018
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"Well-spoken English-speaking tour guide (his name was Peter?). I thought the group size was rather too large since we made several stops in the cave to learn about the history. The group was too big that I could barely see anything, so it may be better to have a limited size of the groups.
The tour itself took about an hour and I came out with a good sense of the history that this town offered.

Some of the paths are uneven, so I recommend wearing a pair of flat shoes.

Must do :)

Simply put, we were shown an array of interesting parts of the fort and caves* with a knowledgeable and pleasant guide who explained a great deal about what we were looking at and why it came to be like that. Ed [for we think that was his name] expertly managed the experience so that we learned a lot of interesting points while making us feel engaged too. Most of his jokes were funny too ;)

Overall, a nice experience and the geology and history are fascinating too.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"After visiting so many European towns, there are only so many churches and museums you can see before they all blend together. The caves, tunnels actually, in Maastrict were really different and interesting. It's a nice, but not too strenuous walk, you learn a little history, see some beautiful drawings and do something completely different. Our guide, Paul, was very nice and knowledgeable. It was fun and I highly recommend a visit.",Dec 2017
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I took this tour with my 2 kids (11 and 13) and had a blast. Our tour guide (Paul J) was quite a character, with a very funny sense of humour. The caves are spectacular, and he did a very good job of telling us all there is to know about them.

When I came to post this review (because I had such a blast!) I noticed a few 1-star reviews, which mostly centred their complaints on the lack of english tours and lack of signage. The management of this tour clearly has listened to the feedback, as there were signs showing where to meet your group; and at the start they divide the groups into 2 or more - at least one to go with a dutch-speaking tour-guide, and at least another one to go with an english-speaking tour-guide. In our case, they needed 2 english speaking tour guides due to the size of the group that required english as the tour language.

If you can, make sure you get Paul J as your tour guide - you won't regret it!

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We weren't sure whether to visit this, as we had little time in Maastricht, but decided to do so. It was a great decision and I fully recommend a tour with Maastricht Underground even if you only have one day there.

There are more types of tours. We only did the North Caves (probably the best choice for first time and little time to spare, because they are closer to the town and more easily accesible), but you can also combine it with the St. Pieter Fort or do the Zonneberg Caves, which also seem to be really interesting.

The ""caves"" themselves are impressive through the size and appearance, but also through the art in there, but what makes the experience is so special is the tour itself (not that you could go there alone anyway). Our tour guide, Katja (really hope I remembered the name right), was funny and great and told us some amazing stories. It was impressive to see how much has been going on in those catacombs over the time. The tour takes one hour, but it's so interesting that it feels as much less.

I would definitely do another tour with Maastricht Underground and, actually, I would even pay for doing the same tour again. I think even people not so fond of history will love it. Just remember to book online to be sure you get a spot and, if you go in the summer, to dress a bit thicker.

The tunnels are incredibly extensive, and inaccessible without the tour. Each tour is different, so you can go several times and see different areas; if you are interested in something specific - WWII history, a particular piece of artwork, etc. - tell your guide before the tour!! My mother, who is very claustrophobic, was with us, and she had no problems- the tunnels are spacious and several stories tall - we simply skipped the opportunity to experience total darkness with the rest of the group! Plan in advance for this trip if you don't have a car - you must take a boat from downtown there and back. Boat tickets must be purchased from the ticket office in advance (not available for purchase on the boat!) The boat trip was lovely and informative, although in only 3 languages (Dutch, English, German.) The walk up from the water to the cafe and cave tour is very steep!! If you can, leave time before or after to eat at the cafe overlooking the water. Yummy cafe fare, beautiful view, and when we visited, there was live music from the Jazz Festival.

Both tours are interesting and informative, and the tour guides are extremely knowledgeable.

I took the Caves Tour in August 2017 and was surprised by the number of tunnels and how extensive they are. The tour included an explanation of when and why the tunnels were created and how they’ve been used since. I’ll say no more -- no spoilers in this review.

Our guide has been giving tours at the Caves for over 20 years and knows the history well. During the Caves tour, she doused the lantern so that we could experience total darkness. It was a little unnerving but fascinating.

Very impressive both attractions, it is great to see how the caves were built and how people used to live there as well as to understand better how the fort worked during the many tries of invasion to city of Maastricht. Timewise is excellent, both will take somewhere between 3 and 3.30 hours which is still under the tolerable limit with children",Aug 2017
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"We enjoyed a very good tour of the North Caves in English. The guide was knowledgeable, able to answer all questions, and kept the tour moving smoothly.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,I went on a tour of the underground tunnels (you can only go as part of a guided tour now) and I have to say it was a very interesting and informative tour. We were underground for about an hour and our guide was very knowledgeable. There were tours in English and Dutch (I went on the English one). He price was very reasonable at 6.50 euros with an option to buy a combo ticket for the fort as well (slightly more expensive). I found it easy to walk to from the center and reasonably well sign posted. Well worth a visit.,Jul 2017
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I have lived in Maastricht for three years now, and although the city is beautiful and lovely there are not a lot of great tourist things to do. Ended up going to the ""caves"" (spoiler alert, they're technically not caves but you'll have to go there yourself to figure out what they actually are!) with a bunch of exchange students in an attempt to share some of the city's history and culture. It was INCREDIBLE, and SO COOL. The guided tour was a mix between hilarious, interesting and even solemn at times. Being so far below the ground in complete darkness was a strange, exhilerating experience. The group was a mix of parents with their little children, teens and students in their 20s, and it was fun for everyone.

We had to take a 10 minute boat trip over the Maas to reach the caves, which gave us a beautiful view of the river and some of the city's older buildings. This is especially nice if it's nice weather and you can sit out on the deck. It's a short walk from where the boat drops you off, very scenic and probably one of the few mountains (hills?) in the Netherlands.

Bring a sweater or a coat, it gets pretty chilly regardless of the season!

The boat has an English time for tourists, but it's not necessary as it is a short ride (10min there) and we were sitting outside so we didnt hear much of the descriptions. The tour guide in the caves was great, informative, and patient with some annoying tourists in our group. It was WAY more interesting than I expected-a real highlight. The restaurant by the caves-overlooking the river-was good. Our B&B host recommended having the Vlaai (Fruit pie). I'm not a dessert person but it was SOOOOO good!",Jul 2017

We didn't know anything about it going in and it ended up being the highlight of our day there. Remember to bring warm clothing because it's 11 degrees (Celsius) down there, and quite humid. It was really interesting, we were under the impression that it would be regarding its use as a WWII shelter but ended up being much more varied (and interesting) would definitely recommend.

Would definitely recommend a visit.,Jul 2017

Quite different from the most you must I have been. Informative and absolutely unique. The cave and the paintings where just great. The final walk in the dark was just a great finish.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"Originally this was an extensive network (over 200 kms) of mining tunnels. Local farmers dug the tunnels and carved out blocks of limestone for their own building material and also to sell. During the war these tunnels were used to hide refugees (including Jews), and was a safe passageway into Belgium. A massive vault was build to hide 750 art treasures (including ""Night Watchman""), and keep them from being ransacked. More recently artist were commissioned to do charcoal paintings on the wall to make it more interesting for tourists. Our guide Justina was fabulous and made the history come alive. Do take a coat for the tour, even though it's only an hour, it becomes quite damp and chilly.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"We took the combination tour (caves + fort). We started with the caves -- well actually they are tunnels and not caves - and I can say it was petty impressive and very entertaining. The tour lasts about an hour and our guide, Matthew, was very commited to the task and he made the tour very pleasant.

You can't miss this visit when you are in Maastricht. If you have a lot of time, you can also combine the visit of the tunnels with the Fort, but honesty, you won't miss that much if you don't visit the Fort. Sorry to say but the hour of the tour is way to much for what you will get to see inside. Half an hour would be more than enough.

Tip: Even if it is summer and warm outside, bring a jacket with you to the tunnels. It's 11°C inside and 98% humidity.

It goes without saying, but if you are a bit claustrophobic you may have a little hard time inside the tunnels for an hour. Try to relax, the experience will be worth it :)

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"These are tunnels made by the miners that are not only well preserved but give a spooky feel. Our english guide, Math made the tour entertaining and also informative. A small experience of how it would be in the tunnel without the lights was a good experience.

It is a deal to get the combi ticket to the fort and the caves. Only guided tour tickets are available for the fort and on a busy day, this runs out fast. Since the tickets to the tour are limited, would suggest to book this online.

If you are short of time, you can just take the cave tour that takes about an hour.
If you are in Maastricht, will definitely recommend this one.

The caves are incredible. I didn't realise just how huge the caverns were and the length of tunnels. It's like being inside a pyramid in Egypt.

Parking was very busy but we expected it. So parked down the road in a residential area.

You can organise parties and other kinds of get-togethers in the St. Pietersberg caves. During the Second World War they were used as hiding places and a place of storage. The Mosasaurus, Maastricht's very own ichthyosaur (sea-dwelling dinosaur) was found here, its bones kept in the local Natural History Museum in the city. The geology of the caves is fascinating too, consisting chiefly of the soft marl stone deposits from ancient oceans. There is much artwork, from relief scuplture to charcoal drawings to be admired. Mushrooms are culitivated, and you may even come across the odd bat colony, within the labyrinthine passages.

Because we were a quick group he was able to take us to 'de kluis', the former keeping-place of all the Dutch national art treasures during the second world war. He showed us where they used to keep De Nachtwacht and explained the storage system to us. He was funny and very well informed and made this tour worth every euro, even to a poor student. Would've paid much more for this! Keep in mind it is a bit spooky, especially when your guide turns off all the lights to illustrate his story. Great illustrations on the walls, and very interesting historical aspects to them. Definitely recommend! Absolutely loved it.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,"Before visiting DAF Museum I was not so sure how good it could be compared to my experience visiting several Transport Museums in different countries. I must confess, I was completely mesmerized by seeing DAF Museum! With family, this could be a highly recommended half day trip to this museum. It is very conveniently located close to the city center. On a pleasant sunny day, this is at a walkable distance from the Eindhoven city center. Alternatively, you could catch a bus for couple of stops. It is not that huge in size being a transport museum, but the way the DAF Trucks & passenger vehicles collections are preserved & showcased for the visitors must be highly appreciated. The contribution of DAF as a company in transport evolution is beyond admiration. By visiting the DAF museum, you will be super convinced with that feeling. Their collection of true size & miniatures is really awe-inspiring. The visit can be complemented with the nice and cute museum souvenir winkel. You, particularly if you are accompanying kids, would be highly tantalized to take a couple of their collections with you as a lifetime memory. If you are a transport geek & have specific interest for Transport history, this is the museum for YOU. If you are visiting Eindhoven for at least a day or two, you cannot give it a miss; highly recommended. There are plenty of photo ops equally for selfie lovers & photographers. Kids in particular enjoy this place a lot!

Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,Visted with my partner and 15yr old. Lots of history and insight into DAF and how they have advanced over the years. Most people who think DAF think of lorries. It has much more to it than that from Armoured personel carriers to race cars it really has a lot. The old machine shop is amazing and you are allowed to walk around and hold the tools and equipment rather than it being behind barriers. The cut ways and interactive exhibits are interesting too. The lay out is simple and there is an area for young children to play too. It has an old town set up inside with a hotdog stool and a bar. If you are into vehicles of any kind then its well worth the 10 minute walk from the town center.,Nov 2019
Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,"The DAF Museum is larger than you might think. The exhibited vehicles are very interesting and you have never seen many of them before. The collection of military and commercial vehicles is also remarkable. If you are in Eindhoven, you should not miss this museum.

The museum is not far from Eindhoven's city center and can be reached by foot in a few minutes.

The museum features a cafeteria with a nice view of the main part of the exhibition hall.

Well worth the diversion if you are remotely interested in transport,motoring or militaria.Parking is a bit of an issue.I parked alongside the canal and walked across the bridge. The restaurant and cafe seem to attract a lot of older diners who use it as a family get together. Entering the ramp ( disabled friendly)to the main museum is a Tardis experience as its a giant facility with a period facade at the front. I was offered an English booklet and many exhibits ( but not all) have bi lingual info.
A varied selection of haulage,racing trucks,firefighting,waste disposal,military, buses etc. The car displays are mainly on the upper level (stairs or lift) and in addition to the expected production cars there are a number of specials and prototypes. A display of variomatic transmissions and a engines on stands are on both levels with a room full of display cases filled with Daf memorabilia. The staff are keen and informed.

There were 2 floors where the vehicles were exhibited from the DAF 600 produced in 1958 to the latest super-trucks. The variation and condition of the vehicles were absolutely superb and there were also additional areas that included engine motors, workshop, garage, lots of model cars and trucks, collections of company ties and memorabilia etc. The museum attendants were very helpful in answering any questions about the exhibits and even offered me to sit in a super-truck's driver's cab to which I gleefully accepted.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,4.0,"It’s located in an old brewery, leased by van Doorne to build trailers, called van Doorne Aanhanger (trailer) fabriek DAF, afterwards moving to another building where they started building cars. The first one the Daf 600 was introduced in 1958, the acronym became the better known as van Doorne Automobiel (car) Fabriek (works).
The museum is run by lots of enthusiastic volunteers, on the second floor all models ever produced inluding those produced after having been taken over by Volvo are on show, and a few unique prototypes that never reached production, e.g. a DAF 33 Coupe due to lack of production capacity, and costs, or the planned DAF 700 that was produced as the Volvo 340, a one off DAF 55 made to look formal by designer Moretti who design a “classical looking” bidy fir a rich Swiss lady, the 1973(?) Formula 1 Williams racing team car with the famous van Doorne continuous variable transmission, who never did compete because that transmission was disallowed just days after the car did the fastest lap times ever... Also a working demonstration of how continuous variable transmission worked, and the steps taken since having been taken over by Bosch trasmussions Tilburg.
Two stairs down in the basement lots of DAF trucks, including a 1,000 HP racing truck, three DAF trucks driven by van Rooyen in the mid eighties winning the gruelling Paris-Dakar race, powered by two 11,8 Lt 495 HP engines, standing very, very tall indeed, even a small DAF 44 car which finished the London-Moscow-Peking race. For those interested lots of very big diesel engines on show too.
Time spend 1 to 2 hours depending how interested one is.
Tours can be booked in advance.
One small quibble: no parking available, they are building a new extension to house their extensive truck collection on what used to be their parking, parking space alongside the road is difficult to find, but there is a bus stop right in front of the museum.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,"DAF are a home-brewed Dutch automotive company that most people will have never heard of. They used to make passenger cars and commercial trucks. Their current factory just makes trucks now. If you live in Europe you'll have seen them everywhere.
This museum has a history of DAF going all the way back to their original automotive invention - the Variomatic - the world's first CVT (continuously variable transmission). CVTs are used in everything from passenger cars to scooters nowadays. Nissan and Subaru use their own version of these in current models. And DAF's one-time involvement in F1 was supplying CVT transmissions to the Williams Team in the 80s. I didn't know that.
At the time of our visit, several DAF Dakar Rally trucks were on display and I got the impression this was a temporary addition. Any Dutch person will be able to tell you who the De Rooy family are and to have two DeRooy rally trucks on display was a treat for me.
The museum will take about 2 hours max to go through. Make sure you look in to De Smidse which is hidden at the back - it's part of the original DAF manufacturing workshop.

The truck which is the core business of DAF, there is a few models, including old models and army models (used more by Netherlands army), 3 trucks of Dakar, but I was expecting more. Maybe more disappointed, because i was expecting more models of Dakar, once DAF have some history with this type of competition and because this is a manufacture museum.
So, pay 9 or 10 eur to visit a museum like this, I think is too much, but is my opinion.

Little cafe for coffee and a snack (not for lunch)--outside food is allowed and there are picnic areas in the building to sit. The best part was that the kids could touch and press buttons and climb. there is a sort of scavenger hunt they can follow. Our sons favourite was the army truck which carries 10 soldiers. You can go in and touch everything and peak through the roof! I recommend this location highly! We spend 2.5 hours but could have easily stayed longer if we had packed a lunch.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,I visited with my son and we spent about two hours here. It's great to see so many old DAF's.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,3.0,"I have given this museum 3 stars because I didn't find it terribly interesting, but then I have been to the excellent Louwen Car Museum near the The Hague which is incredible by comparison. The Daf museum is a nice little museum just outside the city centre of Eindhoven. They have lots of well preserved cars, fire engines and lorries, all of which are in excellent condition. If you owned a Daf it would probably have been more interesting. I felt the place was run by volunteers, although that was just my impression, but the staff were very pleasant, the museum well kept and there is a small coffee shop. If you are interested in Daf cars and lorries, the museum is very good.

I've never seen a collection of such dull cars, beautifully presented dull cars, but still dull, not the museums fault, they are what DAF made (I guess). There were a collection of interesting trucks, some of which you could get into. There are also activities for the children (computers and things) but most of them seemed to be broke.

It was indoors though and we did spend about 1.5 hours there so I guess it's worth a visit, but don't expect your children to be enthralled.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,3.0,"I went on a Sunday in August 2015. Entry was relatively inexpensive (8 Eur). It is relatively easy to find, near to the canal approx 20 min walk from centre of Eindhoven. There is a cafe on site.

If you are a huge fan of DAF vehicles and can speak relatively fluent Dutch, this is the place for you. I saw an interesting olde worlde village (not sure why it was there), DAF fire engines and coaches, couple of floors of DAF cars of all shapes and sizes. There was also a display of military vehicles.
It was somewhere to pass the time for an hour....but it isn't somewhere I will be in a rush to return to. I would give it 2.5 stars if possible. Please note that 99% of display signage is in Dutch.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,3.0,"This really is a trip down memory lane (when you're old enough and otherwise it is a history lesson:-). The movie starts in the 1900s and ends in 1988. A lot of the movie is without the original sound (but piano rattle) and in black and white. The funniest part of all the movies are the numerous festivities: for the 60th birthday of the director, for chassis number 10.000, for the 65th birthday of the Director, for the stepping down of the Director, etcetera etcetera. The one recurring feature of all of it (except for smoking and predominantly male players), was the fanfare / drumband. The display of passenger cars and trucks is very informative. The DAF passenger cars weren't the most stilish of them all. The trucks are world class and are still being built (be it under the Paccar flag after the bankruptcy in the late 1990s).

The 'Daffetaria' is the place to sit down and have something to drink/eat. That could/should be upgraded a bit. There are plans to expand the DAF Museum, so perhaps that will mean a revamping of the whole place. It could use some TLC.

Being born and raised in Eindhoven the DAF truck company history was (of course) known to me. This is probably the most important reason I never visited the DAF museum until recently. What a pleasant surprise it was. Not only is the museum ground much larger than one would expect by looking at the exterior, it is also a lot more attractive than the building (location) suggests.
Lots of tangible remnants of an industrial company that went bankrupt only to arise stronger (under PACCAR). Great displays, very enhtusiast and supportive staff that is clearly tremendously proud of the company. Even worthwhile if you're not a petrolhead.
If you're in Eindhoven and have 2 hours to spare - go visit.... I should have done so much earlier.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,"Friends and I were doing a six day motorcycle trip through Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. We stopped here as a point of interest.

I knew of DAF cars as a Dutch car manufacturer, but little else. Wow! I was amazed by this museum. It is very well presented and worth going to.

I enjoyed learning about the Car Company and its founders. I also enjoyed the simple way that the technology behind these amazing cars is presented. I learned a lot about how these cars work, specifically without a traditional transmission, which allows the cars to go as fast in reverse as they go in forward!

There is a huge selection of cars, trucks, some motorcycles, farming equipment and military vehicles as well as racing vehicles (both cars and trucks). All are in good shape, with video presentation as well as hands on demonstrations.

The museum tracks from initial company formation, through war times, up to the present and future concepts for its trucking branch.

There is a restaurant / café in the museum. The coffee was tasty and hot.

There are lockers (free) we used for locking up our motorcycle jackets and helmets.

Well worth a couple of hours to go. Price was nominal.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,4.0,"This museum is completely set-up around the Dutch car brand DAF, former producer of cars and still producer of trucks. The museum is located in the first DAF workshop. It gives a complete overview about the DAF history. Very interesting and nice to visit.",Jul 2015
Netherlands,DAF Museum,4.0,"The DAF Museum is established in the building, where dr. Hub van Doorne, the founder of DAF, started with his machine work shop in 1928. Originally, the building was a brewery, but was transformed during the first decade of operation into a trailer factory. Later on the design an production of trucks was started and in the '50's of last century the DAF passenger car was presented. Although dr. Hub van Doorne had only a basic education, his technical genius created many interesting solutions, such as the Variomatic for the DAF passenger cars and the CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission). This ultimate invention of dr. Hub van Doorne lives on in many mainstream cars today. When I drive away in my Toyota Hybrid smoothly and effortlessly, this is with thanks to the inventor of the CVT. I sometimes joke that I drive a DAF when somebody asks me the brand of car I drive. The title of my review is maybe a bit over the top, because DAF trucks still exists of course, being saved from bankruptcy by the deep pockets of the American Paccar company in the '90's of last century. But the passenger car division lacked a savior with deep pockets and the will to retain the brand. So DAF passenger cars are long a thing of the past. The ultimate DAF passenger car, the DAF 77 was marketed as Volvo 343. The demise of the DAF passenger car is a pity, because the DAF museum shows a wealth of ideas and designs which just didn't came to fruition through lack of capacity and money. Basically the museum consists of two levels, the ground level, where the trucks are shown and the upper level with the passenger cars. Interesting are the models of the Variomatic an the CVT. On the ground floor is the original work shop where Hub van Doorne started business; a good effort has been made to bring this work shop back to the original atmosphere. Car fanciers, engineers, and everybody who is interested in the history of a great Dutch brand, can spend a pleasant couple of hours in the DAF museum. Entrance is free with the annual Dutch Museum Pass; a small parking area is adjacent to the entrance, otherwise parking in a bay on the Tongeresestraat is free. To be recommended.

Starting from around1930s ,it shows its various models,applications,and engines till date.One can see the role it played in reconstruction of Netherlands after the war,and defence.,in trucks.
In car section it shows its small compact cars with its unique belt and pulley design of Automatic transmission.
The museum also has a small board room and merchandising room.
There is a small cafeteria, very elegant ,where a smiling old man served me excellent coffee.
The staff was very polite and helpful.
DAF is a small player and not Mercedes,so is it's museum, not a Mercedes museum,but a good practical one,serving its own purpose.For some one like me who spent entire career in India's largest Automobile company,it was a must.

Netherlands,DAF Museum,4.0,"We have been a couple of times in the last few years. Staff are very friendly and great with the kids.

Clearly motor buffs will love it although it is well staged and provides as real sense of nostalgia that most people can relate to. There's quite a bit of military equipment and a full history of the DAF car, as was.

There is also an interactive area for kids to experience driving via computer and sit in a truck simulator.

A small, free car park is just to the left of the entrance.

The walk from the centre of Eindhoven was lovely it was nice to be going away from all the crowds. Upon entering the museum you have the opportunity to have a drink and snack whilst overlooking all the vehicles. You are presented with a map and booklet in your language and from here you are free to walk around all parts of the museum at your leisure. There is lots to see there are however some parts that are not in English but that didn't really matter the pictures provided enough information if there wasn't a translation. There are guides hovering around the musuem and even let us get in and sit in one the newer tractor units and showed all the latest gadgets that they are being equipped with. I def could not fault this attraction and if you can in hotels or on the back of the map guide there is even an offer to get discount of entry. I would recommend this for anyone who has interest in cars / lorries / bikes and even those who havent to come and see how much transportation has changed I would be surprised if you came away disappointed.

The museum is located where Mr van Doorne first started as a blacksmith in 1928. The collection is large and very complete. I have many museums on my list, and I am glad I made it here.

Most of the information on the displays is in Dutch with some added info placed in English on a few. There are large glass display cases full of toy(model) Daf products and toys. There is a working workshop area where volunteers repair/restore vehicles. A small simple café for drinks and biscuits is near the entrance. Entrance fee of E8 isn't too bad for an hours(or more) entertainment. The car park is fairly small, probably no more than 20 vehicles at most.

The greatest annoyance is the fact that there is no explanation or serious guide in English.

The timeslot is for entry only, you can then stay as long as you wish. It was shocking to see how crowded it was, to the point that it was really discomforting. Talking to a Blijdorp-volunteer, we understood that 7100 visitors were allowed in the day we were there. Way to many!!! The 1.5m distancing could, in many many places, not be honoured. Nobody was wearing mouth/nose masks in the covered areas, which were places where 1.5m distance was absolutely not possible. Even outside it was at times difficult to keep 1.5m distance.

I sow on their web site they write a lot exactly about that bear, and they are very proud to have one, which is really great. But what is not great is that polar bears hardly can live in those conditions in the warm season. I really was happy that I am having the opportunity to see that amazing animal in live, but then I was so upset with what I actually saw. The bear was lying down in the shadow, very hardly breading because it was too hot, time to time put his/her head up, it was obvious that does not feel comfortable and that is too hot, after 40 -45min I went back to see if he moved, but even worst in that second time he/she even was lying completely in the ground with more heavy breathing. Due to the fact that exactly on their website there is a lot of data about that amazing animal, and it is very surprising knowing all those but not reacting accordingly. For me, that was something I didn't want to experience, because if it is already in captivity for any reason, then should have good living conditions or at least better...If they made for Amazonia animals a very warm tropical environment, I am sure that the bear can have a colder environment. Yes, there is a cold cave, how they are mentioning on the website, but through that cave, visitors are passing and the bear is still outside in the sun, or shadow, unless the moment when he/she is catching fish in the pool.

1. LOCATION📍
※ The zoo takes about 47-50 minutes from Rotterdam central.
※ The shortest route is to travel by bus, which would take you there without needing to transfer.

2. PRICE
※ For adult, the ticket is around 24€. You are also provided with a map around the zoo. Although the map is all in Dutch, you can still nevigate easily as there were detailed and creative visuals.
※ If you stay for more than 3 months in Rotterdam, then it can be useful to purchase Rotterdampas, which reduces the price to 5€.

3. ACTIVITIES:🐧🐧🐧
※ The Zoo is divided into different areas such as Africa, Tropical,... and there is even an Aquarium, Butterfly farm with decorations according to the regions. It makes me feel like an adventurer.
※ There aren't much activities to interact with the animal. The only thing you can do is wander and observe the animal from close distance.

4. SERVICE
※ The service is insignificant as the employees only did the job they are assigned to, making less interaction with the guests.
※ Inside the zoo, there was little to no employees standing which can be troublesome when you need to ask for direction.
※ Since the zoo is really big, they offer the ride service to different areas. However, the location and schedule of the car was unclear, there seems to be only one stop at the entrance.

NOTE:
※ If you are an international travelers and really want to learn about the animals rather than just seeing them then you should consider going because EVERYTHING IS IN DUTCH, from the description of animals to the instructions in the map.
※ I went solo and as an international traveler, it took me about 4 hours to visit all the zoo and the animal. However, if you travel with friends and family, it would take about half a day or more.

Heb een fijne dag!🏞

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,It is the Dutch Zoo and certainly tourist have to visit this very well organised zoo. You will experience all kinds of wild live in an animal and people friendly environment.,Oct 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"We came here for the day because being members of our local zoo gave us free entry to this zoo, but would happily have paid to get in. The variety of animals to see is the best of any zoo I have been too. For us it took 3-4 hours to get around the whole zoo, but could quite easily be a full day with small children",Jun 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"The zoo is huge and there are a lot of species to see. Unfortunately a lot of them come from Africa and Asia where the wheather is different. When we went to the zoo, we missed a lot of animals because they couldn't come out in the cold :-( But we did see the Gorillas, the Oceanium, and some other animals.",Dec 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Went with my 11-year old son. Even though we had a bit of rain, we still had a blast. As much to see indoors as there is outdoors. So many animals... You really need a full day if you want to see and experience it all. We got there at 9:15 am, left at 6:00 pm and never fore one minute got bored.",Oct 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,Just is also a place just to have fun watching all the gorgeous animals from tigers to the silver back gorilla bokito,Feb 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"A large and well laid out zoo, with many animals you won't see in smaller zoo's. The zoo also has a large Oceanarium, with glass tunnels you can walk through and watch the fish swimming above and around you. There is so much to see, you'll need to allow at least four hours for your visit. The zoo is easy to get to, with a Metro station just ten minutes walk away. Very enjoyable on a sunny day!",Nov 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"The Zoo looks small but is actually rather streched out. The Zoo has several interesting buildings in the Dutch art deco style made by the architect Van Ravenstein..Of course the Zoo was updated over the last decennial, but this mix between old and new works perfect.The aquarium is spectacular : you walk in a glass tunnel so it gives you the feeling you are in the water yourself.",Aug 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,If you are ever in Rotterdam this is a must see attraction. The zoo is massive and has the best aquarium that I have ever seen. It's surprising how close you can get to some of the animals but my personal favourite is the polar bear even though it never wants to go in the water. We spent 5 hours there with grandchildren who loved every bit of it. It's very reasonably priced and so is the food that is available.,Oct 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Awesome zoo! Highlights were: 1) the bird house with free-flying Hornbills (Jaarvogel) amongst others, 2) the crocodile house with its Nile and Panzer crocs, 3) the shark tunnel in the aquarium. It was a bit too cold and rainy to judge most of the rest. While inside the Oceanarium it rained in buckets, another excuse to go back through the shark tunnel and again. ;) The elephant house was also pretty awesome, but the animals were outside.",Nov 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"I have been so many times to this zoo. My parents to me every few weeks to go look at the animals. This is the place I learned so much about animals. Even though its not as much cared for anymore, it still feels the same.",Dec 2018
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"The zoo is really big with a lot of different areas. We spent a whole day there.
Unfortunately the food (as in all zoos) is expensive and mostly junk, and in autumn many of the food carts are closed down already.
Finding your way round can be a bit difficult, even with a map and the signs because the paths are very windy.
Their elephants were very playful, and they have okapis which are a rare find.
We had a great time and can totally recommend a visit!",Sep 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"I had a great time in this zoo.
The only problem was that there are no many people selling the tickets.
It is better to go on a weekday on when the weather is not so good because it can get very crowded.
Great zoo experience. I got to see the animals very close",Sep 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"The animals look well taken care of and they have room for the elephants to have a place for summer and winter environments.
My favorite part was probably the red pandas. They are adorable! They definitely bring in a crowd.
I know in the one day I visited, I only got to see 1/3 of the park. Also, the entrance to the zoo, I thought nobody was in there. I didn't see anyone loitering around. Inside, there was a fairly decent crowd.
Yes, I recommend a visit to this zoo.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"We visited with our two children (9 & 8) on the 29th of August. We arrived around 10:15 and only had 3 people in front of us in the queue. We used the Welcome to Rotterdam card so received a discount off the gate price.

What can I say, we had a BRILLIANT day out. We didn’t leave until closing around 18:15, it is a full day out. Everywhere was clean, we lost count of the number of different animals we saw. Lots of interactive exhibits. Plenty of choice of different foods spaced nicely around the park.

All animals looked healthy & well looked after. The enclosures were all a very good sized and appropriate for the type of animal in them.

The main playground was also a hit with our two, it’s a decent size with some really tricky aspects to it, to make them climb and explore. Three really good slides too.

We had ice creams as well as lunch and found everything to be priced well.

A lively day out in a lovely setting and everyone we came across was pleasant, friendly and helpful.

Thank you!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Excellent zoo with the variety of animals, birds, reptiles, and even butterflies. It takes five to six hours to see the zoo. Such a big and old zoo maintained so clean. They have restaurants inside the zoo and the indoor play area for kids. So the people with kids can enjoy a lot. I have never seen such a good zoo till today. You can view the animals so closely from different angles. Thanks a lot for the staff for maintaining the zoo so cleanly. There are 2 entrance for the zoo. Once you enter the zoo and proceed with watching animals and birds you end up with the other entrance. But thankfully there is small battery operated vehicle that takes you from one entrance to the other for 1 euro per person. And you reach within 10 minutes. There are even strollers for the kids one can rent it.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,3.0,"The zoo is very big! There are a lot of different animals you can see here. There are multiple places in the park where you can buy something to eat or drink also.

The birds show is really nice! It’s a 20 minute show where they give some information about a few different birds and you can see them nicely. The information was given in Dutch though.

Unfortunately when we were there, quite a few animals were not visible.. the cages seemed completely empty.. but I’m not sure if the animals were actually there in another cage or if they were just not there at all ..

A good thing is that the park is nicely reachable from Rotterdam Central Station. You’ll have to take bus 44, which will reach you within 5 minutes!

Do ask for a free park map upon entering the park.. it will come handy, as the park is big enough to spend the whole day!!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"We (mom, dad and a 6 year old kid) have chosen to visit Rotterdam (from Germany) just because of this zoo. Our kid has a fascination about animals in general, fish and other marine animals, and also butterflies. Rotterdam Zoo has all of these in one place. There's no need to have 3 different schedules to visit a zoo, a butterfly park and an aquarium park. Our son had the best time and he has asked strsightaway when we could go there again.",Jun 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,2.0,"To start with, this is a huge zoo with lots to see. You definitely get your money's worth. You can spend the entire afternoon wondering around all sites which are divided by world region. However the reason for the lower rating is that such establishment in 2019 need to take more responsibility to be environmentally and socially aware and proactive. Firstly, on June 15th was the Rotterdam Festival which is next to the zoo. There was extremely loud thumping of electronic music which sounded like it was on site. Although you can't move the zoo or ban the Rotterdam Festival, you can temporary close the zoo on that weekend - for your animals' sake. Especially at the polar bear enclosure, it sounded like a nightclub whilst one of the polar bears was pacing back and forth in repetitive motion all day long. This was extremely sad to see and definitely disheartening for a zoo to keep an endangered specie in such a hectic environment. This was not the only animal exhibiting signs of distress. If the animals were reacting to the loud festival music, I would highly recommend you close the zoo on that weekend. Secondly, and to keep this short, PLASTIC STRAWS have no place at a zoo: a place that is supposed to be environmentally conscious. Thirdly, you are responsible to clearly state on your website what kind of work you do with preservation and the fee % that goes towards that goal.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Okay, it’s expensive for a single adult at 24 Euros but we did enjoy it. Overall, we spent 4 hours there as it is a very large zoo. And yes, plenty of kids but hey ho what can you do ? Just go with the flow.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Cute zoo with many interesting and beautiful animals. The zoo is much larger than it first appears from the entrance and you can easily spend a whole day there.

Particularly liked the oceanarium section, big cats, gorillas and the polar bears. Highly recommended!",May 2019
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Many may disagree with the idea of a zoo, but it is perhaps the only way for someone who lives in an urban environment to come in contact with all these wonderful and beautiful creatures. The facilities are excellent and try to cover all the needs of the animals that live there. The zoo provides all the amenities that a person with mobility problems needs.
It also offers activities for young children, food and relaxation areas.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Enormous zoo with a lot of beautiful animals. Going there with my mother and son, it was a bit too much to see in one day. We will have to come back.
The zoo is divided into continental areas for the animals, and there's a huge aquarium, too. We got to see parts of Asia and Africa.
Our son had lots of fun in the indoor Biotopia playground and the huge outdoor Oewanja playground.
If you arrive by public transportation, be aware that the metro stop Blijdorp is a good walk from the entrance. You might be better off taking bus 44 from Rotterdam Central station. The bus stops in front of the entrance.
As always, there is a slight uncomfortable feeling when watching caged animals. I do not like the idea. Still, many zoos play a vital part in preservation of species, and it is an opportunity to see these animals that many would not have if they had to travel. The educational element, plus the fact that this zoo seems to play a responsible role and understands its position, makes that this still is an activity I can recommend.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,3.0,"Wasn’t sure whether to go or not since I consider myself as a “zoos are cruel type”. Some of the cages are way too narrow for the animals, and I do not know if they get to live their natures in a bigger area but most of the cages are really big that animals can get the privacy they need. You need to spend a lot of time in front of a mountain cat place if you are looking forward to see one. The place is huge. In 5 hours could only see 2/3 of it, had to leave before collapsing with exhaustion. There are plenty of cafés to enjoy around and some of them seem to be designed especially for families with kids. Although I am still not okay by the idea of caging animals, I am glad I found the opportunity to observe them closely, which is not an easy find for people caged in cities.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"We have the luxury of living near Chester Zoo and in comparison most other zoos are poor imitations. Not Rotterdam. I would still say Chester is slightly better but Rotterdam is very close behind.

Its plus points are the diversity of animals and the well kept nature of them. I've seen some zoos where the animals all seem undernourished and poorly kept, so well done Rotterdam!

The aquarium section is amazing with a multitude of marine animals on display. Outside there are sea lions whilst inside there are various fish, corals, reptiles and invertebrates on display. One of the more fascinating fish was the sturgeon. I'd never seen one before and couldn't believe the size of them.

The zoo also boasts an arctic section with polar bears and arctic foxes (though this time of year they are black not white - the foxes that is, the polar bears are still white!).

There is a tropical realm with free flying butterflies as well as a variety of insects and poison dart frogs etc. all safely ensconced behind glass.

The rest of the zoo is split into continents - Africa, Asia, Europe and Australia - with animals you'd guess at in each area.

There are a few restaurants around the zoo, additional cafe type places selling drinks and ice-creams and both outdoor and indoor children's play areas - as if the animals aren't exciting enough!

The zoo has its own app which is well worth downloading as it helps to navigate to the animals you're especially interested in (as well as showing the quickest way to the nearest toilets should nature call).

The app gives additional information about the animals on display - there are sign boards around the animal enclosure and some, but not all, have information in English as well as Dutch.

We saw quite a few local Dutch visitors throwing food to the animals - I'm not sure that they were meant to, so really wouldn't recommend copying them.

All in all its a great day out - and it will take up most of your day if you do it properly.

I would really recommend the bird show (Vrije Vlucht Voorstelling), it’s fun, especially the big owl and the vultures. And a free tip: never buy a regular parking ticket, always go for the parking ticket for season pass keepers. If you’re not a season pass keeper, buy your parking ticket at the machines. It saves you €3,50.",May 2018

There were plenty of places to buy refreshments and excellent facilities. Fab day out!",Jul 2018
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"We had a great time in this Zoo. We spend over 4 hours and didn't get to see it all. Naturally everyone has its favorites. We liked the gorillas that where inside with the warm weather and the hyenas chewing on bones. We went to see the feeding of the sharks and the tigers. Probably we, and most visitors, expected too much of it as the animals got bored soon so there was not much to see. Great lay out by continent so you have a great mix of different species (birds, mammals,...) in every continent. The food in the restaurant are typical dutch fast food options. I tried a 'broodje kroket' that really missed taste, with or without the accompanying sauce. Broodje Unox (hot dog) had the same problem. Perhaps best to take a picknick with you. Great bakeries (like Koekela) in Rotterdam. We came with an Uber from the centre for 7 euro which is cheaper than the 3,50 euro/person for a two hour ticket for the bus as you will take longer than two hours in the Zoo. Probably the same with a taxi.

You will find the animal area are divided into their habitual continents, a tropical butterfly dome and also an Underwater World.

All in all a nice day out.",Jun 2018
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,3.0,"It is known as one of the best Zoos, but I think one at the very end on this list. Despite we've seen there very rare animals, like rhinos and polarbears, and very friendly girrafes and Zebras, this object itself is not so good in my opinion. The worst are pool panes. Glasses are dirty and You can barely see animals (sea lions , pinguins etc.). Also there is almost no added attractions like in other Zoos. Feeding of animals looks like: one person throw them the food and thats it. In other places (not in Rotterdam) during the feeding You can hear from staff about carrying animals, little story about them, and so on. For Young kids Will be ok. They can see different animals, play at one of the few playgrounds, but for whole Family or Adults I know much better Zoos. I think that its do not deserve for so high place at the rankings.
So if You are nearby and have nothing else to do, its ok to spend the day. But if You have to go there from afar, choose something else.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Having arrived in Centraal I had a few hours to kill before my hotel room was available. I noticed the zoo was lust over a Km away and walked there. The rear entrance was a bit innocuous and the entry fee a bit steep but as I had time on my hands I went in anyway. Wow I am so glad I did, I have been to many zoo's safari parks around the world and this had to be one of the best. Relatively compact without the massive distances to walk, beautifully set in mature woodland, great views of the animals, polar bears which I have never seen before, a fantastic oceanarium with the best water tunnel I have ever seen. If you like photography in particular this is great with great views of sharks, turtles and rays allowing you to take those 'starburst' type images you only get when diving. Interestingly despite its great quality it was not too crowded, perhaps because it is slightly out of the way in Rotterdam. Either way I was grateful and if you are an animal lover this is for you. I will certainly come back and bring my 5 yr old next time!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"I have been to many zoos and this is the best. The underwater exhibit allows you to walk through a large, open tunnel with sharks, fish and turtles swimming around you and overhead. It is quite spectacular. The size of the zoo is surprising. It is hard to cover the whole area in a day. Spectator safety is different here than in the USA - i was surprised to see how close we were to animals, some out of their cages (prairie dogs). More surprising was how many parents allowed their children to put fingers into the cages of wild animals - must be a cultural difference. The bird exhibits were great, hippos, giraffe, elephants, etc. The butterfly exhibit was rather disappointing

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"The Rotterdam zoo offers a great leasure time for couples and families with children if you are not scared from walking a little. You can not only find here a great variety of animals but there is also quite much information about them. The area itself is huge, so it takes around 6 hours to go through the entire zoo. I would recommend planning a full day for the visit so you have ample time for breaks.
Apart from Dutch, most animals have information displayed in English as well.
Additionally, the zoo features great attractions like the bird show (in Dutch), but, as the zoo is quite large, it is advised to plan ahead to make the best use of your time.
Finally, the opening time is incorrectly displayed on tripadvisor. The real opening time is from 9am to 6pm (check the zoo's website for most recent information).

I must say that quite some cages seemed to be without animals but of course it is possible they were hiding for the visitor's looks. Noticing all the concern and worries about nature in the park (on many billboards) it can also have been a symbol of the loss of so many animals in the world. My grandson was most interested in other children and the rhiniceros. We both had a good time.,Jun 2018

Both offer mainly the same type of species like mammals, fishes, butterflies, reptiles, birds, etc.

The free bird shows (Vrije Vlucht Voorstellingen aka VVV) in Blijgaarde however offer an unique opportunity in the Netherlands to see nice birds in flight.
There are three shows a day (not in winter time) held in a special spacy arena. It’s safe, fun and educative. Every show offers different birds: some big, some small, some even in groups. So do come back for the next show to see more.

A good opportunity for photographers to practice their Birds In Flight (BIF) skills.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Close to the center of Rotterdam, this zoo packs in a huge amount of animal attractions to view. Some of the enclosures are perhaps a bit small but there is a lot to see and do. Food is hit and miss, like many zoos. On a cold day the lack of hot food like fries is strange. (of the many outlets I checked)

Very large zoo , bring your sneakers as you will walk a lot. The tropical areas are undercover, including a cafe in one.

From a non-dutch tourist point of view its disappointing that signs are only in dutch. Having at least dual language signs would be a must. Bring google translate on your phone.

The gorilla area has an awesome play area for kids with swings and a large haunted house like structure with climbing activities and slides for kids.

Was surprised how many non-European plants (e.g. Bamboo) are growing at the zoo, credit to the staff keeping this alive during the cold winters.

It made for a fun day - especially when it was really nice weather out.
I don't think I could pick a favorite part of the zoo, it just kinda seems like I would be saying one part of it was better than another and that is not the case. But, you should go and see the Polar Bears. There was one that was quite happy to come closer to the glass and see people. It was quite refreshing to see these animals happy where they are and to be comfortable around those that are walking past.
This was a wonderful day. I look forward to going back and visiting it again another day in the future. And honestly, I think they may have the largest range of animals you can see in one place. The aquarium and learning stations were quite vast as well. It was wonderful to see a zoo that seemed so alive with the people visiting and the animals that were housed there.
Impressive as well for the size of the zoo was the Giraffe enclosure. I couldn't believe how large their roaming space as well as the housing enclosure was, you would have to see it to believe it.
Fantastic! Definitely a zoo I recommend to visit.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Great wee day at the zoo, despite the terrible weather. Few wee negatives to get out of the way before getting to the good stuff. First, the park was pretty much deserted, which is fine but as a result most of the public bathrooms were all locked up. We enquired at one of the gift stalls where the nearest ones were and the two guys seemed to be in competition over who could be least helpful. Congrats, you’re both winners.

Second, the layout of the park isn’t the best so there is a bit of unnecessary wandering about to be had. The map provided wasn’t top notch either.
But the positives outweighed all of this I’m happy to say. The exhibits were fab and spacious (a must for the ethical treatment crowd) and there’s a ton of variety of animals to see. The aquarium, polar bears and tiger exhibits were among the highlights for us. Although the tickets weren’t cheap we found that there’s more than enough to occupy 4-5 hours of time to justify it and will be recommending a visit to anyone who travels to Rotterdam.

In the winter we’re a big fan of the aquarium, which contains much more than just fish. Animals like small mammals and penguins also have their home here.
On a nice and warm day we always (have to) go to the elephants, tigers, lions, giraffes, okapi and many more animals. Also the playground is always a nice stop.

With small children it will be a full day. The park is quite large, so be sure to take a pram.
For just adults it’s still a full day, but you might manage to see all the animals.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Rotterdam zoo is a must do !
Ladies are you brave enough to be an airstrip for large colourful butterflies to land upon or steady enough when a bouncing wallaby passes you by ? when strolling along the zoo pathway. I was fascinated when a very large hamster type fur ball popped out of one hole in the ground shot through my legs and disappeared down another to every ones amusement. However if your after a little more adventure stand against the Polar bears enclosure. This enclosure has a huge glass viewing screen which holds back the polar bears swimming pool. I don't know how strong or thickness of the glass panel however you are close enough to the polar bear to check if he's washed behind his ears and also ladies what a great selfie you would have when they swim past. Another great selfie could be taken in the Oceanium . Here you will walk through a large glass tunnel observing sharks , rays and turtles as they swim by. Therefore ladies you might find Nemo , Happy feet or you can be a mermaid without having to get your feet wet. A ticket into the zoo costs 23 euros for an adult however it will take all day to see and do everything. The zoo takes 10 to 15 mins when walking, starting at P & O s drop off point ( bus stop HH at central station ) with the Bus stop behind you walk towards Central station and you will notice a cycle/ pedestrian tunnel to your left. Walk through this tunnel and at the other side turn left, it is sign posted to the zoo. I have put a photo of a map with a highlighted yellow route to the zoo on tripadvisor. If you are not sure the tourist information centre inside Central station have friendly advisors who are more than happy to help and also have maps for 1 euro available. Therefore if you haven't a selfie with a Polar bear, Happy feet or Nemo its another must do zoo !

A lot of animals in almost natural surroundings.
The big silverback gorilla named Bokito is one of the stars who love to see you whatch his family.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"The zoo had a massive overhaul since my last visit a couple a years ago. The lions moved house and so did the crocodiles and the barracudas.

The Oceanium aquarium is massive and now also holds a small section of The Great Barrier Reef. The piranhas moved to the Amazonia, a peace of tropical rainforest which holds beautiful butterflies and plants. More refurbishment of the aquarium is on its way, to be finished in 2019.

There's always something new to discovered, which makes this zoo ideal for a nice day or afternoon visit. It's great to see that Diergaarde Blijdorp keeps improving the zoo and it's animal quarters. Giving the animals the space they need.

Some interesting facts: the zoo is 160 years old in 2017 and holds 21 monumental buildings.

Entrance fee is a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth your money. This simply is the best zoo of the Netherlands!

We got some vouchers to visit the zoo and we knew it would be a nice experience for our infant daughter.
Baby strollers at the entrance, but make sure you check for seat belts.
It's a very GREEN zoo. Great for the animal obviously. Signage was either inadequate or I'm simply not smart enough to understand it.
All in all, it was an OK trip for a ""zoo experience"".

Based on her information, the ticket is quite expensive. It was a huge area with differents themes. You can find Japanese garden, also Long House of Dayak. Not so much animals you can see. But some of them I haven't found in the zoo in Indonesia. It takes a long walk to finish this place. Because I am not into zoo, to visit this place once is enough for me.

This gave me a 25% saving of the entry fee of €23.
S check out the Welcome Card, as if you only visit the Zoo, you will save yourself money!!
Anyway, back to my visit!
The Zoo, had several areas of limits, as they are in the process of developing new areas. This did not diminish my enjoyment.
There are several demonstrations during the day, and the details can be found on their website. This also includes ""guided tours""! I don't know if they are in English or just Dutch, as I decided not to go on one!
One thing that impressed me was the very reasonable prices for main meals at the various restaurants around the Zoo. I opted for a Kebab meal, which included fries and a drink. Good value at €8.50.
It is a great site that could make you stay all day.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"My wife and I travelled by train from Amsterdam specifically to see the animals and the surroundings of this zoo. We were not disappointed at all. Our four day vacation from the UK (N.Ireland) was topped off by this visit and the weather was glorious on the day we visited. The entire layout of the zoo was wonderful and the animals well cared for. The only negative aspect was that the maps were not produced in the English language and it was difficult at times trying to work out which path to follow and where the various amenities where located. A clean, tidy and beautiful place to visit and we particularly enjoyed the butterfly house. Well worth a visit in our opinion!!!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"In terms of the variety and amounts of animals on display and the size and condition of their enclosures this the best zoo I have ever visited.
Other areas such as café facilities and signage were slightly lacking but this did not reflect badly on the overall experience.

The array of animals here is amazing, so many elephants, giraffes, lions. Other zoos brag about having one elephant, there must have been at least 10 here!
Now is an excellent time to visit because of all the baby animals.

The 'Amazonica' butterfly house is incredible. This was my favourite part. Make sure to leave time for this and for the huge aquarium located at the back of the park.

The cafes in the zoo are very basic, offering kids meal boxes, chips, some sandwiches etc. I would recommend taking in a picnic lunch.
A great place for a day visit and so easy to get to either on foot or by train from the city centre.

There's also plenty of restaurants to choose from and some awesome play equipment for the kids. All in all a great day.,Jun 2017
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Rotterdam was really great, it is quite big with a lot of exhibits. Being from South Africa I enjoyed the African exhibit.

Butterfy dome was great, but be warned that it is very hot as it mimics the amazon. Saw some giant lillypads which was great.

Polar bears were so stunning to see and the enclosure is made from glas so you can see under the water. The day we visited the bears were quite palyful ans the kids enjoyed this enclosure the most.

Rotterdam is easily accessible with the train or with the car and there is a lot of parking if you do go by car.

If you do go on a warm day, take enough water or drinks with you as you do walk far (some comfy shoes) and it does get very hot (also take a hat and sunblock).
We had some lunch and it was not so epensive as one would expect but you can take some snacks with you.

It is helpful to book some tickets online as you get a bit of discount online and also then you can skip the ticket queue at the entrance.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"I'm one of those people who loves animals but is always a little unsure about zoos because they tend to be more depressing than fun. However this zoo is really well layed out. A lot of the enclosures a very open for example the red pandas were sitting in the trees above us and were able to move freely rather than being stuck in a tiny cage. There is a large variation of animals here including the classics such as elephants, giraffes and polar bears. But also some interesting additions for example the Komodo dragons. This zoo is very invested in conservation and I believe some areas are open to the public so you can see what they are doing. There is an aquarium too. They also have a butterfly house and some interesting fish I have never seen before. Snacks and restaurants are on site.

Boys (10 and 5) loved the zoo, especially the Oceanarium and the Giraffe house and the adventure playground was a big hit too.

Missed a few of the animals. Some enclosures are being repaired ready for the summer season and there were very few places open for a coffee, as it is still low season. Bit aggrieved about the price (€75 for us booked online).

We ate at one of the restaurants which was ok, typical fast food for a premium price.

From Rotterdam central station the zoo is about a 20 minute walk. We took the bus which was a 5 minute ride. It drops you off right outside and you can get the bus back to the central station here too.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"What a wonderful way to spend the afternoon in Rotterdam. Easily accessible by public transport, as well as walking from the Central Station (signposted along the route). You purchase your ticket from a little booth and then it is scanned further inside at a kiosk where you get handed a map. The map is in Dutch but it has pictures of the animals so you can work everything out.
Each zone of the zoo is themed to the animals that you can find there which is a nice touch and stops the exhibits being muddled together in a way where it becomes confusing.I particularly liked the North America exhibit with the Polar Bears. I was a little concerned they would not have enough space, but was pleasantly surprised by their large swimming pool and extensive grounds in which they can spend their time. The pool is built in such a way that you can view the bears swimming (should they wish to). All 3 bears looked relaxed and well cared for.
Other areas we thought were done really well were the Asian exhibit which had a beautifully styled Japanese Garden which must look beautiful in the Spring with the tree blossom and flowers. This area housed a board walk where you could spot the Red Pandas in the trees, the Asian Elephants and also an Indonesian Rhino which is a species you don't often see in zoos in my experience.
The zoo is split in two by the railway line and you navigate this by walking beneath a large bridge, however due to the peaceful feeling of the zoo you could forget you are anywhere near a city. It was wonderfully quite during our visit. Due to the flat nature of the Netherlands almost all the zoo I think is accessible to wheelchairs and buggies. I noticed that there were little themed push chair like things for young children near the main shop. In fact it was the shop that I felt let the zoo down, it was perfect for buying bright coloured toys for children, but lacked in anything that showed where you were visiting.
Near the entrance we used there was a large building that seemed to house a cafe/ restaurant and a large play area for children. It seemed quite popular with the families who were visiting and I vaguely remember there wing a sandpit for the children to play in. On the outside of the building is a kiosk that sells snack food like mini-dutch pancakes and chips, just in case you are looking for a snack. I think there was also another eating place just before the path splitting to go to the African zone or under the railway bridge.
Other areas of interest were the wonderful aquarium with its walkthrough tunnel, the amazon area which is a large warm butterfly house and we also particularly liked the giraffe enclosure which is a weird barrel shaped building with a large paddock outside. All the animals looked well cared for and happy and everything was spotless around the zoo itself. Pack a camera and a good pair of shoes and spend a few hours watching the wonderful animals in the fantastic zoo.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Overall, this is a good zoo. We purchased tickets online prior to our visit, this saves you £2.00 and the tickets are valid for approx 1 month.

The zoo itself is a good size. What would have made it better for me was more English translations. However, staff speak english and some enclosure information was in English.

Most enclosures were a good size.",Feb 2017

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,The oceanium is very beautiful and big. If you also get the chance to go to the restaurant behind the oceanium the view is even better! With sharks and other beautiful sea creatures. But also the other animals are very nice Bogito the Gorilla is very beautiful and impressive. The lions and the other animals are all very nice. We have even had a family year card so we can visit more often. It's really worthwhile to visit this zoo. You won't regret it!,Feb 2016

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,The park is large and spaceious. There are some clusters of habitats but between them there are roads with green. Its nice to stroll there. But because of the fact that the zoo has expended over many years (moved to this location in about 1940) so the could not design it logicaly having to ad several times. Lots of wavy routes (there are signs though),Sep 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"You can definitely explore this zoo the whole day and still have things to see on your second visit! It's busy, but there is so much to see, it hardly gets too crowded. Highlights for us were the giraffes, gorilla's, wallabies and the elephants. The park looks clean and well maintained. The animals generally look happy and comfortable. Although there was one low point of the visit. The tiger enclosure didn't look adequate enough. It looked way too small and the tigers looked miserable, they were pacing in circles and panting heavily. They were visibly distressed and affected by the crowd. Because of that I can't give 5 stars, for what others wise is a wonderful zoo.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"After covering Rotterdam in a full day Friday, had most of Saturday to fill before the ferry home so decided to visit the zoo, walked to it easily in around 20 minutes from the Central Station and its sign posted all the way.
The zoo is massive, covers so much ground, in very nice settings. We saw some wonderful animals very close up in good viewing areas. My highlights were the polar bears, 3 of them posing on the rocks near the front of the enclosure, tigers, lions and the elephants next to the cafe. In the cafe got a great lunch, a pizza wrap filled with veal meat and sauce (salad if you like), with a drink combo at 6.50 euros, tasty and great value. Great day out, highly recommended.

The aquarium is awesome! My kids love the big playground as much as seeing the animals and there are a few nice places for food and beverages.",Nov 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"The zoo is very easy to reach as it's quite central.We took the number 33 bus from the Centraal Station bus station and it is only four stops (taking just 7 minutes) to the Oceanarium entrance to the zoo.This is the best entrance if arriving by car or bus and actually the best way to start your walk around.There is a closer entrance to the railway station if you are walking.
At the entrance there are a lot of ticket machines to buy your ticket (pick your language from the screen) but we used the ticket office as we had the 25% discount voucher you get with Rotterdam welcome card.The lady at the desk was very friendly.
There is a very nice cafe straight after you go through the entry barrier.
The zoo is huge and the first section is the Oceanarium which is worth the entrance fee by itself.The tanks are fantastic and the walkways are such you get a very good close up view.The penguin and sea lion tanks are worth a special mention.There are even small tanks just containing jellyfish which I have never seen in a zoo before.
After the Oceanarium the rest of the zoo is split into geographic areas and all of them are worth a visit.It is a very big zoo so if you don't have a lot of time just pick your areas like Asia or North America for example.
All the outdoor paddocks are very large so animals like the bison or giraffes for instance have a good deal of space as do the lions.
Visiting as we did in December a few of the animals were in indoor areas attatched to their outdoor enclosures as they are free to move between the two but these heated areas are open to the public with walkways so you can always see the animals and it meant we got really close to the rhinos and hippos.
During our visit not all the cafes or toilet facilities were open but there are two very nice cafe/restaurants and a couple of other toilet areas.The bonus of going in December was the low number of other visitors so we could spend as long as we liked at every exhibit.Judging by the number of cafes and the size of the car park I can imagine it gets very busy during the summer.
If you walk around the whole zoo the route takes you from one entrance to the other one but if you don't fancy the long walk back to your original entrance (to return to your car or bus stop) there is a land train that travels between the two for an adult fare of €1 or 70c for children.
A fantastic zoo and judging by the number of young animals on view the animals are happy enough to breed.A thorough visit will take 3 to 4 hours

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Nice zoo where animals are not kept in cages when not necessary (which is a big plus for me). Wide lanes that take you through the habitats and where you can see all sorts of animals. A few older buildings intermixed with new ones give it a nice style and the atmosphere of an older zoo (but still well maintained).
Ignoring the question why we have tigers and elephants in the middle of a city next to the freeway, it is a nice zoo where the animals seem to be relaxed and on a good day there are no queues and you can see them all up close.",Dec 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,We went here for a morning and didn't have enough time to see everything. The zoo is well maintained and offers a wide variety of animals.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"I visited in October with my other half. The staff on reception were very helpful and helped us with our poor Dutch, much to our delight everyone spoke English and could help us out. We were so fascinated with the sights we saw, polar bears, elephants, penguins and so much more. Our highlight was the giraffes, we could get so close and it was great to see them playing together. I truly feel the animals were very well looked after and happy here. Prices were very cheap for all that we managed to pack into a day! Tram lines stop practically outside the zoo and were fast. Cafes were reasonably priced yet long queues and not enough staff. Other than that a truly unforgettable experience! One not to be missed!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"This is an extremely good Zoo, certainly world class. It is especially good for all weathers. The presentation is fantastic. We loved the way each area weaved its way into the next one.

The HMS Beagle as a setting was genius! The aquarium, polar bear and jungle themes were just so beautifully done. Special mention to the panther area. You walk through a woodland setting and see what looks like the animal walking across your path ahead! In reality, you're separated (quite rightly!) by a clear window. But it looks so real and you feel that you're in with the animals.

It's a shame the little road train going round the park was a trade-up. It's not a cheap place to visit. This should have been included with the admission price.

From a geek's point of view, the free Wi-Fi was so fast that we were able to download several TV programmes to watch at our accommodation later!

My son loves how close you can get to some of the animals and also how knowledgeable the staff are about them.

The zoo is very big so be prepared for a lot of walking, but there are also a lot of nice places to sit and eat your sandwiches or to buy food. The 2 playgrounds are quite good for if the kids (or the adults!) need a break from the animals.

This is by far the best zoo I have ever been to and would highly recommend it to anyone, even those who don't really like animals.

The oceanariam was excellent, make sure you see this.
The only downside was when you get off the metro, there are no signposts directing you, we asked in a shop directions.
So when you get off the metro at blijdorplaan turn right to the church, cross over by the lights and take a left and follow the road down till you find it.

The ticket price seemed a little expensive at first, but wow, it was so great, it was well worth double the price. I was lucky with the weather, as the zoo is vast and requires quite a lot of walking in the open air. It was busy there, but pleasantly so. Blijdorp has a massive range of animals, many of which I've never seen before in other zoos, and most of which are easy to see whilst maintaining some privacy for the creatures. I've visited about 10 zoos, but this was the only one with a walk-through aquarium tunnel. The toilet/baby-changing area near the aquarium was also sparkling clean. The walk from Rotterdam train station is not particularly far and quite pleasant too. Really very good indeed, especially for a family day out.

It is one of the easier zoo's to navigate, the staff are very professional and the range of animals on show is diverse enough to keep you entertained, i would recommend seeing the meerkats, tigers and seals and going to the sealife section and seeing the penguins, sharks and stingrays. A great afternoon out and very family friendly.",Jun 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,3.0,Very good activity for families. Beautiful nature. Different animals. The places where you can eat offered different things. Enjoy!,Jul 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"This was a stop-off on our journey between Europoort and Venlo and was an amazing experience. We have visited several Zoos (London, Chester, Magdeburg) but this has to be the best, simply because the animals seemed to be enjoying themselves and were not hiding away behind high fences. On the contrary some animals were so close (safely behind glass or an open ditch of course) that you felt you could engage with them. I've never seen a polar bear throwing a toy in the air and jumping to catch it or a family of elephants playing with such enthusiasm in the water of a pond. Entrance is €22 per person and €8.50 for car parking which I considered expensive at the time but having spent 4 hours amongst some wonderful creatures it was money well spent.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"This zoo is a must see! I recommend this to anyone who is visiting the Netherlands not just Rotterdam. You need a full day to make the most of your visit, we arrived just after lunch and stayed until it closed and there were still things for us to see. There is a large aquarium and other indoor enclosures so even if the weather is changeable you can still enjoy your visit. In terms of location it is quite close to the station (approximately a slow 10 minute walk) so is brilliant for anyone traveling by train. All in all this is an amazing place to visit and is suitable for all the family, I can not recommend it highly enough!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Visited here as part of our trip to Duinrell. We have 2 boys with Autism and its not everywhere they can manage but this was perfect. It's the cleanest Zoo I have ever seen and the best smelling too. The oceanic area is mesmerising. The boys would have stayed there all day. It's divided into regions like Africa and Asia and the sign posts are all symbols so you can't get lost. Really well laid out.
Give yourself lots of time to get around it. We were there about 6 hours and didn't see it all. They have little 'buggy' like things and wheelchair hire on site. It's really disabled friendly. Highly recommended.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Since I first visited blijdorp 15 years ago, I saw a gradual change from a typical old-fashioned zoo where animals were kept in way to small cages and concrete environments to something that might be the best zoo experience possible in an urban environment. Today almost all exhibits are modernised and the renovated parts are very nicely themed to the regions the animals originate from. Not the largest zoo(+- 3-4 hours), and best on a sunny afternoon.",May 2016

We have had gold passes for Colchester zoo for many years so we used these to get into the zoo for free, but it is worth paying for anyway. There are many animals here that Colchester doesn't have, polar bears probably being the best. The young ones really looked like they were enjoying themselves! All the rays, sharks and turtles were wonderful to watch and the butterfly house is amazing. The playground was brilliant and the ice cream I had while watching the children on it was one of the creamiest I have ever tasted!",Jun 2016

Sumilian/monkey grove is very cool for kids.",May 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,The main attraction is the aquarium where you can walk through a tunnel and experience a walk through water. The tunnel is made of glass and you can see sharks and sting rays very close and right above your head. Penguins and the butterfly done park is also another attraction. Other things are normal like any other Zoo.,May 2016
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"A decent place that you can cover in 3-4 hours, without walking way too much. The tropical zone, the okapis and giraffes were amazing. The oceanium felt a bit old and tired. Lots of places to eat and drink along the different stops. Not very crowded.",May 2016

And we were there for five hours! Just to give an idea. We were glued to the only real herd of elephants in Europe doing their thing for almost an hour.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"I go to Blijdorp at least once a year, even when I am living abroad I make time to visit this Zoo with my children whenever I come home.

The Zoo has two entrances, the old one that you can reach when you come from the center of town, which is the entrance closest to the tigers, gorillas, the amur panter and the indoor playground (just to name a few) and then there is the other entrance that you can reach from the highway, it has a huge parking and this is the entrance closest to the Oceanium, the butterflies and the polar bears.

What I like best in this Zoo is:
- the Oceanium... it is not just a huge aquarium, but it is a Zoo in itself with pinguins, sea lions and so much more... the biggest variety of sea animals/ creatures that I have ever seen in a Zoo. You can spent more than an hour just walking around here...
- The Polar bear area... specially now that the mother has two youngsters. There is always one in the water...
- The butterfly pavilion... it is the biggest butterfly pavilion in the Netherlands, with of course a lot of butterflies, but also many other animals that can be seen if you take the time.
- The new lion area. The Asian lions were moved to a new enclosure... which is better for all. The lions seem to be more at ease and visitors can see them from all sides (in good and bad weather). Also the indoor enclosure for the lions is bigger and more animal friendly.
- Next to the indoor playground there is an old part that is quiet with tropical birds in smaller enclosures and once flying freely in a much bigger area... here you can sit and relax as a lot of people seem to miss this part.
- You should see the Gorilla Bokito... with his 20 years he is an impressive silverback.... they have a huge outdoor enclosure, also the indoor one is big, but a bit strangel divided into three big rooms... depending on where they are sitting it can be a challenge to see him as crowds seem to form just to get a glimpse.
- the giraffes have a nice in and outdoor area, just also here it can be a bit crowded when they are indoors.

But there is so much more to see.... the elephants, the wolves, the tropical birds enclosures (there are several ones), the other monkeys, the amur panter, the black rhinos, there are asian rhinos too, of course there are tigers.... (and I'm not even close to naming all the animals in the Zoo yet).

If you have the time and it is a sunny day then take a four or five hour break and you will see most of the oo... still I think to see it all without rushing it will take a whole day.

I love this zoo, so do my children... There are more nice Zoos in the Netherlands, but this one is the closest to my house and also in the top four of the best ones here.

If you like animals and love to go to Zoos then this place can't be missed!.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Rotterdam zoo - Dierengaarde Blijdorp is an excellent destination for a day out. It is located approximately 10 minutes from the central station. The zoo is very spacious and all the animals are in different categories depending on their origin. This seems to give each animals a lot of space to live and develop. The animals look very happy and well kept which is nice in such a large commercial zoo. There is something for everyone at this zoo, no matter what your preference.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Dierengaarde Blijdorp offers a fantastic day out. This really is one of the best zoos I have ever visited. All the animals look lively, happy and well-cared for in large, well-planted enclosures. Blijdorp obviously has some very successful breeding programmes too, which again shows they must be looking after the animals well.

The animal houses are really well-designed, allowing the animals to be viewed to their best advantage (for example the giraffe house, where you can view the animals from a platform at their eye level). The elephant enclosure was also impressive - so nice to see the young elephants splashing about in a stream. Even the polar bears (which often look so sad in captivity) seemed content in a large enclosure with a deep clean lake to swim in.

This zoo seems to major on animals that do well in captivity, rather than trying to cover the whole animal kingdom. Not so many big cats, for example, which must be a good thing.

The Amazonica butterfly house and the extensive Oceanica aquarium are also very well presented, with interesting displays of different eco-systems.

In contrast to many other zoos, the Blijdorp cafes are really nice, serving interesting food. We particularly liked the cafe in 'Asia' which had attractive decor and some tempting Turkish pizzas. The Caribbean cafe at the end of the Aquarium was also very nice. The food wasn't even overpriced (a first for zoo visit!)

Arrive early at 9.00 when the zoo opens and don't expect to leave before 14.00. A great day out.

It is good to see animals that you don't normally see at zoos such as Polar Bears and get within touching distance of Giraffes and Prairie Dogs. Our 5 year old daughter loved everything including the play areas where she made friends with a little Dutch girl.

The animals looked well cared for. We enjoyed seeing the baby elephant, the gorillas, giraffes, lions, polar bears, not to mention the large oceanarium. Most sea life centres are smaller. This zoo had a huge tunnel through a large tank with sharks, stingrays, fish and a giant turtle.
The restaurants on site were not the usual ripoff prices and served a good selection of food and drinks. We were there for 4 hours but could easily stayed for another 2.

At 22 euros each this place is a bargain and a great day out. The buses back to centraal run regularly too :)",Nov 2015
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"If you have time in Rotterdam, that's a good place to visit. That's a big zoo that divided the different species of animals per continent. It's necessary the minimum of 4h to visit the whole zoo.",Nov 2015

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"We came here a few years ago and didn't manage to walk around all of it, so have been back for another visit.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,Diergaarde Blijdorp is a great Zoo at the city center of Rotterdam. If you are visiting the city the Zoo is worth seeing. The animals in the Zoo reside mainly in 'biodomes' and are well treated.,Oct 2015
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"We were among the earliest arrivals for the day and among the last to leave in the evening but we still didn’t see everything. We started by heading for the Polar bear enclosure to see the nine month old twin cubs then via the Asian Lion to see the two week old Asian elephant. We worked our way round to lunch in the main restaurant via Asian animals and then entered African territory for Rhinos and Gorillas and hippos. By this time, we realised that we only had time to go to either the Oceanium or the Butterfly house. The Oceanium won.
So we didn’t see the butterflies, or the giraffes or the zebras or the bison or . . .
For Dutch or English speaking individuals, there is largely no problem with the notices and captions. Some information and the ‘animals bite’ warnings were, however, only in Dutch. All animal descriptions are in Dutch and English and the species are also given their Linnean and German names. In the Oceanium, however, whilst the naming follows the same convention, there are no descriptions in anything other than Dutch and the general information was also only in Dutch. This did not spoil our enjoyment, however, as it is the animals, birds and fish that we actually went to see.
The adult entry price is €22, children €17.50 (or €19 and €15.50 if one can get, in advance on an on-line, print your own tickets, basis). The snack and meal prices are no more expensive than many places around and were cheaper than some. All-in-all then, we felt that we got our value for money and will have to visit again to see the animals, birds and butterflies that we missed this time round.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"I went there with friends after we spotted it online and thought it was the best to spend some hours in before we headed to the concert.

And we were right: it was great!

The cages are well made and I saw no animal pacing in circles. Everything seemed clean, the food was good and we had a lot of fun. The area with the butterflies was really awesome! They also offered a bird show, but we somehow always missed it.

The Oceanium is simply awesome and so worth a look! And I also really loved the asian garden! And you also can get really close to the Wallabies!

The butterfly enclosure is amazing as it is a dome filled with all different species but it is very warm inside so don't wear jackets and jumpers. There is a bird show every day and the food is an average price if you do not bring your own. There are hours of fun to be had for adults and children and the train station is a 10minute walk away.",Oct 2015

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Although expensive, worth the money for a full day of family fun.
Two entrances. The 'original' one in the front (near the flamingo's) or the one at the Oceanium side and also the side where the big parkinglot is.

Just so you know...when you arrive at Rotterdam Centraal Station by train, take the back exit (direction spoorsingel) and in 15min you can walk to the 'original' entrance from Blijdorp.

Once inside Blijdorp there is a
small 'Blijdorp' train running from one side of the Zoo to the other side for around €1 pp.

They are making a big effort to create a natural environment for all animals. They are always updating or renovating parts of the Zoo, but not to worry as you won't notice. They are taking fantastic care for the animals here.
Dont forget to check the times they feed the popular animals like tigers, lions and sharks. If you check this when you enter the Zoo, you can build your walking route around it.

For the children they have a fantastic playground. Try to avoid this untill the end of your visit here because most children do not want to leave once they are there.

Enjoy.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"Diergaarde Blijdorp is a dead-set beautiful zoo, and I have spent many a day wandering through the beautifully landscaped grounds.

It's divided into geographical regions, with each region themed with the flora of the region.

I particularly like the oceanium, which takes at least 20 minutes to walk through (longer if you take the time to really explore it) the amazonica enclosure (which is hot and humid, and completely full of butterflies - it feels like a fairy tale), and being able to get up close and personal with the prairiehondjes.

My kids are big fans of the two massive playgrounds (one indoor, one outdoor)

It's definitely worth a visit, and one of the first places I take visitors to Rotterdam to visit.

Devided in continents you're able to see a great variety of animals in micro natural habitats. The past 20 years Blijdorp Zoo has transformed from a typical City Zoo into what it is now: natural, sustainable and with a lot of respect for animal welfare.

Afrika, Asia, Europe, Ocean, Desert are a few of many isotopes build, housing a vast amount of diversity. Elephants, Rino's, Polar Bears, Bisons, Camels, Indian Tigers, Lions, Birds, Butterflies, Gorillas, Oerang Utang, Reptiles, Sharks, insects, and many many more.

Only downside is the small variety in catering possibilities. basic food and snacks, that is it. But than again, enjoy the Zoo and have Dinner in Town afterwards.

They are a good distraction from the visits around for children who are bored with just seeing the animals.",Oct 2014

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,4.0,"Lovely zoo (well as nice as they can be), quite small/ compact with parking on the door step.

We visited whilst on our way to the Europort for a ferry home to England. About 45 mins from the ferry.

Well priced at around 80 EUR for a family of four incl car parking.

If you have young ones I'd suggest hiring one of the animal shaped strollers - we made a mistake and didn't!

Animal areas looked clean, as were the paths and toilets. But if shame you had to pay for the internal train.

Underwater/ sea area our favourite - especially the walk through water tunnel. Very cramped / crowded though.

For a city zoo the big cats, polar bears and elephants looked very cramped. Better if they didn't have these, or had less big animals and more space for them.

Amazon zone was excellent, get read for the humidity and giant lolly pads.

Overall a good well priced zoo, great location for the city, but big animals looked cramped.

We compared this to Chester Zoo (UK) and think that Chester Zoo is a much better experience, Rotterdam is a big zoo with lots to see and do, has a great children's play area and there are a few food stalls, animals look well cared for but there just seems to be very few animals in there!

Enter at the Aquarium and see an underwater world of sharks and stingrays swimming above your head in a glass enclosed tunnel. We were in there an hour just looking at all the different fish. You can walk along a pathway around the giraffe enclosure and then into the giraffe house and see them feeding. There are signposts to all the animal enclosures and everywhere is easy to find. Particularly liked the layout as there were secluded pathways with trees and shrubbery leading you around the zoo. There was an amazing logged children's castle with slides and swings plus an indoor adventure park if it is raining. We stayed for 5 hours and it was well worth 19 euros as the tickets were purchased online before we went otherwise its 22 euros each. Plenty to do and see and would highly recommend this zoo.

The is enough variation in the enclosures so that they stay interesting for the visit. In some places you can walk inside the bird enclosures, look at the polar bears when they are swimming, walk above the hyenas and many other interesting areas.
