Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"This is a magnificent museum with incredible collections. It's a must see when visiting Amsterdam. Purchase ticket online prior to visit to reserve entrance time...even with that though you will still need to stand in line to get in. However, the line moves quickly.",Nov 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,It is one of the best museums in Netherlands. If you have 3/4 hours time than you have to visit it. You can buy ticket directly infront of the museum with QR code. Inside you also have a restaurant and cafeteria.,Nov 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,Very clean and excellent display of everything! I did not feel that any room was overcrowded with people or art. There is a coat check and restrooms were spotless.,Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I think, that the art collected in this museum gives the visitor great study of The Neverlands history and art development over centuries. This is one of the best (if not the best) museum in Amsterdam. One cannot miss it during stay in the city.
I think it is the only museum worth the ticket price!",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"Loved it, must visit when your in Amsterdam, so good that Rijksmuseum is open again for public after covid.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,This was a good museum to understand not nly art but also the history of the Netherlands. One could spend the whole day but it may still not be enough,Oct 2021

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"If you love art, this is an essential stop. ""The Night Watch"" is currently under restoration, but it is still observable from behind the large protective glass window for those who work. A little disappointment for us, but acceptable given the importance of the work.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I spent almost 6 hours there and time just flew by. It’s a bit difficult to navigate the space, but the quality of the art work are top and they are beautifully curated and presented. I especially enjoyed the current exhibit of “Remember Me” in the side wing.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,2.0,"Night watch has been torturously poured over by computer wizards for 5 years. I suggest they do their computer wizardry at night so the rest of us can just admire the master painting.
I like having a free audio app. However, there were no words that guided me from place to place so I was usually lost unable to find the highlighted item in the tour. Lastly, the timed entry may have been critical at certain times of year. Now, it seemed ludicrous that people were being sent away with a half empty museum because they're smartphones do not have international service and could not buy their tickets online. And, a little disappointing that the whole museum shuts down at 5:00",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,The title says it all. It also contains other exhibits such as old weaponry and models of ships. It is well worth the time and cost.,Sep 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,4.0,"Awesome experience, very nice building and paintings. Very big, so you have to take your time. Nice to do on your own.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,1.0,"What the Rijksmuseum doesn't tell you on their website is that in order to access the Museum Shop or the Museum Cafe you must have purchased an entry ticket of 20 Euros !!

I understand the need to control the numbers of people access the building during these times of Covid but there should be some accommodation. Tickets can be checked past the access to the shop and cafe.

Of course, this won't deter people from going to the Museum, which is incredible of course but just a notice to the public since the Rijksmuseum website doesn't advise that the shop and cafe are not accessible to everyone

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"Rijksmuseum is one of Holland’s most important museums and should definitely not be missed when visiting Amsterdam.

The building itself is also stunning.",Sep 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,Please do visit the museum and wear comfortable walking shoes or tennis shoes. The museum collections are large and truly remarkable.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I think I enjoyed the architecture of the building as much or more than the art! It is a lovely building. I appreciated the way it was layed out to not have numerous options of where to go next to be able to see everything. We did realize we had missed a whole section and had to ask how to get to that part. The gardens are lovely and there are chairs so you can sit in one of the gardens, which is nice.",Sep 2021

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,3.0,"This is a huge museum, with wonderful gardens displaying many works by the American Ellsworth Kelly. The Vermeer paintings are worth the trip. I would focus on the rooms displaying these master works and spend less time on subsequent eras of painting. The collecting has not been as deep or broad, and it shows. The worst part of the collection is 1950- 2000. First of all, it is impossible to find in the building -- I had a map but had to ask two attendants how to get into the two attics containing the ""collection."" What is displayed is not a good representation of the development of art through this period. It is obvious what is the heart of the museum.",Sep 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"Very impressed with the Rijksmuseum's wide range of art and relics spanning over such a long period of time, especially since all of the displays have an English translation. It is better to go earlier in the morning to avoid waiting in line.",Aug 2021

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,It's a good place to understand the phenomena of the golden age of Netherlands' art. The dept of the collection shows the context of the most well-known masterpieces.,Aug 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,3.0,If you are concerned with Covid safety protocols this museum is not for you (which is why I gave it 3/5). The collection is impressive but with that it is a little overwhelming add to that the crowds (they maybe need to restrict the numbers - especially during the Covid pandemic- which is not over!). Particularly impressive was Rembrandt’s Night Watch. Worth a visit but maybe book ticket earlier and it would be less busy.,Aug 2021
Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"It is the most deep and most richest museum of the world, concerning painting art of the 16th and 17th century. Is like heaven te be there, and just to sit en feel the deep athmosfeer. The unique technic the artist used, is very good visible. It is never reachable for other museum.

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,5.0,"I visited over 100 museums and Rijksmuseum is still my top number one museum in the world until now. Even if I live in Amsterdam, I still enjoy visiting once in two months and still get curious and excited about this museum. What makes the Rijksmuseum one of the world’s most famous museums is the fame of the masterpieces in its collection.

No matter how old you are, or where you’re from, you’ll discover something new at the Rijksmuseum.",Jun 2021

Netherlands,Rijksmuseum,3.0,"It was impressive. The size- and. the organisation of the museum was fabulous inside. Waiting time was ok, but i found the lines to be disorganise and disruptive. It’s important to make a reservation online and within a feasible hour, u less you are with a member, otherwise you waste time in the waiting line (as they do not distinguish the differences). However, it’s a nice experience with alot of beautiful artwork and historical education. The museum is smaller than first impressions. They have a lovely cafe inside, which serves good food and beverages suitable for vegetarian/vegan. .",Jun 2021

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Emotional experience visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. I just read the book last year for the first time.

The Nazis murdered over 100,000 of the Jews in Amsterdam. Authoritarian populism starts with the dehumanizing of groups of people. First they are banned from certain places & activities, then they are marked, then they are shoved into ghettos, then the murder starts. This progression was highlighted in the Dutch Résistance Museum, a good compliment to the Anne Frank House.

In this time, 2021, humanity needs to be aware of & vigilant against creeping right wing authoritarianism. It can happen again.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"I wanted to visit this museum for years, ever since I read the Diary, the museum and the house was everything I expected and overall it is a heartfelt experience.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"We were 4 adults and we had the best experience with Rudy's Taxi. Rudy and his wife Katja are both experienced tour guides. Day 1 was with Katja giving us a walking tour of the city and she gave us so much information in a friendly way and also made us taste local snacks on the way like Herring and eel. She did not rush us and we felt like we were with a friend.
Next day Rudy drove us through the countryside in his luxurious Mercedes van and we stopped and strolled through many little villages, then went to Markem a beautiful fishing village, we also stopped at dairy farm, wooden shoe factory, Edam, Volendam, Gouda, ka Steel de Haar, Delft, Monikerdam, Nijmegen and the windmills. All in the next two days, driven once by Rudy and once by Katja. On the day we were to board our ship, Rudy picked us up from our hotel and dropped us off at the port even though we asked him to do this last minute.
They are also multilingual and spoke fluent English as well as German and Portuguese. Highly recommend Rudy's Taxi to anyone visiting Amsterdam.

It's one of those experiences that will stick with you for a while after, so plan on more leisurely sightseeing afterward (easy to do given the local/surrounding area).

Tickets can be bought in advance. If you're a single ticket person or only need a couple of tickets you can look up what is available day-of (Covid policies may change this).",Sep 2021

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This is a very simply presented overview of Anne Frank's story, her diary, and the annex in which she and her family lived for more than two years. I appreciated the space and sparseness of the presentation. It created space to think about the absence of all the missing from that time.",Sep 2021
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"My favorite part was the introductory program (additional fee) prior to going into the Anne Frank House. The house itself is now empty (I wish they would stage the furniture for a more realistic experience) But it is still a very powerful and moving experience. The introductory program really made the whole visit worthwhile. It explained the timeline, details about the other people that were in hiding and the factors that allowed a innocent group of people to be villainized and persecuted.",Sep 2021

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,3.0,"It is a nice experience, but price too high when compared to what other museums offer. The museum itself we enjoy it. It has good information, but also is missing something, inside the rear house, it says that Anne Frank shared room with her sister, but in the video at the end and the model of the house says Anne shared the room with the dentist. Also, it was never mentioned that Mr. Frank took off some pages of the diaries before publishing them, As a museum, all the information should be provided.",Sep 2021

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,Make sure that you book your tickets online before you go or you will not get in - very popular. This is by far one of the most moving experiences that I've ever had in a museum/historical place. You cannot take pictures inside but this visit is something that will stay with you. The self-guided tour is very interactive (you listen to a young girl reading excerpts from Anne's diary as you visit each room) and you really get a sense of what these poor people had to endure. The climb up the stairs to the Secret Annex is challenging - need to be in reasonable shape. Don't leave Amsterdam without doing this tour.,Aug 2021

As an half hebrew I can only say thank you to all the works done in order to keep focus on MEMORY and on past experience, to not commit the same atrocity as yesterday.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,We visited the house with our 4 (usually noisy) children aged between 8 and 15. We opted to do the 30 minute presentation before and it was so worth it. The children got a clear view of the back story of WW2 and could ask many questions. I felt the audio program was great for kids as we could all go at our own speed and they loved finding the audio points in each room. We all learned so much about the atrocious treatment of the Jewish people during this time as well as learning about Anne Frank herself. I would highly recommend visiting. Make sure you book ahead of time as tickets sell out very fast!,Jun 2021
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"This was an incredible journey into the lives of Dutch Jews and their plight. The museum and house are integrated in a way that each step builds upon the previous.

Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,Amazing place to visit when in Amsterdam. I read Anne Frank's book many times and had researched her story so found it all very interesting. Booking online is a must and arrive 15-20mins before allocated time as ques are very long......all the time.,Jun 2021
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,The horrors are real and the feelings are strong when strolling through Anna Frank's House. History is what shapes us and it is important to make trips to the past sometimes.,Jun 2021
Netherlands,Anne Frank House,5.0,"Took advantage of the Covid season to visit before the place was opened to tourists. There were still a lot of people tho and you need to book your tickets early still. There were people who showed up on the day itself wanting to get tickets but were refused since tickets for the day were already sold out. We ourselves got our tickets about 2wks before the trip cos we booked as soon as they opened up their tickets purchasing again with the easing of lockdown(not bad considering you normally have to book months in advance)

The tour itself includes a free audio guide in a language of your choice but prior to visiting, I recommend knowing more about the life of Anne Frank beforehand to really appreciate this experience much more.

Don't expect much from the museum, it's very simple and come here simply for the experience of seeing first hand the place were Anne Frank and her family (and a few others) lived in hiding.

Netherlands,Markthal,3.0,"The architecture is kind of cool, but hardly unique.
There are many stalls that sell variety of food. However, a number of them don't accept credit card. And because of covid, they don't take cash either. So even if we wanted something we cannot pay for it, which is kind of dumb.

Wound up eating some fish and chips. Greasy as hell.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"How does a pocket sized portrait art museum with stunning art in each Sala sound?
Yes, done in 2-3 hours so you have time to explore the rest of the city.
Maybe eat a warm stroop waffle or some ""Dutch"" fries?
Of course, being in the Netherlands, there is more Rembrandt than you ever knew existed.
Each portrait has an explanation next to it leaving you with a sense of education and completeness.
The tour times are booked online so there is no overcrowding.

Everyone needs to stare for a while.

Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,4.0,"Nice place, fair price, easy to go and a small collection. At this museum, you'll see the best of the Dutch paintings. In one hour, you'll see everything with ease. If you go to Den Haar, it's a must.",Aug 2021
Netherlands,The Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery,5.0,"A museum of great elegance and sobriety, with impressive collections of great Dutch artists, and not only, with an impressive number of paintings by Rembrandt, but also Vermeer, Van Eyck, etc. Too bad the museum has as few halls as it owns.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,1.0,"My husband and I came in on the train from Bruges. Leaving Bruges, the directions were clear and easy. Once in Ghent, the experience was quite the opposite. We could not figure out which tram to take to Saint Bevos. Help was scarce and misdirection was also common. St. Bevos personnel were at best courteous but more inclined to scold. The virtual tour was shorter than other tours Why? Who knows. The altarpiece was magnificent. The rest was lacking in any type of spiritual renewal. Ghent, itself was dirty and many of the shops were closed. Instead of spending the day in Ghent, following the Rick Steves self guided tour, we scurried back to Bruges.",Aug 2021

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,5.0,"Terrific tourguide, fantastic tour! So cool to roam the streets of Gent with a pack of tourists at night and to hear all about Gents mideavals whereabouts.

Netherlands,Ghent City Center,4.0,"A very nice city to visit with family. When we were there, it was raining nearly always. So it was a bit nuisance but still we had a great time.

Netherlands,Canals area,5.0,"Utrecht is worth checking it out as a daytrip from example either from Amsterdam or if you live in West Germany like me. You can see the canal area in the center very quickly, there is the old and the new canals. The old ones are the ones full of bars and restaurants. The canals have two floors. It is nice for pictures but can get boring pretty easily. Do not plan too much time for this city.",Aug 2021
Netherlands,Canals area,5.0,The canals area is a must see when in Utrecht. The area has lots of photo opportunities and are busy with pleasure boats and paddle boarders. There a lots of pubs and restaurants to choose from along the banks from ordinary pubs to really high class restaurants and cocktail bars. Mr H and I loved the atmosphere although we did find it difficult to get a table on a Saturday night so would advise to book early if wanting to eat in any of restaurants in this area.,Aug 2021

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Fantastic journey into Maastricht history with the best guide, Michael. Full of so much information on the tunnels and very witty. Thank you from England!",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,We came to Maastricht just for this tour. Our English guide Ernest was phenomenal. He clearly loves his work and took great care in showing us a collection of interesting focal points that I would never have expected to see. His passion for the subject matter and all the little details makes all the difference between a good tour and a great one.,Oct 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,Excellent tour from guide Willy in English. Great stories and insights about the history of the tunnels. Great experience overall.,Oct 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I took the 60min guides tour “De Grotten Noord” for €9,50 per persoon. The tour was great. To group was about 21 people. Our guide Willy was very great. He talked very loud and clear. He share some funny stories and was really friendly. He also give us some tip about the other tours and things to see/do in Maastricht. The this tour about 60m was too short. I did not expected the tour to be so good. It was good to have him as our guide.
I also recommend the tour. If you can, try to book the tour with the museum. The tour is about 1h 45m.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"It was a good experience, I chose an English tour. The tour guide provides a wealth of historical stories and origins, it is highly recommended to stop by here if you visit Maastricht. The restaurants over there is also good.",Oct 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Very interesting. Also if you're not interested in military history, there are a lot of interesting points to pick up. Many things I didn't know. Ed made the tour informative and interesting, partly because of his jokes. The jokes could've come straight out of Monty python.",Oct 2021

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"Very interesting tour in English (book in advance to avoid being disappointed). The guide was full of knowledge and the tour unlike anything I have done before. We did the Zonneberg Tunnels. If you arrive by car, it is not very well sign-posted, so don't park at the bottom of the hill because there is a car park at the top and lovely old cafe/restaurant with wonderful views/",Aug 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,4.0,"Very cool to see these passages underneath the city and surroundings. Fortunately, we chose the tour in English, but our tour guide spoke super fast. The pace at which we moved through the caves was also fast, giving little time to do any exploration or ask about some other works of art that our tour guide didn’t address. I think the war tour would have been a bit more interesting than the art one as the art is relatively new in history terms. If you suffer from claustrophobia then this visit is not for you. I suffer a little bit, but asking to hold the lantern (& my husband’s hand who helped me through my initial panic) got my through the first part, and when it opened up to higher ceilings, I was alright. In the end, glad we did it.

Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,We went on the guided tour of the northern caves with guide Michael and learned a lot about the caves. If you’re ever in the vicinity of Maastricht I’d definitely recommend going here!,Aug 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,We had taken the English tour for the North Caves and the Fort Sint Pieter. Both the tours were very well managed and both the guides were friendly and knowledgeable. Their English was great and they took time to explain the history and the whys and the whats. Special mention to Wim who was our guide for Sint Pieter as we were the only guests for the Fort(good for us). He was still very enthusiastic though the group size was only 2. So if you get Wim next time you are lucky.,May 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,3.0,"We did the English tour which was done by an originally Taiwan lady. Her English was not great and heavily accented which at times made it difficult to understand.

A mildly interesting tour. Not entertaining even.",Jun 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,"I attended both the Fort and North Cave tours in English — Jo was extremely kind, approachable and knowledgeable. Marion as well! they involved us by asking questions, guessing things or even hands on activities at times. It was super interactive and fun! I didn’t feel silly asking questions and they made the whole experience a 10/10. I will definitely come back again to visit the other cave, and highly recommend anyone interested to find out more to book the tours!",Jun 2021
Netherlands,Maastricht Underground,5.0,Very compelling and interesting! These caves are a Must-Know part of Dutch history. The guides knew how to present the facts and stories in captivating ways.,Apr 2021
Netherlands,DAF Museum,5.0,"Before visiting DAF Museum I was not so sure how good it could be compared to my experience visiting several Transport Museums in different countries. I must confess, I was completely mesmerized by seeing DAF Museum! With family, this could be a highly recommended half day trip to this museum. It is very conveniently located close to the city center. On a pleasant sunny day, this is at a walkable distance from the Eindhoven city center. Alternatively, you could catch a bus for couple of stops. It is not that huge in size being a transport museum, but the way the DAF Trucks & passenger vehicles collections are preserved & showcased for the visitors must be highly appreciated. The contribution of DAF as a company in transport evolution is beyond admiration. By visiting the DAF museum, you will be super convinced with that feeling. Their collection of true size & miniatures is really awe-inspiring. The visit can be complemented with the nice and cute museum souvenir winkel. You, particularly if you are accompanying kids, would be highly tantalized to take a couple of their collections with you as a lifetime memory. If you are a transport geek & have specific interest for Transport history, this is the museum for YOU. If you are visiting Eindhoven for at least a day or two, you cannot give it a miss; highly recommended. There are plenty of photo ops equally for selfie lovers & photographers. Kids in particular enjoy this place a lot!

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,5.0,"I visited the zoo with my family. We spent almost the whole day here as the zoo is huge and full of animals (polar bears, fishes etc.) We really enjoyed ourselves.",Jul 2021
Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,1.0,"Fully understanding that everybody is happy that we can go out and museums, restaurants and Zoos are open again, it was quite shocking to see how crowded it was. We chose Blijdorp for a small family birthday gathering, also to support the Zoo, as they financially suffered during lockdown. We booked tickets online, including a timeslot. The timeslot is for entry only, you can then stay as long as you wish. It was shocking to see how crowded it was, to the point that it was really discomforting. Talking to a Blijdorp-volunteer, we understood that 7100 visitors were allowed in the day we were there. Way to many!!! The 1.5m distancing could, in many many places, not be honoured. Nobody was wearing mouth/nose masks in the covered areas, which were places where 1.5m distance was absolutely not possible. Even outside it was at times difficult to keep 1.5m distance. There was virtually no control by staff. A pity.
Sorry Blijdorp, nice Zoo, but this was not good.

Netherlands,Rotterdam Zoo,3.0,"Everything is fine except the polar bear story. I sow on their web site they write a lot exactly about that bear, and they are very proud to have one, which is really great. But what is not great is that polar bears hardly can live in those conditions in the warm season. I really was happy that I am having the opportunity to see that amazing animal in live, but then I was so upset with what I actually saw. The bear was lying down in the shadow, very hardly breading because it was too hot, time to time put his/her head up, it was obvious that does not feel comfortable and that is too hot, after 40 -45min I went back to see if he moved, but even worst in that second time he/she even was lying completely in the ground with more heavy breathing. Due to the fact that exactly on their website there is a lot of data about that amazing animal, and it is very surprising knowing all those but not reacting accordingly. For me, that was something I didn't want to experience, because if it is already in captivity for any reason, then should have good living conditions or at least better...If they made for Amazonia animals a very warm tropical environment, I am sure that the bear can have a colder environment. Yes, there is a cold cave, how they are mentioning on the website, but through that cave, visitors are passing and the bear is still outside in the sun, or shadow, unless the moment when he/she is catching fish in the pool.
