Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"A building of such importance and with so much history. A must visit on any trip to Berlin.

However in these times of Covid there is one very important message to give and that is book early. If you see an on-line ""Visiting slot"" take it and sort the logistics out later. We could only secure a visit at 9.00 am on a Sunday morning, but were so glad we didn't hesitate.

For those who cannot book a tour, consider having a meal in the restaurant and using that as an opportunity to enter the building. An added bonus are the unrestricted views from the top of the building.

Finally if you do manage to hit the jackpot and get to visit then take time to carefully read what documentation / pre-registration is required. When we went they were strictly enforcing the rules and I am sure people are turned away.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"Reichstag is the parliament building in Berlin. The building houses the German Parliament, the Bundestag.

The building was built in 1894. In the 1990s, it was renovated and a glass dome was built.

Now the building is a true example of eco-architecture. The shape of the dome allows the building to make use of natural lighting.

At the moment, entering the building and the dome with panoramic views is possible only with an advance booking.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The building the SS presumably set on fire to instigate stricter measures against their opponents. Built about 50 years before WWII it has seen a lot of change. If you enter it, you can visit the roof, which offers both a view of the city, and the ability to look over the politicians at work inside the building, through the added glass dome.

It offers the opportuinity to reflect on whether Europe is moving forwards or backwards, and whether the Germans, who keeps trying to strenghten Europe by pushing for democratic erosion through the EU, is this time doing the right thing. Personally I think we have a long way to go before we see true transparancy in Europe.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"It's worthy of being treated as an example of how a Parliament building should be, and probably it's a depiction of what the German Nation stands for. It's classy, dignified, and understated; it's modern, but with its classical roots; it's grand, but not ostentatious. But more than anything, it states 3 very critical aspects, conveniently forgotten by other governments: 1. Provides access to the common man (it's our/their Govt. dammit) 2. Transparency, the dome is made of glass and so is the ceiling of the parliament floor for all to see 3. The citizen is physically placed higher than the parliamentarians, clearly stating how the power should flow.

No wonder, this nation is where it is, in merely 6 decades after being decimated. Kudos!

One important thing: do not forget your ID. I went around 8.30 pm and the view at night is spectacular. Furthermore, there were few people and I could take nice picture.

You are able to go inside, if you book a tour, and go up the dome. It looks directly into the parliament itself and also I am advised there is somewhere to eat up the top.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"We visited the Reichstag on invitation of my cousin who lives in Berlin. You have to pre book your visit online and submit passport details of you are not a German citizen, no worries around this.

To enter, you must first make it through an airport style security hall. I had my grandmother in a wheelchair and they made it very accommodating for her. We were taken personally to the lift due to having to go through some security critical areas. Once there, we were loaded into the lift first before we picked up a lot more people in the floor above. The lift then takes you directly to the top dome.

The views were excellent and you receive a free audio guide to talk you through what you can see. There is a very long spiral walkway up to the top and the audio guide is designed to know where you are on that walkway, then giving you information about the building and the views beyond.

At the top there is a viewing platform where you can rest and view the sights. Then follow the other spiral walkway which takes you back down, again, the audio guide is giving you timely information.

Overall, this is a wonderful place to visit, i would even pay for the privilege, but the fact it was free made it even better!

I checked online and saw that there was ONE slot left! 9:45PM. We took it. When I checked back the next day I saw that the next possible visit was 2 weeks away, so do what we did at your own risk. Glad we got to go.

The building was interesting to visit as it has a lot of history, including its burning as the Nazis came to power. Great view from the top and the glass dome. You can also walk around their exhibit and see the history of the building.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,Important tip : Register for free in advance to visit the Dome of the Reichstag. I would recommend starting your trip to Berlin by a visit to the Reichstag first. Easy to get to by the metro. Spectacular views and information of history .,Apr 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The Reichstag Building is the current home of the German Parliament, and as such, boasts a prime location on the banks of the River Spree. Over the years, it‚Äôs survived Nazi rule, wars, bombings, the country‚Äôs division and even a fire. In 1933, only four weeks after Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, the Reichstag Building was subject to a mysterious arson attack and almost destroyed by flames. Following the fire, the police conducted a search and accused a Dutch council communist of starting it. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler then urged the president to pass an emergency degree, which led to the mass arrests of the entire Communist Party of Germany and left the Nazi Party unchallenged. This enabled Hitler to consolidate his power.

The Reichstag Building‚Äôs present-day appeal, however, lies on its roof rather than its history. The large glass dome offers visitors a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. Mirrors integrated in the dome reflect natural light and illuminate the parliamentary chamber below. From an architectural standpoint, it‚Äôs unique and seemingly futuristic. From a photography standpoint, it‚Äôs very visually pleasing and many of you will find different and creative ways of capturing it.

I visited during the day and found it breath-taking. I read online that after dark it‚Äôs even better! The dome is free to visit but an online registration needs to be filled out and submitted prior to your arrival.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"There is so much information to absorb on a visit, you really need to have a guide, ours was excellent and easy going, there was the odd dumb question from the group but they were dealt with in a polite and courteous manner. Its an amazing building and experience, make sure to bring photo id or you won't get in!",Feb 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The Reichstag is a main edifice of the Bundestag - the German Parliament (the lower house) in the very city center, 5 min walk from the Brandenburg gate. It's a remarkable bldg with a significant history, so seeing only the exterior is far from enough for any serious traveller. Therefore, I recommend booking a tour of it.
And, I suggest doing that as soon as possible - beware, it fills up quickly.
The process is very easy on the Bundestag website, it's totally free and you can do that for 3 months in advance. There are several options to choose from, but I recommend a guided tour followed by the Dome visit.
Have in mind, you cannot either climb the Dome without prebooking and written confirmation (you can take your chance by queuing outside if they have spaces left, but why should you do that when you can arrange everything with no stress).
You book a date and a time slot (you have an option to name 3 of them that best suit you, and you'll be assigned one of them). You have to be there 30 min prior the assigned time WITH a PRINTED voucher (confirmation). Be prepared for airport style security.
The tour lasts around 90 min during which you must not leave your guide. It's very informative and interesting and you visit various parts of the Bundestag. Best part is naturally the Reichstag main debate room where the Parliament meets with the enormous eagle, designed by a Dutch architect. Beside that you're taken to other parts of Bundestag via underground hallways, like the part where're the member's offices across the library (which is the third largest in the world) and visit the small drawers hall where are drawers of all Parliament members through history with the exemption of the Nazi period whose drawer is black. The only thing I doubt being authentic are the Soviet soldier's graffiti when they captured the bldg - they look too fresh for a 75 years period.
After the tour you're left on your own to admire and climb the fabulous glass Dome and enjoy the views from the Reichstag terrace.
Count on around 2-2,5 hrs for the entire experience, which is really a must do in Berlin and absolutely free.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"We were unsure what to expect with this tour but were blown away by the experience. After having visited the Capitol and White House in DC we expected this tour to be similar but could not have been more wrong. The building was rebuilt to be contemporary yet also historical at the same time. Having the guided tour is very worth the effort as you are able to get a true sense of the ideology and ask all the questions you didn't even know you would have. The building and governmental system represents a shift of the mindset that is truly unique. The design specifically addresses the atrocities of the past and their commitment to never repeat them. A must on anyone visiting Berlin.

Well with it.",Mar 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"We had enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the K√§fer roof top restaurant at the Reichstag building one Monday back in February and afterwards went on to explore the glass dome of this iconic building. It was well after 10 o'clock in the evening and we virtually had the place to ourselves. We had time to read all about the history of the building before slowly walking upwards & around in a spiral towards the very top. The nighttime views of Berlin were fantastic.

I was fascinated by the large mirrored cone in the centre of the dome which apparently directs sunlight into the building. It cleverly allow views right the way down to the main debating chamber a long way below. And I learned that the whole idea of allowing the public access above the debating chamber was to symbolize that people are above the German Government - this certainly wasn't the case during the Nazi years. And the futuristic design of the dome, created by the British architect Norman Foster was designed to herald a departure from Nazism to a modern, reunified Germany.

At that time of night there were hardly any other visitors - just numerous security staff who were more than willing to chat and explain things. I didn't realise, for example that there is no roof at the top of the glass dome - it is open to the elements right up there.

All in all this felt like a private visit to one of the most significant landmarks in Berlin, probably Germany and possibly the world. Unforgettable!!!

Germany,Reichstag Building,4.0,"I prebooked the free tour a couple weeks before my trip in January and had no problem getting my first choice of time/date. I was in Berlin for a week in January and the weather was unseasonably warm and clear for my visit; with the exception of the day of my Reichstag tour. It was a cloudy, drizzly, and cold morning when I arrived at the security checkpoint. My tour time was one of the first that morning and there was no waiting; I went right in and went through the airport style security check. From there, a group of tourists was escorted inside the building and to the lift. At the top of the elevator, there is a counter where they hand out the audio guides (the audio activates automatically at different points in the dome). The audio tour is interesting. You can walk around the roof area as well as go up the circular ramp to the top of the dome. It is an impressive building with an interesting history and on clear days, you get a great view of Berlin. The prebooking makes it difficult to plan your visit around the weather (the day before was a picture-postcard, beautiful-blue-cloudless-skies day.
There is a cafe on the roof which can also be prebooked and there are public toilets near the audio guide counter/lifts.

It‚Äôs free to book, and we were lucky going in January as I believe it would‚Äôve been harder to book a day or two in advance if it was a busier time.

The Reichstag was incredibly interesting and it was very secure (as expected) but it didn‚Äôt feel rushed looking around. Once inside, you had as much or little time as you wanted to explore the glass dome.

On arrival have your letter of invitation (this will be emailed to you) and official ID such as passport or drivers licence with you. Airport style security will provide entry to this building with a huge amount of history behind it.

Then he stomped over to us turned the exit sign (which was faced the wrong way) around slamming it down onto the floor throwing an actual tantrum like a toddler! He turned the sign which was still facing the wrong way and glared at us. Walked off to his friends and spoke about us in their own language.

We loved how they saved the facade but modernized the building. Being in the dome felt almost like being a fish in a bowl on that rainy nite: I imagine in the spring or a clear night it might be even more magical. Definitely worth making the reservation....it's FREE!!!,Feb 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"This free, self guided tour must be pre-booked for security reasons. We arrived ahead of our appointed time but didn't have to wait. There was a certain amount of bureaucracy and unnecassary ""herding"" of visitors but once on the observation platform there was plenty of room to move and admire the views. The free audio guide points out all the sights, tells you about German politics and the construction of the dome. What an amazing piece of architecture! Well done Norman Foster!",Feb 2020

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,We took a trip to the dome at night to look out over Berlin and it was definitely worth it. The staff were very efficient at getting us up and in and we could spend as long as we liked up there. The dome is beautiful and the views of the city are very pretty. The dome design also makes it very easy for people with mobility issues to see everything.,Mar 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"If you are looking for free views of Berlin, this is the best place to go to. Just make sure you sign up for entry a few weeks before so that there are spaces available. It was quick to get into. The security were a bit rude in terms of not speaking to us properly but I guess that is what you get when you are going into a government building. What I loved about the dome is the free audioguides. I learnt a lot as the guides gave enough detail about the city. I would deinitely recommend when in Berlin.",Feb 2020

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The building is actually more impressive up close in real life. Truly monumental. You have to book ahead but it all worked smoothly on the day and we were quickly up to the dome.

There are information panels giving you a good overview of how the building sits at the heart of German history. The free audio guide kicks in as you walk up the dome describing all the landmarks of Berlin. You can walk around the roof too.

All in all an essential part of a visit to Berlin and even better it is totally free.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"It's iconic and represents German determination and resilience. It is a symbol of retaking the promising past of Berlin, which was an important cosmopolitan progressive cultural center and an important city for many ""firsts"" in LGBTQ history in particular, away from the dark presence of a very sinister era. The dome is beautiful and it's fun to go to the very top (it seems). I couldn't do it as I was too tired after walking two days in Paris, then two days in Vienna.... The view is gorgeous. Keep in mind that you should make a reservation to go in during the high season especially. Very annoyingly, you need to go through a security checkpoint and it takes forever to get up to the top. It's far worse than the same experience at the airport. I was here in the low season and it was bad. Be prepared! If you are going to K√§fer, the really great restaurant at the top, make sure you make a reservation and arrive with much time in advance due to the security nuisance which will make you very late if you dont take it into consideration.

The building has a rich and varied history and is currently a working seat of government. The story is told well in the foyer of the dome and gives you a real sense of purpose. The walk to the top is interesting and rewards you with a fantastic centrepiece where you can sit and marvel at the views.

Entry is free and one receives an audio guide that activates automatically in the ramps. One should book early enough. It is an exciting activity that my 7 year olds enjoyed just as much. I recommend mid-day visit, we went at night at 1800h and we could not get a good view of the city building as described by the audio guide.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"Visiting the dome is free but you will need to book in advance via the website. You have to pick an arrival time and are told you need to be at the building 15 minutes in advance to get through the security checks. We were booked onto the first group of the day at 8:00 so arrived at 7:45. The security point did not open until 8:00 so was pointless turning up early.

Once through security you get escorted up to the dome. You are given an audio guide in your language which is cleverly done. The audio guide gets triggered at certain points as you work your way up and back down the dome. Helpful for pointing out landmarks and giving you the history of the building. Great views out over the city and a lovely view of the Brandenburg gate. Definitely worth doing.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"We visited on a lovely late afternoon as the sun was setting. After security checks (including passports), we were escorted to the entrance of the main parliament building and up the lift to the impressive dome. Slowly winding your way round the interior ramp of this modern landmark, right to the top, is a treat. Take in the city views and the architectural wonder of the chrome and glass, and enjoy the circular opening at the top that connects you back to the great outdoors and hopefully blue Berlin skies. Book in advance for this refreshingly free visit. We got lucky and popped into the quietish restaurant for a reasonably-priced latte and huge cake between us!

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The tour of the Reichstag Dome is a ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô when in Berlin. Visiting at night provides a particularly peaceful experience, not to mention a free view of Berlin‚Äôs skyline lit up.

You will need to book a tour in a small white hut next to the restaurant on the street opposite the building, using your passport. These fill up quickly but can usually be booked on the day. I managed to secure a space on a 21:00-22:00 tour when queuing to register at 18:00pm. This can seem like a bit of a hassle but is definitely worth it.

Small groups are then taken to the top of the building in a lift, where you are free to read information plaques at the bottom of the dome, or stroll to the top of the dome via the spiral staircase that lines the building. Notably, this is accessible and wheelchair friendly. Audio guides are also available but are not necessary unless you would particularly like the extra information a tour guide can provide.

There is also freedom to walk across the roof of the Reichstag, however very few people choose to do this in winter due to cold winds.

If you only want a quick tour, it is easy to be in and out of the building within 20 minutes, however exploring the building at a leisurely pace is a far more rewarding experience. There is also no pressure to leave at the end of your allotted hour, although this may differ in busy periods.

I chose a 5.45pm slot knowing it would be dark but the view was beautiful - the city was lit up. The audio guide available in multiple languages was brilliant and we enjoyed the walk to the top. Brilliant free thing to do whilst visiting Berlin! Security was good and you needed to bring your confirmation and a form of I.d with you. Would recommend adding this into your itinerary when you visit the Brandenburg TUR and the war memorial as all very close together and just a stones throw away from Potzdamer Platz.

To be honest there is not a great deal to see outside from the Dome on a dark February evening but the design is amazing. I didn‚Äôt realise that it wasn‚Äôt totally enclosed ‚Äì the roof was open when we were there. The beehive design has walkways that spiral up to the top giving you plenty of opportunities to get a 360 degree view of Berlin. If you look down you can also see the German Government chamber.

The second security checkpoint had a metal detector and strict security procedures. We then took the elevator up to the base of the dome. We then walked up a circular ramp to the very top of the dome. The views of Berlin were fantastic as well as of the roof of the Reichsag Building. At the base of the dome is a long circular exhibit on the history of the Reichstag. It was very interesting and I studied it carefully.

The reichstag is a very popular place to go so I recommend you take time to wait in line to go up.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"Book a visit to the Reichstag Dome (you must buy a ticket in advance). One of the more architecturally intriguing structures in Berlin, one can only imagine what impulses prompted the architect to envision this addition to the Reichstag. Well worth a visit.",Jan 2020

It is free. You must book it in advance. But ultimately there is just not much to see. The view is average too.",Jan 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"Interesting modern practical architecture, but also very aesthetically peasant. If you can plan a visit, it will be worth it, but if you only want the views, you can get those from Berliner Dome, without prior planning. Reichstag visit is free, but a reservation is needed and it has a specific time slot so you have to plan your day around it. Arrive earlier because there's airport type security. Don't forget to get the audio guide (also free) because without it it's less impressive. We went in the morning and it was not crowded at all, but being winter, it was foggy and not much view was available. Still, it was an interesting visit and we enjoyed the architecture and the guide.",Jan 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"You do need to book an appointment so be aware if travelling at peak periods in the year. In January we were able to book for later that day although we opted to book a slot for the next morning. Be aware there is a high level of security and it‚Äôs rather daunting as you need to get into a large glass lift and are packed in!
We went after visiting the Jewish museum and also after reading about personal stories from the holocaust and the horror of being packed into trucks and huts ( in preparation for the atrocities to take place) it seemed rather ironic that we all happily allowed ourselves to be herded into the lift in the same way!!
Excellent commentary and wonderful building.
Be aware of long queues at the toilets due to a ‚Äò one in one out‚Äô policy.
Don‚Äôt miss it.

Audio guides are preprogrammed to start at significant buildings or objects. An enjoyable event.",Jan 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,Well worth a visit. The views are amazing. It‚Äôs free which surprised me.

Passports are needed when you are booking.,Jan 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,We viewed the dome at the Reichstag building during our stay in Berlin. Not only were the views breathtaking but there was also a helpful and informative audio guide to give us some history and information about the building and the sites of Berlin. You do need to book this before you go so it is best to check online!,Jan 2020
Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"I recommend reserving a time to enter the Reichstag early in your Berlin stay, your time slot could be several hours or the following day (you choose based on availability). The process is simple, easy, moves fast, results in minimal lines and prevents overcrowding. Once in you get all the time you want so go as fast or slow as you wish.

Walking up into the glass dome your audio highlights different parts of the city, sites, monuments, history, and the operation of the German government. I used to plan some visits later in my trip as well as getting and enjoyable overview of the city and country.

Time of day to visit, that is the question, several people I spoke to recommend dusk. On this visit I went in the evening on a misty night so the views were not as spectacular but the dome takes on a different character at night. Bottom line there is no wrong time of day.

Very enjoyable.

Germany,Reichstag Building,4.0,"Pre-booking a time slot to visit on-line is essential which is confirmed almost immediately .
Efficient airport style security check prior to entry .
The crowded lift up to the dome with 40+ people crammed in is the only negative of the visit .
Using the free audio guide is a must which cleverly gives a commentary relevant to wherever you are walking .
Great views from the dome of the city and rival Arab factions kicking off with each other at a protest in the park below .
One niggle ...how are some people so thick as not to realise that there is one way up and one way down the dome spiral ramp . Grrrrr .

On the day we arrived about 45 minutes early, but that was no problem as we were allowed in, through the security check with no queue or delay.
The trip to the dome was really efficient, and the information provided on the displays and audio guide were perfect, distilling a great deal of information into straightforward messages. The audio guide pointed out buildings on the skyline, also providing background information on each one, as well as information on the Reichstag and the dome itself.

The lift takes you up to the glass dome at the top of the building, which has a walkway that gently goes round and up to the very top. While you go up, your audio guide picks up where you are and tells you about what you can see - all VERY clever!

You have to register your intention to visit which you can do on their website. Indicate what day and time and how many people and it shows what spaces are free, you select what you want, and they will contact you back with confirmation. I booked for myself and my daughter at 6am on the morning of our visit, selected the 8.30am slot and had confirmation by 7.45am. This is also a great time to go btw as i'm led to believe that the queues get pretty long. Once in you can pick up a 'free' audio tour in the language of your choice, which identifies the major landmarks in the city that you can see from the dome and tells you about the history of the building and a bit more besides. If you are like us and you had limited time or limited interest in a longer tour of the building this is perfect and the length of time is probably great to hold kids interest as well.

There is a circular exhibit at the bottom of the dome with lots of photos and information panels. It is well worth working your way around this before heading up the dome. As you walk around the dome the headphones provide information relevant to your position in the dome.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The Reichstag is a ""Must Visit"" place on a visit to Berlin. It is an amazing building absolutely brimming with history and today it is open for all to experience. The Dome offers the most unusual and exciting platform from which to see the Berlin skyline and to see the German government at work. All this and it's free - you just need to book early.

Not far from the Dome entrance is the Restaurant. Not free! I booked online for my coffee and cake visit (Dome included). We were escorted to the Restaurant by a student guide and then seated by the staff. It's a 30 minute experience. The views from the restaurant are excellent though in mid December, they can be a little ""dull"".

I was served a coffee and a massive slice of chocolate cake - about the equivalent of a year's intake for me! It was delicious but far too much and I felt guilty leaving so much. I had no opportunity to determine the size - it was presented.

The walk in the Dome and around the roof helped a little to ease off a few of the 'gains' I had just made courtesy of the restaurant. I might add that breakfast is also a feature but in the spring through summer, difficult to secure a place because it's so popular.

Prebook though because it saves lots of time.

Views really good and you can see for miles.

As with everything in Germany it‚Äôs a slick operation getting everyone in and out foe their tours.

The only disappointment was the restaurant /cafe on the top floor.
It doesn‚Äôt cater for anyone wanting just a light snack and a drink. It‚Äôs a formal pricey menu (I know price isn‚Äôt just about the food but also the ambiance etc but ‚Ç¨25 for a main course on a limited menu is a bit saucy

Bookings are accepted up to two hours prior but reservation in advance is very recommendable. I was not able to visit the dome as I discover this opportunity too late and the first available date was after my departure. üòè

It also introduces some of the main concepts that it is important to grasp if you want to start to understand the unique history of Berlin. The important thing to remember is that you must book an appointment online in advance and then when you arrive at the reception area be able to show photo ID to gain admission. Once you have been through security you will be taken as part of a group to enter the building and up in a lift to the roof terrace. On the terrace you can collect an audio guide. You enter the dome. In the centre there is a presentation which explains the origin of the German state, the Reichstag and Bunderstag, the rise of national socialism, the division of Germany and the development of the new building by Norman Foster. You can then walk up the ramp and as you proceed the audio guide tells you more and indicates the various important city landmarks. On a good day you can see for miles. Once at the top you can also look down and may be able to see the Bundestag in session. You leave by walking down a second ramp. We also went to the restaurant which is on the roof terrace. It is not the cheapest place to eat but it is lovely. Some people just had a hot drink.

There is an English audio guide available (strongly recommended), which is triggered automatically as you walk up the ramp. The guide is excellent, and of course free.

There are display boards showing the history of the building, and thus the history of German democracy. It's good to see the Nazi period covered in an open and honest way, and to see how Germany is determined that the mistakes leading to the rise of Hitler will never happen again.

Unfortunately due to it being really cold outside, there was horrendous condensation and so we couldn‚Äôt see a thing. The audio guide was pointing out places of interest but all we could see is condensation. I‚Äôm sure later in the day would be better at this time of year.

Sir Norman Foster‚Äôs amazing dome is an asset to Berlin and a superb place to visit. Using the audio guide, you get some details about why and how the structure was made the way it is, as it has a practical side as well as an aesthetic beauty.
We were lucky that on a winter‚Äôs day the sun was out and the sky blue, but even under those conditions Berlin was quite hazy. Still, the views were great for what they were, and seeing the dome is an experience in itself.

The guide talks about the original design, post-WWII reconstruction and then the current re-design after the unification of Germany. They show the various pieces of art contributions from the US, France and Great Britain. They tour discussed the Nazi party, rise of Hitler, etc. given how instrumental the Reichstag was in the rise of Hitler and then the capture by the Russians after the Battle of Berlin in WWII. The tour covers the division of East and West Berlin / Germany as well. The guided tour portion ends in the plenary chamber where you can sit in the gallery overlooking floor of where the Bundestag (parliament) sits - the guide then talks all about modern day German parliament. The tour ends with a self-guided tour to the glass dome. An wonderful experience of the Reichstag. There is an option to only go up to the glass dome and do an audio tour.

We only visited the Dom as there were no tours of the building available, but the audio tour, the vista over Berlin, and the fact that it was free made it truly memorable.

We visited on the second day of our trip, having done a walking tour on the first day, and it was great being able to piece the previous day‚Äôs locations together from on high.

We followed it with coffee in the cafe overlooking the Berlin skyline. A great way to spend a morning.

Make sure you a) get the audio tour (free) and b) pick up a panoramic map in the reception area on the Dome level (also free), and explore outside the top level outside the Dome too.

All the websites say book online, which we did, but I did notice a booking office across the road next to the Berlin Plaza, so it may be possible to get on the day booking there.

You can choose the type of visit (including the visit of parliament if available for the date of your visit), the date/hour and you need to be there 10-15 minutes before the start of the visit. Unfortunately we were late 10 minutes but they are OK and let us in.
We spent about 30-45 minutes to visit the Dome, an amazing piece of architecture, while at the base of the Dome there is an exhibition related to history and building of parliament.

There is a 360 grade panoramic view of Berlin from the Dome (outside terrace) where you can take great pictures.

I highly recommend the visit.

You need to take your passport and ticket to enter and of course have to pass through rigorous security, which you would expect for such an important building. It was wonderful, the day was a bit drizzly, but you could see all over Berlin and we walked around the roof terrace as well. The dome is so impressive and it's worth using the headsets (which are free) to get an insight into all the details of it. If you are visiting Berlin, you really must see this building!

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"I made a trip planning slip and didn't get advance reservations to visit the Reichstag. Thankfully, we did make it in by heading there on our first day in Berlin, and waiting in long line at a small gray building across the street from the Reichstag to show ID (our passports), and secure a timed entry slot for 2 days forward (which was our final day in Berlin). The clerk at the gray building gave us a piece of paper to gain access when our time arrived.

When the time did arrive, we used the paper to enter a queuing building in front of the Reichstag. A clerk walks you into the building, where you get on an elevator to go up on the roof and enter the dome, You can get free whisper machines, and use bathrooms, in the alcove where the elevator arrives.

Once you get off the elevator you are basically free to wander the rood terraces, and to ""climb"" (it's a ramp) all the way to the top of the dome. It is very impressive, with excellent views. Although you are protected from rain and snow in the dome, it is open air, so the space will be chilly in winter-time. There are interesting historical tablets to read around the base of the huge mirrored obelisk inside the dome.

We hung around about an hour, but you can stay as long as you like. Elevators from the same alcove you entered into take you back down. We were lucky to get access to Reichstag given our relatively short duration stay in Berlin. Be smart and go online to secure your entry time before you visit the city.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"This was the first place that we visited when we arrived in Berlin and was one of the highlights. Public transportation is very close and the walk pleasant.
First as many have said, make reservations and get there early. Making reservations on the website was very easy and it is free. There were some there that unfortunately did not do their research and missed their timed entry and were turned away. Security as you can imagine was very very tight so get there early in anticipation of this. Make sure you bring your printout of your reservation just in case since there is a long list of names that security will verify your name against and you can show them your reservation just in case they can't find your name right away.
The dome is truly amazing and a very gradual spiral incline. The view up top was 360 degrees and a great view of city. There is an expensive kiosk for food and drinks if need be. It was a very pleasant visit and would return. Enjoy.

Once at the top of the dome we enjoyed the views, we walked down again and then took the stairs back down to the entrance and went on our way, I think it was a good way to start our trip to Berlin, to orientate yourself in the city and it is a short walk to the Brandenburg Gate, and from there the public transport will take you easily to your next destination.

Wow! It must be organized far in advance and requires entry with a passport and security control, but once at the top, it's fabulous. The luncheon was very nice, multi-course with wine, and walking around the top of the Reichstag roof and ramp up and down the glass ""egg"" was a fabulous way to end our trip.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"The fact that this is a working building of national importance, I think it's great that it allows such easy access to the public. That it's free and open to all is even better. You do need to book a time slot in advance and these can be cancelled but we had no problems. We booked a few weeks ahead and there were limited slots available even then so do book early if you can. We chose the evening slot as we wanted to see Berlin by night.
The audio guide was really useful and helped identify numerous landmarks as well as giving a basic overview of parliamentary processes. Wandering the roof terrace was good, giving views across the city and parks.
We also had a wander here during the day and liked the buildings on the opposite side of the river too. A good start for then walking down to Tranenplast along the river.

I've seen comments here about the staff but the security team and staff inside the building were great. The 'students' inbetween were pretty surly and unhelpful.

When we spoke to staff they repeatedly stated that it was open until 20.00 until we eventually managed to convince one it was closed. They then claimed it was due to winter hours until it was pointed out on the sign that winter hours started in November and it was still October.
Having attended again the next day we were informed that it was now fully booked for the next 2 days and then closed for the remainder of our visit.

Admission is free but it's best to book in advance and you must bring your passport with you if not a German citizen. The glass dome is most definitely worth it. You walk up a gradual inclining ramp (wheelchairs available) to the top for a great view of the city (not as grand as at the TV tower, but then you don't pay 21.5 Euros either). The restaurant there offer decent food at a reasonable price but you need a reservation. On ground level of the dome is an excellent historical photo exhibit in both German and English.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"Do not miss seeing the Reichstag Building while you are in Berlin. It is a very memorable experience.

We received the official reservation online for the Glass Dome about 4 business days after requesting it through the Reichstag Website. We also reserved a one-hour 1:30pm English Tour at the same time. You really should do this rather than chancing getting a reservation to the dome the day you are visiting. (And this is all for free.)

The Tour Guide explains in detail the workings of the German Parliament and that the Reichstag is only the name of the building. She said Germany is very proud that ""the Reichstag is the most visited Parliament building in the world.""

She explained that the architect wanted to construct a ""People's Dome"" and not a symbol of power as in the past. That is why the dome was constructed to allow visitors to walk through it and look down on the Parliament. One highlight is seeing the inscriptions of Russian soldiers on the walls after they took the Reichstag in 1945. You also get to sit in the Visitor's Gallery directly overlooking the main Parliamentary Chamber.

I highly recommend seeing the Dome and taking the tour. When the tour is over, you go on your own to walk up the Glass Dome with a very good Audio Guide.

Germany,Reichstag Building,3.0,"Because I booked ‚Äúonly‚Äù a week in advance, the best tour I could get was at 8am and only of the upper glass dome. That particular tour offers no opportunity to see the rest of the parliament building. Such a tour is possible but I suppose needs to be booked with more advance notice.

The glass dome ‚Äútour‚Äù was solid. It consists of being given an audio tour handset in your language of choice and walking up a winding ramp. The audio guide automatically knows where you are and tells you about the buildings you are seeing from that particular vantage point. You can learn about the German government system and where those departments are housed.

The glass dome tour is free. I recommend it if you‚Äôre interested in learning some things about the city you‚Äôre visiting!!

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"This is an attraction that you need to think about in advance, and book your place before you travel to Berlin, When you arrive you need to show your passport or identity card. We booked in September for a slot in October. We actually arrived at the building early, as we had booked an early evening slot, and we had visited the other attractions on our list quicker than we expected. We asked at the door and they checked our names and let us visit then. You can spend as long as you like in the Dome. There are information boards about the government to read in English. We found this a very interesting and informative trip, and, of course, the views from the Dome were great. Worth a visit.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"We were completely blown away by this experience. My friend and I (both in our mid 20's) were originally unsure if this is something that would appeal to us, but we decided to get a reservation for the dome anyways, especially since it was completely free. Since we booked just a couple of weeks out, the only time that was available was at 9:45pm. We were a bit bummed by this, but ended up having the best time! Seeing the city lights from up top was amazing and we were able to have a very clear view down into the senate (which is in the center of the building). It also felt incredibly peaceful at that time- which I'm not sure would be the case during the day. The free audio guide was also amazing- it was incredibly informative while still being engaging. We rated this as the best thing we did in Berlin so I would definitely encourage anyone visiting to check it out! Even if you aren't interested in German politics or history, the views of the city are totally worth it. A couple of tips for your visit: 1. If you want to go at a certain time, definitely book well in advance- as I mentionned above, we booked 2 weeks out and there was only 1 timeslot available. 2. Get there at least 15-20 min before your reservation time- they have to verify your name and ticket and you have to go through security so if you want to ensure you get in at a certain time, give yourself a bit of a buffer.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"I had read about this the day before we got to Berlin but was not able to get any tickets from the website. Fortunately the guide from our walking tour told us that there are often tickets directly at the site. Sure enough we were able to get tickets for the next night. You must have id. We used our passports. I am not sure what other kind they will accept. There is quite a bit of security going up, but you can stay as long as you like once you are in. If you have options, I would suggest going during daylight so you can really see all the sights.",Oct 2019
Germany,Reichstag Building,4.0,"It's free. You just need to book through their website. Instructions in the booking said to be there on time, so we were expecting German efficiency at its best. That was not the case. Visitors had no idea which queue to join -- we all kept asking each other, and no one knew. No signs. There was one staff member at the front of the queue just before the security entrance but she was very busy (answering questions -- probably the same question all over: where do we queue?) so we decided to queue and crossed our fingers. We breezed through security but, again, there were no signs as to where we were supposed to go next. So we decided to walk towards the main building (the security check is in a white box-like area a few metres from the building).

There were two entrances to the building, and we decided to go to the one on the left. Wrong. We showed our booking printout and the young-ish female staff member shouted and said we were at the wrong queue -- that was was for group tours; then she said in an angry voice that we should follow instructions because this was the parliament building (we know!). We felt humiliated, and were made to feel stupid. We went to the entrance on the right (the correct one) and the older female staff member made sure we got in, no hassle. Apparently, they allow people in only in groups and if you miss yours, you might have to wait for the next one. Once inside the building, you wait for the elevator and they take you up in groups (it can be a bit of a wait because there is only one lift that takes visitors up and then down).

The dome gives you a great view of Berlin. You have to climb from the terrace to get to the top of the dome, but it is not tiring, even for people like us who are not used to walking a lot.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"One of the main attractions in Berlin is the Branderburg Tor area that includes Paris square, Republic square, Tiergarten and Reichstag Building.
When in the Reichstag Building you are allowed to enter to visit the dome. Although the access is free, you need to get an online registration in advance. Then need to present a valid ID with photos at the entrance check point (15 minutes before the scheduled time) with the printed form previously received by email from the German government.
There is free audio guide in several languages that adds data regarding the history of the building and the areas and buildings of Berlin you are seeing while walking up on the ramp to the top.
As they allow to enter a relatively small group of people every 15 minutes, you really will enjoy the visit and the 360 degree view which is great.

Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"A seriously cool building a perfect way to start a day in Berlin.

It's situated right by the Gates and the Tiergarten. So it is very hard to miss. It has some amazing views in and of itself, but it's really about the glass dome.

In order to get up here, you need to sign up online and book your spot. Its free and easy. Also to be fair, you might have your time changed or cancelled due to various factors.

Once through security you are escorted through the building to the rooftop with free audio guides. From there it's all the amazing views and access to walk the dome. The significance of the design is really cool. It is supposed to remind the legislators underneath that the people are always watching over them. The mirror structure makes the light shine down into the building...

It's a stunning structure that should be added to anyone's Berlin list.

You must have your passport in order to sign up so make sure you have it before standing in line. The line was not too bad when we were there. Registration was easy. You show your passport and then they would give you a ticket for a particular time slot. In our experience, we did not have to wait until our time to enter the building. For example, our time was 10:30 am and they allowed us into the building at 10 am. You do have to go through security. You then get the audio guide and you walk up the ramp to reach the dome. The view from the dome was great if the weather was clear. It was a bit cold and windy when we were there though.

We were told if you wanted to book online you had to do it a minimum of 2 weeks in advance. You could also book for that day or the day after if you go in person but you do need to have your passports to get your ticket so make sure you have them. The entrance is free and you just turn up at your allocated time, have a bag search then are taken to the main building where you are taken up in a lift to the dome area. Here you are given an audio guide ( we had the English audio guide) and as you walk up the ramp in the dome it triggers the audio guide and informs you of what you can see from that spot. The guide is very clear and informative without being boring. The views around the city are spectacular and as you come out of the lift you can walk round in the open air to get a 360 view across the city before you enter the actual dome. It probably takes about an hour inside but you can spend longer if you like and when you get to the bottom of the dome you hand your audio set in and get the lift back down. On the way down you also get to see all the seating for parliament. It was definitely worth going here and we really enjoyed our visit.

The glass dome to the building provides great views actross the city, and there is also a cool cafe to one side (again, pre-book).

Germany,Marienplatz,5.0,"To be fair, we had an image in our minds as to how Marienplatz would look, feel and sound. It's because of Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within (and yes, I realize how nerdy that makes me sound!)

At any rate, all the images we'd had in our heads went right out the window the second we stepped out of the Bahnhof and saw the millions of Christmas Market stalls in our faces.

NOT that I'm complaining! I was in Christmas Market heaven.

We visited Marienplatz several times over the course of our five-day stay. It was crowded - except for early in the morning, which was my favorite time to visit.

We did visit some of the ""local"" type stores on the Platz, but avoided the chains we know from home. It was easy to get lost and turned around with all the stalls and the side streets, but it was an amazing adventure.

Marienplatz served as a kind of ""home base"" for us while we were in Munich. It was comfortable, had a good variety of restaurants and shops, and had a wonderful vibe. I loved the history and the architecture, and how central it all was.

I would love to go back in another season, to visit the Platz without the market stalls (did I really say that?), and to see the area in sun and warmth. To, you know, see it as it was depicted in Gabriel Knight. Nerd alert!

Germany,Marienplatz,4.0,"The area was awash with Christmas market stalls selling everything from mulled wine to various local festive delicacies - lots of little wooden shed everywhere which helped to create a very festive atmosphere despite being situated in the main shopping street, full of designer/brand-name shops.

Despite being full of people on Christmas Eve we never felt and danger of being pickpocketed, unlike similar places in different cities, but caution is - as always - advised.

Get off the main street and about a block behind the New Town Hall, and by the cathedral, there are some very good and reasonably priced restaurants which are full of locals. Always a good sign as often centrally located restaurants in tourist areas are bad and expensive. We had lunch in this are on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (when admittedly there wasn't much choice apart from fast food chains) and yet weren't disappointed at all.

We spent our time trying to wormhole our way through crowds, baby strollers, and more crowds and more baby strollers. We could barely see the booths because of the people standing in front of them, not moving, not buying, just standing there. I keep hearing about how Christmas markets are ‚Äúmagical‚Äù. Well, not this one, unless your idea of magical is playing a game of frogger through thousands of people. I have since found some magical Christmas markets, much smaller in scale, in Germany, but I‚Äôm not telling, because then they won‚Äôt be magical anymore.

Absolutely gorgeous right in the center of the city under the town hall with the giant Christmas tree, so many sights, sounds, and smells. Many nice ornaments to buy. Look out for the ones in the Erzgebirge- they are the real deal. Don‚Äôt buy cheap as many are made in China!

Germany,Marienplatz,4.0,"This review is based on the Christmas Market Marienplatz as opposed the the place alone.

The main square offers a huge array of stalls with crafts and other festive items to buy. But I'd say about 75% of the stalls are food and drink. They operate a fun method if getting gl√ºhwein, with each stall offering a different style of drink container, from a simple cup with a winter marienplatz scene on it, to a ceramic boot! All the stalls will top up any drinking vessel. You can return your cup for your refund back or keep the item for a souvenir.

The square itself offers a great background with all of its historic buildings and the giant Christmas tree looks as festive as you can get at night.

Its quieter during the day so if you want an easier life looking round, go during the day for shopping, and then head back at night to simply soak it (and gl√ºhwein) up! Be sure to visit the near by medieval market too as this offers extra activities, drinking vessels and foods not found in the square!

On September 19, we witnessed the locals loudly singing and cheering for Bayern Munich and the pro-Serbian fans singing and cheering Crvena Zvezda, with Munich police in full-battle regalia to make sure all kept calm & peaceful.

And to make it more appealing there are tons of restaurants and shops from small, independent ones to a mall... My favorite store, Ludwig Beck, has its main Munich branch there so how convenient is that?! Also across from Ludwig Beck is another favorite: Hugendubel. bookshop. Between Ludwig Beck & Hugendubel I am heaven. Anyway, I'd recommend not eating on the plaza itself as it's tourist central. Go a short stroll on the sides or in back as there are more restaurants not so touristy. And there is also a local market selling all sorts of fruits and vegetables as well as flowers and cheeses, nuts, meats a few steps away from the square. Worth a walk to see what's still a part of an authentic tradition.

Germany,Marienplatz,5.0,"Sitting and having a quite brunch, lunch or afternoon tea is the way to drink in all that is around you by visiting the Marienplatz. So much to see and do in this lively area. The Glockenspiel is the main attraction inside the ""old town"" and according to some, it is a ""must see"". Would have been an absolute marvel during its time, however the waiting for this old world ""wonder"" seems forever and while it holds character, there are other more attractive things to explore. Many tourists gather around to watch and take pictures of its workings. From memory the clock performs twice a day - once at 11am and the other (I think) at 2 or 3pm. There are plenty of shops for those who are into retail therapy, lots of cosy and quirky little cafes and many side streets that also hold a wonder of different attractions. The Old Town is definitely a ""must do"" when visiting Munich. So much history and architecturally beautiful buildings. A good way to spend a day or at least a full morning or afternoon, depending on your itinerary.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,1.0,"Waste of money! For 20 euros it is one of the most expensive entries and all you see is miniature models. People were just walking past them.

Maybe its for kids but even the kids looked not very interested.",Oct 2021

You could probably blast round in a few hours but I would recommend a proper half day minimum to really enjoy the crazy attention to detail.",Sep 2021
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Wow! Can this place really exist?

We originally did not plan to visit this attraction, because it seemed too kitschy and touristy to us. We changed our minds due to the recommendation of a local and we are so glad we did.

This wonderland is so detailed and quite faithful to the places that it represents. It is amazing to see the intricate detail and how the various vehicles and lighting work together to create a tiny world of activity.

We highly recommend purchasing your tickets in advance. This place is very popular and there are long lines for buying tickets. We were only able to get tickets for 10:30pm, but we went ahead and visited at that time rather than miss the experience.

It was worth it, but it does get tiring to enjoy the Wunderland past midnight after a full day of sightseeing. Go earlier in the day, if possible, and be prepared to spend hours enjoying all the details and amazing technology that enables this miniature world to come to life!

One can easily spend up to 2-3 hours here just mesmerizing all the movement/activity of the trains, cars, people, bridges, boats, airplanes, etc.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"The Miniatur Wunderland is not only Hamburg¬¥s most famous attraction, but is also regularly voted as Germany¬¥s Top 1 place to visit.

To be honest I didn‚Äôt expect much before my visit and thought I will just take a small round, as I am not a big fan of model trains. But this place is so much more than a museum of model trains. What has actually started small is nowadays the biggest model railway system in the world according to the Guinness-Book.

The museum is divided into different country and theme areas and lighting will change periodically from daylight to night-time. What I found most fascinating is the indescribable love for details. Every single person or thing in the display reflects 100% reality. You really have to see it, as words can¬¥t do justice. For a visit I would at least plan for around 2-3 hours, actually you could spend the whole day in there. If you like to know more about my visit to there, see also on traveltreasuresbymarion

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Upon arriving at the long multi-story red brick building, we got off our taxi. The building‚Äôs wall had signs ‚ÄúHamburg Dungeon‚Äù and ‚ÄúBelleisenbahn Wunderland‚Äù. We almost entered the wrong door for ‚ÄúHamburg Dungeon‚Äù. Be sure to enter the correct door for the Miniatur Wunderland. Inside the building, we walked upstairs following the sign ‚ÄúMiniatur Wunderland‚Äù. An elevator was nearby, too. At the ticket counter, we bought our tickets with the entrance time marked on them. Since we did not purchase our tickets in advance, we had to wait for about 20 minutes in the large waiting area next to the ticket counter. Advance purchase of tickets could have avoided this. The waiting area had complimentary beverages counter as well as comfortable seats & tables. On the walls, electronic display screens showed the numbers. Once the numbers on our tickets showed up on the displays, we went to the entrance to the exhibition area. The exhibition areas spread over 3 floors had many halls with model railway sets representing different countries & regions such as Austria, Middle Germany, Hamburg, Italy, Knuffingen, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Venice, America, etc. We were really impressed with painstakingly detailed miniaturized railroads and Hamburg airport scenes. While walking around, we faced recurring blackouts to show alternating day and night scenes. Over 2 hour period, we could see only a fraction of the world‚Äôs largest miniature wonderland in this establishment.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is my third time visiting Miniatur Wunderland and each time I am amazed at the breadth, scope, and attention-to-detail found here. The ""Find This"" game in the brochure ws especially fun and really encouraged us to look carefully in each location so that we could find the scene that was pictured. Having the lights dim and brighten to show the passage of time is clever, especially when the traffic lights transition to just blinking during the nighttime and then working again once it is daytime again.

This was my first visit with kids (5 and 3 years old) and they were entranced. We spent more than 3 hours there; they especially loved seeing the shuttle take off in Florida and looking for Santa in Sweden. My husband and I could have been there for longer, but their attention started to lag at the 3-hour mark.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I really really love the Miniature land. I can spend hours and hours watching the landscape, people, buildings, situations and hidden funny findings.
It is great for kids, adults, old. Everyone will like this.
I will probably visit once every 3-4 year.
I dont post photos of this, since there is so many already.",Aug 2019

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,3.0,"This place is definetly worth a visit, bith with/without kids. Placed in one of the old buildings near the harbour, you find this very ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù tourist attraction. It is an amazing travel through a lot of countries, with incredible details and a lot of small stories going on in the landscape if you look closely. It is both a fun and different tourist experience, but do take the time to discover the details, and get impressed by the many hours of work that lies behind it! Remember to book your tickets good time ind advance, and TAKE YOUR TIME to see it all. Not a place that you should rush thru. We were about 2 hours and 15 minutes to see it all, and we didnt see everything.

The ‚Äúworld‚Äù consists of a lot of Germany, but they are still building new countries. Take your time to read the little notes, that will tell you a lot about the things you see.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,Spent three hours and could have spent three more. A must see no mater what age or sex. Just facinating!,Jul 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,This place was surprisingly funny. The kids loved the night time view and all the funny details such as Greta Thunberg at an ice flake and various crazy dangerous scenes with people getting attacked by animals. There are so many details you could spend hours in here.,Jun 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I have not expected so many details, colours, funny ideas, romantic ways of exposing the beauty of the nature and the cities. It is definitely on the top of my museum list! It is for a few-hours-long visit. For young and old ;)",Dec 2019

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,I‚Äôve visited the Miniatur Wunderland for the 3rd time now and it is fantastic how I still found some amazing details and funny easter eggs everywhere (even though I spend hours there the first two times). It is just crazy detailed and one can see that people are not building the model for money or prestige but for passion!,Jul 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"The other reviews certainly weren't wrong.

Wonderland markets itself as the world's largest model railway. But it's so much more. A true to detail miniature replica of many places including Hamburg the airport with actual flight movements, Austria, Venice, Switzerland, soon Monaco (it's under building as of July 2020).

One can easily spend 3 hrs here, even though the exhibits dont cover that big an area.",Jul 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"It""s honestly too much to take in for one day. The airport alone can be enjoyed for hours on end. If you walk through and see the overall construction you""ll have a great time as scenes change between day and night, but, if you take a closer look you""ll notice a lot more detail like a murder scene, ET flying home, and a couple having sex in their apartment :)
Most people don""t spend the time to examine the hard work that goes into building something like this, but it's worth it.",Jun 2020

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is absolute fantastic and unique place. Its real world of many another small worlds. We bought the tickets online before 2 weeks. And the only time slot was 23:00.
Tickets redemption was good and easy, but 1 hr was really not enough to see all the expo. Guess that we saw only 10-15% of all the installations.
I wish i can get back very soon. Can recommend this place to everyone!",Aug 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Great, we spent more than 4 hrs in there. Next time again, I am sure we still missed a lot. Fair price.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"If you like this sort of thing, this will blow your socks off. Even if you don't - go and take a look anyway. It's fascinating, impressive and funny. Given the work that has gone it, it is worth the entrance price several times over. Even liked the cafe (carriage) for a beer afterwards. Just go, if you can....",Mar 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"First of all, the museum impressed me the magnitude of hard work of those who participated in it's creation: in 9 rooms you can see entire cities and lands in miniature with day and night light simulating, intertwined by the railways and the roads. Everything moves, sometimes accompanied by sound signals. Most of all I liked Hamburg in miniature. There are a lot of visitors, so it is best to choose the earliest or latest time. The bus numero 6 goes to the Wunderland from the city center and the main train station to the final stop.",Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,It can get crowded on a weekend but highly recommendable place to visit in Hamburg. The details of the miniatures were exquisitely crafted that i was able to bluff a friend it was real by simply taking a photo at good angle. Wonderland indeed.,Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Dont be fooled by the gift shop, once you make your way into the exhibition area you will get transported to Wunderland for hours. We attended with a 7 yr old and stayed more then 2 hours. Great place to hang out with family with children as its fun for both young and old.",Mar 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I thought I would be bored after an hour. But the details, funny quirks (ET in a bicycle half way up a mountain!), interactive buttons, the daytime changing into night every half (?) hour. Watch a palace break into fire (smoke coming from the roof, flames through the windows) then the fire engines are despatched to combat the fire. We spent 6 hours here and would have gone back the next day if I could. Attention to detail was amazing! Cafe food reasonable prices too!",May 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Is a must visit while in Hamburg! Monitor the Website for how long the queue is and buy your ticket in advance- online. Use public transport to get there and bring plenty of time as there is so much detail going on!! Day, night, trains, ports, mountains, cities, planes, etc - very impressive! Suggest you go as late as possible (pm) if you can. The place gets insanely crowded during the regular hours. Spend some time in the souvenir shop afterwards, great stuff and good value for money! Great place overall!!",Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,I liked the feature to buy tickets and a timeslot in advance. But I had expected more activity trainwise. The transition from day to night was amazing. The interactivity could easily be expanded further. However a good experience that almost match my expectations that was high,Feb 2020

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"It‚Äôs truly creative and a wonderful miniature exhibits of the ones imagination, how the world looks. The City exhibits are the most awesome ones to see... I truly recommend visiting this place.",Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"By the time I got there, it was pretty empty but after an hour or so, it got really really crowded. I would recommend to visit early in the morning if possible, to avoid waiting in order to see the cities and constructions. I would say that, if you enjoy the collection and want to see it all (in detail) you need almost 3h . Cities are represented by day/by night (which was very impressive - also wait to see volcanic eruption, thunderstorm and many more).
Ticket price was 15.50 euros online (someone purchased it for me in Germany). I'm still not sure why for the same ticket the price shown on my phone was 18.50 euros.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,3.0,It is not good place for people with claustrophobia. Too many people in one place. Miniatures are interesting but I missed there more interaction and natural materials.,Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is much more than a model railway - it's a miniature world!
Regions included are Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Scandinavia and America.
One suggestion for improvement: take out America and put in Britain. This is where railways started, it's in Europe (more in keeping with the theme) and is the home of wonderful heritage railways that could, in part, be modelled. The British also make-up the largest number of visitors from a country not covered by the modelling.",Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Excellent place. We spent around 3 hours here and probably could have spent longer. The models are awesome and we especially loved it when the light dimmed to see the models ‚Äúat night‚Äù. We visited the cafe for lunch which was delightful and loved the seating (as if you were on a train).
It‚Äôs so hard to describe the detail that is put into these displays without having seen it. It‚Äôs just spectacular. I‚Äôd recommend a visit and we will return as they were constructing another two lands whilst there and would love to see them once finished",Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"We hadn't really planned to go here but as we were strolling around the area decided to. It's not a normal thing we'd do as it was just myself and my husband away for the weekend. Anyway my husband grumbled at the 15 Euro entrance price and then after declared it the best money spent! We were told there was a 40 minute wait when we bought the ticket (and to sit in the cafe) but it only turned out to be 20 minutes. The exhibition was amazing and the attention to detail second to none. Every few minutes the lights were dimmed so you could see everything lit up properly. Lots of things to mention but perhaps leave people to discover themselves. The only slight annoyance is that some people stood in the same spot for 10 minutes but we just wandered to other parts and then back again. The newer exhibits in our opinion are better due to technology but still enjoyed the original builds. I think people of all ages would love and appreciate this.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,The attention to detail is incredible - I spent three hours here and could have stayed all day. This is by far the best attraction of its type I've ever been to. To call it a model railway doesn't do it justice.,Feb 2020

There is really harf work on it. You like going to your childhood. All the miniature city‚Äôs, trains , cars , people, buildings, everything perfect.",Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,If you visit Hamburg this place is a must visit attraction. I‚Äôve seen models before but nothing like these. The details are unbelievable. The models with the planes taking off and landing are brilliant. It‚Äôs not just about the models the technology to have so many working vehicles and trains is something else. We were in there three hours and could have stayed longer and only 15 euros per person,Feb 2020
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,3.0,"We looked in the website for the waiting times and went on the moment it said 0 minutes which was absolutely correct and saved us ‚Ç¨5 by not having to book a fast lane ticket. The miniature cities and countries were very beautiful, detailed, funny with little hidden easter eggs and interesting to see. Especially the airport really was amazing to see! It was very full at the beginning so it was sometimes hard to see everything or the get in front to push the buttons. But later it was calmer and we got to see things better. We spent around 2 hours here and it was worth the money. I must say though that it was an experience that I will not do again. It was great, yes, but also a bit ""boring"" after a while because at the end it is the same all the time. I would recommend it to families with kids. For adults that are not that much into railways or miniature things it can be bit boring.

All the details are perfect and you can see also how it works since there are cuts in the wood. It is also very interactive for kids: in each place there are push buttons to see something moving or turning on lights.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,I have been wanting to go here for many years and went with my grown up son in January. We were not disappointed - what a fabulous experience. Exceeded all our high expectations - so much detail and such a huge three stories high extensive and amazing set of layouts with over 17 km of track. The airport terminal is AMAZING. Would return again gladly - so much to see. It was better towards end of the evening when crowds were thinning. We flew for the day with Ryanair from Stansted. Would suggest you go for more than a day - such a kot to take in.,Jan 2020

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"What an amazing place to visit! The detail and activity in all the represented lands so cool. As night falls every fifteen minutes, you experience a whole new world. An airport with all the moving parts including take offs and landings, a volcano, a concert, a harbor, trains, the wild West, Las Vegas... Even a miniature Venice. We could have spent another couple hours exploring, as it was we spent almost 4 just mesmerized by the shear scope of this miniature land. We visited first thing in the morning, and noticed the crowds getting more intense by afternoon... But totally manageable. Explore, have fun and make sure your camera device has plenty of memory and charge.... You'll need it!!!!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,3.0,"I'm drawn to writing this review after my experience at visiting this attraction. Arrival was very much as expected. You climb stairs to gain entry although there is a lift for disabled visitors. I had prebooked my ticket and this is generally advisable but on my visit was not really needed as the queues were very small. I put this down to being a week day, first thing in the morning so it's best I think to visit then. Also out of term time as well. The display was as been said very impressive, but the German section which I believe was the first area is showing some signs of wear now and needs a bit of loving care on it. There are lockers to place your rucksacks in but are not good for the very large ones, they cost a euro but that is returned when you retrieve your items.

Now the clincher for me I had pre booked the behind the scenes tour, I was told to go to the temporary control point which is where all the layout is controlled from. The appointed time came and no one turned up, on asking one of the operatives I found out I should of been at the old control point. By the time I got there I had missed the tour. I went to complain about the miss information I was given the only response I got you can have your money back. No effort was made to find out if I could of joined the tour or any real apology for the error, or if something could be done. A lesson in customer service here is needed. Yes there is a sign at the temp control station but this gives the impression your in the correct place. So this is a warning to others not to fall not this trap like I did.

As a result this did put a dampener on my visit hence 3 stars.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Amazing place! Incredible attention to detail and an insane amount of electronic and computer wizardry has gone into this! Way to much to take in. I would definitely do this again, and take an entire day to look around. We had the guided tour where we got to learn the 'secrets' of how it all works, and see stuff the general public don't get to see. Well worth doing. I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this attraction to anyone with any respect of creativity and workmanship...and it's just good fun. Staff all friendly, everything clean. One thing that may be good is the occasional 'over 18s' evening where we don't have to suffer a million hyped-up children!Thanks for a great experience!

There is an excellent restaurant available.
A couple of tips to note,
Try and pre book your tickets and get there early as it can get very busy and you could have to wait for a time slot to enter.
All details are on their website.
Make sure you know how to get there as it is not signposted greatly !!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"We recently spent a few weeks traveling throughout Germany and specifically visited Hamburg to tour this attraction. The Minatur Wunderland was one of the highlights of our trip and I highly recommend for everyone...great for children to seniors! The numerous exhibits are individually fascinating and, in total, cover 2 entire floors of an old warehouse. The staff's attention to detail within each different exhibit is absolutely amazing and they do a great job of capturing every-day life in their working models. I loved the staff's sense of humor...from Pinocchio's growing nose to some sexually explicit scenes hidden in some exhibits (You'll have to look close to find them!) Everything is on full display including watching the artists work on improving existing exhibits and/or new & upcoming projects at several different work stations. There is a sliding pricing schedule for admission...from children to seniors, a restaurant and souvenir shop on site so you can spend as much time as you wish. The Minatur Wunderland is the BEST miniature exhibit that I've ever seen and would jump at an opportunity to visit again to see what's new!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I didn't want to waste the day adjusting to the time change so I made a point to get out and explore.

Staying in the St Pauli/Reeperbahn part of town, I looked up how to get to the Miniatur Wunderland, after hearing raves from other friends who have already come to Hamburg.

I am not a sophisticated traveler.

I wing it and don't make lists of what to see.

This was a way for me to take a bus and wander to the area. I could have walked but already paid for a 4 day Hamburg pass.

The Miniatur Wunderland is in a quieter marine area and it's housed in a large old warehouse.

There is an elevator and it is on a couple of floors.

The overhead lights change periodically and it highlights the many working lights of displays and vehicles.

Mostly it is just wowing over the little marvels of miniature versions of places and areas all over the globe.

Even a mini airport with a display screen of arrivals and departures!

I loved the tiny drive-in with mini movies.
There is a multi-level Swiss mountain with different vantage points and a working movement ski lift.

There's trains, planes, cars, trucks and boats moving. Around mountains, cars do a right of way wait.

They even track where people visit from. And have a LED counting tally.

The volcano has steam/smoke emitting from it and the lights mimicking lava looks great.

Plan to give yourself time of about 1.5-2 hours or more if you like.

It is of course, family-friendly, and wheelchairs can manage.

Even trains have a see-through track on the floor.

And the repair and planning/construction areas are visible, but not accessible to the public.

Which means you can come and it doesn't mean it's the same old thing every visit.

They are proud of their work and they even have an old TripAdvisor award up on the wall.

I would keep the inner child amazed, and would do this again in a heartbeat!

The level of detail is incredible. The size of it is incredible. The animations are incredible. The whole thing is just incredible. I‚Äôd advise going early or late so it‚Äôs not too busy otherwise you may struggle to see as much as you‚Äôd want. If you‚Äôre a fan of these types of things they do a behind the scenes tour. If I ever visit Hamburg again I‚Äôm definitely going on this tour.

The airport scene with aeroplanes taking off is just breathtaking. The larger planes take longer to get off the runway compared to the smaller ones and the detail of the planes touching down is just remarkable.

I probably found the airport the most fascinating with planes landing, taking off and taxi-ing to and from gates. Venice was delightful with rocking gondolas and great attention to detail. We spent three hours there and could have spent at least another hour or two so give yourself plenty of time.",Jan 2020

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"A very interesting, outstanding place to visit. You can easily spend a couple of hours in this fascinating warehouse full of miniatures. Easy access to all, prams have to be left in a secure waiting area, but wheel chair accessible to all floors and exhibits. Exhibits are breath taking so a camera is a must. Nice cafe area with reasonable menu. Gift shop with a wide variety of tourist membrbelia from cheap and tacky to decent items. Book this in advance as the queues can be over an hour. Easy to get to by train (a 15 min walk or by No 6 bus). Wear comfy shoes. Leave big bags and coats at the desk for 50cents per item and enjoy yourself. Open 7.30am - 1 am daily.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is so much more than a model train exhibition - there are some fantastic scale towns and villages that have to be seen to be believed.The Airport is extraordinary, with planes that actually go down the runway and take off. We arrived around 10 AM and had to wait in the restaurant area for 50 minutes, so it's worth checking if you can buy a ticket in advance and secure an entry time. You need to allow several hours to see it all, we spent 3 1/2 hours there and had to rush through the last few exhibits, so next time we will start at the other end. There are several new exhibits to be launched later this year. We thought it was brilliant and if we return to Hamburg will certainly visit again.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is not a model railway display, this is a piece of art. Honestly, the whole thing is so well engineered that it being called a 'Model Railway' is just ludicrous. You are taken from place to place, country to country, scene to scene in beautifully crafted vignettes that just happened to have railways, roads, rivers and even aeroplanes in them. The sculpted scenery is stunning and the animations are very cleverly done. Lighting alternates from day to night and changes the whole perspective as it cycles through.
Yes, it can and does get full of visitors, is that a surprise? But plan ahead, buy a ticket before arriving and go straight in.
Sadly, it is not wheelchair friendly and to be fair, I cannot see how any display of this nature can be so as viewing is best done from somewhere higher than a sitting position.
So, if you like seeing well crafted miniaturised recreations, then this is a must. If you are somebody who would rather have a tooth drilled without anaesthetic than go to a model railway, (as I see some reviewers have put) then stay away and spend time elsewhere. If you do visit, allow at least four hours.

We were in awe of the workmanship which has gone into this wonderland. The airport is particularly impressive. Not as extensive as we‚Äôd expected but worth a good couple of hours.

Miniatur Wonderland is a really nice exhibition of different worlds with trains around it. The craftsmanship of the worlds is amazing and one could spend a lot of time admiring all that. Unfortunately we picked the wrong time and the exhibit was very crowded, including with people who wanted to video every single detail.
This took away a lot of the charm: it would have been a lot nice to experience the day and night sceneries without all these mobile phones in front of your face.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"The Miniatur Wunderland is an amazing place that I could have never imagined. When I arrived, I saw many parents with their children waiting for the hourly admissions. Inside, the parents were more engaged and thrilled than their children, probably because of the massive European attractions/places were built using hundreds of thousands of pieces to depict places, i.e. the Vatican, Fountain of Trevi, Swiss Alps, German towns, etc. with moving trains, buses, cars, people. The airports with the planes lining up and taking off were probably my favorites. Seeing is believing in this museum...a true Wonder!

There are a series of displays set over two floors. It was very busy when we visited and this can detract from the enjoyment. The lights periodically dim so you can see the scenes at night.

It was amazing and my wife and I agreed that we could easily have spent several hours if not days here to fully explore all there is to see. The scale and detail are beyond anything I have seen in a UK model village and every scene is full of humour. Planes take off, land and taxi. Vehicles drive without slots to guide them and indicate to change direction. Scenes from around the world and Germany are painstakingly recreated. All are animated and have special sections which can be activated at the push of a button. We squeezed it into 2 hours but would have liked to have spent longer. Thoroughly recommended to anyone of any age. We booked online and had no problems with queuing.

Love the way the lights dim every so often to replicate night which adds another dimension to the experience. There is so much to see and it takes about 4 hours to see everything but that was with a short break for food in the middle .
I‚Äôm travelling with a young child with learning difficulties and have no issues here, he is absolutely mesmerised with things to see above him and below his feet.
There are plenty of clean accessible toilets, a cloak room and lockers, a great well stocked restaurant - reasonably priced with loads of choice and plenty of seats and even equipment & space for nursing mothers. A Huge shop with lots for little children to buy, so not all expensive stuff.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Came here on a cruise, shuttle bus from cruise terminal into town and then it‚Äôs a short and easy walk to this location.

The models are impressive and the attention to detail in somewhat amazing. They have cars, Busses, trucks and fire stations that drive around and stop. Trains and boats driving around by themselves.. staggering.

Then you get to the model airport.. to my utter belief the planes take off and land all by themselves... they even take off at different angles to the what a plane of that size would do.

You can easily spend all day here.. just try to avoid when kids go!! I would also prebook a time slot .. or when you get there pick a slot and go wander rather than waiting.

Halfway round they really need to put a little coffee shop in .. I got hungry and needed coffee and had to wait !!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Having seen this on UK tv or somewhere I was intrigued. Could it really be that big or good? Having left the Hamburg DBH I immediately went the wrong way so got a cab, about $10 (euro) Dec 2019, to the door. It was actually very easy to find if I'd left the station the right way.

I had a pre booked ticket and went straight through to the bag/coat drop. For 1 euro leave the baggage in a safe place. Toilets and a cafe are inside as is a shop for all of your mementos of your visit.

Up the stairs, or lift, and you're met with the workshops and small displays, which gives an idea of what's to come, a concert in a sports stadium. Hundreds of people sat in the stadium with a concert on a stage, as would happen anywhere in the world.

In the main displays there are various city, rail displays and an airport. Each display shows a different city around the world. For me the Swiss mountain display beats everything hands down, although the rest are also nothing to be sniffed at. The work and detail put into the displays are exceptional.

During your visit you'll find the lights dimmed for the night views of the displays and yet again these are amazing with house lights coming on then off.

You're not limited to only stay in your 'timed slot' and are welcome to stay till closing. It's worth going around again as I'm sure you'll see something that you missed first time around.

Would I recommend a visit, certainly. Take children, definitely. Will I go back one day, without a shadow of a doubt.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Expected a German version of Mardurodam. Got a totally unique experience. A little uneasy, since you must pass through a huge gift shop to enter the exhibition, but once inside it was fascinating. The exhibits right inside the entrance, showing a village at different stages in history, were terrific. I read a lot of history, and the short synopsis that accompanied each era was the most thorough and thought provoking I‚Äôve run across, and each point was illustrated by a scene in miniature to be found in the village. VERY well done. Once inside the main exhibition, everyone became a kid. How could you not? Just a remarkable morning, not at all the tourist trap I initially feared. I have three recommendations for your visit: 1.) allow adequate time. We only allotted two hours and I could easily have spent a couple more 2.) spend the time reading the video presentation at the beginning where the eras of the village are 3.) consider going later in the day to avoid the hoards of (mostly well behaved and overjoyed) preschoolers and perhaps 4.) consider taking reading glasses. The miniatures are really tiny and so much detail and humor has gone into the production of the tens of thousands of little people

I was travelling on my own and didn't think this would be so special, but it was mid-afternoon, raining and very cold so I decided to take a look. I had obviously not pre-booked, and although there was no queue to buy tickets I had to wait 20 minutes in the holding area (but was glad of the warmth and a sit down - there's a cafe there too). Within minutes of entering exhibition itself, I reckoned the entry price was more than worth it. I know that in 2 hours I probably missed loads of the detail, but this was a truly amazing experience. I have been to model exhibitions before and been underwhelmed, but this one was not only fabulously detailed and varied, but went on and on. The night and day experiences really add to the magic and mean that you need to see each part of the display for a decent length of time. I particularly liked the moving road traffic and the airport, in addition to the trains. A particular hit also was the music festival site. I have managed to fool several people with my photographs.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"The up's and downs....

I first visited this just after it was opened over 16 years ago with my girlfriend and we always said we would return, which we did with a colleague Dec 2019 to see how it's grown.

For us - it was a fantastic experience and well worth the visit - again looking at the new country locations added, the technology that's gone into the building of it and the sheer scale of it all. The programming of the planes landing, taxiing to their bays and taking off, the cars which follow the various roads with lights and indicators, the various emergencies that are reacted to and so on. The actual models and scenes are brilliant and one can spend alot of time just looking in one area, spotting the little cameos and amusing set-ups which are invariably there. Some are very representative of actual places whilst other scenes are loosely based on a typical location but, a small amount of imagination is all that's needed. The nighttime changeover is fabulous with hundreds of thousands of lights on the cars, buildings and various elements.

However, I did read with sadness and incredulity some of the crass comments made by some in this review and can only say judging by a few, they are written by those with no imagination or whose sole ability for enjoyment is getting drunk in a bar.

Yes - it is popular so there is the chance it could be crowded consequently, it is definitely worth pre-booking tickets for a time-slot entry. Unfortunately, there will be lots of children especially school trips (best to avoid weekends if possible) and children do get hyper...!!!

I will warn those who are in a wheelchair that sadly, this is not the exhibition to visit on a general day although the centre has now organised 'wheelchair only' days to overcome this, so suggest you enquire. For the infirm and those with standing issues, this could also be difficult - sadly it's the nature of the exhibition and difficult to address.

However, if you enjoy models, have a good imagination and wish to see what can be achieved by the hard work and imagination of others... this is the place to come. My grandson is now 1 year old. In another 10 years or so, i'll be revisiting with him to see what new countries and technologies have been added.

I hope you have the same enjoyable experience we did if you go.

Meticulous attention to detail to portray the traits of every place in the world that they so carefully have put together. Kudos to the people who put this wonder together. Suitable for all ages. Everyone will be impressed. Just showing a few pictures from the portrayal of Italy in order to avoid spoilers. This a must do!,Dec 2019

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Due to a rainy day, my 24yo daughter & I spent the afternoon exploring this fascinating museum. We went through several times and I know I still didn‚Äôt see it all! The details are beyond mind blowing. The USA was represented by the Southwest (an accurate mileage sign on I-15) & a few other places. Many other places I‚Äôve visited I recognized immediately. The lights dim with dusk, all the nightlights come on. Excellent experience for all ages. (I can‚Äôt wait to return with my husband; he will LOVE this place) Nice climate message from GretaThunberg too. All around fantastic experience!",Oct 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,A lot of great miniature models from all parts of Europe. Very interesting and interactive. I highly recommend this place. It‚Äôs also located next to a river with nice architect.,Dec 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,You must visit. That's all I can say. Amazing value ‚Ç¨15 for adult. Just superb. Had to wait an hour to get in but you can wait in the restaurant where snacks and drinks are available and they provide free soft drinks. Definitely worth the wait. Spent ages in the the exhibit. The detail of the miniature displays is just superb. Brilliant as the lights go down and the exhibit is in dark every so often so you see the displays all lit up. Can't recommend enough. Not posting pictures as they don't do the place justice. If you go to Hamburg you definitely need to visit. Fabulous and suitable for all ages.,Dec 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"I was really surprised with it. Not that I was expecting it to be bad, just not so rich! Very interesting and realistic displays of several different cities in US and Europe. Be aware it can be a little crowded, so allow enough time to be able to get close to the displays (you will miss the details if you just stand behind) and move throughout the different floors.",Nov 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"We discovered this place by chance, just googling attractions in Hamburg, but then I had to have a look before we left town.

It is AMAZING!!!

Housed in a 3 floor old dockside warehouse, there are model displays, in HO gauge, of different countries and cities all over the world!
The display of Switzerland is 2 stories high, with a huge mountain, nearly 20ft high..

I would suggest you need half a day at least to see this place.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Neuschwanstein castle adorns the covers of all travel guides in Germany, which makes up the belief that it is number 1 in the top of the main sites in Germany. However, sociology is a stubborn thing. The German national Committee for tourism (DZT) after a survey of 40 thousand tourists from around the world put the romantic brainchild of Ludwig II only in third place. And on the first - Miniatur Wunderland in Hamburg. Freud was right, regression into childhood is ubiquitous. It is naive to think that most visitors here are children. No it's adults. Maybe Eric Byrne was right with his transactional analysis, arguing that the child sits in all of us along with the adult and the parent. Or maybe we want to be a couple of hours Swift`s hero Gulliver, surveying the world around us. We want to turn on the contrary, making us big, and the world is small. On a scale of 1: 87. It costs 15 euros for adults and 7.5 for children under 15. Children up to 1 meter are free. You'll have to spend time waiting in line. You can reduce the last coming early in the morning at 9 or in the evening and on weekdays. The money spent is worth it. Of course, this is almost the price of the Louvre ( 17 EU) at a disparate scale of exposure. But on the other hand we will see the Harz mountains, the Swiss Alps, Knuffingen airport, the beauty of gingerbread Austria, Las Vegas and Scandinavia. And you don't have to go to Neuschwanstein, it's waiting for you here. Under the roof, not under the Alpine winds. Piazza San Pietro can be seen from above, as can Venice. Half of Europe in one hand.

Lockers are provided for a returnable 1 euro deposit, its good to leave all your coats and bags there. Take your time slowly going round the exhibition as there is so much to see. We also opted for the behind the scene tour which is tour a real model fan I highly recommend you do. Lunch is a must and the food is excellent, as is the restaurant itself. There are lockers should you run out of battery for your phone, take your power bank to avoid any disappointment. This is one of best days we have had in a long time.

I strongly recommend to visit it!",Dec 2018
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"The Miniatur Wunderland is huge and every place they built is incredibly detailled. You can spend a lot of time observing each of them and discover small things and hidden surprises. You realize how much this is a work of passionate dedication to miniature building. I especially enjoyed how the whole building's lighting follows a day-night rhythm and once it grows dark you can see small street lanterns, windows and model train lights turn on - and sometimes a volcano or a fire breaks out or an alien spaceship lands. We entered the exhibition at 10:00 and left at 16:00, so it's very much an all-day activity.

It is best to book in advance, as it does get booked out, especially on rainy days. Weekends are super busy. There are discounts if you go later in the afternoon/evening.",Nov 2019

It‚Äôs super cool, the kids enjoyed it and the attention to detail was amazing. The place is huge and for us the nicest touch (aside from the miniatures themselves) was the step rail that they have along a lot of the displays. It was perfect for our little 3 year old.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,2.0,We waited longer to get in than we actually spent in the attraction! It's very overcrowded so it's difficult to get close to any of the exhibits. Whilst at first glance it is quite impressive on closer inspection it's really dusty and in a poor state of repair and much of it is just shop-bought toy vehicles (with not much regard paid to things being to a consistent scale). I'm sure kids would enjoy it but for us it felt like a waste of time and money.,Oct 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I just love the Miniatur Wunderland and my godson and his brother also had a great time. Honestly I really don't know how these creators work, but the two floors of miniature cities reflect amazing handicraft and technical work. The room will keep on rotation between day and night time so you can see the lights. Just pay attention to everything because they even have small human figures inside of the ships, buildings and whatever. Knuffingen is an imagined city and the airport is just a highlight because they have planes that actually took off and landing, and they were just like real airports, where the planes parked at gates, pushed back from gates, taxied, took off and landed.

I agree that you should buy tickets online in advance. You will need to plan a bit but it will be helpful especially during holidays and weekends. However, the place can be crowded. I came during school holidays so there were crowds especially in the Germany section. Maybe you should start from the last city and worked backward, so you would go against the crowd.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,3.0,It was nice but not impressive. I expected more of this place since it's so famous. The only part that didn't leave me cold was the airport.

Amazing in details and lots of buttons to push which got trains, cars and planes to drive/fly.. a nice detail is the day and night shiftüòä. Only downside was that it was too crowded even if they are keeping track of/keeps limit on how many people are in the exhibition at the same time..",Oct 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I was a bit unsure for visiting the museum because of my two small kids ...not sure if they will enjoy it. We stayed in the museum for almost 4 hrs without any complain or getting bored. They enjoy it so much that we went again. Ofcourse expect them to be tired afterwards... which is good :)

It‚Äôs a unique experience for the whole family. You have the chance to see the making process of the miniatures and demonstrate to your kids physical phenomena or transportation means and historical events.

I recommend everyone to visit. Wear comfy shoes and take water as you will be standing quite long time.

Lastly, expect to see at least a few rude people pushing you to take a ... picture. They are usually HuGe & Tall north European Mountains that will block the view of many people... just ignore their uncivilized manners... and enjoy!!!!

Prefer to go on a rainy day during the week not during weekend/ holiday/ festivities seasons!!!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"If you like model railroads or just miniature modeling, this attraction is tailor made for you and/or your family. It is the largest model railroad in the world, modeling highlights from countries around the world, including Germany, Italy, the U.S., Switzerland, etc., many villages, harbors, huge train stations, ships and so much more. They‚Äôre all interconnected and span two floors with hundreds of trains, thousands of cars (many of which move), tens of thousands of figures and an enormous airport at which planes take off and land. Some of the modeling is astounding, recreating many iconic landmarks from various countries. And it‚Äôs even expanding. Definitely worth a visit at which you can spend an entire day. The private hour tour is also a good bet to see areas not easily visible from the viewing aisles and to learn how some of the wizardry works.

Loads to see as there are lots of intricacies‚Äô that if you don‚Äôt look close enough you could miss. Our issues lay with the staff and rudeness of many of the visitors (not much you can do about that i know) shoving and pushing and tolerance of my son ( ASD&SLD) was negligible. Food was great but pricey however the majority of the staff were rude, lacked good manners and apart from a couple looked like they were being forced to work there. A gentleman brought a piece of fish back that was frozen and the girl snatched it back off him with out uttering a word and flung it in the fryer again. This didn‚Äôt spoil our visit however we did find the intolerance of people with disabilities was the main observation on our trip. Definitely will not be returning to this place. This is no discredit to the hard work of the people responsible for the displays, just not a place we‚Äôre we felt comfortable. We were upset about the way people reacted to our son. Such an shame.

Got crowded very quickly with people pushing in to see all the exhibits.

I loved the fact the rooms are on a 12 minute cycle from dawn to dusk.
It‚Äôs rightly so popular that they are expanding into new buildings.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Miniatur Wunderland was fantastic. I booked ahead so avoided any queue time, which was great as I was on a strict timetable.

The sets are brilliantly detailed and varied from the Las Vegas city scene to the Snowy Mountains. They are not so much models as living scenes with a day/night cycle, each person or vehicle doing its own little task and then there are even ""Incidents"" which only happen occasionally such as a forest fire or car accident with the mini emergency vehicles showing up to respond.

I spent a good 3 hours there and I would have loved to have stayed even longer trying to find all of the hidden details in each set (Dinosaurs, King Kong, Star Trek away team).

Really good value for money as well, I can't rate highly enough!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I had seen a you-tube video of Miniatur Wonderland several years ago, and decided that we had to see it someday. Thankfully, we recently had the opportunity and were not disappointed. The attention to detail, and the worldly scope of their exhibits made it a fascinating experience. Many large cities are instantly recognizable, and the planes taking off, cars and trucks dodging each other, not to mention railroads circling mountains, were exceptionally realistic. They've created an amazing experience overall, enhanced when they turn out the overhead lights, and the towns come alive with their street lights, headlights, stop lights, etc., especially in their Las Vegas exhibit. Highly recommend this museum to satisfy the child in all of us.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"We visited here on our Honeymoon earlier this year and had a fantastic time. We didn't book in advance and arrived mid-morning on a Friday. A welcoming receptionist greeted us in excellent English and explained there would be a wait prior to entering the main area as they staggered the starts to ensure a good flow of people. We had to wait around 30 minutes in a well lit and equipped waiting room before being able to go up to the main event.
The main attractions are fantastic, large in scale and incredibly detailed, taking hours to create. The lights, trains, vehicles and interactive parts are incredibly well crafted and can surprise as much as they can fascinate. Much of the fun comes from simply observing the sets, using your eagle eye to spot some of the (in)famous scenes and others which arent well known, but bring a smile to your face.
I wouldnt say there was a particular highlight, as each section was fantastic in it's own right, but needless to say we took more photos here than at any other point during our visit to Hamburg.
Well worth a visit and a great way to spend a few hours.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"During the day that our cruise ship was docked in the port of Kiel, we were involved in a guided tour to Hamburg. This tour took us to see various attractions located around the central city area of Hamburg.
Our first stop was at the Miniatur Wunderland model railway and model airport exhibition building. On the day of our visit, there was a long queue of visitors at the ticket desk waiting to purchase admission tickets. Fortunately, because we were on a tour, we were allowed to go straight in without having to wait.
We were just blown away by the size of the various displays and the amount of detail included in the various layouts. Despite there being many visitors present, it was relatively easy to move around to view the different displays.
One thing that visitors need to be wary of is that from time to time, the building‚Äôs main interior lighting is dimmed so that the special lighting effects on the layouts can be appreciated. When this occurs it can become quite dark. In a crowded environment, this could provide an opportunistic pickpocket with the chance to strike. Consequently, visitors need to take good care of their personal valuables.
At the end of our time at the Miniatur Wunderland, we visited their well-stocked gift and souvenir shop where we managed to make a couple of purchases.
Because, we were on a tour, we were only able to stay at the Miniatur Wunderland for about ninety minutes. We would have loved to have stayed much longer as it was fantastic.
It was the highlight of our day in Hamburg!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"You don‚Äôt have to be a model railway enthusiast to enjoy a visit to this brilliant attraction.
The sheer scale of the model railways and surrounding scenery is amazing.
There is even a massive airport with planes taking off and landing. All ages will appreciate a visit. It was very busy but with a bit of patience you can see everything.
Give yourself at least 3 or 4 hours to see and appreciate the detail of the model towns and villages. There are replicas of famous buildings in Hamburg and Rome . While you are looking at a section of wunderland you will see vehicles moving in different directions, observing traffic signals and trains running on various tracks.
The restaurant has good choice and reasonably priced.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,We were on miniature overload!! There was so much to see!! Loved every minute we were there.. and we were there for 3 hours! Loved looking for the secret letters from the pamphlet they give you .. no way can you find them all!,Oct 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Situated inside a warehouse building at the UNESCO-listed Speicherstadt, this indoor gallery/exhibition is truly an outstanding work in progress. Tickets cost 15‚Ç¨ per adult (student discounts available), and is absolutely worth every cent, considering the level of detail and thought that has gone into every figurine and arrangement.

We went there without reservations on a late Monday morning, and although we had to wait for around 25 mins to enter, it didn‚Äôt feel long as the waiting area had a caf√© and several puzzle games to keep one busy. Inside, we were overwhelmed by the variety of model themes on display, from Italian landscapes to limestone caves. My personal favourite was the airport, where you get to see aeroplanes literally taking off and landing!

Additionally, you also get to have a sneak peek of the ongoing work that goes into creating and maintaining the displays, with craftsmen/-women at work for visitors to view. At the end, we spent nearly three hrs exploring, and could easily have stayed longer if time permitted. If you get hungry in between, there is another cafeteria inside selling full hot meals.

Overall, it was a really enjoyable visit, and it really doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are or whether you‚Äôre into miniature models ... the place has certainly got something for everyone! In any case, it's a great indoor activity for a cold, rainy day.

At the end of the day this is and should be among the top spots to visit when you‚Äôre in Hamburg.

The detail, scale and overall professional way the exhibits are presented is really incredible. We have visited in real life many of the areas recreated in miniature and it is amazing to see how real they look.

I truly went from skeptic to promoter in the 3 hours that we spent in the miniature wonderland.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I had heard that it was worth a visit , but nothing prepared me for just how exceptional this attraction is.
Very easy to find in the Hafencity area of Hamburg , I was surprised to find there was a 2 hour wait for entry. I asked how long we would need to go round , 2 hours came the reply.
We duly returned having purchased 2 tickets at ‚Ç¨15 each .
7 hours later we left at closing time (8pm)
There are 9 very large zones split over 2 floors , any 1 of which would be worthy of a 2 hr visit for ‚Ç¨15.
The sheer scale is mind blowing.
The level of detail is outstanding , with literally thousands of fantastic scenes. The level of imagination is unbounded. You could visit 100 times and not spot all the details.
The buildings are truly fantastic, with everything from churches , football stadia, ports, stations , temples, hotels and so so so much more
I would have been happy to have paid that for just 1 of the 9 areas.
It is the best attraction I have ever visited
I will definitely visit again - you are garanteed to see something different as there is so much to see - not withstanding that they are working on 2 more areas

It must be the trains, planes, ships, football matches, concerts and even dolphins. Try looking for the couple trying to be discreet. Then there's the Vatican, Swiss Alps the Americas and a erupting volcano.

Did I mention the airport with planes arriving and taking off. On the day we were there the Millennium Falcom overshot the runway. Chewbacca must have been piloting it.",Aug 2019

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"We had pre-booked our tickets online which meant that we didn‚Äôt have to queue. So it was straight up the stairs and into the exhibition.

The good reviews on here are not wrong as the museum recreated miniature versions of railroads, cities and life in Germany, Europe and even America. It even includes a fully operational version of Hamburg airport. It was quite mesmerising watching the flights take off.

There is so much tiny detail in the exhibitions such as fire engines moving through the streets to respond to fires and car accidents. We even spotted a model of a dead man in a stream!

To say the wife was in her element is an understatement. She waited for ten minutes for the displays to go dark so she could press the UFO button. This triggered a UFO to fly over a display of Middle Germany.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Very easy to get to via the U-Bahn (U3 to Baumwal). If you like model railways then this is a must-see. You can get tickets online from their website and avoid the queues getting in. I chose a time later in the evening when the crowds die down. I also scheduled a behind-the-scenes tour for the next day. They keep the tour sizes small (up to 6 people), so you get a very personalized experience.

The models are setup in different geographic regions, America, Scandinavia, Hamburg/Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.

Other than trains there are road vehicles (buses, trucks/etc) that drive around the roads, there are planes, and boats. There are many buttons that guests can press to activate different scenes (loggers chopping trees, lights & music at a night club, a ski-lift, emergency vehicles, etc).

There are lockers & a coat check area for items, as a well as a cafeteria with nice German foods.

We ate in their food court which was tasty and busy so they must be doing something right!

Working motorways, trains going around you and under you, and the best of all, a fully working model of the airport, with planes landing and taking off, taxiing to and from their stations, fire engines running around the airport apron- oh, and numerous fake fires breaking out over several of the displays. A stadium concert, a staging of Romeo and Juliet and a model of the Elbephilharmonie that opens at the touch of a button. Fairgrounds, zoos, alpine scenes, harbours, replicas of Venice, Rome, the Americas and so much more. You have to see it to understand.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"First saw Miniatur Wunderland (MW) on YouTube a few years ago and have been wanting to visit since then, in fact it was on my bucket list. We organised our entire visit to Hamburg to visit MW so it could have been a very expensive mistake if it didn't live up to it's billing. It is far, far better in reality than anything you will see in YouTube videos or that is casually written about it. The sheer scale of MW and the mind-blowing attention to detail is unbelievable. My wife (who I think secretly wasn't really interested in MW before the visit) was as fascinated as I was. 5 stars are not enough for MW. The entrance fee has to be the best value for money around!
We were also pleasantly surprised that MW's Bistro was so excellent and the prices very reasonable, even though we were a 'captive audience'. Miniatur Wunderland is 100% recommended.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"More than just a massive train set in model landscapes with lighting cycling from day to night, Miniatur Wunderland has interactive features, in-jokes, and touches political commentary. (including centimetre-high nudists staging a protest on a melting glacier). Their miniature Las Vegas captures the spectacle at a fraction of the expense of visiting the real thing, and for extra verisimilitude, their model of the US features a scaled-down gunfight. Other highlights include planes taking off and landing from the model airport, and a Philharmonic that opens to reveal the tiny musicians seemingly playing their instruments. If you're having trouble finding it, it's right next to the Hamburg Dungeon (which has much better signage, visible from across the canal) and considerably less gruesome. Recommended.

Not only are there model railways, but entire miniature cities with all forms of functioning miniature vehicles from cars and trucks to ships, airplanes, and spaceships. Besides that, there are miniature recreations of regional architecture, including famous landmarks from Hamburg (of course) and around the world. Some areas featured day/night cycles, with the cities illuminated by their own internal lighting. There are also a huge number of ""easter eggs"" hidden around depicting humorous scenes; or favorite was the secret headquarters of ""international world domination"" beneath the Swiss Alps where various secret societies were meeting together to plan their conquest of the miniature world.

We did the behind the scenes small group tour which was the best decision we made! Wouldn‚Äôt have seen half the stuff we did due to the crowds and it‚Äôs only 15 euros more.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I was a little unsure about choosing to visit but this attraction really is as good as people say. I thought it would occupy an hour but ended up staying several.

""Model railway"" doesn't really do this justice. There are trains, lots of them, on an amazing layout with bridges, inclines and stations (including Hamburg Hauptbahnhof) however that is just the start. There is an airport, with planes taking-off and landing (I'm sure I saw the Millenium Falcon come in to land at one point). Famous landmarks in Hamburg, Rome, Venice, Switzerland (an amazing Alpine scene spanning two floors), Austria, Scandanavia and the USA are recreated in detail. Car, buses and emergency vehicles roam the streets. Buildings light-up at ""night"" as the lights dim to bring a new perspective on the world before you.

And there are people. For me, the charm is in observing the tiny figures going about their daily ""lives"". Each one seems to be different and the little scenes tell hundreds, if not thousands, of stories. I could not see it all or even a fraction but hugely enjoyed that I did see.

I visited in the morning to buy a ticket for the afternoon, which means you get a specific time of entry. Once in, you can spend as long as you like exploring the exhibits and visiting the restaurant and shop.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Imagine you gave 20 hard-core German train fans 50 million Euros to make the best train layout in history. This is that. It's gone well beyond trains though and now features three floors of amazing dioramas in 1:64 scale including fully working airport, canals with working locks, and so much more. There are also hundreds of funny easter eggs and scenes to discover among the millions (literally) of tiny figures they have placed. It's amazing on two levels -- first just as what it is, and second when you consider the engineering that goes into making it work. To me this is a must see attraction in Europe. I happily spent 4 hours there, and I could have stayed longer. Do yourself a favor and don't bring a camera. If you have one you won't be able to stop taking pics, but you're better off just enjoying and buying a book or postcards in the gift shop. Like all good tourist attractions, this is super corny and weird, and that just adds to the charm.

I seriously recommend you pay a visit to Hauptbahnhof Central Station afterwards you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre inside the model version, that‚Äôs how detailed Miniatur Wunderland is!

The airport will leave you speechless!

The restaurant is excellent too, you sit on the comfiest trains Seats I‚Äôve ever sat on.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"No wonder it's the #1 tourist attraction in all of Germany. There is nothing I can say here that will adequately prepare you for what has to be the 9th wonder of the world. If you are saving up for a trip to Disney, save a little more and come here, instead. You won't be disappointed. In fact, your trip to Hamburg and the Miniature Wunderland might actually be cheaper as well as way more awesome. Like I said, must be seen to be believed. My wife tracked the passage of a Lufthansa jet from the miniature terminal at pushback, through taxi, to takeoff...and the videos are among our most prized mementos of our entire trip.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I visited with a friend who has wanted to visit the Wunderland for many years and it wasn't a disappointment to either of us.
The attention to detail, well the ability to capture and create everything in a city is outstanding. You could spend hours and hours looking at the same model and still notice things that you hadn't seen before.
Our visit was 3 hours long and that included a bit of a rush through the last couple of zones.
It is very busy in the wunderland, atleast when we visited which was in summer holidays and late afternoon. I imagine the visit would be more pleasant when it's quieter so its easier to move around and look at every part of the model in further detail.

There were a few issues with the models breaking, a plane crashed for example. However within minutes the command center knew about this and a member of staff was fixing it. The command center in itself is amazing, to see from a high level the amount of things going on that they are monitoring.

Pictures taken really can't show how large these models are and just how much care is taken.
Well worth the visit if visiting Hamburg and would be interesting to see it in a few years time when new cities are added.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This place is completely INSANE. One of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life. The detail in the miniatures is amazing, you can even see the facial expressions in the small habitants of this world, some are smilling, others concerned, each one has is own features. There are some interactive models such as the airport, the vulcano, the storm and be sure that you have enough time to spend because there are a lot of ""Easter eggs"" that you can only see if you spend some time observing the miniatures. Also, there's the day and night modes (it changes from time to time) and some of those things are only visible during night mode. We spent about 4 hours and it wasn't enough to see all the details in the models. Definitely worths the price of the ticket.

The number of ""stories"" within each model had been very well thought out as well as the totally random items like the Millennium Falcon landing at the airport!

The staff are lovely and the facilities great (I got a freshly cooked plate of pasta a few minutes before the restaurant closed at 10pm, and I appreciate that they made an announcement that the restaurant was going to stop serving hot food at 10pm).

It does get very busy with long queues, so I strongly recommend booking a timed entrance ticket and going either early in the morning or late at night. I booked a ticket for 9pm and stayed till they closed at midnight. It was not too busy and by 11pm was nicely quiet. I would imagine visiting at peak hours would not be too enjoyable.

To call it a model village is a bit of an understatement, it's two floors worth of incredible attention to detail including moving planes, trains, motorways, rockets and boats. It was crowded near the start and we spent a long time queuing round trying to see all of the details until we realised how huge the place was and we had only seen a fraction of it. Keep an eye out for little touches like scenes from well known films recreated, an alien invasion and erupting volcano. We really weren't expecting much but cannot recommend this enough. Make sure you give yourself at least a couple of hours to take this attraction in fully and pre-book your tickets if you can.

You do not have to be a model railway enthusiast to appreciate the vast range of modelling from all over the world. Supported by a large team of electricians, computers, model makers, this is an unforgettable visit that photographs and video will not do it justice, you really do have to be there. Just stand back in amazement, as you get drawn into the different parts of the world. Vegas, Venice, Rome and Switzerland were particularly stunning.The airport where planes arrive and take off is a joy to behold.Look at reviews, plan your visit, pre book if you can.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"Miniature wonderland is very impressive and you could go back 10 times or more and still be spotting new details. I thought the teens may be dismissive but no, they were fully absorbed. Particularly enjoyed the cycling of night and day as the lights were spectacular, and the occasional political comment eg Greta Thurnberg on the iceberg, baked protest on the glacier etc. The experience drops below 5 stars because they let a lot of people in so it can be difficult to get in to see the exhibits; my most specific gripe is that the written information is on the handrails and was typically obscured by a hand!

Different scenarios are to visit - from Swiss mountains to Norvegian mining, from Hamburg airport with landing and departing planes, fire brigades, ground handling and VIP cars, planes docking on and off...like in real life. It is too much to tell it all - you have to see it! - Most people think this is a boy¬¥s dream only. But hold on! - It is for the entire family to visit.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"Miniatur Wunderland is located in a nondescript building in the warehouse district. You can walk to it from the city center although most drive. There are miniature railroads embedded in each model. But, the emphasis is on the models, not the trains. If you want trains, I suggest the exhibit at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. That said the models are exquisite - a realistic volcano destroys Pompeii. The hype that one hears about this place is all true. It is packed. They only have so many linear feet of viewing space and when its full, they have to curtail entries. So, either get there when it opens or buy a timed entry ticket or do both. Children will love this place. The exhibits are shown in both daylight and nighttime with a frequency of every ten minutes or so for darkness. There is a gift shop and clean, free restrooms. One negative is that the gift shop does not have a book summarizing the models. There ia a book called ""25 years at Wunderland"" but it is more of a testimonial than an overview of the exhibits. This is a ""can't miss"" Hamburg attraction.

Another feature was a fully functional airport with planes landing and taking off being fueled and serviced. The railways had short and long freight trains, passenger trains modern and old steam engines and watch out that was running under the floor. With heavy plexiglass covers. I spent over 3 and a half hours there and then another hour behind the scenes viewing the new lands they were building for 2020 and the computer controller areas.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"It's #1 for a great reason.... the attention to numerous details is incredible... and since its opening in 2000, it continually grows/expands. While it was mainly a ""model train:--- but it has expanded in many ways-- including an airport. It is now nearing its last major addition [which will increase the size by an additional 50%!- to 1300 trains and about 500,000 ""people""! The exhibit has also earned TripAdvisor's coveted ""Certificate of Excellence"". As it has grown in scope and nature, the ""behind the scenes"" work, co-ordination and maintenance by its staff continues to require ever more effort! It is definitely worthy of a visit!

I hope that this Review has been helpful.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Miniatur Wunderland is a fantastic exibition of modeling skills that most every one will appreciate. Young peple from about age 6 will find all of the moving trains, planes and automobiles fascinating. Allow the better part of a day, especially during school holidays. Be sure to do the behind the scenes tour if possible. They do some in English as well as German. Also if time permits, the Philharmonie is a short distance away and worth the walk. Also harbor tours.",Jun 2019

If you can get an appointment ahead of time it is advisable. If not your group can wait up til an hour to be called. It wasn't that long for us though.

All the displays are awesome. They have every possible scene in miniature. Sometimes the overhead lights go out and the displays are lit up like Christmas trees. Looks beautiful.

This place is well worth the time and trouble to go see. The kids enjoyed it.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"One of the highlights of my trip to Hamburg, Miniatur Wunderland is by far one of the best things top see in the city. The passion and attention to detail that has gone into creating replicas of some of the most famous places on earth in miniature scale is simply astonishing. And remember to keep an eye out for the 'easter eggs' in the scenes including a visitor from 'a galaxy far, far, away' at the airport, Vatican monks repairing the Popemobile, lovers causing an earthquake from their bedroom, Pinocchio's door opening nose, and a working chocolate factory.",Jul 2019

We made a reservation for 8:00pm on a Sunday evening to avoid the crowd, and it was still busy but manageable. About four times an hour the house lighting dims so you can have the nighttime experience. That was nice, but I would have liked the darkness less often, because I would have liked to have more time to examine the detail work. I was glad to have the opportunity to see the adjacent workshops where the magic happens, even though the craftspeople were not at work. I can see why this is the number one attraction in Hamburg.",Jul 2019

The level of detail in every ""country"" is amazing, making everything not only look real, but including small 'jokes' for the eager eye to spot. Small changes are made constantly, meaning there's always something new for us to find on every visit.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"An awesome exhibit with so much attention to detail. The landscapes are amazingly realistic. Look for hidden gems like the corpse in the stream at the crime scene, the little sailboat that you can control, and the scuba diving cows. The creators have a marvelous sense of humor along with patience required to individually place the tiny people and flowers. Plan on at least 2.5 hours, more if you really want to examine the landscapes. Also make sure you have plenty of battery life in your phone as you‚Äôll end up taking more videos than imagined!

It‚Äôs not just about the trains, but they are amazing on their own. The attention to detail is incredible and searching for some of the rather funny positioned characters throughout made it even more enjoyable.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"An excellent experience for all ages. Booking tickets online for a certain time will save you a lot of efforts. The feeling after visiting the miniature Wonderland is as if you have travelled and seen a lot of interesting places in many countries: Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Italy. It is a form of art!

One of the most informative installations is the historical reconstruction of the same place in Germany through the centuries. The story is told in German but there are English subtitles on the screens. It would be great if there was a possibility to listen to the story in English too.
On the negative side is that the rooms can be a bit crowded, some people push, and it is airless in some rooms (particularly where Scandinavia is). But a good thing is that there are benches to sit and rest. May be some more benches would be a good idea.

All of the displays are expertly put together and many of them interactive. The whole museum also has a day/night cycle which is a really nice idea as the look and feel of the exhibits changes so much.

Even though it was pretty crowded when we were there we had pretty much no trouble seeing everything there are plenty of viewing spots.

The cafe also has good food and drinks to have after walking around the exhibits and is done up to look like train cars.

We took a day trip to Hamburg from Berlin to see this and was worth the train journey to see - would highly recommend.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I've been wanting to come to this place since it appeared on an episode of James May's Toy Stories back in 2009. When I got the opportunity to come here, I couldn't turn it down. And wow, what an experience it was. So many model trains going by, you can even press buttons along the handrails to make an event happen like a volcanic eruption, take off a hot air balloon, or set a fire in a building and see the emergency services arrive, all in miniature.

There are several areas, America, Germany, Italy, the Alps (2 floors), Austria, Sweden and an Airport. The detailing on things like the grand canyon in America, the snowy mountains of the alps and Sweden were phenomenal, honestly pictures and videos don't do this place justice.

In the airport area, you can see planes landing and taking off. They come in or leave the room via a curtain type wall to symbolise them going through clouds in the sky. There are some highlights that may be hard to find like a Bumblebee plane, Space Shuttle, even the Millenium Falcon (Star Wars) land at the airport.

If you have someone who is keen on model trains and model villages, definitely go to Miniatur Wunderland.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"I don‚Äôt fully understand why none -- hear me, NONE -- of my many traveling friends who had been to Hamburg had ever mentioned the MINIATURE WUNDERLAND. Yet during my visit to Hamburg, at least one person a day would ask: Have you been there yet?
Well, folks ‚Ä¶ This Miniature Wunderland was one of THE highlights of my trip to Germany. The exhibits hit so many buttons for the inner-kid in everyone. It has trains, planes and automobiles, though it‚Äôs billed as the world‚Äôs largest model railroad. It‚Äôs got enough science, anti-science and electronics to thrill any nerd. It‚Äôs arranged to engage children too. It features regions of the world with models of cities. You see life‚Äôs development over time.
Each exhibit ‚Äì you‚Äôll love the Las Vegas strip (see photos), the erupting volcano and the Hamburg airport (planes, including the Millennium Falcon, actually take-off and land amidst the other activities there), to name a few ‚Äì shows before your eyes how life changes at each site over a 24-hour period. So much fun.
Although most of recommended early tour path is in German (there are English subtitles), once you get beyond those exhibits, you will not care. (Or you can design your own tour and completely ignore those early historical stops.)
The model makers must really enjoy the painstaking work to create these exhibits as you‚Äôll notice they go out of their way to interject a little humor into many of the models, which brought many smiles to this reviewer. There also are land exhibits (the Grand Canyon, for one) and water ports (Venice and the Hamburg waterfront, for others).
It‚Äôs an evolving exhibition and I suspect I‚Äôll be returning over time to see the planned additions,
You may have to book your visit, but once booked, you‚Äôre good to go. We decided late in the week to visit and had to wait a few days to get a time slot. The wait was worth every minute.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"If there were 17 Wonders of the World instead of only 7, this Wunderland deserved a place among them. You'll feel like a child again, building cranes and trucks with your erector set, or gluing paper planes together that'll never fly. Yes, it is a little hokey to see something en miniature that you should, perhaps, visit in its real-world size. But the experience is amazing, the engineering feat awesome. The kick is a plane (and a giant bumble bee!) starting and landing on a mini runway. Mount Rushmore never looked cuter, and the light dimming now and then, pretending night time, is a nice touch. Silly, true, but you have to see MW, especially with kids - before they turn into bored-faced teens.

The attraction is very popular but buying tickets on the day was easy and stress free, if there is a waiting list to enter you are directed to a cafe type area where soft cold drinks are available FOC.

The attraction is spread over several floors and is huge, there's no point in me describing what's on offer only to say it's mind blowing, attention to detail is staggering.

A must see is the airport and every 15 minutes the lights dim and the whole exhibition becomes a nighttime show, all I can say is you need a minimum of 4 four hours (my opinion) to take it all in.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Overall an amazing world class experience. It must be seen to be believed. Not only is there a huge model railway network over two floors, but roads with moving traffic and the scenery and buildings are stunning as well. There are scenes with hundreds and in some cases thousands of tiny human figures beautifully carved or moulded and in various poses or activities. Many of the buildings are representations of real ones and in some cases you can see through windows and look at activities going on inside. There are fairgrounds, parades, a circus, a rock concert, a football match, a moving container ship, and all manner of other activities. And to cap it all there is a huge airport with moving planes, including take-offs and landings, very skilfully done. There are whimsical portrayals such as a police speed trap and a fire attended by fire engines with simulated jets of water, as well as a huge traffic jam.
The only oddity for such an amazing and much visited venue is that it is not easy to find, even when you are in the immediate vicinity. Local street signs don‚Äôt mention it and even the building itself does not contain a sign for it (there is a sign for a model railway if you read German). There is only a very small movable sign right at the door to Miniatur Wunderland, which starts on the second floor through a most unattractive lobby and stark staircase or, if you wait, an ancient and dirty elevator. There must be a story here. Anywhere else in the world, an attraction of this calibre would be advertised all over town and probably have its own subway station, or at least bus route.
If you go, get tickets on line well in advance. Don‚Äôt miss it if you are anywhere near Hamburg, or even if you aren‚Äôt.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,I had to drag my eight year daughter to this place then I had to drag her out of it. Incredible detail. It is a lot of fun especially if it is hot or raining outside.,Jun 2019
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,4.0,"The Miniatur Wunderland was a very intense introduction to the world of miniature model making. It was very interesting to explore the different mini worlds, however it would have been nicer to have more countries rather than all Germany. The lights switching on and off to replicate daylight and nighttime was a little annoying because you couldn‚Äôt admire the models when it was so dark. Also would be nice to have more pointers as to focal points of the exhibition, as there is so much to see, it‚Äôs a little overwhelming. For those with mobility issues, please note there are very few seats around and you will be on your feet for a long long time. I recommend going in the morning as opposed to the afternoon (when we went) because it was very very busy, and it‚Äôs quite a compact space.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"If you are planning a trip to Europe, add Hamburg and Miniature Wunderland (MW) to your itinerary. If you have a model railroad or were think of building one, you MUST see MW. If you reserve your back stage tour, make sure you get your tickets when you get there and find the meeting place BEFORE you loose yourself in MW. We came with friends who were skeptical about a toy train exhibit and left after four hours later totally amazed. Finally, you may ask me what was the best display within the exhibit. It is the airport, no Scandinavia, no the soccer stadium, no it's the concert on the river front... obviously, it's the WHOLE experience. Go, be amazed. This is one place and day you will never forget! Like me, you WILL most likely want to go back.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Plan to spend at least two thirds of the day here. Not surprisingly you‚Äôll be milling about with many other people while you wait to get to various vantage points throughout the variety of model railway, roadway, airport and cruise port exhibits.
I can imagine that parents of small children will spend their day shouting, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt touch!‚Äô, but older children to OAPs will delight in the detail. The word detail doesn‚Äôt do it justice. I‚Äôm sure a second visit of at least half a day will reveal attractions on each area that were previously missed.

It‚Äôs a creative & engineering marvel.

A caf√© offering basic but tasty hot and cold food is a great place to get an early breakfast and light lunch between wandering from room to room.

Entrance price, I believe, was very reasonable too.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,3.0,"I visited the museum on Saturday evening (I entered around 19) and based on previous reviews I had really high expectations. Well, the museum is indeed interesting and unique and I have a huge respect towards the people who created the exposed items, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs the most outstanding museum I have ever seen.

During my time in the museum I was bothered by the huge amount of many people who were let inside; there was clearly not enough space to accommodate all of them. So my suggestion is either to go from Monday to Thursday or during the weekend early in the morning. It‚Äôs an experience worth having once, but I wouldn‚Äôt go again...

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"I went to this expecting it to be a nice train setup. It blew me away since it is so much more than that. Yes, they have model trains, but they literally have planes, trains, and automobiles. There is a great display on entry of the same site throughout the centuries, allowing you to see how things changed and grew. The various location based displays were great too. I liked that night would fall periodically and you would see things you hadn't noticed before.
Look closely at as much as you can since there are lots of little hidden gems in the displays. All sorts of people doing all sorts of activities, the occasional rogue dinosaur, and other little unexpected twists.
The town that they imagined is awesome and includes an airport with planes taking off and landing.
I could have spent way more time there (we were there for a little over 2 hours), but we had an appointment to make and had to leave.

The airport was incredible as was everything really. To hard to explain it all, but well worth visiting. It was very busy, so a bit hard to get to all exhibits, but I‚Äôm from NZ, were crowds aren‚Äôt really a thing. I noticed it was mostly middle aged people there.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is my second visit in just over a year, yes it‚Äôs almost worth paying for the fare to Hamburg just to see these amazing miniature layouts. It helps if you are a train enthusiast but as they model, with amazing likeness, all the buildings scenery, people and trees etc it‚Äôs suitable for all from 8 to 80!
This time I went super early (before 08:30) and it paid dividends if you are looking to use your camera, and why not, because when you show your photos to anybody they are truly amazed. They are continually working on new layouts and one for Monaco under construction is open to view. The GB one is along the line somewhat (pun intended!) as I believe they will require another building to house it! Great cafe with train-like seating in one area and an extensive shop make this a world beater. Another return visit is on the cards for me!

Definitely worth the extra money to skip the line. Except for three things. First, there was no crowd control noticeable regarding the number of people allowed in, which was overwhelming. At times there were people eight deep trying to see one painting that made if almost virtually impossible to read the details about the work. If you tried waiting for some people to move for a better look, another wave of people came in. Second, due to this sea of people, it was uncomfortably warm. Third, also due to the amount of people, you had to go to the restroom before you needed to, because there were not enough facilities.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"The museum was founded in 1817 and has Art from the 14th century to Modern Art. There was a Tizian exhibition in May when we visited that was enjoyable and educational, it was well curated. The museum has a really excellent permanent collection. One of the most significant paintings for me was the Monet painting called 'The Luncheon' which was the painting that the jury of the Paris Salon on 1870 turned down. So Monet instead turned to Impressionism. 'The Luncheon' is a nice painting but it was the turning point to Impressionism. There are many other works of Art that are worth seeing and spending a day or at least an afternoon there is well worth it. Some good paintings of historic Frankfurt can be viewed too.

It was not busy at all the day we went, though -- so it's not necessarily the crowds I'm talking about -- it's the shear vastness of the place.

Germany,Stadel Museum,3.0,"As someone who enjoys 15th - 17th century Northern European art, this museum left much to be desired. The stars of the collection are the Lucca Madonna, a 1437 piece by Jan Van Eyck, and Ecco Homo, a 1500 work by Hieronymous Bosch. However, when we visited, The Geographer by Johannes Vermeer was on loan at an undetermined location, and The Blinding of Samson by Rembrandt was not being exhibited. There were no works by Rubens or Van Gogh, standards in most other major European art museums. The museum‚Äôs collection is fairly small and absolutely not worth a visit to Frankfurt if you are looking to view the Flemish masters.

The entry charge is justified by the quality of the collection. We were failry exhausted after going around the old masters' galleries, though happily there is a cafe (as well as a more formal restuarant). The collection of medieval paintings -- primarily German and Low Countires, including Bosch, Christus, the Flemalle master -- was superb and we fell in love with an altarpiece from a nunnery which had a Virgin at the centre and painted wings, but space presumably for relics. I confined myself to a brief perusal of the more modern works on the floor below, but the works by artists of the Weimar era -- Beckman, Kirchner, Kollwitz -- were excellent.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"We focused on the Modern Art section, since we had only 90 minutes left for the visit. What we found was mind-boggling! I've never seen a Modern Art collection that was setup within a context. Usually, you see isolated works of art, put in place coincidentally. Not so at the Stadel! The explaining texts connect the diverse subsections with each other, the architecture seems to be around the pictures, and not the other way round. Every work of art is given enough space to breathe, and the collection has been obviously driven by some purpose, some plan.

We will re-visit the museum next year, and we will focus on a different section.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"All in all, I loved this place. It obviously doesn't have the collection of princes and emperors as at the main museums in Munich or Vienna, but it's nonetheless strong in both highlights and breadth. Even more so, they do a lot in terms of providing a rich experience for viewers. Took me from about noon until 6pm (6 hours!) to get through the whole collection thoroughly, with a few breaks for coffee or snacks, though the galleries always felt like a pleasure.

Maybe the best wall labels I've seen at any museum on the planet? I've got a graduate degree in art history and actually learned *a lot* from the labels here!

The collection itself is solid, reflects the long history of Frankfurt as drawing primarily on its merchant class to buy Northern Ren and German old masters, with some Italians sprinkled in, along with a good collection of Die Brucke and Blaue Reiter and some nice Courbets and Nazarenes, among others. The contemporary section leans too heavily on macho posturing of 70s and 80s Neo Expressionism, so expect a lot of empty Albert Oehlen type works that go on forever.

Cafe provides good fare at a reasonable price. Ditto the bookstore (though they didn't have any affordable notebooks when I ran out!).

Contemporary painting was very well represented too. This is probably the 'go-to' place to admire the creations of E.L. Kirchner and Max Beckmann.
The Downside is the way the display is set up, with no particular order or a chronological plan: One room is Italian renaissance and the next one is XIX century English painting to move back to medieval religious paintings in the following room. Kirchner paintings also were displayed awkwardly in different locations without an apparent logic to it. I had to make a mental effort to put myself in situation at the turn of every door: ""Ok, where are we now??"" Maybe there is a plan to all this but I was not able to comprehend it.

Picasso‚Äôs lithographic exhibition is good, with many intriguing prints and some colourful lino cuts.

Titian and the Venetian Renaissance is also really good although quite crowded. Lots of work by Titian himself, plus Tintoretto, Bassano, Veronese and El Greco amongst others.

The permanent collection is huge. A great selection of Impressionist work and as you‚Äôd expect, a wide range of German art.

Paula Modersohn-Becker, Lovis Corinth, Max Liebermann and Max Becker featured prominently.

The Modern Art section on the lower floors was very good too. I liked Andy Warhol‚Äôs portrayal of Goethe, as well as Gerhard Richter‚Äôs work.

I wouldn‚Äôt say the arrival experience is particularly positive - a little bit stand-offish, why not just be friendly and welcoming like other sectors of the service industry.

The major exhibition was Titian - and I managed to navigate it in reverse. The signage that takes you to it takes you to the 2nd part of the exhibition on the upper level. Anyway, there were clearly some notable pieces of art here, and it was interesting enough.

The highlight for me was the room dedicated to Max Beckmann - never heard of him - but his work was really thought provoking, sadly it was only about 15 items.

The lowlight, well I took off my coat for a few minutes as it was quite warm. I was quickly reprimanded - apparently holding your coat is not permitted, it‚Äôs either worn or in the cloakroom. It would have been a fairly spectacular heist for me to get out of there with a piece of art under my coat!

Germany,Stadel Museum,4.0,"I loved the old Masters collection at this museum. In fact there were so many I could not absorb them all. Beautifully displayed with a nice use of colored walls as a back drop in the space. There were two special exhibits. I couldn't get much mental action on the Victor Vasarely collection - much redundancy in the paintings and presentation. The Lottie Laserstein special exhibit was very powerful and well done. worth the visit! The modern art collections on the bottom floor left me cold. Technical execution of the pieces looked amateurish, especially after looking at the painstaking works in the other collections.

I did not understand what he was saying. There were many other people with similar sized handbags viewing the art and he was not targeting them.

An employee who spoke English came over to help, The employee who was harassing me took out his phone and showed him a photograph of me. This photo of me was taken without my consent, which is a violation of German law.

The employee that spoke English explained that situation with handbag size was a subjective matter and hence some people were allowed to bring their bags in.

I went to the reception area to ask to speak to a manager about this harassment but there was no one available. The person that I did talk too explained that the issue would be dealt with by Human Resources I asked that my photo should be deleted from this man‚Äôs phone.

This incident was extremely stressful and ruined my experience at the museum.

Well maintained, and docents happily direct you to where you want to go.
May seem warm but the art determines what‚Äôs appropriate. Humidity and temp, as explained to us, play havoc on the art and so the museum‚Äôs system self regulate.

The few pieces of the many painters are a wonderful mix. The well known (Monet, Renoir, Rembrandt) attract visitors to also see the others (Beckmann Passavant ++).

As normal, benches are in the room‚Äôs to sit, look at and reflect.

I was there for 5 hours. I saw pieces that I had only dreamed about... it was magical. This museum doesn‚Äôt get enough recognition for the pieces that they have obtained, and housed for quite some time.

The top floor is the, ‚ÄúOld Masters‚Äù which will blow any persons mind that appreciates artwork. There are three floors. Each is just as spectacular as the other.

I was pleased to find there were major works from many artists I have previously encountered, as well as works by artists who are new to me. The works were logically ordered with sections for Italian, German, Dutch & French etc., & the galleries moved through time, so to speak, from older works to far more contemporary areas. I also know that they hold major exhibitions here as, for example, they recently hosted one focussing on Raphael. I particularly enjoyed the feeling of space as this is a good-sized Museum which was extended below ground in 2012 to house the modern Art they hold . There are also interesting gardens around the Museum which are worth a look as they contain many sculptures & installations, plus the skylight dome which lights the new extension.

Drawn by the grandeur of the buildings facade and excited by what it held we eagerly signed up once inside for the Rubens exhibition being held. Included in the price were Audioguides for an extra fee but well worth the ‚Ç¨7 to hear the in-depth description of each of the works.

Some photography was permitted with signs clearly showing that as well as a detailed description of the works magnificently curated.

Covering many rooms the exhibition also included other masters and more lesser known works from artists from Renaissance and other highlighted periods in history.

There's plenty of seating inside the exhibition to take in the works or discuss in the cafe over a glass of wine and delicious snacks and meals. Time didn't permit this as we spent so much time in the exhibition!

Allow at least 3 hours but preferably a day to sample the full gamut at leisure or even more!

You will see Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Rembrandt, and right now (April 2018) a special Rubens exhibit. There is a very unusual display of the backs of paintings. It explains how experts can tell how the painting was mounted, see various markings made by the artist, and learn more about the material on which the work was painted. This all helps provide provenance. Interesting and unexpected.

Allow 2 hours for a thorough visit. I paid for the audio guide, but then learned that there is an app you can download and listen on your phone. I wish the cashier had mentioned that.

One caveat: This was the noisiest art museum I have ever visited. There were some school groups which created much of the cacophony, as they can do. What I did not understand was that no one tried to address this and ask them to be respectful. Also, you will be asked to put your backback or other large bag in a locker (1 euro). If you carry a jacket, they insist you wear it or tie the arms around your waist.

All this aside, the art collection here is outstanding. Add this to your Frankfurt list!

This was my first time seeing so many Bonnard paintings together at one time, providing more appreciation for his talent. This well staged exhibition by the Staedel, was one of my favorite exhibitions of 2017. No photos were allowed in the exhibition.

As mentioned earlier, the Staedel has a fine permanent collection that's not to be missed. They also have a nice gift shop and restaurant. The Staedel is located along Frankfurt's famous museum row.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"Having visited most of the major art museums in Germany, I would say the Stadel is the best of those that cover the whole history of art (slightly ahead of the Hamburg Kunsthalle). The Matisse/Bonnard exhibition was brilliantly curated with the most enthralling audio guide. I went in not being a big fan of Matisse and came out appreciating him a little better. But Bonnard was the real eye-opener with his dazzling colours and mysterious ghostly presences. The permanent collection is superb. A particularly fine collection of Kirchner and Beckmann paintings but most of the big names are represented with major works, aside curiously from the pioneers of abstract art. The museum is generous with loans so some of its iconic works were not on show but enough were. The audioguide for the permanent collection was fantastic with an unusually large number of works covered unlike in some more august institutions. There was a 30min entry queue which was probably due to Matisse. If there is a big exhibition it is worth buying online and waltzing straight in. The cafe in the bookshop also had a long queue. There is also a pricey restaurant, which was pretty empty. I think the museum could reorganise to give the cafe more space and reduce the queue. Overall, simply superb.

If you can download their app and read about the museum and the exhibit you are going to see it enhances the experience. We saw the Matisse and Bonnard exhibits and knowing about their friendship and influence on each other helped to bring the paintings alive-especially the different interpretations of the girl on a blue checkered blanket. Sadly, we only saw that exhibit due a scheduling issue so we missed all the other works. This museum is beautiful and very nicely organized. I wish I had know you are allowed to take photos so I could show some of the works of art. The gift shop is first rate (museum gift shops are my favorite shopping places).

The museum has a great collection of old master works (dutch, german, italian and some french) that was really enjoyable but we don't understand the choice for the walls colors (dark blue or green in some rooms) that made us sleepy at some point. We went out of the exibition to drink a coffee but the employees of the ""upscale"" restaurant were really unprofessional and didn't care at all so we left for the self-service cafeteria. When we wanted to go back to the exhibitions rooms the lady checking the tickets didn't let us pass because we had a too large bag. Which was ridiculous as we spent 2 hours with it in the museum, nobody said anything and there were still people with much bigger bags.
The museum is ok in comparison to others but the price was really to high for what you get to see and the conditions inside. I won't visit it again nor recommend it.

Having an audio guide helps you focus on certain paintings and the explanation on the guides was clear, interesting and also discussed the painters as well as the paintings.
There is a cloakroom as well as lockers to leave your belongings next to the cafe.
The whole museum is very spacious and paintings spaced out so you can examine the paintings very closely without a lot of people in the way. There are also sofas in the middle of the bigger rooms to rest your aching feet.
The garden at the back has benches and there are also a few sculptures.
We were hoping to see Vermeer's ' The Geographer' but it was on loan to the Louvre. There were quite a few paintings by the Dutch masters notably 'The blinding of Samson' by Rembrandt
The impressionist section was also good and there was an early work by Monet called 'The Luncheon'.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"The St√§del, officially the St√§delsches Kunstinstitut und St√§dtische Galerie, is an art museum in Frankfurt am Main, with one of the most important Art collections in Germany. The St√§del owns 2,700 paintings. 600 of them are alway on display. The collection of 100,000 drawings and prints as well as 600 sculptures is pretty convincing as well.
The founding father of the St√§del was in 1815 the Frankfurt banker and merchant Johann Friedrich St√§del. In 1878, a new building, which was designed according to the Gr√ºnderzeit style, was erected on Schaumainkai. A street at the southside banks of the river Main. The Schaumainkai is, presently part of the the major museum district which has been planed and built in the 1980th.
There are always special exihibitions, so look them up.

Germany,Stadel Museum,4.0,"I had about three hours to kill while I was in Frankfurt so I hopped on the train to Frankfurt HBf. It's about a 20 minute walk to Staedel and not hard to find if you have google maps. Crossing the bridge over the river was worth the walk itself. That was beautiful.

The museum has an impressive collection of art from about the 14th century to today. Mostly paintings with a few sculptures. They had a nice collection of Max Beckmann paintings and a Rembrandt's Blinding of Sampson, which I thought was the highlight of the visit despite it being overlighted with glare in places. Their contemporary art section, which not ironically is in the basement, is huge. You will either love it or hate it or scratch your head.

Mission accomplished. I wandered through in a few hours and then walked the park along the river to kill the rest of my free time.

Once I got there, this impression totally changed. It is so worth it! The museum has 3 beautiful floors: Old Master Painting, Modern Art and Contemporary Art. Besides getting an audio guide, you may also get free wifi and download the museum app. For pieces with the app ""eye"" icon, you can scan with your smartphone and retrieve information maybe even a youtube link on that artwork immediately.

Most popular pieces have good English annotations. Enough to make a non-German speaker like me happy. There are also a nice cafe and gift shop. Spare some time to check out.

Not only classical paintings, but also good choice of modern (renoir, degas, some german artists) and contemporary artists ( andy warhol, tony craigg....)

Building's architecture is very good... built in 1865? But modern decorated inside... very clean, good lightened.

Location of the museum is great, by the river, many other museums next to it.

I'm not into art at all but it is a good place to see some European pieces and Scandinavian works. Personally I recommend Munch's work. His most famous piece, the Scream, is in Oslo, but a small collection is here. There are a few Monet and other famous artists. I do not know arts well (or at all), so it was a rather quick tour for me (30~45 minutes). For art lovers, recommend 2 hours here.

Currently they have a Battle of the Sexes exhibit which was quite crowded. I actually had more fun slowly roaming the top two floors, stopping to ponder art that spoke directly to me.

After about two hours I was in sensory overload, but you could stay for four hours, easily.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"The St√§del Museum started out as a private art collection and was then donated to the City of Frankfurt by Mr. St√§del after his death. Today, the museum houses one Europe's leading collections on Northern European medieval art. Its collection also encompasses art from Antiquity to today. A few years ago, a new photographic art section was added to the museum.

Often, art collections that travel around the world are also shown here. It is a good idea to purchase tickets online before you go to the museum. Especially when there is a famous international art exhibition, the waiting lines can go around the block.

The St√§del is located on the south bank (Sachsenhausen) of the Main River on Frankfurt's famous Museum Mile. There is a good restaurant in the museum, in case you would like to have lunch or dinner there.

One of my favorite walks when I show visitors the town is to start at the R√∂mer (the Dom church where many German emperors were crowned, St. Michel's and R√∂mer, the town hall),then walk down to the Main River, cross the footbridge Eiserner Steg and take a right and walk along the river until you arrive at the Museum.

Germany,Stadel Museum,3.0,"The collection has some lovely pieces in but the curators have had a strange idea about how this hangs together - I found it a little random to be honest - one minute you're in Dutch Masters and next you're looking at Max Ernst and Munch... some interesting minor German works and a clever exhibit on the backs of paintings (could have been done more cleverly by displaying the works like sculptures instead of having reproductions displayed alongside). We also went into the exhibition dealing with Gender struggles which was a far more cohesive narrative -but lack of signage meant we entered it the wrong way around (started on top floor and worked down - exhibit flowed vice versa). For a short visit on a foul-weathered day this is a nice place to hang out and enjoy some lovely art-works but I wouldn't say it justifies the pricey entry fee.

Germany,Stadel Museum,3.0,"The works displayed here range from the pre-renaissance period to contemporary. None of them leaves a lasting impression. Overall this is a soulless museum.

Museums with such a wide incursion into the history of Painting need to carefully think the exhibition so as to unite the works into a pleasant museum experience. Perhaps the architecture of the building doesn't help much. Besides the main central rooms, the body of the old building, which are similar in style to the rooms of say, the National Gallery in London, the remaining exhibition rooms are arranged in a somewhat disconnected manner, interrupted by confusing corridors leading to technical areas and bathrooms, or by the audioguide's counter. We almost missed the main attraction of the temporary exhibitions.

The ticket was a bit expensive (being the main touristic attraction in Frankfurt and the Museum of the State) but on the positive side one can download the museum app and listen to the audioguide on ones phone.

Germany,Stadel Museum,2.0,"My husband and I recently visited the museum and were really looking forward to the visit. Unfortunately I felt bullied by the staff and it happened on each floor. Firstly I could not carry my jacket so I put it into my small handbag, then on the next floor the handbag was apparently too big! (I did not want to leave it in the cloakroom as it had our passports in it). Then I was told I was standing too close to the paintings! I am 68 years old and my eyesight is not that good now. We have been to many museums and galleries all over Europe and have never been made to feel so uncomfortable. It completely ruined the experience and we left before seeing all the paintings properly. What a shame when the building and exhibits were so good. Goodness knows what they thought I was going to do!!! It was also surprising that there were no concessions for seniors considering the expensive entrance fee.

Germany,Stadel Museum,3.0,"I agree with whoever said it has a few classy paintings but on the whole the average is not so great, which might be why it is not particularly busy. Again and again the paintings were not in the top league, which was a little disappointing. However, the open expanse of modern art in the basement is a great space and enjoyable to explore.

It is therefore annoying that the website suggests that there are crowds of people visiting so one should buy in advance online, then to find there are no crowds at all and one has to pay an extra euro for the privilege of advance booking, saving the staff at desk from giving out a ticket. And it is very mean that there is no discount for entering the gallery within the last couple of hours before closing. So all in all the place is pricey for a comparatively modest collection.

The tops: Van Eyck's Lucca Madonna, van der Weyden's Medici Madonna, the Bronzino portrait of Francesca Salviati, Rembrandt, Monet, a fairly good group of Beckmanns and Kirchners, especially two Kirchner sculptures, a good Archipenko sculpture, a surprising little Ensor. But as a whole, a not exceptional collection. Not at all comparable to the Ludwig Museum in Cologne or the K20 and K21 in Dusseldorf, when we're talking 20th- and 21st-century art.

However it was 15EUR each which is steep by English standards, where you can visit the majority for free. The big thing for us was that we felt uncomfortable from the moment we entered. We felt that all members of staff were watching us. One stern security guard told myself to move away from a painting, which was mostly unnecessary. Rather than making a quick comment or suggestion, he spoke in German for ages, even after I apologised.

Personally we wouldn't recommend it.

I believe regardless of what type of art interests you, you'll find something here you'll like from the old masters to recent work. It is well setup and is a large enough collection of art it's worth the 14 euro entrance fee. It is also small enough you don't feel exhausted seeing all of it.

Germany,Stadel Museum,4.0,"Came here specifically to see the Vermeer, and was not disappointed. Situated on the cultural strip along the river Main, this museum overall was much smaller than I was expecting but there are some gems of European art, even among the frames. It makes sense that it derives from a personal collection. For that reason, perhaps, it is also quite an unusual art museum; the rough-hewn stone floors for instance, and the bold blue background-walls for the old master paintings. I enjoyed its slight eccentricity: the hang of paintings 'skied' OUTSIDE the gallery for instance. Overall the old-master pictures would look better if they were not hung on long strings, which is more than a little old-fashioned; such a practice skews the artworks' relationship to the wall as well as to neighbouring paintings. But I appreciated being able to take photos (as is obvious here), and being able to get close to the art.

The history of the museum, which is now over 200-years old, is quite colourful; it readily admits to having wrongfully claimed some art as its own in the past. Access via the main entrance is not particularly easy if you have a heavy suitcase (as I did); I would hope that the museum provides another point of access for those in wheelchairs. The bookshop and the adjoining cafe are light-filled and attractive. The admission fee is a bit steep, but if it helps maintain the quality of the museum it's a price worth paying. All the same, there should be the odd day when admission is free (as a gesture of goodwill).

Germany,Stadel Museum,3.0,"Came here to see the advertised & much-hyped exhibitions ‚ÄòSchaufenster des Himmels‚Äô (Heaven‚Äôs Windows) and George Baselitz: Helden (Heroes), both of which are very disappointing. Baselitz may or may not be over-rated, but one thing is certainly true: his paintings are all very similar in design, coloration etc. They tend portray upright, upstanding mock-heroic figures in a vaguely Expressionist manner, and are messily executed. The subjects are interchangeable, the style self-indulgent. Having seen one you have seen them all. The second exhibition shows an early gothic altar from Altenberg, also some finely embroidered altar cloths. While I was there, a guided tour was taking place and as I stood nearby trying to look at the altar, an old woman kept hissing at me to go away, as I had not paid for the guided tour whereas see had. I did not see why I should be moved on from one of the exhibits which I had also paid to see. An unpleasant experience in one of Germany‚Äôs top museums.

Germany,Stadel Museum,4.0,"St√§del Museum was on my list of places to visit in Frankfurt and initially caught my attention when I read the ""Travel Like a Local"" post, which detailed great places to visit the week before my trip.

The main exhibition in the museum is currently ""George Baselitz: Die Helden"" (The Heroes), but on a personal note, I wasn't a fan of this exhibition. the style of the paintings were not to my liking due to the striking colours and ferocious painting, and the graphic nature of the images. Baselitz depicts in this exhibition contorted and unsightly posed soldiers, that are wounded, in battle, or just being,

That being said, I was a big fan of the rest of the museum offering collections from ""Alte Meister 1300 - 1800, Kunst der Moderne 1800 - 1945, Gegenwartskunst 1945 - Heute (today), and a graphics collection.

One can really spend a couple of hours here, and once again learning about part of the history of Germany though the perspective of painters and artists.

Some specialties and my faves were Van Gogh's ""Farmhouse in Nuenen"" and some from Munich painters.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"This is a definite must see place if you happen to be in Frankfurt. Okay, it may not be as big as some of the other galleries, but it certainly is impressive. As well as temporary exhibitions, the Stadel also has three levels of the permanent displays, with the old masters on the upper floors, the modernist (19th and early 20th century) on the middle, and contemporary artwork in the basement. It is probably best to start on the upper level since you get to see how the artwork evolves over time. They are also divided into specific galleries, and each of the galleries has its own theme (or even theme within a theme). It is actually pretty pricey compared to some of the other museums, but it still quite worth visiting.

Germany,Stadel Museum,4.0,"I really enjoyed this museum. I've seen a lot of European art, over years of travel to the continent, but the Staedel has the advantage of providing large but manageable sections each devoted to a different period, giving one an excellent historical tour of the development of western European art, from late medieval images down to contemporary art. It is actually possible to visit all the main sections in about half a day, and I didn't feel as if exhaustion was making me miss anything.

I have a fairly good familiarity with European art from the 1400s to the 1800s, so I spent more time on the period from 1900 to the present. I was very pleased to discover an excellent sculpture by Picasso, and also a painting by Fernand Leger, a twentieth-century artist whom I had only recently discovered. To my surprise, I especially enjoyed the contemporary art, in the lowest level of the building. The space is stark white, large and airy, and provides a startling contrast to the darker rooms devoted to earlier works. I really enjoyed the witty, sometimes cheeky works of art, some of which call into question the very assumptions on which art is based. (One of them, for example, featured a black background on which the word ""paintless,"" with a definition, was stencilled.)

The museum has a ""self-service"" cafe which we wanted to eat at, but it is not air-conditioned, and the area was far too hot to make eating comfortable. There is also a more formal restaurant, whose menu intriguingly features Asian dishes. But it was not open when we were there.

I strongly recommend a visit to the Staedel. It is easily reached by walking from the main train station and across the river on a pedestrian bridge. The Staedel is the nearest of the various museums along the river.

Sadly I was not as impressed as the majority of the reviews on this site. I'm not the world's biggest art enthusiast but I am always ready to give something a look and make my own mind up. The first thing that struck me was any sense of cohesion. The bottom floor was a mish mash of contemporary pieces. Some interesting, some just dull. I guess though that depends on your own idea of art. The first floor was the strangest. Again a mixture, this time of classic artists, Renoir, Van Gogh etc and then a small section of photos of the actor James Dean. Maybe it was me but I just couldn't fathom out the thinking behind it. The second floor is dedicated to portrayals of religious scenes. Images that have always left me feeling cold and uninterested. And, unless I missed something, that was that. All for ‚Ç¨14. One of the more expensive museums here in Frankfurt. Like I said, it's all down to personal taste and who knows, this may be for you. I lasted 10 minutes.

Front desk was not very welcoming...sad as she was one of the first ten people we had spoken to since our arrival in Frankfurt hours before. It was a slow day with no crowd.

Germany,Stadel Museum,4.0,"If you compare it to other museums in some other European cities, you might think it's small. But, in fact, you get to see the works from many important artists without getting tired! And since it isn't as crowded as other very famous museums, you can sit down and enjoy the paintings and sculptures listening to facts about them. Download the app before you go (saves some of your cell phone battery), it has an image recognition option that is a very good idea, the only down is that it sometimes bugs and it doesn't recognize all of the paintings. So there is a lot of room to improving the app but it's a beginning and it helps the visitor to better enjoy the time spent in the museum.
The price is a bit high (14‚Ç¨) but I guess it was worth it!

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"Nice pieces like Degas, Monet, Picasso and various German artists fill the walls of the museum. It is enjoyable, however, it is warm in there. That is surprising since I would have thought that art pieces need to have proper ventilation. Some of the rooms have a central seating area where you can take a rest and admire the grand pieces in front of you. You might need that with the warm temp. Oddly enough, one of the rooms was closed off because they were vacuuming (during the day?) If you take the grand staircase downstairs, you will find yourself amidst contemporary art. Very interesting artwork. A favorite piece is Andy Warhol's depiction of Goethe. There is also a photograph of Warhol posing in front of Goethe's photograph! That is the photo with which he based his artwork. There is a cafe and a restaurant when you need a break.

Germany,Stadel Museum,5.0,"The collection is not huge, but it is very impressive. It is mostly painting with some sculpture. The Old Masters occupy the top floor, with Dutch and Italian paintings especially strong. The first floor displays modern European painting and some sculpture, up to 1945. German painters like Kirschner are especially well represented.
There was a special exhibit on Italian Mannerist painters, very illuminating. English descriptions were very good, and there was also an audio guide which we did not try. We did try the museum's smartphone app, but found that it had mostly the same information as the translated captions beside each work.

The shop is very good. There's a nice cafe with salads, sandwiches and pastries.
On a Friday, we encountered no crowds at all. In fact, there were very few visitors in the evening (museum was open to 9 pm).

When we got off the train in Frankfurt, we bought a Museum Pass, good for two days and working out to only 14 Euro/person for the two of us. It covers pretty much all the many museums in the city. I think the admission for the Stadel alone was 14 Euro, so the pass paid for itself with just one visit. The quality of the art and the relaxed atmosphere made us want to return.

- Construction began in the year 1248.
- At one point the construction was suspended for 300 years
- in WWIII, The Cathedral suffered 14 direct hits from aerial bombing
- The Cathedral was finally finished in 1880.

In addition, the exterior walls of the Cathedral are covered with a stone that will not stand ""high pressure"" washing. So each piece must be cleaned in small areas.. This is the reason that the outside of the Cathedral looks and is dirty from years of not being cleaned.

In 1996 the Cathedral of Cologne was added to the UNesco world Heritage List.

The interior has many beautiful historic pieces . It was dark inside the church when we visited.

The majestic Gothic style church with soaring twin spires, flying buttresses and massive stone columns looked as impressive as before. The huge nave with impressive columns, stain glassed windows, and decorative organs were impressive as usual. Visitors with exposed shoulders and knees were stopped at the entrance, and were offered thin blue coveralls to wear before being allowed to enter the cathedral.
The location of this cathedral was so convenient to visitors to Cologne by train or ship. The Central Train Station (Koln Hauptbahnhof) was right behind the cathedral, and the river cruise ship terminal was just across Rhine River. At night, the illuminated cathedral building and other buildings along River Rhine formed an impressive night time skyline of Cologne.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,4.0,"Our first view of the Cologne Cathedral (K√∂lner Dom, officially Hohe Domkirche Sankt Petrus, English: Cathedral Church of Saint Peter) is the Catholic cathedral in Cologne. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Cologne and of the administration of the Archdiocese of Cologne. It is a renowned monument of German Catholicism and Gothic architecture and was declared a World Heritage Site in 1996. This landmark attracts on average about 20,000 people a day, and currently the tallest twin-spired church at 515 ft tall, second in Europe after Ulm Minster (which we visited in 2018) and third tallest in the world. Its has the world's largest church fa√ßade which is dominated by two 515 ft high towers. The exterior is beautifully decorated with plenty of statues, bar tracery, pinnacles, gargoyles and flying buttresses. The Cathedral's oldest doorway is the Petersportal, built between 1370 and 1380 and decorated with statues. It took centuries to construct this Cathedral beginning in 1248 and finished in the 19th century. On this trip we did not ascend to the top of the spires. It was gray and rainy for most of the trip and there were other interesting things to see. Allow ~1 hr for your visit.

The view from the top is amazing but, be aware that there are hundreds of narrow spiral stairs (with two-way traffic) to climb to get to the top, and there aren't many resting station in between so, once you start to climb, you must commit. We saw many old people, out-of-breath, stuck on the stairs, blocking the way. It definitely helps if you're in shape.",Mar 2019

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,4.0,"This amazing, immense cathedral is definitely something to see. The exterior is made from Sandstone that is blackened from the weather and it took 632 years from the start of construction to when it was eventually finished, with wars and bombings in between. Easily seen from the Rhine River it is a UNESCO World Heritage Sight. When we were there there was a lot of scaffolding around the building as they were cleaning the sandstone, a massive job. It is situated close to the railway station, beware of scams and pick pockets in the area. Our guide told us that people are distracted by the chalk art work on the ground and then get their wallets stolen. The interior is amazing, if you're fit enough then going to the top platform via the 533 steps is worth it. It was a slow walk up as there were so many people doing it, but the views were great.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"If you happen to visit Cologne, the cathedral is a must. Dating back to as early as 1100 AD, words cannot express the construction and beauty. The outside, which is made of sandstone, has a gothic, grayish hue. However, when the sun hits it, the slight display of a pinkish/tan can be observed. Inside, the stained glass and floor are just breathtaking. Be sure to take your time and look at the intricacies of the floor. We were consumed with it. If you are physically able, be sure to walk up the cathedral. With over 500 winding steps that are not for anyone that struggles to walk, the panoramic view from the top is well worth the trek.

I would also recommend walking down to the bars and restaurants along the water. Cologne was a city we will be sure to visit again!

It‚Äôs an absolute must to see the inside as well as the outside. If you have the stamina and energy you should take the 500+ steps to go to the very top. Keep in mind it gets very narrow at the very top of it. The steps are steep and extremely narrow and small.

During the war this was used as the focal point to bomb the city. Which is why only one corner of the cathedral was ever damaged, friendly bombing.

The majority of the cathedral has stayed intact from the time it was built. Each spire is generally being kept in maintenance here and there.

The bones of the Three Wise Men are said to be kept here, which seems to be it's claim to fame, although Napoleon is said to have used it to stable his horses at one point which I thought was much more interesting. It's definitely worth a visit, especially as it's free. An added and humorous bonus is the Roman wall and well which can be found in the parking lot just below the Cathedral which the owner did not deem important enough to stop construction for, so instead just built around.

A good climb - 533 steps- up one of the towers

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"This Catholic church was finished in 1880, after 632 years of construction work and it is nowadays one of the most significant pilgrimage places in Europe, due to its historical significance and priceless relics kept inside. Apparently. the sandstone covering the building walls reacts with the acid rain, turning a dark grey, and giving the edifice its blackish colour, in spite of renovations over time.
There are a multitude of areas not to be missed, once you enter the cathedral. Probably the most memorable is the South tower, accessible by elevator, otherwise by foot, if you dare the challenge to climb its 533 steps. From the top platform , you have an impressive view over the city, from a height of approximately 100 m. At the ground level, you need to wander through the large expanse of the naves, under the 43 m high arches ceiling, in order to see the main and two side naves, in detail. The decorations are exquisite. Then there are the choir ambulatory, the Shrine of the Three Kings behind the altar, and a few various chapels. Also, underground, accessible for and extra fee and by elevator, there is a treasury - where no taking pictures is allowed, holding holy relics, liturgical items, and works of art in precious metals and stones, some dating from the 4th century.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"We stepped out of the station and there it was, right in front of us. Amazing and fascinating in its looming medieval glory. We had come, from Holland, just to see this.

It was the facade that made the first and abiding impression. Dark, but oh so detailed. We looked up, studying the details. Delighted by the life-like statues, the proportion and balance. We looked again and again. Wanted to step back some more to get a better perspective, but there was a busy traffic intersection. Not safe to walk into it looking at the cathedral. From the other side of the intersection, the view was blocked by large tour buses.

We walked around the back of the cathedral, had to to get to our hotel. We approached it from the south side, where much of the view was taken up by a concrete and glass museum that wasn't open. We marveled for a long time at the facade. We went inside.

Inside was just as balanced and detailed outside. The whole made a kind of sense, but the details were from different centuries and in different styles. Making sense and bringing pleasure along with the sense of history and reverence, but not quite fitting together as the facade did.

Not too noisy inside. Still room and time for meditation and worship.

We left, looking back on this hunk of architecture dumped into the city by history. Extremely imposing. You just have to design your city centre around it.

At night, from the hotel, we had a superb view of the floodlit clock tower. Unforgettable.

Catholic cathedral church, located in the city of Cologne, Germany. It is the largest Gothic church in northern Europe and features immense twin towers that stand 515 feet (157 metres) tall. The cathedral was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.
The site of Cologne Cathedral has been occupied by Christian churches since about the 4th century. An older cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1248, and immediately thereafter work began on the present cathedral, which was designed in the Gothic style in emulation of French church architecture. The choir was consecrated in 1322, but construction continued until 1560 (or only until 1520, according to some authorities). The architects Ernst Friedrich Zwirner and Richard Voigtel carried out the enterprise, guided by architectural drawings made in about 1300. Construction finally ended in 1880.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,The Cologne cathedral is the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe and has the second-tallest spires. The towers for its two huge spires give the cathedral the largest fa√ßade of any church in the world and what is the most interesting- during 4 years in the past it was the tallest building in whole world.,Nov 2019
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"I had my first view of this famous cathedral as we arrived on our Rhine Cruise, it was simply stunning. It is only a short walk from the river or the station and wherever you go in Cologne it dominates the skyline.

Some say it looks dirty, but I think the colour is part of its charm. It is amazing that it survived the bombing in World War II when so much didn‚Äôt. Our guide told us that navigators used the two towers as a navigation aid - don‚Äôt know if this is true.

The interior was nice but not spectacular, for me it is the gothic exterior that is so special. You can, for a small fee, climb 533 stone steps to a viewing platform for some special views.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"The cathedral has been standing here for centuries now and that was pretty obvious considering the top walls and spires all turned black from soot deposits. Only some parts of it could retain the original colour. The backside of the building was being renovated. It‚Äôs magnificent to look at though, and very big in size. We weren‚Äôt aware of the modest dressing norm here and so my wife had to cover up her shoulders with a scarf they provided. Once inside the cathedral the beauty was unmatched. It was a gothic masterpiece. We were lucky enough that a prayer had started when we entered and we did witness the ceremony. I totally loved it !!",Aug 2019

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"Honestly the major reason we came to Cologne was to visit the cathedral. It was right across the street from the hotel which was very advantageous since it was lit up at night and its nice just to walk there and head back. The inside of the church is awe inspiring and a classic Gothic church. Since we were traveling away from the summer mayhem, it did not feel crowded at all. Don't forget to also look down since the mosaic floor is also and incredible work of art. The stained glass windows are to die for.
You also have to climb to the top. The entrance is just to the right of the church and outside the church. We did not see the sign initially and enjoyed walking around the church. You actually go down the stairs. If you keep going straight there is a bathroom. When you turn left at the bottom of the stairs you will quickly see where to start. There is a small gift shop as well. There is a 8 euro charge to climb and also see the treasury later which is cheaper than going to the doctor for a treadmill stress test. 533 steps later you are at the top. It was 60 degrees which made it so much easier. It would be far more difficult during the summer. We always carry a couple of bottles of water which for obvious reasons get lighter as we climb. Minimize what you carry to avoid extra torture. There was a couple in front of us and behind us which was nice since none of us were in a rush. I just can't imagine what the crowds must be like during the summer.
The view is spectacular and absolutely worth the climb. Felt absolutely safe up there though those with acrophobia may not feel the same way. If you want the full experience you have to climb to the top. There is also a crush penny machine at the top if you want a souvenier. Enjoy.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"It is hard for me to grasp the number of people it took to complete this cathedral over the span of more than six centuries. Before construction on this cathedral could begin, the existing cathedral had to be torn down and removed since it was deemed too small for the growing city. The foundation stone was laid in 1248 but work on the structure did not progress smoothly. Construction was on and off over the centuries and the cathedral was considered complete in 1880. Maintaining and restoring the cathedral seems to be a never ending task; witness the scaffolding seen today.
This is a must see site - for the art and architecture, for the testament to human accomplishment, and to honor a God who inspires us.

The church that owns the cathedral asks everybody to donate money to repair the damage in the war they started, and you can find pieces of the church that were blown off by the bombs everywhere, but it is obvious that the Brits tried very hard to miss this beautiful structure.

The interior is also quite impressive. We were there on a sunny fall day and the stained glass windows glowed. The gargoyles are very cool with some of them quite bawdy.

I'm now back to reading the Bible and it did mention The Magi as 3kings who brought gifts, I guess I missed that part!

This had the bones, they're not uncorrupted. I don't know if they performed miracles but i was in awe that they've decided as kings to be together and is now in Cologne Cathedral.

For me the most inspiring part of the visit was the crucifix which was over 1000 years old, the Milan madonna, and the shrine of the three Kings, which were both over 800 years old. Amazing to think of all the visitors over the years looking at these relics. There are many areas of the cathedral where it is possible to light a candle. Entrance is free, although donations are always gratefully received. There is a fee to visit the tower and the treasury. The cathedral dominates the skyline.

They are bit particular about clothes, so make sure your arms are covered and no cleavage is shown. They will have covers at the door for you, if they find something inappropriate. On the entry we saw group of people painting the flags of almost all the popular countries which looked really amazing. We also shred some extra ‚Ç¨ on our country's flag.
The outside of the cathedral is not made of black material, nor is it just dirty, instead the sandstone which most of the building is made from reacts with the sulfuric acid in rain & turns dark grey, giving the cathedral it's distinctive dark color.
The cathedral has the world's third largest church interior. The cathedral's colorful glass windows are especially impressive. They sparkle like precious stones and bring a vibrant intensity of color into the church. It was hit by 14 bomb during world war II, but the building did not fell.
The entry is free, but if you wish to climb up the tower with spiral staircase to enjoy the scenic view of the city over the river Rhine (approx 533 steps) you need to pay 3‚Ç¨.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"The Cologne Cathedral (the Dom), located in Dom Square, is a heavenly dual-steepled building with openwork spires that project skyward and are visible for miles serving as a landmark for Cologne city centre. It is Herculean in stature, the Mount Everest of churches ever built and as I approached its imposing facade it appeared like something plucked from Disneyland. The exterior colour scheme was perplexing; however, a kind of a 'dirty snow' appearance. This illusionary effect stems from fact that the limestone facades were built in significantly different time era's with resulting white and dark limestone colour variations (almost 700 years to build).

As I entered the Dom, through the great central portal (already opened), their size seemed overbearing and begged the question: 'How are they opened'. Inside my first impression of the interior is that it was dominated by the enormous measure of the aisle to the main alter. It was barricaded from visitors, shone brightly as if just buffed and polished and seemed to go on forever as if the floor was bowling lanes joined 'end-on-end' as far as the eye can see. Grabbing my attention upward were a bevy of enormous stained glass windows each with their own religious story to portray. The Dom was heavily bombed during WWII, as was Cologne in general and a number of these glass masterpieces were dismantled, stored and remounted after the war. Some were lost and had to be reconstructed by the Dom's glass repair lab. Interesting, the colours in the new constructions were arranged by using a random number generator. To me, this seemed like quite a fusion of science and religion.

The Dom is completely open on the inside, a feature of Gothic architecture that makes supporting walls unnecessary due to an outside supporting structure. The Cathedral is chucked full of chapels, alters, statues, tabernacles, prayer coves, memorials to saints
and other items precious to the Catholic Church and what that entails. Of particular importance within the Dom, is the Shrine of the Magi. It holds the relics of the Magi (aka..the 3 wise men), who brought gifts of gold, frankincense and mer to Mary and Joseph on the occasion of the birth of Jesus in a stable in Bethlehem (Christmas). In my opinion, the premier attraction in the Dom. I viewed a spectacular statue called the Jewelry Madonna with the Mother and Child clothed in elaborate fabrics, richly adorned. It is still customary in Cologne to donate precious stones or gold to this statue when seeking help in matters of love or when couples want to have children.

The Dom is a bastion of significant religious treasures. This collection of sacred objects has been built up over the years through acquisitions, purchases and donations. This collection is irreplaceable. On the basement level, I witnessed a working lab where experts in Gothic design and repair --- reconstruct and fix Cathedral entities that need tender-loving-care or re-creation altogether. Some 70 stone masons work daily on facade restorative and maintenance requirements.

To close up my visit with a bit of exercise, I decided to scale the 533 steps up the Dom south tower to the base of the steeple for a spectacular view of Cologne. I traded this trek as penance for my sins.

On my way out the Dom, I couldn't help noticing a ray a light from the heavens piercing though a stained glass window and reflecting a spectrum of colour on the gleaming mosaic floor. A fitting end to great Cathedral visit.

So, if you would like to witness some amazing Gothic architecture, in a religious context and portraying a presence that you will remember long after your visit........................
then taken in the Cologne Cathedral............Stairway to Heaven.

The cathedral was bombed during WWII, with the massive spires and the main body of the Gothic cathedral surviving and serving as a landmark to Allied bombers attacking the Nazi Germany interior! The reconstruction is wonderful, and the interior is only surpassed by the massiveness of the exterior!!! We spent quite a lot of time inside, looking at the incredible painted windows, and other artwork inside!

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"I was on a cruise down the Rhine and missed breakfast so I could be in the cathedral by 7am. It was open with only an early morning service in progress in a side chapel and a few canons in their lovely red robes. I sat and admired the stained glass windows as sunlight poured through them. Suddenly the cathedral filled with the most wondrous music from the main church organ. At the moment it was hard not to believe in the majesty of the Almighty.

The cathedral is simply magnificent in scale and architecture and yet it retains its spirituality. This is a place that is not to be missed but try to get there early as I did since often the cathedral closes or partially closes to visitors while they hold services. You must also cover your shoulders upon entering.

i sat for a long time , admiring the windows , architecture and marveling at the serene and tranquil atmosphere . One of the canons advised me that the cathedral belfry opened at 9am and i should climb the 533 steps to the top for some truly magnificent views of Cologne. The cost is 5E.The toilets are near the entrance to the belfry, so stop there first since it is a 30 minute climb up a steep winding medieval stair case to see the bells and reach the top of the belfry. The views are indeed wonderful.

In Germany everyone of Christian faith pays a 6% church tax to help maintain their churches- the only way to avoid the tax is to renounce your religion. Germany takes its churches seriously and the care of this church shows that.

In the square in front of the church is evidence of Roman Cologne and a model of one of the cathedral's finials which is enormous. It is also decorated with plaques in many languages as a symbol of unity.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,Some buildings are so famous you seem to know everything about them. I have three impressions of the cathedral having seen it in person. Up close from the outside it is overwhelming and you can feel dwarfed (oppressed?) by the scale and detail of it. Go to the opposite bank of the Rhine and see it in the distance as the sun sets and the delicate beauty is breathtaking. The abiding impression is seeing the view up the central nave with the columns rising seemingly impossibly high and the light flooding through the windows. Then you know this is a special place and you are privileged to experience it. Now add all the art work and other features and you see why people rave about it.,Sep 2019
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"Cologne Cathedral is possibly one of the finest buildings or churches in all of Germany. The building is truly monumental and masterpiece of gothic architecture. The twin spires rise to an astonishing 157 metres. The difficulties of visitors trying to fit the entire spire into a photograph a testament to its scale.

Inside the cathedral is no less monumental and the tall soaring columns a match for the soaring heights of the spires outside. There some fantastic stained glass inside especially the contemporary ""pixel"" on the right hand transept. If you're lucky the light streaming in creates a nice rainbow effect through it. Many of the traditional stained glass are truly magnificent for the amount of detail. They just don‚Äôt make them like they used to.

The reliquary holding the shrine (whether you believe or not) is amazing. The metalwork around the shrine is a masterpiece of gold-smithery. I was told by the guide that each of the characters on the shrine is unique. I didn't check, but I believe it looking at a few.

A must visit when in Cologne.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,4.0,"We spent much of our short break in Cologne at the world famous Cathedral as there is so much to see!

We took a one hour guided tour booked via the dom office at 8 euro each. It was well worth it - our guide, Thomas, had an encylopaedic knowledge of the history of so many parts of the Cathedral. His tour was informative and constantly interesting that the hour flew by.

We also did The Cathedral Treasury Tour, which despite having some amazing artifacts on display, we thought that the 'flow'of the exhibits didn't quite work and therefore it was a little disappointing. At times it was not always clear where to go next and apart from staff at the entrance we did not see anyone else during the walk around.

Finally, we took the ascent of the second tower!! It took some courage for someone who doesn't like heights to ascend the 530+ small stone spiral steps. But after letting others rush past me, I took my time and finally got
to the be viewing platform and it definitely was worth the effort! The view of Cologne was amazing and I felt pretty good too!

Overall we loved Cologne during our 3 night stay and we will definitely come back for more. The people were friendly and prices we found reasonable.

Only down point - as with most major towns or cities world-wide was the number of people begging. From our arrival at the train station to every time we went out- day or night - we were met by people young and old begging. It is a reality and sign of our times I know and maybe sometimes easier to ignore at home but we couldn't help but notice it on our time in Cologne.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,4.0,"Take Notre-Dame de Paris. Scale it up. A lot. Let exteriors darken and get pretty ominous.

Copy ‚Äúvirtue police‚Äù concept and put people making sure you are properly dressed around, but equip them with a number of covers that they can provide if necessary. And instruct them that maybe they do not have to be ambassadors of culture, but they are not allowed to compete with Notre-Dame de Paris security for rudeness world championship. And build a huge rail hub just by, so any passenger that has a transfer with a sensible time buffer may just casually walk in. Profit.

I would consider an alternative to the view from the Kolner Dom‚Äôs tower (namely KolnTriangle), as it is quite difficult to catch a highlight of the city in your panorama while you are actually standing on it.

There is also the chance to go to the top by climbing 533 steps. 509 of them being the original ones.
The cost is just 5 euros and worth every cent. It‚Äôs a steep circular climb though so check your vital signs before you try.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"I used to work in Dusseldorf many years ago and I'd take the train to Cologne just to see the Kolner Dom. It is massive and it is hard to describe how impressive it is.
We stayed in Dusseldorf and took the train to see it - twice. One of the times we also took a Segway Tour of Cologne which you can read about on TripAdvisor.
You can't escape seeing the Kolner Dom - it dominates the skyline. When you arrive by rail at the main station, you're across the street from it.
This should be on your bucket list to see.",Sep 2019

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"The Cologne Cathedral, formally Kolner Dom stands majectically in the center of Cologne. I will not repeat the stats of the cathedral. I am sure you have read or seen them already. The cathedral is open from early to 9:00 pm in the summer. Due to Sunday services, it opens to the public at 1:00 on Sunday. The shear size and beauty of the cathedral will leave you speechless. Expect some scaffolding around the church as restoration and cleaning is underway. After absorbing the exterior, you will be equally amazed at the interior. But just before entering, take a look at the archway and the statutes on either side and the small statutes in 4 arches all across the the arch. Then look up at the intricate carvings all the way to the top. Make sure to see the shrine of the three kings, behind the alter. It is all gold, cant miss it. You will be amazed at the huge arches on either side of the main aisle and the main alter, the two side alters and the massive stained glass windows throughout the cathedral. Oh and dont forget the organ. Just look up, it is in the clouds.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"Love this church. Personally I think it‚Äôs nicer than Notre Dame. It‚Äôs definitely bigger, has same amount of details if not more, and lots more to see inside. Entry is by donation.

Just a little history about this church: it‚Äôs black on the outside not because it‚Äôs dirty but the oxidised of the sandstone overtime. The church was bombed 14 times in WWII with over 70 bombs and still standing. Amazing ! It took 600 years to build.

One note. On google map and on TripAdvisor, the shrine of 3 wisemen was listed separately but its actually located inside the church. They are not as big as I thought it would be. Nevertheless it‚Äôs still good to see and be close to it.

Lots of people will walk on or walk by the beautiful mosaic floor and not noticing it. They are man made, put together piece by piece to form a beautiful master piece. See one of my photos below.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,3.0,The Cathedral is a magnificent sight when walking out of the train station. It also made me sad that the grime of a city is incased in its walls. I know most of our beautiful architecture has been ruined by pollution and this is definitely one. The information leaflet in English is very good and it is helpful as you walk around. Unfortunately there was lots of chapels were were not permitted to go into which was disappointing. The tower was also closed so unable to walk up. We did visit the Cathedral Treasury for an admission fee of 6 euros which held some beautiful artefacts and the treasury is split over three floors. This was very interesting.,Aug 2019
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"We first saw it driving into Cologne - from miles away. It towers over everything else.

Up close, the first reaction I had was a pause in breathing. Nothing you see in photos prepares you for it‚Äôs magnificence up close. It is like something out of a gothic dream/nightmare. It is one of the most impressive structures I‚Äôve ever visited. And that‚Äôs just the outside.

We paid the small fee to climb the 533 steps to a height of just under 100 m. This is a serious climb - not for the very young, very old or frail. Views of the city from the top are obscured to some degree by fencing, but you can see around it. It‚Äôs amazing to see the detailed architecture up close.

You could easily spend an hour or two in the main part of the cathedral. Note that, to enter the cathedral, you need to have covered shoulders (they will provide a free, thin shawl for those who need it). We skipped the audio tour, and simply wandered through the various areas in awe-struck wonder.

Despite the large number of tourists visiting, this is mandatory stop in Cologne.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"Cologne Cathedral was built to house the relics of the Magi. The story goes that the relics were stolen by Frederick I also known as Frederick Barbarossa (""Redbeard"") in the 12th century and brought to Cologne. While this is a much visited site the line to enter was not long. The relics are in the back of the Cathedral housed in a golden sarcophagus (wood covered with gold and silver). It is decorated with more than a thousand jewels and beads. Less noticed is a portion of the old Roman north gate to the left of the new entrance dating back to 50 AD. Easy to visit though there are a few steps to get up the the Cathedral. If time allows daily services are held that the public can attend. Times vary so check the schedule.

Firstly, entry was free, but we did pay to enter the Treasury to look at all the cathedral treasures. Entry price was reasonable, which was ‚Ç¨12 for a family ticket.

There was another option of climbing the 500+ steps to the top of the cathedral, but we decided against this, as we had our little one with us. This came with a charge, but not sure how much this would have cost.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"The museum traces the history of the car from their inventors Benz and Daimler to concept cars of the future with amazing cars (many originals, some re-built), parts, displays and movies. You get a free audio-guide (German or English) and can move at your own pace and take in as much or as little as you want. You take an elevator to level 8 and take a spiraling way down through different eras. All is accompanied by displays covering world events and respective sound (i.e. clopping horses at the beginning or Rock ‚Äòn Roll in the 50s). Side galleries cover trucks, people transport, vehicles owned by famous people (including Lady Di and the pope) and temporary exhibits (I went to see the one celebrating 40 years G-Wagen). There‚Äôs a deli on the ground floor which you can also access to take a break and then re-enter the exhibition area with your ticket. The shop is accessible without entering the exhibition (no ticket required). The museum‚Äôs parking garage was full when I arrived, but right next to it there was another garage.
Local Covid-19 regulations mean wearing a mask is mandatory and contact details have to be filled in. There were automatic hand sanitizers all throughout the building and people mostly watched their distance. There are also museum guards on each level. A nice surprise was that when returning the audio guide you get to keep the branded lanyard (which usually would be sold...). I spent 2.5 hours and wouldn‚Äôt mind going again with visiting family or friends.
The museum is located near the Mercedes-Benz Arena football stadium so visits can be easily combined.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,3.0,"The museum is based in an amazing building and attempts to discribe Mercedes history with European history.

However, it fails to really discribe clearly any of the engineering advances Mercedes have made. It also fails to really create an engaging narrative around the politics and history which Mercedes was affected by or helped effect. The first rooms jump back from the new engines to explaining how great were the dramatis personae and it all seemed disjointed.

The later rooms feels like a collection of the sales catalogues and that the rooms were compiled by public relation professionals rather than educators. After being in the vehicles dedicated to public service I was quite board of the museum

For all the money spent on this palace very little time was investing how to create some engaging narratives which Mercedes developed through

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Wow, what a museum! We toured the old Mercedes Museum in 1994, and thought it was great, but this place leaves it in the dust! You start by taking an elevator to the top floor, and then walking down a gradual spiral to the ground floor, seeing all the displays arranged in chronological order, from the very first automobiles by Daimler and Benz, including the early engines, designed by Maybach. This is truly the beginnings of the gasoline powered automobile, and the history is well described on each display item in both German and English. If you're a car nut like me, you'll be thrilled by the tour, but even if you're not an avid car enthusiast, there's something about the history and development of the automobile, from the early primitive days, to the modern concept cars of the future that will appeal to almost everyone. And the displays are set in the context of world events of the times, including the company's role in production of military engines and vehicles for the Germans during WW2. There are also some interactive hands-on displays that are really interesting...I loved the one where you can hand crank a supercharger to see how it increased engine horsepower. That loud siren-like whine is something to remember! Plan on spending 3-4 hours to see everything . I can't wait to go back!

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,3.0,"Overall really enjoyed this. I accompanied my husband and surprised myself that I appreciated the cars and historical information. We could have spent longer than the 6 hours we did spend.
My feedback would be to have more opportunities for interaction. Why not provide stools or platforms so we can climb up and look inside the cars? How about some that we could actually get into, or pretend to drive?

Not very child friendly because one would be constantly telling the child not to touch the vehicles!

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Wow. Mercedes has spared no expense with this amazing museum. It is worth coming to Stuttgart just to experience it.

For starters, the architecture of the museum itself is incredible. I am sure you could take a tour just covering the architecture of the building. It is truly beautiful.

But the cars inside the museum are even more beautiful. The collection is fantastic and extensive.

We took an English language tour and it was well worth it. Our guide was a long-time Mercedes employee, who is married to one of the top Mercedes executives. His knowledge of the brand was garnered through a storied career at the company. I guess he just likes giving the tours for fun.

The tour itself starts at the beginning, the 19th Century that is. Mercedes-Benz has such a long history in the development of the automobile and the museum has cars, motors, and artifacts from every aspect of the continuing evolution. The tour gives a great overview of this history, but you could literary go back and spend all day looking at each car and reading about their history. There is some much to learn.

There is also a nice, if pricey, gift shop where you can find all things Mercedes.

A thrilling day at the museum.

My particular favourite was the section where they showcased some of the cars that were owned by celebrities or important people of our time. The entire place can easily take up 2 or more hours of your time depending on what interests you. Each visitor is provided with an audio guide and you activate it by aiming the device at exhibits that interest you.

Remember not to throw away your ticket as it gives you a 10% discount should you decide to visit the Porsche museum on the other side of town. At the same time, consider having a meal at Bertha's located at the basement which is another experience on its own.

I am a particular fan of early history, and the first part of the exhibit which showed the development of the very first automobiles by Benz and Daimler was captivating. Everything about this museum in terms of information provided (in both English and German) was very well thought out, including important events over the past three centuries. The curators are to be commended for including Mercedes-Benz's complicity in the atrocities of World War II . Obviously a museum for car buffs, I still believe that non-car lovers would find this a worthwhile experience. Some of the fully restored examples of cars from the 30s were just exceptional in terms of their beautiful lines.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,3.0,"Seeing that the Mercedes-Benz Museum is the #1 rated attraction on TripAdvisor and with so many posts saying that it's a must-see even if you're not a car enthusiast, I decided to visit.

My thoughts:
- Incredible building. The architecture is what I enjoyed most about the entire visit. You start the tour by taking an elevator to the top, and then basically wind down around the building until you reach the bottom.
- Along the walking path, there are a lot of photo displays of important historical, scientific, pop-culture events that have nothing to do with Mercedes-Benz, but they provides some context to what else was going on in the world through the history of Mercedez-Benz. This was more interesting to me than the vehicles.
- There are plenty of vehicles to look at, as would be expected. But as a non-car enthusiast, I found I only wanted to see a sampling of each on each floor, as I wasn't all that interested in seeing every single one.
- This is a big museum. I rushed through it in about 90 minutes, because I had an appointment to make later that day. Would probably take closer to 3-4 hours if you saw everything.
- I would imagine if my kids were with me - they would find it pretty boring. I wouldn't recommend for young kids. The only thing that might have been cool is the racing simulators.

Overall, for a car or Mercedes-Benz enthusiast, this would most definitely be a 5 star attraction. But as a non-car entusiast, I thought it was OK for 10 Euros, but didn't find it all that engaging.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,3.0,"We visited the museum 25th October in the afternoon. Unfortunately, there was a large event in the evening (Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the year 2019).
Due to this event, a large part of the lower floor was closed.
There was a lot of pressure to get everybody out at 18h00.

There were no general open guided tours this day due to ""capacity issues"". Only a special G-series tour was available.

The building is architecturally very impressive, but I do recommend to get a guided tour if possible. I think it's much more efficient then the free audio guide.

The free audio guide becomes uncomfortable for wearing after several hours. And it's not really a guide, but a kind of media player you can use to get spoken info at many points in the museum.
There are Wifi icons almost everywhere, where you have to point the guide device to the icon to get info. Unfortunately, there are more points then I liked where nothing happend.
Usage is not really intuitive (and I'm an IT specialist).
Audio often didn't start immediately, you had to restart the guide a second time to get audio.

Wheelchair accessibility is good, but the viewpoints in between the different floors have high railings. If you can't stand, you can't see very much at these overview points.

There are many unique cars in excellent condition in the museum, some more interesting then others.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Being that there are so many car museums in Germany, you probably want to either prioritize which ones to see or just want to know which are the best. We did them all on our trip and for sure the Mercedes Benz museum was the best. It was the largest one, most interesting, all information in English, best tour guides, and imo best German car there is ;) beautiful building built across the street from VFB Stuttgart‚Äôs arena and training facilities, if you‚Äôre into football. I‚Äôd 100% recommend doing a guided tour since they give you more information and show you the highlights. If not, you could literally spend all day in there reading everything but I think the tour is the best use of your time as a tourist. Our guide took us through Daimler Benz history as separate car producers and then the ultimate merger later on. On display are the first engines ever invented, cars, trucks, vans, trains, boats, you name it and they‚Äôve got it. As you work your way down from the top, you gradually become more modern and that was for me the coolest part. Being able to compare their original models to the relatively new ones, then going to the basement to the brand new car dealership with all of their brand new cars. Parking is pretty easy to come by, either underground in the museum or on the street outside where it‚Äôs free. We liked this museum much better than BMW and Porsche but I guess it depends on which brand you like best

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"We wanted to kill some time before flying home, and had already visited Porsche previously.

I only wish we had a bit more time to look at everything instead of only two hours.",Oct 2019
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"This museum is very interactive compared to most museums. I really enjoyed the way the museum was designed in order to easily guide your way through the museum. When you first start your way into the museum, you are given a device similarly alike to an iPhone and earphone headset with a complimentary Mercedes Benz neck strap. On your device you simply choose your language and click start, you immediately start to hear an auditory introduction to your auditory tour. (No tour guide needed) You start at the top floor, with the historical/older models at first and as you go to the bottom floor you reach the most up to date models. Almost every car or gadget accessory will have a wifi symbol towards the description of each piece, if you see the symbol simply point your device to the signal, once you hear a vibration you will get 3-4 options you can choose from, of descriptive audio information relating to that specific model. I found this very helpful and great because you may learn at your own pace. Depending on how much information you would like to hear you can spend an average of 3-8 hours here.

There is also a souvenir shop, and cafe area at the end of the tour, along with a dealership - Maybach located on the top floor. If you go towards the back of the top floor dealership, there is an area interactive area where you can click on each model to hear what their start up engines sound like.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"I was reluctant to go as I‚Äôm not into cars, but I‚Äôm so glad I did. This is a beautiful well designed building that showcases not only the journey of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz over the years, but the history of the evolution of the automobile in relation to the history of the times in Europe and the world. The scope of the company in and around Stuttgart is mind boggling and I was lucky enough to do a tour of their factory at Sindelfingen as well. The museum offers information either by tour guide, headset or stories displayed on the walls. Seeing all the beautiful cars on display was nostalgic and impressive.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"This is more than an homage to the Daimler-Benz and Mercedes marques, it is a history of the development of the motor car and its place in the social history of Germany and to some respects Europe. The exhibition is over 7 floors accessible by a spiral walkway and lifts. So perfect for push chairs and wheel chairs. The audio guide is included in the price. This has quite a few languages and automatically explains the theme if a floor when you enter it. Thereafter you point it at a display board and get specific information. I particularly liked that you could hear General, Technkgical and Social and Childrens information by choice. The cares are immaculate with plenty of room to walk around and photograph without people being in the way for long. There are great 10 minute documentaries most floors with well selected archive film to explain the period of history covered by the floor. And of course the cars, vans and buses are to die for. There are 2 cafes, one on the ground floor and one on the first floor. They seem quite small for the number of people who visit, but the food was fresh and well presented. Mainly cake and filled rolls.
There is a small shop with well designed but overpriced branded merchandise. Plenty of parking next door but very expensive. There is some deal to get your first hour free which we missed so paid ‚Ç¨7 for 4.5 hours. In that time we didnt get through all the floors. Highly recommended, especially on a wet day.

And yes, they do mention the war. I learned that Mercedes, like many other german companys, used forced labour during the war. But of course they have apologized for this. So now I can never buy a Mercedes beacause of this. Sad, seems to be a nice c car.

Mercedes just has much more history to cover than Porsche, as well as, as wider range of products. Porsche was about racing. MB has its racing aspect for sure, which is at the end of the tour. But the majority of the exhibit is from the very beginnings of automobile production thru present. The walkways to the next section are sloped downhill so easy to walk and there are lighted panels that discuss history. I was happy to see that it wasn't all about Mercedes Benz. That is most certainly covered but there are world events that fit into the timeline as well. I really liked the cars from the 1920s and 30's. Classic.

The cafe was alright. Our egg and bacon toasties were cold.

The layout is very wheelchair friendly and very easy to access. I liked the plush lift and how clean and modern everything was. Toilets were pristine and the gift shop was huge! I know my boyfriend was very happy with the trip so that's all that matters!

We took the guided tour which was interesting but felt like a race to fit in way too much info in 75 min or so. Parking is not free so keep that in mind and you are not allowed to take your bag/water bottle into the exhibition which was to us very very annoying and uncomfortable, every time we wanted something out of the bag we had to walk to the lockers (which are free at least).",Jun 2019

It‚Äôs looks architecturally superb as you first see the building and it‚Äôs equally impressive inside. With our seniors cards it was half price and would have been worth full admission! With the provided audio guide we took the lift to the top floor and then started the impressive spiral descent similar to the approach at the Gugenheim Museum in New York. The history of the three main protagonists who started the firms that were to evoke Mercedes Benz, messrs Benz, Daimler and Maybach was done very effectively and after that we saw the steady progress made as they improved the cars, buses, trucks, etc. We spent more than two hours in the museum and we could have spent a lot more time there as we rushed through the last few floors devoted to racing. Absolutely fabulous!

It was just so interesting and the cars were amazing. Everything was just so sparkling clean and plenty of room to move round and get a close look at all the vehicles (not just cars). You should not miss this if in Stuttgart. Oh, and photos allowed.

The only downside was that the free lockers were all full so we had to take out bags with us. But if your bag is too big you have no choice but to leave it there.

It is located inside the main complex at Mercedes-Benz. The cars bearing the three-pointed star are not the only attraction here - the architecture of the building is spectacular - it takes the form of a double-helix.

Inside the museum - throughout the exhibition you are shown the complete development of over 1,500 vehicles since 1886. The museum showcases almost every automobile ever made by the company. You take a fascinating time journey from the origins of the earliest designs by Carl Benz & Gottlieb Daimler, move on to the Silver Arrows of the 1950s, the F1 car, & finish with a glimpse into the future; all are represented in some way.

The free audio tour guide raises your experience with information, original recordings & interesting stories.

The Museum shop at the end of the tour is also very well stocked with everything from tie-pins, to DVDs and posters. Of course, you can also buy a Mercedes car if you so wish!

Managed to arrive just before 09:00hrs opening time and parked in the well signposted Parkhaus around the back of the museum.
No queues, just paid for my ticket in the entrance area and took the lift top the top of the building (8th floor).
From there you just follow the slightly downward sloping path descending down to the next lower floor, with each floor full of fascination exhibits.
8th floor has the very earliest/oldest models, with more modern vehicles appearing on the lower floors.
Take a camera or good mobile phone as the exhibits are perfectly lit for some excellent photo opportunities.
I had a business appointment, so could only spend 90mins in the museum, but long enough to get a taste.

Unlike Porsche that focuses on their racing tradition, this museum focuses on commercial vehicles that Mercedes developed.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"A very interesting history of the Mercedes Benz from invention, to merger, to survival during war, to re-imagination and future inspiration. I am not a petrol head, but I was nonetheless interested by all the information presented in this museum and was quite happy to spend five hours here. Cost to enter the museum is 11 euros for an adult, which I found to be well worth the money for the knowledge that is imparted through the museum. Petrol heads will adore this museum as all the classic cars are still driveable - hence the wide spiral walkways throughout the building. We had lunch inside the Mercedes Benz Museum - although a little expensive given the portion size, we found the food tasty, well presented and well cooked. My one problem with the restaurant was that they would only provide one free glass of tap water before they started to charge....I found this quite stingy and petty, especially given the cost of entry to the museum. Lockers are provided free of charge in the museum so that guests can wander for as long as they like without the burden of carrying children's coats / bags / etc. Toilets in the museum are a plenty - at least one on each floor and immaculately cleaned. Would definitely recommend spending at least 3 - 4 hours in this museum...but bring your own water bottle to fill up on each floor (free water fountains).

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,4.0,"This Mercedes Benz Museum stands out in Stuttgart and it a must, to visit. The Mesuem 9 floor building stands tall above everything around it. It's slick spacious design, glass lift that shoots to the top, everything is gleaming and spotless. The cars are immaculate and the history lesson that you experience is very impressive. The selection of cars and the condition they are in is mind-blowing. There is a child's creative arts room supervised by 2 very patient kind ladies, which really distracts the kids. It's staff are very helpful and informative.

The information hand-sets that are given out, I found - didn't pick up the signal easily- and it took alot of pointing and waving before it would register your request.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"I was on a business trip to Stuttgart, Germany last year in December and planned to visit the Mercedes Benz museum on one of the weekends. It's easy to reach the museum either by bus, train or taxi from Stuttgart. Train is though the most economical and preferred way. I caught the train from Stuttgart central station towards Stuttgart Neckarpark. From Neckarpark station it is a brisk 10 minutes walk to the Benz museum. Signboards were pretty clear and we did not face any issues reaching the museum.The entry fees was 10 EUR per person which included an audio guide and access to all the museum floor. I would recommend to start from the top and keep coming down. I was really fascinated by the prolific legacy and rich heritage of Mercedes. The audio guide was really helpful in understanding the various vehicle models and their background. Automobile freaks will really have a great time at the museum. The vintage collections and presentation style really amazed me. The museum has a simulation system, where someone can enjoy the thrills of a F1 race as a driver (Charges extra).At the end of the tour there is a souvenir shop in the ground floor to collect tokens for memories. There is also a snacks bar for quick bites.
I would definitely recommend this place to everyone who visit Stuttgart and have a day to spare. Good for both adults and kids.

Starting off with the first vehicle, the first flying machine or fuel-driven boat, the Daimler / Benz saga is fascinating. Seeing all the different vehicles to reasonably recent cars, it is impressive to see how vehicles have been developed in a short time span.

On the down side, the museum should improve of its markings, we battled to find the hidden entrance as there was no proper or highly visible signboards guiding you. We also found that the layout may have concealed some extras built into the museum which we may not have discovered, simply because the signboards were not clear or absent altogether. So look behind every corner to see whether you may be missing something. But otherwise, not as huge as Autostadt, but still very impressive and worth a visit.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"This was our first visit to the Mercedes Museum. The cost was ‚Ç¨10/person, which included free lockable lockers (to store your coats) and a multi-language headset. The museum had 8floors of various era cars, to include an outstanding explanation (in both German and English) for each display. I found the stories about Benz, Daimler and Maybach extremely interesting. The only part that cast a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù on the story was how the Nazis employed Benz-Daimler to build aircraft engines, during WWII, and the factory using ‚Äúslave labor‚Äù to make them (probably not one of Benz-Daimler‚Äôs proudest moments, but an important story to tell). Anyway, the explanation of how Benz, Daimler and Maybach designed the first cars, engines and other transportation methods (dirigibles, railroad engines, boats) was pretty cool. Incredible to see how transportation technologies changed in such a short time period.

We highly recommend you give the museum a try.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Mercedes have an enviable history as a prestige manufacturer of premium automobiles.
It‚Äôs great to see that they have ploughed a decent amount of their profits into this wonderful visitor attraction.

Easily accessed by public transport, the modern museum rises from a sea of grey factory units. Upon entry you are provided with a personal audio tour that will guide you around the exhibits in the museum.

Even for those not hugely interested in the history of the brand, or even cars, there is a lot to be gained from the tour. Information on the ramps between floors puts the history of the brand into a historical context, including refreshingly up-front information about the part that they played engineering and manufacturing weapons of war. Carefully presented and very thought provoking.

For those with a love for the car, however, this place is close to heaven, especially the lower floors that displayed Mercedes‚Äô racing history. Unfortunately we only got to this point as the museum was about to close - we had to rush through what was the highlight of the tour (our own fault for taking too long at the top of the building!).

How they introduced 9.5 working hours. How prisoners are used to work on automotive industry.
The cars and other vehicles are manufactured by Daimler are shown in year wise.

I liked particularly the historic explanations not just all around motorcars, but also about the facts: politics, science, social life. Very well done.
I did not appreciate that is was not allowed to take a water bottle with me. There is a coffee place, but in the ground floor, so when you are still at the very beginning of the exhibition and you have a need for a sip of water you have to go down and pay money for it. I can understand no food or soft drinks, but water???

Along the way it ties in other world events that happened around the same time as Mercedes advancements. There‚Äôs so many fancy cars and vehicles that they make through the tour. Plus you get to listen in the language of your choice and hear more about the exhibits. At the end you get to keep the lanyard the device was hanging on

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"I went there with my girlfriend who is pretty far from definition of car enthusiast and she liked it so I can recommend to everyone.
As you enter the museum you take the elevator to the top, to the cca year 1850, and as you walk down spirally towards today, you learn about Mercedes Benz history as well as world history, as most historical events of the period are briefly explained along the way.
There are also a few airplanes and airplane engines, but also other road (and even water) transports.
My only complaint is that the museum shop is really expensive, even compared to the Porsche museum shop. And when I already mentioned Porsche museum, it is good to know that you get 25% discount at one when you have visited the other.
All in all I give it a 5-star rating - you can easily spend three hours there.

For the car enthusiast, this like a candy shop. I am not a car enthusiast, but, I did find the historical references about what was going on in the world at different times through the car development was very interesting. There were many hands on things for the girls to try along the way, to keep them entertained, which is always nice.

Fascinating to see early cars and see how Herr Daimler and Herr Benz worked at the same time in the same area, even went to the same conference. There firms eventually merged, but they did not know each other.
The History worked alongside the many magnificent vehicles, but eventually by the 5th floor I decided to do what the cars did and speed up.

Worth a visit just for the auditorium! A building worthy of a James bond film set. Polished concrete and space age elevators. The museum itself was so informative but allow yourself a good 3hours when it is busy. Cafe was acceptable. Had decaf coffee which was a bonus for me. Building also includes a dealership so you can look at the latest models. Don't buy one from here though there were children climbing all over them . There is reasonably a reasably priced shop in the basement and a restaurant but this had a very limited offering so we opted for the cafe on the ground floor.
Only niggle. . . There is no way out once you are in for a coffee for example so eat before you start. (Plenty of toilets though and water fountains)

From the museum website:
The Mercedes-Benz Museum is the only museum in the world that can document in a single continuous timeline over 130 years of auto industry history from its very beginnings to the present day. On nine levels and covering a floor space of 16,500 square metres, the museum presents 160 vehicles and over 1,500 exhibits.

That‚Äôs a pretty accurate description. On arrival, we took a futuristic elevator to the top floor.

The self-guided tour starts with the oldest first.

We then worked our way down a wide sloping spiral, surrounded by historical events and cars. I‚Äôll post a series of pictures at the end of this review.

My favourite car ‚Äì the 300SL with gull-wing doors. My favourite movie vehicle from Jurassic Park ‚Äì Lost World. My least favourite exhibit ‚Äì a Mercedes hand painted by some famous rapper presented as a ‚Äòwork of art‚Äô. If I were Mercedes, I would have banned the guy from purchasing a Mercedes for life for ruining a good car.

The ground floor has a showroom of all the latest Mercedes models.

We visited the ground floor restaurant. It was pretty sad compared to the excellent restaurant at the Porsche Museum. It wasn‚Äôt clear how to obtain food and we first queued at the nearby snack bar, only to be told there was waiter service.

The menu was unexciting and expensive. So if there was one thing I would change about the Mercedes Museum, it would be the restaurant.

We really enjoyed our visit and I‚Äôd recommend the Mercedes Benz Museum. If you‚Äôre planning to visit the Porsche Museum on the same day, then plan to eat there.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Take a journey through more than 130 years of fascinating automotive history ‚Äì and on into the future. Make sure you do not miss it, one can spend all day there!

The building's height and ""double helix"" interior were designed to maximise space, providing 16,500 square metres (178,000 sq ft) of exhibition space on a footprint of just 4,800 square metres (52,000 sq ft). The double helix also corresponds to the exhibition concept, which divides the museum into the ""myth rooms"" and the ""collections"", offering two alternative tours that can be merged at any given point of the museum.

The museum contains more than 160 vehicles, some dating back to the very earliest days of the motor engine.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"A visit to the Mercedes-Benz Factory and Museum could be summed up in various ways.

One could summarise the visit as: ""I came, I saw, I absorbed, I ticked the box. Or I was challenged, inspired, and moved by what others have done to put me and millions of others behind the wheel of innovative engineering to take me and others where I and we want to go.""

Or the summary could be something along the lines of: ""There are some in the world who say they are uninspired and unmoved in life, to them I say - come to the Mercedes - Benz Museum and sense the inspiration and motivation. There are some who say technology is not the answer to humanities needs, and to them I say - come to the Mercedes - Benz Museum and leave your trepidation outside. There are even some who feel lost in the world of maths, engineering, problem solving and design, and to them I say - take heart and rejoice for motoring may not solve all of mankind woes but it is better than the alternatives and it is a beginning, so come to the Mercedes - Benz Museum.

If one takes the time to wander, the Mercedes - Benz Museum to observe, absorb, contemplate, to consider the history, the successes, triumphs and failures of motoring industry's relative short span of existence on the scale of mankind's existence, then one realises how far we have come in mobility terms and how profoundly it has changed the way we see and live life.

Wandering through the Mercedes-Benz Museum is like wandering through one's past and present while seeing flashes of one's future.

The posters, the stories, the racing outfits, the automobiles remind us of another time, maybe simpler, maybe more entrepreneurial, maybe more driven to test the limits and test them again and again or maybe just to remind us that it takes a special breed to risk everything to succeed and change the world as they know it.

What ever your reason or rational for visiting the Mercedes-Benz Factory and Motor Museum in Stuttgart, take your time, relax, and take it all in and before you leave, pick at least a favourite exhibit or two or three and have your photo taken next to them and take them home and reflect on them from time to time.

Alternatively after your visit to the Mercedes-Benz Motoring Museum just consider how better informed and prepared you would be if sometime in the future you had the opportunity or were given the challenge of establishing a motoring or any other type of museum armed with what you had seen and experienced in the Mercedes-Benz Museum.

If you are fortunate you may see new car buyers collect their brand new Mercedes-Benz's and drive out after some orientation, and if foreigners, take their new chargers down the autobahns for a few weeks before having their vehicles re-detailed and shipped home overseas.

Make the time and effort to commit yourself to an insightful and enjoyable Mercedes-Benz Factory and Museum visit, not because someone said you should, not because its just another item on your ""bucket list"", but because the Factory and Museum is waiting to inspire you in the widest range shapes, colours, forms, technologies or concepts imaginable.

Embrace the opportunities.

If you wonder how a car museum should be, displaying all cars from its first model to the latest car. You are wrong, in fact, I am surprised too when my first visit.
You will start taking a long escalator ato the top of the Museum after the entrance.
And from the top, you will walk like a spiral and visit the oldest Mercedes Benz transportation floor by floor, along the walkway, you will able to read the pictorial of what the world is happens since 92 years ago.
This is a great Museum design with best car technology and it quality.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,3.0,"This is an ok museum but I think they have their priorities skewed. The building itself is hugely impressive and near the stadium. The entrance atrium, lockers were set up well. In terms of the museum though it was a little to dry. Highlights were definitely the first engine and car, and the ground floor sports car and formula one outfits were a massive selling point but the 5 floors in between were underwhelming. When you enter at the top floor and you are greeted by a horse I get it cars were seen as an interim for the horse, but it is random and not impressive. If they had the space live horses may work but it doesn‚Äôt really impress. The models of scenes of Stuttgart seem displaced and only the items about the first engine and first cars are wow. After this on your way down 6 levels you get a mix of picture boards saying random facts completely unrelated and related landmarks on Mercedez and it‚Äôs pretty much just a range of places you could find an engine. There are a few nice classic cars and a few sports cars but nothing breath taking. Also the simulator in my opinion should have taken you round a course rather than up and down different angles of the outside of cars, again I get it but doesn‚Äôt hit the spot. Mercedez clearly has a lot of exciting things to show off but a bit more focus on those rather than history I could look up on my phone or cars that down leave your mouth open would improve things. Would refer to Porsche museum, short, sweet to the point and amazing.

Entry includes an audio guide and you get to keep the lanyard to take home. A lift takes you to the top floor then move down through the museum chronologically. I found the lay out slightly confusing to start with, on each level there is a main display with a separate area to the right hand side. The exit to the next level down was to the left and it would be very easy for someone to go straight from the main area to the next level and miss some of the cars on display. I also thought the gift shop was the best museum gift shop I've been in. You would expect to be able to buy models of some of the more famous Mercedes cars in the shop but in this gift shop you can actually buy the car!

The museum is located nearby the trainings facilities VFL Struttgart soccwer club. The stadium is just around the corner.

The museum is a big building you enter and will be impressed. Buy a ticket and keep it. You get 25% off at the Porsche museum (and vice versa). Get your free audio guide and use the elevator up. The museum guides you upside down. So you experience history to today from the top to the ground floor.

Its an amazing museum with massive information about automotive history from the real start to today. Expect minimum 4 hours for the tour! The whole thing takes time.

At the end you are filled with information. The audio tour is a big assistance for you. The audio guide also offers also extra text for kids.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Inexpensive entry fee. Regardless - Worth it to go here. Parking available.

Don‚Äôt know about a ‚Äòdirected‚Äô tour. Only had a ‚Äòself-at-your-own-pace‚Äô audio tour available (in different languages). This was great.
You elevator up to the rope floor. Then walk thru that floors exhibits to the ramp down to the next floor.
-Enjoyed the lineage of the Benz, Daimler, and Mayback families and they intertwined.
-Was fascinated with the disclosure on the company‚Äôs involvement with the Third Reich and its wartime practices.
-Enjoyed the comparison of the world events to what MB was offering.

Certainly the old vehicles relics was super to see. The newer models we all know but the old cars, trollies (!), buses & trucks we don‚Äôt and letting them register into your mind versus what Henry Ford was doing should be with the price of your admission.

Pick and choose if you can return. If not, then divide your time by floor and watch the time. It goes quickly; not boring!

Spent about 3 hours there. Could have been more but I didn‚Äôt want to read every card or see every video.

Very organized both people and exhibits. (what did I expect?)

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"Visited the Mercedes museum whilst on long weekend in Stuttgart. It is a remarkable museum tracing the history from the very early invention and development of the internal combustion engine. The collection includes many examples of original vehicles, of all sorts, from throughout the history of Mercedes. The layout and flow through the museum is excellent, and everything easily accessible. The exhibits are set in themed stages through the years, with relevance to world events of the appropriate period in wall charts and well written descriptions.
The exhibits cover more than just cars, but the large display of racing cars etc. is magnificent.
We spent several hours here and really enjoyed it.
Travel tip - We used the hop-on / hop-off tour bus to reach the museum - it stops right outside. Admission prices are not expensive, aeduced ticket prices apply for seniors, and at the current time there is also a 25% discount on subsequent visit to the Porsche museum (or vice versa)

There is plenty of parking nearby I visited on a Sunday and at 9.30 it was very quiet. When I left at about 2pm the queue was pretty long but it is a big place. There is a nice coffee shop which is reasonably priced and mid range restaurant that looked nice but I didn't eat there.

This was on a Sunday morning, there was some special event going on so we got in for free. This building has no corners or straight lines and was difficult to complete, but it is a beauty. The amount of cars, engines and other vehicles of air, land and water on display here is mind boggling. The museum is eight floors tall. You take an elevator up to the top floor, then wind down around the perimeter on sloping floors to the bottom. Then take the elevator back up to the top and wind around the other direction and see completely different things. So amazing! Once you get back to the bottom there is a huge gift store to buy anything Mercedes related that one could imagine, even shop for a new Mercedes Benz here. Stuttgart is the world headquarters for Mercedes Benz Company, in fact the offices and manufacturing are next to the museum.

There are lots of visitors and so the queues are quite long. About 20-30 mins. The museum is a little more expensive than Porsche but they do give you a Mercedes lanyard as a souvenir. The exhibition is very good laid out from the top to the bottom. The audio guides reception can be a bit patchy but the description is good.
The history of the engines and development of the cars was fascinating. There is a restaurant in the basement area leading back into the car parks. The gift shop caters for all pockets (unlike Porsche which only has nice high end expensive gear)
I recommend seeing both as Ferdinand Porsche started his career at Daimler Benz so there is continuity in the story.

The museum is huge and housed in a beautiful building. The displays are well done and the self guided audio tour really adds to the experience. The ground floor also houses a complete selection of current Mercedes-Benz models and many restored cars of various vintages for sale.

The museum is absolutely huge and it took a good four hours or so to go through it completely. You could do it faster, but you would miss out on a lot of interesting details in the audio tour. It is laid out from the top floor down to the bottom, covering the earliest days of Mercedes to present day. It also has an impressive exhibit of Mercedes race cars and side rooms that are themed to various aspects of the automobile, from public service vehicles to everyday cars, vehicle with famous owners, and workhorse vehicles.

However, we had a few spare hours before heading to the airport so decided to check it out. The building itself is impressively designed and faces the Mercedes Benz Arena, home of Stuttgart FC. We arrived at 9.45am and the place was crawling with tour buses. It was quite hectic getting in. You are given an audio tour phone with the 10 Euro entry although mine was playing up all the way around so I did miss quite a lot of the running commentary. The museum showcases the history of the Mercedes Benz company and there are some stunning cars on display. I was however disappointed that the 'Popemobile' was absent from the display- not sure why and it's just a personal preference but I was hoping to see it up even closer than when it cruises around St Peter's Square.

Consequently, the members of the family who have only a passing interest in cars didn‚Äôt really enjoy the afternoon. The service in the cafe was a little unhelpful and indifferent. Beware also when paying to get in, we had a discount as we had been to the Porsche Museum, they acknowledged this but then tried to charge us the full price anyway. When we were leaving they asked us for feedback but then refused to do anything with it unless we spent 10/15 minutes filling in a survey, I think this summed the visit up, great for the enthusiast, indifference for the casual visitor.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,2.0,"My son and I are involved in the classic cars business in the UK and went to take a look at Classic Remise as we were in Dusseldorf. Lovely retail location but they let you wander around like its a museum.
A 308GTB caught our eye because it was an early, 'tall tyre' possibly vetroresina example and one of our customers was looking for one for his collection. As we were standing there an irate Gentleman comes out of a door marked 'Movendi' and starts shouting at the top of his voice in German. We look around (as does everyone) and it turns out he is shouting at my son on the other side of the car, who replied with ""I beg your pardon?!"" and shouty guy converts to English and shouts ""Yes you, don't touch the cars, don't open the cars!!!"" Now, my son is 27 years old, has several full restorations under his belt and has had his vehicles exhibited at a national level, he knows how to treat them and I was standing there with him, he didn't touch them let alone try to open the doors without asking. When he replied that he hadn't done anything Mr Shouty states ""YES YOU DID, I KNOW YOU!!!"". Quite bizarre as we'd never been there before. My son was concerned about the misunderstanding and went over to the office where Mr Shouty had retreated but he was now on the phone, maybe shouting at someone else. My son apologised to the other (polite) gentleman there that clearly they'd been a misunderstanding.

Shame, it's a nice venue but that's a strange way to run a business. If you don't like people getting near the cars probably best to lock them in a warehouse.

Despite hanging around for a bit Mr Shouty didn't come out so we couldn't set the record straight. Needless to say, we didn't buy the 308 either.

Mostly were European cars of course Ferraris Porsches etc. But there were some American iron two beautiful 1963 split window corvettes and some mustangs. There was a nice looking restaurant inside I didn‚Äôt visit and a couple of shops selling shirts and such. They do have a garage where they were restoring and working on vintage cars. Some of the cars were behind glass but most were not. They did have some old motorcycles on display. IF you like a lot were for sale so take your banks info and bring on home.

This place is amazing, and the men were like little boys in a sweetie shop. Apart from the fact the collection of beautiful vintage and luxury cars is huge, there is also an indoor restaurant, bar and shops.

Outside there is also seating, with food and bar. We enjoyed a couple of Alt beers in the sunshine. We could not believe that it is free entry here - I am sure that would not happen in the UK.

All in all a very worthwhile visit - try to make time to go if you can, you will not be disappointed. The bar staff even called a taxi for us when we were ready to go back into town. First class all round.

It‚Äôs free to get in and when we went there was only a hand full of people there, mostly taking their own exotics in for repair at the many garages inside.
From the moment you enter the car park you are in awe of the historic building that used to be a old train winding that could house up to 30 locomotives for storage and repair.
Walking into the building you pass the Ducati garage where the mechanics are working on bikes in all sorts of repair and will happily talk to you about what they are doing. Seeing some of the exotic machines in various states of repair gives you a good sense of what exactly goes into these.
Inside the there are cars everywhere. I made it very clear to my young family that this was a ‚Äúlook and don‚Äôt touch‚Äù place which they ably stuck too.
There‚Äôs so much to see here that you need at least 90 minutes to view everything, stop in the restaurant for lunch and then go back and look in a bit more detail at some of the classics. Although we didn‚Äôt eat, the food looked amazing and the cost seemed pretty reasonable.

It rained all the way there and it was raining and cold outside during my visit but the Remise is warm and inviting with nobody pushing you along. The people inside are all there for the same reason and everyone is polite and generally in awe of the vehicles inside. It was Sunday so most shops are closed. The cafe was open and the food and desserts looked very good but I didn't partake since they don't accept credit cards. I am constantly amazed at how many places don't want my business because they only take cash. Sad but hey they must be making plenty of cash to turn people away. It didn't spoil my visit but if you want to partake then bring euros.
Great place and should be on the bucket list for all car lovers.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,5.0,"To be honest, the reason why I went here was the rating on TripAdvisor. I did not regret it though. It is located somewhat remote but still easy to reach with public transportation. (Btw. my bus did have a minor crash with another bus so I had to go the rest of the way on foot but hey, hopefully this is the exception)
The Remise is really for free and you don't have to feel like you swindle yourself into something. It is there to show off great cars / bikes and makes it money by selling them. When I was there most people present where tourists.

As I said, I don't know that much about cars but I really liked some of those on display. Most are rather old, but some are current models of super cars. The cheapest I saw was a Corvette for 30.000‚Ç¨, the most expensive was a Maserati for 740.000‚Ç¨. I liked the Corvette more but you probably have to pay the price difference at the next gas station.

Dinos are a favourite of mine, although the Ferrari 308 has always had a lure!

Surrounding the exhibion hall, which is one of the best I've seen (a beautiful crescent with excellent natural ligh), there is a series of stored vehicles again of all types and values. We spent a couple of hours wandering around the splendour and then moved on to what we were really there for - which was to find someone to help restore the interior of our XJS coup√©. We were pleased to find just the right guy in Grigor Darmas who was happy to give us a quote from photos for a new headlining and seat repairs. I will be happy to update this review when the repairs are done (providing the quotation is accepted of course).

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,5.0,"As per my title I can't believe anybody could give this place less than an excellent review. I guess if you don't really care about cars, but then why would you go to this place? It's literally a giant display of a bunch of awesome cars. It's not a museum but a high end car storage and dealership but they welcome the public. They don't bother you, the place Is extremely clean and then there is all the cars. This place wouldn't work in the US, people would be touching the cars, little kids jumping on them. But in Germany it works on the main floor, Porsche , Ferrari, etc., you can look into them, take pictures whatever you want. Just don't touch. So, if you like cars, go to this place. If you don't like cars don't go and then definitely don't then write an average review for what is a wonderful place for car fanatics.

The building itself is an old train turn around, it still has the round about on the floor that originally helped turn the train engines around. Many cars are parked inside the large open area, they are all for sale and totally drool worthy! All along the perimeter there are stacks and stacks of classic and antique cars, motorcycles and even vespas all in glass cases so you can see the full car, on two floors. Depending on how in depth you want to discuss each and every automobile you can cruise through in an hour or be here for like EVER!
Towards the back of the building they have restoration shops and there are several 'guy' stores where you can pick up some automobile themed clothing.
If you have the money all the automobiles are for sale..just tell them Ragan and Steven sent you...they won't care.. but you can tell them anyways :)

That's OK with me but it's quite boring after 10 minutes.
Please bear in mind that I don't hate cars. I own an Audi RS3. But please bear in mind that heaping second hand exotic cars is far from being an attraction.",Jun 2016
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,5.0,"Today I visited the place and it was awesome. There was ‚Ç¨5 entrance ticket but this was probably of the todays event - ""Oldtimers"". Inside the visitor could see different cars - classics, exotics whatever you can think. There are also bikes in there. You can buy souvenirs there as badges or stickers. There are parts and accessories for cars and bikes. There are even bicycles. In my opinion it was pretty awesome experience for me as a car lover. And today's event - ""Oldtimers"", was awesome also. There war Oldmobiles, classic Dodge models, classic Mercedes models.... Just visit it and you won't regret.

When the visitor gets tired he can go outside the building for a coffee, sausages or a beer. It's nice and the people are kind and polite. I was able to get along with then in English without any problems.

There is also a restaurant inside the building with the view of the cars but I didn't try it. Above the restaurant is a second floor where the visitor could go and watch the cars from high.

We were not disappointed- even I, who views cars as a means of getting me from A to B, fell in love with some of the beautiful classics on display here. The added sweetener of seeing a lot of vehicles were available to purchase if you have the necessary funds available was the icing on the cake! Should the winds of change bring a vast increase in our funds then a return visit is definitely on the cards!! The only downside was we visited on a German Public Holiday so all of the shops and workshops were closed. A must for anyone with a couple of hours to spare!!!

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,4.0,"Maybe on the museums side, Duesselforf still lacks behind other cities of its match however this place is a ""Delighter""

Even if you are not really a big fan of vintage cars, this place is worth a visit. Many cars with specification cards over the windshield is enough to tell you things such as model, make, horsepower etc and it is very interesting and informative aswell.

Many Ferrari's and Porsche's which are really good to have a look at :)

Only thing that was a turn off was unannounced closure as we visited the place on 31st of December. However it is always good to give a call before visiting.

To sit in the small restaurant in middle of the car hall and look at the cars is something you need to experience ( I had a burger with fries and bitburger beer - it was ok but a bit expensive ). Also no salespersons were bothering you so you could enjoy the day much more.

The collection shown at the Classic Remise changes every so often, since cars are sold off or brought in for sale. There's usually a one-page that explains the car's features and maybe it's history, but not all cars come with one.

getting there is a ten minute walk through a residential area to the nearest U bahn stop or you can get the bus, though there is a more meandering trip but the stop is right outside the collection.

None of the American cars could be considered to be the truly collectible models--automatic small-blocks and notchback Mustangs.

We liked it too, but we were a little tired from walking to reach there without a car. The entrance is free and you can stay as long as you like and admire the beauties. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to relax and drink something cold. Just a mobile fast food with overpriced french fries and some wooden benches under the hot sun. But all in all it was a good experience.",May 2014
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,4.0,"on our last day in Dusseldorf we went to see some classic cars before heading home. It was very quiet but that probably had to do with the day before christmas. The term 'Classic' seemed a but deceiving since there are fairly 'modern' cars in the showroom. Even saw a VW XL1 concept car.

of course the main reason going here would be cars, but all people not entirely into cars will have a great time here as well. there are some shops, a great bar with a good view and even a motorcycle part.

When you pop around the corner outside you will see the original remise with trains.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,4.0,"My friend and I were attracted to the whisky fair that was being organised in Dusseldorf in May. Imagine my delight when I discovered that this was being held in the Classic Remise! We started by passing a very successful couple of hours staggering around the various whisky stands at the fair and trying out the odd dram. I wasn't driving that day so I had the main duty of checking out the plethora of malts on offer...

When we'd circled the exhibition hall after a third time we reluctantly decided to leave to explore the rest of the building and check out the vintage cars. There were some real beauties on display (and to buy!). We probably spent more time checking out the old timers and dreaming of owning one or two (must have been the influence of the malts...) than at the whisky exhibition itself. So, a very successful double whammy and a classical way for two guys to spend their Saturday.

I never thought cars would be that fascinating for (I went with my sister) but we both really enjoyed it, we spent about 1 to 2 hours looking round and the cars were great to see. I can imagine if you are a car enthusiast you'd be in your element! From more modern cars from the 2000s to vintage, there was a range of cars to see. There were also motorbikes. Some of the museum show rooms were closed when we went, but we got to see a great lot. You don't get bugged or bombarded either so are free to look around without feeling like you're being hawked!

The was a great place to see and it was free too. It is a bit of a journey out of the city but we got the bus from the city (you can catch the 780, 782 or 785) got off at the nearest stop and wlaked for around 5-10 minutes. It was through residential areas so I was cautious, but we got no hassle at all.

Would definitely recommend this if you visit Dusselfdorf!

After a stroll through the parking we entered the semi-circular building and spent a few hours looking and admiring the cars. Better than a museum as you really stroll between the cars but of course you need internet access on your phone if you want to read about the history of the models on display.

Entrance is free and if you love cars you need to plan a couple of hours to see them all.
The location is easy to reach by car, parking is available and free.

After we told them we had reservation and he asked for papers, I showed my ticket and my vaccine card, and my girlfriend her negative test, but he told us she cannot go because her test is now over 24 hours. While I understand the severity of Covid-19, a negative test result is only valid at the time of the test taken, since you could have came in contact with someone after your test. She was only 2 hours past the 24 hour mark, and at this time of day, we'll not able to get another test done, and the ticket I paid for going to waste. The security guy just said these are the rules. Probably won't come back here and try to check out the platform in future. In addition, there is an added 0.50 Euro fee when ordering online, which seems odd when you are trying to reduce in person contact due to hygiene reasons, so why charge me extra money when I'm trying to reduce carbon/paper waste on top of being contactless?

It was the hotel that we stayed in where we found out about the main tower. We woke and ate an early breakfast and arrived right on time for opening at 10am so hardly queued and got searched and went up in the lift. We times it well because when we cane down in the lift there was a huge queue.
I‚Äôd say if you went during busy times the queue for the lift to go up and down would be lengthy to wait.
The views over Frankfurt were spectacular. Well worth a trip.

Germany,Main Tower,5.0,"Opened in 2000, Main Tower is currently the fourth tallest skyscraper in Germany. What makes it special compared to other highrise buildings in the city, is that it has an observation deck at the top that is open to the public and offers great 360 degree views over the entire city.

As Frankfurt‚Äôs highest observation deck its views are unrivaled. However, the view towards the east (city center) will likely become quite a bit obstructed in the upcoming years with new skyscrapers being constructed close to the Main Tower.

For 7.50‚Ç¨ the entrance fee is a bargain compared with most other well-known observation decks around the world that often charge visitors between 20 and 40‚Ç¨.

What I also really like about this observation deck is the welcoming attitude towards photographers. Whereas tripods are banned at most observation decks, there is absolutely no problem whatsoever to take photos with a tripod here.

My favorite time to take the elevator up is about an hour before sunset. This way you can witness the sunset, the blue hour and the lights being switched on all over the city.

One of first in a 10:00 am - not too many people in queue - so one tip may be to get there early to avoid crowds (and there is a security frisk to get through) Reasonably priced for the experience offered. Lift up (and down) is fast and silent - no real sense of speed- so remember look at the speedometer! Views from top-level viewing platform are spectacular. I was lucky it was a clear sunny day.

Germany,Main Tower,5.0,"We think Main Tower is a place must see while touring the City of Frankfurt. We visited the Main Tower on June 30 (Sunday) this summer and it was an unforgettable experience to view the city of Frankfurt from the top (approximately 200 meters or 656 feet ) of Main Tower. The day we visited was not crowded at all. Because the Frankfurt city was busy celebrating the Mainova IRONMAN European Championship. It was an excessive hot summer day with more than 38 degree centigrade temperature. But at the top level of Main Tower was very breezy. It was relaxing, took beautiful photographs and enjoyed every moment. We spent almost an hour on top level of the Main Tower, where we met with several tourists from Brazil and East European countries. The elevator carried us up to approximately 190 meters (or 623 feet) and the remaining ~10 meters (or 33 feet) we had to take the stairs. There was one long bench for seating at the top level. The rest room in the Main Tower was very clean and there was a restaurant on the 53rd floor. But it was closed because it was Sunday. We took ‚ÄúFrankfurt city Hop On-Hop Off‚Äù i.e. ‚ÄúGreenline of Frankfurt‚Äù bus tour, paid approximately 15 Euro per ticket with some discount. The ‚ÄúGreenline of Frankfurt‚Äùdropped us at the Main Tower. The Main Tower had a reasonable entrance fee, paid approximately 7.5 Euro per ticket (adult).

Germany,Main Tower,5.0,"A very short walk from our hotel and from the main town centre and the 'Old Town' we took the elevator to the 54th floor Viewing balcony.

The 360 degree views are second to none, you can stay 'indoors' and take in the views, from behind large windows or you can walk up a few stairs to the open viewing platform where it is very safe (the furthest you could fall is about 6 feet to the balcony below) but you would find it tough to fall from the safety barriers, there are telescopes you can pay to use and map descriptions of what you are looking at, we were lucky enough to have a totally clear day (even in December) so could see for miles.

Well worth the approx. 12.50 euros we paid to go up there.

Germany,Main Tower,4.0,"Visited the main tower recently with my partner , it takes about 40 mins from the time you first que to buying your ticket and then finally getting through security , then you are taken up a lift to the 54th floor where you climb the remaining floors on your own to the top, the elevator was quite quick , however it can feel a bit claustrophobic because everyone is jammed into it, the views are amazing at the top and you can literally see all of Frankfurt, well worth the visit and a great opportunity to get some snaps of the city, we visited on the Saturday so it was very unusual to see the restaurant closed and no souvenir shop , the restaurant was advertised on arrival but nothing to say it was closed so it took away 10 mins of our trip to get the elevator there and then to realise it was closed , overall we were impressed with the tower but some small details can take from an amazing attraction!

Germany,Main Tower,4.0,"An architectural masterpiece in the heart of Frankfurt's skyline, the Main Tower is one of the highest buildings in the city built in 3 years between 1996 and 1999. After a security check, we climbed to the top of this 56 stories 240-meter high (including the antenna) building taking a high-speed elevator moving at 4 to 7 meters/second (for the first 190 meters and walk the last 10) for an incomparable 360¬∫ view of the city. The Main Tower consists of two high-rise buildings that are interlinked with one another. One is square, 170 meters high and the other is a round building 200 meters high with non-reflective glass. Our visit was on a sunny day so we got an amazing view of Frankfurt. The. best time to visit and shoot from this location is sunset when the view is phenomenal giving you a unique experience. This high-rise building is particularly popular with the people of Frankfurt as well as the tourists. It is the only one in the city that has a publicly accessible viewing platform with a restaurant. To help the visitors in identifying the prominent buildings and other attractions around the city, there are 4 ‚Äòinformation boards‚Äô placed at four sides of the top floor with their names. For about 45 minutes it is worth visiting this Tower for a stunning experience.

Germany,Main Tower,2.0,"I usually rely on Rick Steves and Trip Advisor for my travel advice. This time I feel they both got it wrong.

First, the entrance is not easy to find. Second, the entry price is much too high (thankfully, we had purchased Frankfurt city passes for the day, so we each saved 20% on the admission). Third, there was a lengthy wait tome (about an hour). I won't complain about the security check, since it's sadly pretty standard these days, but you can't use the lavatory unless you've passed through security first (did I mention the one hour wait time?).

Despite all these drawbacks, by far the worst was the old woman at the reception desk selling tickets. What a sourpuss! How in the world is this lady still employed? She is literally the first impression of the building when visitors enter, and she creates quite a negative one with her poor attitude.

Last, if I may be blunt, the city of Frankfurt view from the observation deck is just ""okay."" Unlike a view of New York City from the Empire State Building observation deck, there is simply nothing particularly emblematic nor nostalgically recognizable that would make it worth the trouble to deal with the rude employees, overpriced tickets, excruciating wait, etc.

I'd give it a miss.

In the height of the summer, and on a Saturday night, for a photography visit, the main tower is not the best place to be.

Sun sets around 9.55pm, and it never gets truly dark until well gone 11pm. Even then the light hue over the Hills means there is still plenty of light around.

Also, since Frankfurt city centre is effectively closed down on weekends, the lights in the buildings are off so he shoot doesn‚Äôt come across as well as originally thought.

Having said this, you can still get great shots of the river, it‚Äôs bridges, Frankfurt main station, the airport, the football stadium, and the Radio tower.

Oh, it does get very windy (and rather cold) so be prepared for this.

Well
Worth the money , was as safe as houses and would be well worth going at dust to see the city by day and nite ! All the tour buses seem to stop here but give them ten mins to clear and the waiting time is minimal ! Toilets at the top but no vending machines or over priced cafe , there is a restaurant, but it was way out of my budget

I asked for information, asked to pay separately and I did not have the choice. But this would have been fine if she had been nice. Not at all the case, she started to be very rude towards me and my family (with one kid in the group), she was ironic and symply gave an awful treatment to a client.

The main lift takes you up to the 54th floor at a speed of 19km/h, which I think for a lift was pretty impressive.

Once at the top, you have to take a second lift up one more floor, before walking the final part.

I was surprised when we got to the top that there was a covering of snow on the deck, as it hadn‚Äôt snowed for a few days. Once we got out into the open air, the snow started to gently fall.

Germany,Main Tower,5.0,"This was one of the most breathtaking places I visited in Frankfurt. I believe I paid like ‚Ç¨7.50 for the entrance fee. For this, you ride the elevator to the top, which seems to max out at a climb rate of 18km/h but it is not at all noticeable that you have started to climb. This is certainly one of the smoothest elevator rides I have had and merely takes a matter of seconds for one to reach the top floor at 190m high. From there you climb a few steps, I think like one or two storeys high to get to the observation deck which allows an all-round view over Frankfurt with some signage indicating some of the main buildings in sight. It was a gloomy day when I visited and can only imagine how nice it must be on a clear day. It was still really nice though.
As a starting point, it would be a great vantage point before one starts exploring the city.

On entering the building we went to the main desk and we were met by the grumpiest woman I've ever seen manning a tourist attraction. Not once did she smile or welcome us in any way.
Once we received our ticket we joined the security queue. We had a child in a buggy and when we got the front we were told that the buggy had to be left in the foyer. Now I'm not a tourist specialist or anything but a sign which instructed visitors of this would have made life a lot easier.
Once through we made our way to the top. The view was incredible and having been up The Shard I know it wouldn't be on this level but it was a bit shabby. The foyer in which the final set of stairs was was in need of a good paint job and the toilet was grim.

Germany,Main Tower,1.0,"We arrived and bought tickets for my family, including two small children. The receptionist did not say a word and practically threw the tickets at us. When we got to the top they had locked all the doors to the roof - there were about 100 people locked into a small space and the temperature was over 40C as it was a hot day and there was no air conditioning. Because of a possible storm they had closed the viewing platform. There was only a security guard there and he gave no information and just shrugged when people asked what was going on. We decided to go back down as the heat was unbearable and the kids were suffering. We requested a ticket for the next day - the receptionist was unbelievable. Extremely rude. She refused to allow us to come back or to have a refund and made comments like 'it's not my problem'. They pointed to the warning that the top could be closed but NOWHERE did it say there was no transfers of tickets. How can you sell tickets to something that is closed and no allow visitors to use their ticket another day - what difference does it make?? We had paid for three adults and two children and the roof was already closed when she sold us the tickets. Other people were coming in and she was still selling tickets even though it was closed and there was only a few hours until closing time. Other people came down to complain but she just did not care. Her behaviour as a customer service person was disgusting. The place is one by a bank so they obviously have no idea about running a tourist attraction. It was difficult to find an email to contact them to complain - eventually I got an email a week pater saying we could go back but we had left the country already. The worst travel experience I have ever had in years of travelling. The kids were upset and we wasted our money.

Unfortunately there is no bar to get a drink - which is understandable as people would stay there too long :)

But the service downstairs, when purchasing the ticket and passing the security check... one of the worst ever. It does not really ruin the experience on the top, but rarely you see such a unfriendly staff in major attraction like this.

Lift to 54th floor then a few flights of stairs to open air observation deck. You can buy tickets in advance which saves a bit if time but I gave never known long queues.

Germany,Main Tower,5.0,"This is well worth doing. My mum wasn't keen as she's not the best with heights but it was well worth it. It is very much a 'do it yourself' experience as there is nobody to assist in the lifts which I found a little odd. But, you can't really go wrong!",Nov 2016
Germany,Main Tower,5.0,"The title really says it all. There are great views of the area available from the Main Tower IF the weather is good. If not, save your money and wait for a better day. It will be worth the wait.

While Frankfurt doesn't have the world's most exciting skyline, there is enough to see to make it worth the price of admission. Looking toward the east and the Aldstadt, you can get a great view of the old (the Cathedral of St. Bartholomew) with a backdrop of the new (contemporary skyscrapers, with wind turbines and a nuclear power plant in the distance).

The observation deck is open air with low railings that made my wife too nervous to venture toward the edge. However, the next floor down has its own balcony, so one only looks down a single floor, not the 50+ floors you'd think.

While Nuremburg, before WWII one of the most beautiful cities in Germany and Europe was leveled by allied bombing during WWII, they did a very good job of restoring many of the buildings and churches to close to their original look and structure.

There are many beautiful churches here like St. Lorenz and the Frauenkirche (main square) as well as the renovated Nuremburg Castle on the hill. If you have time, there is an old medieval clock tower on the front face of Frauenkirche in the main square that does a short 5-10 minute performance daily.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"The Alstadt (Old Town) of Nuremberg is situated between the Nuremburg Hbf station in the south and the Nuremburg Castle in the north. The Pegnitz River cuts across the city centre dividing Alstadt into two districts, St. Sebaldus north of the river and St. Lorenz to the south. The Old Town dates back nearly a thousand years and is a medieval gem of a destination.

We recently spent 4 days in Nuremburg and enjoyed sightseeing and dining throughout Alstadt. Historic churches that we most liked where St. Lorenz, St. Sebaldus and Frauenkirche. Of the museums around the city centre, we most liked Stadtmuseum im Fembo-Haus (City Museum). Kaiserburg N√ºrnberg (Nuremburg Castle) was another attraction that we really liked.

Along with the Nuremburg Castle, the city wall of Nuremburg is an excellent medieval attraction. Numerous well preserved towers, city cates and walls can be viewed. Similarly, there are numerous medieval bridges which cross the Pegnitz River that we liked. Most enjoyed were Museumsbr√ºcke, Karlsbr√ºcke and Henkersteg.

Another aspect of Nuremburg that we enjoyed was seeing the numerous statues and monuments scattered around the city centre. These range from tradition equestrian and seated statues of historic figures from Nuremburg including the likes of Albrecht-D√ºrer, Peter Henlein (inventor of the clock watch) and Kaiser Wilhelm I. We also enjoyed seeing some of the abstract and contemporary monuments around the city including the likes of Ehekarussell, Narrenschiffbrunnen, Dudelsackpfeiferbrunnen and Der Hase.

Lastly, we benefited from visiting Nuremburg during the annual Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas Market) which starts at Hauptmarkt and spreads through much of Altstadt in most directions. We enjoyed trying local specialities including Nuremburg sausages, lebkuchen and gluhwein - most enjoyed was Feuerzangenbowle from the booth with the giant cauldron. The city was excellently decorated during December as well, it was incredibly festive for the Christmas season.

In the end, we very much enjoyed our holiday in Nuremburg's medieval old town. There is plenty to keep you busy for a few days and longer for those who enjoy leisurely travel and more comprehensive experiences in destinations visited.

From my home we visited Rothenburg and Dinkelsb√ºhl as well.

I*ve never spotted as many nice places in Nuremberg as 'my' Canadians did, probably because I'm used to see the Altstatdt. They were completely fascinated
by the Burg, St. Lorenz, Sch√∂ner Brunnen, and many other attractions you can see in the old part of town. And of course the famous N√ºrnberger Rostbratwurst, the tiny barbecued specialty of Nuremberg.
As one dad was fighting in the Canadian Army in WWII, we also went to the Documentation Center, the building of the Nuremberg trial and the Zeppelinfeld.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Old Town or in German Altstadt, offers many activities, from shopping , city wandering, sightseeing, or maybe relaxing down the Pegnitz River or enjoying local and international cuisines in one of numerous cafes, pastry shops, bakeries, fast food stands, bars and restaurants. There are a plenty to see and feel. Some of them are above, but some secrets are well kept during centuries beneath the cobblestoned streets like WWII bunkers and beer cellars, especially in Sebald district of the Old Town Nuremberg.
The most famous tourist attractions are well maintained and offer great photo-shooting spots for your memorabilia.
The city, which is almost 1000 years old, has suffered heavy bombings during the WWII, in which more than 90% of the old town was destroyed. After the WWII the city has started to rebuild ruins, some of them more or less successful.
Nevetheless, the city has risen like a Phoenix from the ashes.
Some of the most important and well-known among them definitely are: Frauentor, Lorenzkirche, Huptmarkt with Frauenkirche and Sch√∂ner Brunnen, Altes Rathaus, Sebalduskirche and Kaiserburg.
Beside those mentioned, there are a lot more, like Fembo Haus (Nuremberg City Museum), Toy Museum, Spitlertorturm, German National Museum, Wei√üer Turm (White Tower), Jakobsplatz with two churches (St. Jakobs‚Äô Church and St. Elizabeth Church), Holy Spirit Hospital, Weinstadel, Unschlittplatz, St. Egidien Church, nearby Laufer Schlaglturm and many, many more.
What is interesting, during work days across all of Altstadt, there are stands, where locals sell various products of their own and by that keep the medieval tradition of vibrant city streets life.

Germany,Altstadt,4.0,"Situated on the banks of the Pegnitz River in the Bavarian region of Middle Franconia, Nuremberg owed its rapid growth due to its location on the key trade routes from one side. And from the another side, to its close relations with Emperors' court. Presence of Imperial court, even if temporary, attracted commerce and trade and stood behind development of crafts and art. In 1219 Nuremberg was granted ""Great Letter of Freedom"" by Emperor Frederick II, including town rights, privilege of minting coins and independent customs policy, among the others. With that, city soon become one of the most important trade centre on route from Italy to Northern Europe. Following centuries brought with them even larger expansion. The end of 13th century was witness to combining northern and southern parts of the city. Golden Bull of Charles IV from 1356 named Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet increasing further city's importance. And finally, Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg ordered that Imperial regalia shall be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 18th century. The flourishing of the free city of Nuremberg wasn't even hampered by numerous wars of high Middle Ages, and its cultural flowering in 15th and 16th centuries made it a centre of Renaissance in Holy Roman Empire. It was only the wars of 17th and 18th centuries that brought about temporarily slow down to the city's development.19th century, after Napoleon's fall, brought with itself revival of trade and commerce that made once again city prosperous. In 20th century, after WWI and along with rise of NSDAP, came dark card in city's history, but there's plenty of books written about it. And that's all about Nuremberg's history in great short. But what is left from its history? Remarkably, a lot. The great part of its city walls has survived, along with towers and gates. In the northern part of the Old Town can be found medieval churches of St. Sebald, and Our Lady. Not so far from Church of Our Lady, and on the other side of the Hauptmarkt square there's iconic Gothic fountain of Schoner Brunnen. To the north - east of Renaissance Town Hall can be found Baroque Church of St. Egidien and Pellerhaus. Further to the north west, there's Imperial Castle, and to the south of it, and next to the little charming square there's Albrecht Durer's house. Just to mention few interesting buildings of this area. A stroll along city walls, and then down the river, took us to Weinstadel (The Wine Store) located next to the Pegnitz River. Truly picturesque place. In the southern part of the Old Town there's also, a lot to see. Domed St. Elisabeth Church, so called White Tower (no longer white, though), and on the other end of Karolinenstrasse can be found impressive St. Lorenz Church. Outside of the southern part city walls sits Neo - Baroque edifice of Nuremberg's Central Station. And around 4 km to the south east from train station there's infamous Kongresshalle where NSDAP held its rallies, but we didn't go there.

The parks and lake area is beautiful. It is very easy to travel through the old town either on foot or using the easy to use cheap underground system. Travel from the airport couldn't be easier just hop on the U2 underground train and alight at Hauptbahnhof or Opernhaus whichever is closer to your hotel. It takes about 15 minutes. Single trip costs 3.2 euro (Zone A).

Germany,Altstadt,4.0,"We stayed here for a night in December just to see the famous Christmas market. We had a very nice walk along the river that lead us right into the Altstadt where the Christmas Markets are. The main market in the Hauptmarkt is very large and very crowded. We also noticed that the prices here in Nuremberg are much higher for everything than in any of the other Christmas Markets we visited. However, it was certainly festive and there are several markets as you walk around the Altstadt. the neatest one being the Children's Christmas Market. It was different and nice. There are several very good restaurants within the Altstadt but make sure to have reservations made as they tend to fill up very fast as darkness falls. The Altstadt itself is very clean and well maintained and there were several bands and choirs singing during the day and as evening fell. I would recommend that you park somewhere outside the Altstadt and walk in. Much easier. The one problem we did encounter was that it was very difficult to find a public restroom. There are signs but there are very deceptive and following them will lead you in circles.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Having had a brief taste of Nuremberg during a business trip I was keen to return with my wife to sample the Christmas markets. We visited in early December and stayed at the Le Meridian Grand Hotel, which is conveniently situated near the train station and just opposite one of the entrances to the old town. The town is steeped in history and gothic architecture, so visiting at any time of the year will provide an interesting short break, however visiting during the festive season to sample the Christmas markets adds another dimension. The Old Town is relatively compact and largely pedestrianised making it easy to explore the area. From our hotel it was a leisurely 10 minute walk past some impressive buildings, shops and eateries down towards the river and the Christmas markets (the main market in the square, a market specifically for children and an international market with stalls from around the world). Although very busy in the evenings, particularly at the weekend the general atmosphere was very friendly and relaxed. I recommend being in the square at midday at some point to witness the clockwork figures moving on the church tower as the bells ring out. The selection of goods in the market itself was amazing with a huge variety of unique hand made items - if you like Christmas save some space in your luggage for some incredible decorations and gifts! As you walk between the numerous stalls sampling of gluhwein and punsch, bratwurst and lebkuchen is highly recommended!
Apart from the Christmas festivities the Old Town has several museums that are of interest and a visit to the castle is worthwhile if you wish to learn more about the impressive history of Nuremberg. Although we did not partake ourselves, we noticed free walking tours in different languages were available and well attended.
There are numerous excellent dining options that get very busy at weekends and a reservation may be required to ensure a table at your preferred restaurant. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Nuremberg and are happy to recommend to others.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Nuremberg - centuries of history gathered here from medieval to recent times.
Architecture and art, old and new are blended now in the area of ""Altstadt"" - or ""Old Town"". Such a great place to walk and get lost in the architecture and the historical places.
Location - the Old city center - a combination of pedestrian streets and squares. So you can park the car nearby and enjoy a longer or shorter walk. Also is accessible by subway - you have the subway station right at the beginning of Koenigstrasse. Also the main railway station is nearby so you can come from outside Nuremberg by train is perfectly fine.
Sights - to list a few :
- St. Lorenz Church - look up my other review on the church for more details
- ""Der Schoene Brunnen"" - the fountain of wishes , - for details same as above.
- ""Hauptmarkt"" - the main square and still a functional market place.
- Women's tower right at the beginning of Koenigstrasse.
Architecture - Gothic is dominant but also the other currents are represented.
Altstadt - is well preserved and very nicely restored after the destruction suffered in WWII - due to the bombing.
Squares, statues, churches, fountains, bridges , towers, buildings - a lot of spots to be discovered.
Most of the landmarks can be visited without paying and entrance fee - but for those you have to pay they take cash and/or credit card so is no trouble at all.
Also you will find here restaurants - some several hundreds of years old - souvenir shops and not only - if you are looking for shopping you can find also some opportunities.
Overall is just perfect to stroll on the streets and admire the ""Beauty"" of the place.
Enjoy the Altstadt - is an excellent all day activity.

The Altstadt was amazing, it was lovely simply wandering around and taking in the views. There are several churches / cathedrals, the castle, a good variety of shopping and a very picturesque market square.

Well worth taking a walk along the river canal, the views and bridges are stunning.

There are pleanty of good resturants and cafes - you will be spoilt for choice.

Close by and within the walls is a newer part of town with more typical shops to peruse.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Visited as an overnight stay right in the centre of the old town. Everything very walkable right from the train station entrance into the old town with cafes, bars and the Karstadt with supermarket just a short stroll away.

Points of interest regarding Hitler's Nazi occupation are included but the appeal, beauty and earlier historic focus of the area is much more evident as you wander through the village squares, plazas and around the old town walls, tunnels, arches and tors. (gates)

We asked for the printed map of the town (available from our hotel) which highlighted many points to check within the old town for those keen enough to wander.

The charming streets and cobbled lanes up to the Kaisernburg Nuremburg (an old castle and grounds with beautiful 180 degree views over the city skyline) displayed the beauty of the old town and city in a previous era allowing the mind to wander as you look into the past.

I was particularly impressed by the magnificence of the baroque cathedrals and early Germanic styles of architecture, with some in various stages of restoration from medieval to post war era. A photographer's dream!

Day or night there is plenty to see with most areas well lit and cathedrals and churches of particular note.

NB As with most areas personal safety is always important so if wandering particularly at night be aware of your surroundings and stay to the lit areas as much as possible.

Also wear comfortable flat walking shoes as the cobblestones are sometimes uneven, the grade up to the castle is gently climbing on one side and fairly steep on the other. None of these streets are good for heels or stilettos!

Something here for everyone but history, Arts and culture buffs will particularly enjoy. A place of charm, beauty and definitely worthy of a visit for a few hours or much longer.

Not to mention the stunning setting in front of the Frauenkirche. Also the best gluhwein mug!

We also visited the Imperial Castle, and walked by Albrecht Durer's House. Wish we had more time here!

We had a great ice cream and visited 4 museums - make sure you buy the day ticket for ‚Ç¨7,50 that allows you to enter all the museums of the City Museum. The views from Castle are great!

We found the best way to explore it was to start at the Frauentorturm and end at the Imperial Castle, working your way down the Koenigstrasse. There are lots of sites to see on your way to the castle with some lovely bridges and that classic shot of with the river and The Hospital of the Holy Spirit in the background. The tourist information is right by the train station and Frauentorturm so pick up a map from here if you need one.

The tour costs ‚Ç¨10 per person and is a bargain. The four of us were the only ones to book, so had a private tour!

The city is incredibly beautiful and the history is interesting. Our guide spoke excellent English, was very knowledgeable and was charming. We would thoroughly recommend this 1-hour tour to anyone visiting the city.

There are centuries of history to discover about this charming and beautiful ancient city, which is so much more than the infamous location of the Nazi party rallies and subsequent trials.

I personally wasn't looking forward to seeing Nuremberg as I only associated the city with the Nazis and WW2, and had no interest in being reminded of that time. But then we got to tour the walled medieval town of Nuremberg. It was an outstanding day. We spent nearly 6 hours exploring the town and wasn't bored for a minute.

I recommend going on a guided tour starting at the castle, which is high above the town center and much easier to walk down from then up to. Without a guide we would have missed many important sites/sights and not learned of the history.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"The old city of Nuremberg is a typical southern German city with some historic churches, plazas, sidewalk cafes and shopping. The Pegnitz River separates the city into North and South. The river is very picturesque and there are a number of interesting bridges crossing the river including several covered bridges. The old town was mostly destroyed due to Allied bombing but similar to Munich, it has been restored to appear in its original state.

The old town is surrounded by an almost completely intact wall with towers and gates. The highlights are St. Lorenz Church and the Nuremberg Castle at the top of the hill on the Northwest corner of town.

There are wide avenues for walking through the center of town with modern shopping options. A variety of restaurants are also available. There are also plenty of good German restaurants.

I spent a late afternoon wandering around the town and taking pictures. The walk up to the castle is pretty easy and there are some good views of the city from the ramparts. The castle is currently being renovated.

It is much smaller than Munich and almost as lovely as Heidelberg, but much easier to get around.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Nuremberg's old town (Altstadt) is one of Bavaria's jewels in the Crown. Considering the city was destroyed by WW2 bombing raids, it's amazing how well it's been reconstructed using the original architectural designs and in many cases the original stones. One of the best parts of it is that it's nearly all pedestrian precinct - which is so user friendly as a tourist. It's a great place to wonder around all day. It's not all perfect, parts of the Altstadt are fairly nondescript modern buildings, and it's dirtier (particularly with cigarette ends - what is it with smokers in Europe?!) than other cities in Germany. The whole area though is full of shops, cafes, restaurants, and the big tourist sites of the quiet riverbank, the churches, the market squares and other cobbled squares, and towering above it all, the medieval burg (castle). It's at least as good as Prague's medieval centre, and while at Christmas time it was full of tourists, there are always quiet side streets to escape from the hordes.

Indeed, the expanded castle is still available to visit and its image is the icon of the city. Today it provides an historic look at Germanic architecture in a gracious, pedestrian friendly old-town just down the hill from the castle.
Notes:
* For the best views, I recommend staying in the Altstadt (old town). This allows for easy access to a plethora of restaurants and cafes, plenty of streets and alleys to explore, and a fairly gentle up-hill walk to the castle.
* The old town is impressively large, and mostly car-free.
* We stayed in the Sorat Hotel Saxx, which offered the additional benefit of providing a great view of the ‚ÄúSchoener Brunnen‚Äù (the beautiful fountain), and the Haupt Markt (Main market place).

Killing time Sunday night, we were window shopping, took a few side streets to enjoy some of the bridges, and wound up in the ""real"" Old Town. It was absolutely charming at night. Lots of bridges, water, nooks and crannies. We ended up at the Henkerhais area. We were kicking ourselves that we had to leave the next morning.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Nuremberg one of the most rewarding of German cities to visit if you have a only a short time to spend. It is possible to do it in a single day but to do the city justice I would suggest at least two full days. The city is wonderfully compact and it takes only around three hours to walk round the well preserved city walls. We found the people warm, friendly and informative - slightly surprising as in 1945 Nuremberg was one of the most comprehensively bombed cities in Germany. There is a sense that the Nurembergers have a very real commitment to democracy - and not just because of the Nazi trials. The city is also is striking for being so cosmopolitan and I was delighted to notice a statue of the Virgin Mary on the wall of a Turkish restaurant .
The sensitively restored castle, the churches, the attractive bridges are a tribute to the loyalty of Nuremberg's citizens towards their city There are many restaurants varying from cheap to super expensive but all those we tried were good. An unexpected treat was the number of extremely good ice cream parlors.

It's been rebuilt of course, but there it is, a beautiful and tantalising taste of what Nuremberg looked like before the Allied bombing of 1944 and 1945. Such a pity. It sits on one side of the square, the Altstadt, I think. Go into the church and revel in its intimate sanctity. Look at the photograph of the ruined remains of the church after its massive bombing in 1945. Look at it now, scars and all. You come out of the place with a huge regard for the German people who rebuilt it and would not accept the destruction of their city.",Mar 2016

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Was in Nuremburg over the weekend. Had a hotel right near Christkindlesmarkt. What a great attraction. First of all, you have to get the Gl√ºwein, hot mulled wine.
Excellent! You have to put down ‚Ç¨ 3 for the cup, which is returnable for a refund at any Gl√ºwein stand. Next, the Nuremburg sausage sandwiches are to die for! Get the three in a bun with some sauerkraut. It's a must! There's also a half meter sausage on a bun. Didn't have time to sample that one. There's also corn on the cob and plates of hot mushrooms you can get. They also make a dynamite curry kebab served in a plate with a bun. Awesome! 20 cent deposit on the plastic plate, just bring it back and get back your 20 cents. There's also really nice pork hambugers. So, the food and the Gl√ºwein were excellent! The shopping is nothing to sneeze at either. If you're a fan of Christmas ornaments...there's a million of them! Lots of things to fuss over. You can spend hours going through the various kiosques. Not to mention the beautiful canals and churches. Truly an enchanting experience with a great atmosphere!

This river, after flowing out of the Woehrder See and through the northeastern medieval fortifications, divides into several channels, creating delightful islands with waterside promenades. Here you'll find some quiet, out-of-the way corners and really be able to see all the best of Nuremberg's medieval buildings. I recommend you get your detailed map and just explore.

The town has 4 towers at the ""corners"" of the Old Town. They all look exactly alike, so if you get a bit lost like we did, you will find yourself in the Red Light District, which is indeed something to behold. Great city...hope to go back someday.

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"The Altstadt is the old town and is filled with history- many museums, underground bunkers, churches, the Kaiserburg (Nuremberg Castle), shops... and many other attractions, all within walking distance of one another. We stayed in Furth and I was concerned about getting on the train and getting to Nuremberg (I don't speak much German) but it was rather straightforward and every time I pulled out my map- someone would always ask if I needed help to get somewhere in particular- really friendly- thank you to all those who helped me on my way!
There is a walking tour that you can follow of all the attractions and museums which you can get online and any other information can be gotten at the tourist office in the Hauptmarkt. If you are staying at certain hotels- you can also purchase day/2 day tickets for entry into most attractions (and even train tickets can be bought from them)- this was true at least when we visited.
We wandered around at our own leisure and used a map (downloaded) for walking around- it does help that most of attractions are signposted. We did not have enough time for all the museums but managed most of the churches and the market as well as a walk along the river and over some of the bridges. Even went on a tour of the underground bunkers which finished with a small tour of the lovely Aryers Distillery/ Brewery.
There are many places to stop off and grab a bite or a drink along the way and there are a couple of public restrooms which were decent too.
Overall an excellent experience!

Germany,Altstadt,5.0,"Nuremberg was one of the most important European cities during the Middle Ages.In 1219 it became Free Imperial City but in1806 it lost its independence and up to now it's part of Bavaria. So the Old City has so much to offer. During the WWII most of the old buildings were destroyed as Nuremberg was one of the allies' big targets. However most of them have been reconstructed and we enjoy now one of Germany's most beautiful cities. The Old City is divided in 2 sections by the River Pegnitz: Lorenzer and Sebalder, named after the churches St.Lorenz and St.Sebaldus. You can't see properly all the sightseeings in one day. You must definitely return to visit everything. A lot of churches, one better than the other. with significant treasures inside. Besides the above mentioned, Frauenkirche, St.Elisabeth, St.Jacob, Santa Klara, etc. Exceptional fountains like Sch√∂ner Brunnen, Ehekarussel. Different towers like Frauentor, Sinwellturm, Weisser Turm, Spittletor, Tierg√§rtnertor, etc. Picturesque squares, like the Hauptmarkt, Albrecht D√ºrer square, Rathaus square, etc.The castle, Kaiserburg has 5 km fortifications, among the best in Europe and a very good museum. A lot of bridges, like the Museum bridge, the Meat bridge, etc. On the hill in Fachwerkh√§user (Handwerk houses) it's the eldest house of the city, since 1338!!! Museums? Yes, there are like Stadtmuseum Ferbohaus, Toy Museum, Albrecht D√ºrer's House, etc.It's better for you to start walking from the Sebalder section and go downhill slowly to the Lorenzer area and you'll see how tired you are to complete your tour. The first time I visited Nuremberg I started from the rail station, up to the hill and back again, visiting 5 churches among others. It was exhausting. The second time I started from the Castle. It was much better. Whatever you choose, you definitely can't resist to the city's special dish: Bratwurst (sausage) with Sauerkraut (sour cabbage) or potatoes salad. And... beer of course. You won't regret it. There are taverns and bistros everywhere. Some very nice in Handwerkerhof (courtyard of craftsmen) inside the city's walls. A lot of tourists there but a lot of shopping too. There are maps showing the Royal Mile which includes the Old City's sightseeings.

There are many sites to see including churches and museums. There is a cool tour of the underground tunnels dating back centuries.

The exterior ( just like everything in the old part of Dresden ) proves that people can do fantastic things, not just being capable of destroying everything they build.

On the other hand, the gallery is nowhere near complete - there are supposed to be a few hundred paintings inside while there are only 55, just the first floor with 3 halls are available for visiting. Next (upper) part of the gallery will be open in March 2020.

The staff at the entrance ( and inside the gallery ) are quite rude. My sister had a tiny bag ( smaller than mine - I have my photo equipment in it, usually put it in front of me and hug it - worked in every museum so far ) was rudely told to take it down to the lockers yet many people with bags was bigger than hers were allowed in without any problems.

However. It's worth taking time to aimlessly wander, take in the timeless elegance and ambience of this place and just enjoy.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,5.0,"Writing this review is an absolute thrill and honor. Antonio had four other musicians performing with him for a crowd from the Viking River Cruise-Astrild ship. I wasn't sure what to expect until he led his crew into a classic composition that set the stage for what was about to happen throughout the balance of their concert.
I noticed something very different about Antonio and his crew, but couldn't put my find on it. Then, it became incredibly obvious as if some unseen spirit standing next to me turned on the lights. Antonio and most of his crew were not just playing the music....they were deep within the energy of perfectly balanced tones they were producing.
And, only one person seemed to have her eyes open reading her sheet music (the pianist). Everyone else seemed to have connected with one another perfectly.
This, in turn, provided a gift that I was not expecting. Decades ago, I had competed for a position as a teenager with Music Youth International based in Traverse City, MI. MYI sought the most talented young musicians in the USA each year and then when they were found, the perfectionists of MYI groomed them into some even better.
The lead master gave us all an example of what they were building towards by showing us all that you can, and must feel the music you are playing. It is a kind of meditational, spiritual experience. And, when you are successful in do this, you will find yourself merging as one with all of you collogues. The audience will at least sense this regardless of their background.
After the performance, I asked for permission to visit with Antonio and did my best to express my thoughts, my feelings, and deep appreciation for what he and his crew had accomplished.
To say the experience of being with them was unique is truly a gross understatement. If you choose to attend any of their concerts, you will be more than entertained!

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,5.0,"The Zwinger is top notch, but let me do a little explaining first.

Unknown to me before our trip, Dresden was a city of great art and culture in the 1700s. The closest equivalent is maybe the Romanovs in Russia before the revolution. This palace is one of the great works of architecture destroyed in the bombing raids of December, 1945, but rebuilt once East Germany fell. The building is amazing architecturally, but also houses three museums, each worthwhile in its own right.

First, you can walk around for free and it's certainly worth the time.

There is an old masters museum, but it's being renovated. We had the bad luck to be there when almost none of the works were on display. If seeing the art is important to you, you'll want to check ahead (although there are other art museums in the city you can enjoy as well).

The other art museums are for porcelain and scientific instruments. The porcelain is beautiful and I'm saying that as someone who ordinarily isn't that impressed by it. The Soviet Army stole much of this, but it was later returned to the city in the late 1950s as a kind of peace offering to the citizens of East Germany. You can see both German and Russian numbers on many of the pieces.

The scientific instruments are really cool. If you're at all into astronomy look in particular at the instruments they used to track planets. The instruments are also very artistic in their own right. Take a look at the automaton bear while you are there - it's amazing what they could do with 18th century technology.

The separate residence palace is in another palace more or less across the street. That one contains attractions such as the Green Vault (old and new) and many other displays. It's easy to see them both on the same visit but the sheer amount of amazing stuff suggests that you see them on different days.

This is a great sight and a symbol of Dresden's rebirth following the massive WWII bombings.

Upon arrival at the ticket desk, we were spoken to (can‚Äôt even say greeted here) by a very rude female member of staff. She didn‚Äôt even smile and say hello. We had seen on the ticket prices that they did concessions so naturally asked for 1 concession and 1 standard ticket. We we stunned by her rude response when she said ‚ÄúWHAT merit do you claim concession!?‚Äù We said that mum was 75 and she just tore strips off us saying that we shouldn‚Äôt ask for that as it‚Äôs for disabled and students only.

The gallery itself is good, but if you bend down to try and read the descriptions of the paintings, alarms go off and staff come and tell you off. Not fun.

On the way out, we looked for the exit and a lift. I found a sign that had a symbol for disabled access and a lift and was told by a very rude Male member of staff that we couldn‚Äôt use it so my poor mum had to suffer the stairs. She was in agony but they didn‚Äôt care. Definitely won‚Äôt be going back.

There are very nice views from the 2nd level terrase, being accessible from a few entrances.

The Nymps bath fountains were not in function when we visited, but still a nice area (behind the entry to the left if getting in by bridge door)

It is an impressive building with 2 main collections: Old Masters paintings and the Porcelain Collection which was outstanding and my favorite. The paintings were subdivided into 2 sections one of which was the Renaissance collection which I found least Enjoyable as it had repetitious religious themes . How many pictures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph in Med-eval attire can you look at? And there were Many. In the old Masters I particularly enjoyed the pictures of Old Dresden.I was told that this was Dresden's main attraction but to be honest, The Residence was far more rewarding. The Zwinger

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,5.0,"Taking a day trip to Dresden from Prague, the Zwinger wasn't our first choice of museums but it turned out to be our highlight of the day. The Royal Residence was closed for renovation and the Zwinger was our alternative to see Saxon heritage and treasures. The reconstructed complex is built in true extravagant Baroque style. The walk across the balconies is glorious even the dreary winter days. In saying that, I'm sure it would be even better in summer when the fountains are in full swing.

The three museums in the complex are all unique and has something that suit everyone's tastes. We spent the least time in the Old Master's Gallery. Whilst it is an extensive collection, we were spoilt by other great galleries across Europe. The Porcelain Collection is one of it kind. It brought us to a journey into the history of European porcelain from Augustus the Strong's far east collections to its development in Meissen. It was my first experience of a porcelain museum and it was fantastic. The Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments is also fascinating with intricate clockwork and instruments. The museum is also really interactive so visitors can experience the development of science over the centuries. The Zwinger is a complex where you can spend hours at, whether to admire the Saxon collections or just enjoying the Baroque architecture - definitely one of the must dos of Dresden.

No selfie sticks allowed into the museums. However taking photos, in most galleries, is allowed. Ask stuff in-advance. When you are IN, try to get those electronic guides - very helpful and informative. You can find them right at the entrance to every museum. There are several museums. So some homework to be done beforehand to prioritize your visits. In general - must visit place. Especially paintings. Even for those who know nothing about paintings, like me.

Loverly to walk thru. Wish there were benches to set.
Wide and expansive, the gravel paths led you to the entrances of the collections that Augustus displayed there. For example: art paintings and porcelain. Appreciate the separateness because like the Green Vault, there is too much to take-in.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,5.0,"The Zwinger - a super-palace, begun by Augustus the Strong (or Fat), never finished. Still, it's one of the most beautiful sights in the city. I saw it as one of the last stops on a great walking tour, during which we'd seen several wonderful places.Yet, when I entered this beauty I couldn't suppress a gasp - it's a stunning sight, one of the finest in a city of beautiful sights.

Some of it was meshed in scaffolding, but enough was scaffold free that one could easily imagine the splendor at court that Augustus II was hoping for.

In the Zwinger there are also several museums, the finest of which is the Gemaldegalerie. If you see no other museum in the complex, do spend at least an hour in this one.

I think I'd have to say that if you haven't seen the Zwinger, you haven't really seen Dresden.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,4.0,A city that has risen from the rubble. The Palace has been reconstructed into impressive buildings. The courtyard and fountains are impressive. There is much to explore at this location.,Jun 2018
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,4.0,"The site is impressive! The baroque architecture was ""in your face"" and eye candy for me. We took about 30 minutes to stroll around the immense courtyard to take photos of the appealing sculptures which were everywhere on the buildings - roofline, walls, gates, around windows, balustrades, columns, cornices, and fountains. These sculptures are of a whimsical nature - playful mythological characters and cute cherubs - no saints, religious figures, or even royals. It was designed to be a pleasure palace after all.

There are at least 3 entry/exit gates to the site. There is no admission charge to walk around the courtyard to see the exterior of the buildings. We used the Crown Gate so called because of its crown and other royal insignia piled over the archway. This entry crosses a moat (now filled with greenish water). There is no drawbridge apparatus though in the tower - just beautiful sculptures. The other access points are by Theaterplatz where the Semper Opera and Hofkirche can be seen and through the Bell Tower on Sophienstrasse to visit the Residenzschloss and the Furstenzug.

Immediately evident upon entering any of the site's 3 entrances, visitors see the layout. Four large corner buildings connected by lower wings surround a central courtyard filled with 4 patches of geometric lawn shapes and 4 fountains. All the buildings, their connecting wings, and entrance towers have repeated rows of arched windows and openings which make a strong statement. Unfortunately, the sandstone used in the reconstruction of these buildings is beginning to darken.

The courtyard on my visit contained no flowers - just geometric shapes of mown lawn surrounding the 4 fountains. Wide pathways, mainly fine gravel - no cobble stone here - divide the property into quarters with the 4 low, but wide, fountains placed at the center where the paths cross. Tubs of low growing trees similar to those found in Orangeries were placed in this area. This site lacks shade trees - little shade other than that provided by the buildings and no benches for lingering. On my visit, the single spouting fountains were turned off around 4 pm.

One outstanding structure was the bell tower, easily recognizable with its gold framed clock and rows of seemingly small white Meissen bells. With a zoom lens, one can see the Meissen trademark of the 2 blue crossed swords around the clock. Fittingly, the entry to the Porcelain collection is in that tower . Go up the stairs to buy the ticket (6E) and while you are up there, step outside on to the roof terrace for a walk around. This is the spot to take ""aerial"" photos of the site.

If you want to visit the 2 museums holding the collections of art and porcelain, be familiar with their location on the site in order to save time retracing steps as I didn't see large signs outside the buildings (for obvious reasons). While there is no charge to enter the grounds, the 2 museums do have an entry fee - the Porzellansammlung (6E) and the art gallery - the Gemaldegalerie. I visited the porcelain collection using up another half hour to admire the 2 collections of Meissen and blue and white Chinese porcelain. The museum is on one floor. This wing displaying this collection is lovely - full of light streaming through rows of arched floor to ceiling windows, white walls, and marble floor. If you want to see what the interiors of the buildings are like, pay the museum admission price.

Once at the Zwinger Palace, the other attractions are close by - the Semper Opera, the HofKirche, the Residenzschloss, and even the Frauenkirche further along Auguststrasse which also has the 24,000 tiled League of Prince - the Furstenzug. All great attractions for a packed day of sightseeing.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,1.0,"New facilities, good layout, good standard of art works, CRANACH especially well represented. However, all is spoilt by small print labels, set so low you have to kneel to see the text, then, of course you upset the alarms because you have got too close! Then the old GDR scowl from the gallery guards creates a tense atmosphere. None of them acknowledged my comments about these signs, probably also not a lot of english is understood?
Also, many paintings are crammed in up to 5 meters up walls, and with varnished surfaces and high lighting these are almost impossible to see, unless you stand back 15 to 20 meters and loose details.

These are serious detractions and are easily addressed. Fixing the lighting will take money and time, but is worth attention as well.

The grounds were more for a garden/orangerie purpose with surrounding pavilions where small art collections are hosted but if you want to visit them check if they are open during that day/period.
Massive reconstruction works are going on at the moment so be ready for extra noise and dust, also during peak season and weekends it gets really busy with visitors.
Anyway even if sometimes the black walls were giving a more mysterious feeling when visiting these old sites it`s wonderful to see all the reconstruction works carried in Dresden not only to clean but also to rebuild from ruin some of the monuments.

The only complaint is there are restoration, so you can't always avoid scaffolding when taking pictures of the building. Also there are plenty of security staff inside the museum. This may not be a bad things given some tourists like to touch (and break) things. However, here is really strict. You are constantly being watched and a wrong move such as getting to close to the painting to read the label will trigger a beep. This is OK with me as we have to keep the valuable history away from those tourists that can't control themselves.

Definitely pay to go for the Gemaldegalerie Alte Meister. It features quite an admirable number of master pieces and the audioguide was helpful.

We purchased the tickets for the Physics and Maths museum and the Porcelain Gallery as well.

The Physics and Maths museum features the Prince of Dresden's personal collection and contains many exquisite scientific instruments from the earlier centuries. However, as a science nerd, I was not so excited by the exhibit as it got rather repetitive and banal.

Some porcelain enthusiasts may find the Porcelain gallery worthwhile, and it does features some impressive collections. However, it will not be very interesting if do not appreciate the fine details of porcelains and decorations. The place, in addition, has very confusing routes and is sweltering - definitely not a plus point when you've been exhausted from exploring the Zwinger, the Gallery and the Museum.

The building was mostly destroyed by the carpet bombing raids of 13‚Äì15 February 1945. The famous art collection had been evacuated, however. Reconstruction, supported by the Soviet military administration, began in 1945; parts of the restored complex were opened to the public in 1951. By 1963 the Zwinger had largely been restored to its pre-war state.

A bit damp so we enjoyed the gallery though couldn't get enthused about the pottery. Suddenly we'd been there 2 1/2 hours!

You should go to Dresden just to see this, and enjoy a rich historical imagery. It is free to access the garden, which is incredible, and you can also walk freely through the terraces and stairs. However, I would strongly recommend you to enter the halls of palace, because there they have huge old masters' painting collection. the entrance is 10 euros, and they have Rubens, Rembrandt, Tintoretto, Velazquez, Titian and others... In this price is also included visit to the Saxony electors' porcelain collection (which is amazing even if you are not into porcelain sculptures) and to Royal cabinet for mathematics and physics. It is definitely a great historical and artistic tour, after which you can continue to stroll around the historical center of Dresden,

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,4.0,"We visited Dresden with whole-day guided tour. It was good and bad. Wanted to see it ""all"", but had a limited time (bad). Having a guide was great, because a listening to the colorful histories when sightseeing is a must! Especially, Zwinger palace tied with both Augustus ""The Strong"" - Electors of Saxony, and Kings of Poland is full of stories of food extravaganzas, lavish parties, enormous collections, romantic/erotic engagements, and amazing strength show-offs (bare hands horseshoes breaking, and/or fox slinging with two fingers only). What the stories!!!

Most of the people wonders at the palace main yard/garden and then choose one of the galleries/museums to see. I would add to it a hidden on upper level, Nymphenbad - Nymph Courtyard, a small frivolous/ erotic court designed for King's pleasure. To get to the upper level and to the Nymph Courtyard go to the Northeast corner of the Zwinger palace and take the stairs thru the Franzosischer Pavilion. Not sure where to go? There is a big map of the Zwinger palace displayed at the center of the main courtyard/garden. Also, the view of the palace from an upper level is great. I hope our three cents in this massive-pool-opinion were helpful.

Having lived at Paris for 7 years I know the Louvre pretty well and found it having a masculine imposing image through its miles of walking galleries and unending long facades endowed with sculptures terraces and walls, though very beautiful. But can leave you physically exhausted and emotionally drained. Zwinger is more under stated but gorgeously feminine (curves and curves) structure - really beautiful building - a more manageable walk inside and outside the musuem. The displays at Zwinger Musuem are refreshingly different too (unlike Louvre and similar musuems which focus majorly on paintings, sculptures and period themes). We saw (apart from paintings and sculptures) two wonderful galleries - one gallery dedicated to mathematical and physical instruments history (a delight for astronomically and astrologically inclined human species) and a great porcelain musuem.

The Zwinger is certainly iconic in Dresden; certainly a must see. Surely the kind of place where you would want to pose for snapshots for the folks back home. In its heyday it was not a grand historical monument but a hip venue to go to, to stroll within on a lovely day and to be seen, perchance to be admired. It was society 's playground in the outer gardens, and to be part of the social set that frequented the sumptous halls and amenities of the stately interiors, meant to be part of a significant affluence. It is a miniature copy of Versailles, so much is obvious; it is how the crowd that frequented the Zwinger related to its grandeur that has to be imagined.
