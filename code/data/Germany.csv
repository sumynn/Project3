Germany,Reichstag Building,5.0,"A building of such importance and with so much history. A must visit on any trip to Berlin.

However in these times of Covid there is one very important message to give and that is book early. If you see an on-line ""Visiting slot"" take it and sort the logistics out later. We could only secure a visit at 9.00 am on a Sunday morning, but were so glad we didn't hesitate.

For those who cannot book a tour, consider having a meal in the restaurant and using that as an opportunity to enter the building. An added bonus are the unrestricted views from the top of the building.

Finally if you do manage to hit the jackpot and get to visit then take time to carefully read what documentation / pre-registration is required. When we went they were strictly enforcing the rules and I am sure people are turned away.

The building was built in 1894. In the 1990s, it was renovated and a glass dome was built.

Now the building is a true example of eco-architecture. The shape of the dome allows the building to make use of natural lighting.

At the moment, entering the building and the dome with panoramic views is possible only with an advance booking.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"This is an incredible place to visit, its not just the regular train models, its more than that. Three stories floor with different parts of the world to the minimal details. An amazing airport where planes takes off and land. Concert halls, circus and so much more. Its like seeing the world in miniature. Its so incredible to see !",Oct 2021
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,1.0,"Waste of money! For 20 euros it is one of the most expensive entries and all you see is miniature models. People were just walking past them. Not sure why it is rated so high. It is better to walk around that area rather than get inside into a crowded expensive place. The area around is Speicherstadt which is nice to walk around.
Maybe its for kids but even the kids looked not very interested.",Oct 2021

If I return to Hamburg I‚Äôll definitely re-visit - they‚Äôre still expanding the exhibit!",Sep 2021
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Hard not to love this place - it's huge, it's insanely detailled, it's immersive and it's probably the best miniature world I have ever seen (and I have seen a few, sad case that I am). A really stand-out attraction.

You could probably blast round in a few hours but I would recommend a proper half day minimum to really enjoy the crazy attention to detail.",Sep 2021
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"Wow! Can this place really exist?

We originally did not plan to visit this attraction, because it seemed too kitschy and touristy to us. We changed our minds due to the recommendation of a local and we are so glad we did.

This wonderland is so detailed and quite faithful to the places that it represents. It is amazing to see the intricate detail and how the various vehicles and lighting work together to create a tiny world of activity.

We highly recommend purchasing your tickets in advance. This place is very popular and there are long lines for buying tickets. We were only able to get tickets for 10:30pm, but we went ahead and visited at that time rather than miss the experience.

It was worth it, but it does get tiring to enjoy the Wunderland past midnight after a full day of sightseeing. Go earlier in the day, if possible, and be prepared to spend hours enjoying all the details and amazing technology that enables this miniature world to come to life!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,5.0,"We went back to the Miniatur Wunderland last week and it was worth every Euro and minute (FYI, we spent there almost seven hours including a quick lunch). The staff has done amazing work, the love for details, the diversity, the fact of changing lights (i.e., seeing everything by day and by night) is just amazing. Being tall means enjoying the advantage of seeing some details that smaller (and younger) visitors do (un)fortunately miss out on...
We will come back. And a huge thank you to the staff - you are great.",Jul 2021

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,5.0,"This is one of the sites that everyone who comes to Germany should see. It is incredible and really makes you appreciate what people can do when they set their mind to it. One of the few places I have visited where words just do not do it justice. If you like visiting old churches or Cathedrals, Koln Cathedral is a ""bucket list"" visit.",Oct 2021
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,3.0,"The cathedral itself is majestic but a location near rail station is bad. It loses its magic.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,4.0,"Learning the history regarding the building of the cathedral, the various sculptures, WWII and the cathedral, etc. made the sights even more impressive.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,4.0,Enjoyed this museum although I am not a car fan. They have different type of vehicles made for different purpose. Only thing I don't like was the audio headphone: it is of the ear hook type which kept sliding off my ears. I have small ears which already have to carry my eyeglass and the strings of my mask - really have no room for a third item. After about 30 minutes I was fed up and went back to reception asking to use my own earbuds. It was all good then.,Sep 2021

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,3.0,"Nice collection of cars presented in impressive architecture, but not the depth that it could have had. No info on where Mercedes will bring us, the people that went after the founders, the major new innovations (the last one was about safety from 43 years ago), where Mercedes is produced, the current range, or why the fusion with Chrysler happened and then failed.

It is absolutely worth visiting if you're in the area, but it could be so much more.
Food option (one) was limited, and the shop was nearly empty. All texts are German + English, and the free audio guide provides most options in those languages.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,5.0,"The museum contains a lot information about the vehicles, improvements and the inventors. Between different layers they do display what happened around the time aside from the brand, which does make it easier to relate to the time.

The architecture itself is absolutely amazing, just like the exhibition is. You can discover the heritage of this world-famous car brand; personally, the exhibitions I liked most are the one of the racing cars (obviously‚Ä¶) and the one of the cars belonged to famous people, such as John Paul II and Lady Diana.",Jul 2021

Germany,Main Tower,5.0,Great to see it all from the top its one of the best things we have visited during our stay also the renovation was very good,Nov 2021
Germany,Main Tower,1.0,"I paid my ticket/reservation in advance as I am not from Frankfurt. We were a few minutes late to this place due to our dinner running a bit late, and getting lost in the city. Upon arrival, the security told us we cannot go in as they are closed, without even asking if we had a reservation/ticket! After we told them we had reservation and he asked for papers, I showed my ticket and my vaccine card, and my girlfriend her negative test, but he told us she cannot go because her test is now over 24 hours. While I understand the severity of Covid-19, a negative test result is only valid at the time of the test taken, since you could have came in contact with someone after your test. She was only 2 hours past the 24 hour mark, and at this time of day, we'll not able to get another test done, and the ticket I paid for going to waste. The security guy just said these are the rules. Probably won't come back here and try to check out the platform in future. In addition, there is an added 0.50 Euro fee when ordering online, which seems odd when you are trying to reduce in person contact due to hygiene reasons, so why charge me extra money when I'm trying to reduce carbon/paper waste on top of being contactless? Just baffles me.

Germany,Altstadt,4.0,"Visited in Sept. '19 and Aug. '16. Anyone visiting Nuremburg should definitely spend at least and hour or two visiting the Old Town section.

While Nuremburg, before WWII one of the most beautiful cities in Germany and Europe was leveled by allied bombing during WWII, they did a very good job of restoring many of the buildings and churches to close to their original look and structure.

There are many beautiful churches here like St. Lorenz and the Frauenkirche (main square) as well as the renovated Nuremburg Castle on the hill. If you have time, there is an old medieval clock tower on the front face of Frauenkirche in the main square that does a short 5-10 minute performance daily.
