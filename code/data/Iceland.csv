Iceland,fikret oguz,Perlan,5.0,"We came here with hop on hop of bus. ideal for city tour. It's not a big city anyway.
but this is a place worth seeing and you need to spare at least 3 hours. It has a man-made ice cave inside. You can also see the northern light show in the movie theater.
You can go upstairs and see the city around the dome.",Nov 2021

Iceland,Linbol75,Perlan,4.0,This is about a 30 min walk from Reykjavik high street. You can pay to go into the different areas of the museum we walked up to the fourth floor viewing platform which is free to do. The panoramic views were stunning as were the views from the cafe on the 5th floor. Well worth a visit,Nov 2021
Iceland,Phoenix095,Perlan,4.0,"Apparently Perlan is the newest museum in Reykavik. The building is beautiful, with a glorious glass dome on top housing the museum's (light fare) restaurant. The exhibits focus on the natural history of Iceland--it's geologic origins and wonders, as well as its creatures and people.",Nov 2021
Iceland,stevenenhilde,Perlan,4.0,The museum is a essential visit in the city. Great planetarium and expo's about icecave and water. A little outside the city center.,Nov 2021
Iceland,Stefan G,Perlan,5.0,"Did the museum plus the Wonders of Iceland and the Arora Northern Lights Planetarium Show. Loved it. The light show was well done, to include the music, lighting, and storyline. The ice cave exhibit was literally freezing but fun; they built an ice cave in the museum! Then, the museum itself - wow, very in-depth and educational. Information overload regarding the geology, flora, and fauna of the island. One can easily spend several hours here. A zipline attraction is also available, though I myself did not do this.

Plenty of parking. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended.

Iceland,HeardItBothWays,Perlan,5.0,"My husband and I visited the Perlan Museum - Wonders of Iceland and Aurora Northern Lights Planetarium Show and thought it was an interesting and educational way to experience a little bit of many aspects of Iceland's geology!

There are several floors of exhibits that showcase the nature and geology of Iceland. We really enjoyed the replica of the cliffs with the wildlife replicas such as the birds and the arctic fox. There was a taxidermy polar bear as well. We also enjoyed the volcanology videos and exhibits.

The ice caves were a lot of fun to explore, especially since we were visiting too early in the season to appreciate them ""in the wild.""

The planetarium show was very enjoyable and explained the science and mythology behind the auroras.

Masks were required when we visited. Because I wear glasses, it made it difficult to appreciate the exhibits because they kept fogging, especially in the chilly ice caves. It would definitely be a better experience post-pandemic.

The ticket prices were high-ish but not unexpected for this kind of museum. It's definitely worth a visit!

Iceland,Lauren R,Perlan,4.0,"This was our 5th trip to Iceland and we had always wondered what that structure was. This last trip we found out it was now an interactive museum with informative, interesting exhibits about Iceland and an ice cave to explore. There was also a zip line but we had not booked it. The people who were on it seemed to really be enjoying it! While it was just my husband and I this would be a great place to visit with children.",Oct 2021
Iceland,Bonne S,Perlan,5.0,We spent several hours at Perlan on a downpour rainy day. All of the exhibits are very wonderful in nicely contrasting ways. I especially enjoyed the historic timeline exhibit after the planetarium show. Read every description and it really helped me learn the history of Iceland in a meaningful way. The Ice Cave lightens the mood and is very much fun! Memorable way to spend a dreary Icelandic day. Even the observatory deck was with it!,Oct 2021
Iceland,Melinda H,Perlan,5.0,"Loved this place! Great basic information on volcanoes, northern lights, an ice cave, - all presented in a very entertaining and safe manner. Highly recommend",Oct 2021
Iceland,Peter_vB2015,Perlan,5.0,While in Reykjavik you have to visit the Perlan. On top of the information regarding Northern Lights it provides a very good and interesting overview of how Iceland was formed/created over the 10.000's of years. And do not forget to visit the ice cave while there!,Oct 2021
Iceland,JudyRue,Perlan,5.0,"This museum was fascinating - the planetarium was super. So was the ice tunnel. Displays were in English as well as Icelandic, which I appreciated. The view from the top floor was wonderful.",Sep 2021
Iceland,Mark R,Perlan,5.0,"We really enjoyed the geological history of Iceland. This is a museum focused on how Iceland came into existence many many years ago, so be ready for some ready and thinking about the aspects on display. This might not be to everyone's tastes, but if it isn't your think, then go somewhere else. However, what is here is very good in my opinion.

The displays were clear, clean/new and very accessible in both Icelandic and English. The movie content was well shot, clear and enphasised the points it was supposed to.

The Aurora Northern Lights Planetarium show, which is just under 25 mins long is worth the extra money. Our only negative was some pushy Americans going in without paying. But the show itself was a joy to behold.

Like the rest of iceland, need to wrap up warm in this museum as after the first section you visit an artificial ice cave set in one of the water tanks, which we found to be a fun experience. The museum them moves into the forming of life around iceland, focussing on sea creatures and mammals.

This entire journey spirals you up a number of floors which leads you to the top of the museum where the restaurant is located. As we were there early it was lunch time at this point, but unfortunately the restaurant was closed for a funeral wake/gathering which was a shame, so instead of coffee we went to the ice cream shop instead... Ice cream in iceland .... I had a scoop of Turkish Black Pepper (sounds crazy, but imaging light liquorice and mint) and a scoop of raspberry, which was a delicious combination, and not as expensive as one might have expected when compared to countries like Italy. Finally if you want to get a amazing view of the Reykjavik skyline this is the place to do it, as you can walk a complete circle around restaurant on a terrace.

Arguably a little expensive, but what in Iceland isn't? but thoroughly enjoyable and a great way to spend 3-4 hours.

Iceland,Robert D,Perlan,4.0,"I walked to Perlan. It's a bit of a walk, but entirely possible. First, I enjoyed the planetarium show, which was quite impressive and focused on the aurora. Then I enjoyed the Wonders of Iceland exhibit. Finally, I went to the observatory to enjoy the views, but unfortunately, I could not see much in the mist.",Aug 2021
Iceland,arthurs946,Perlan,5.0,"we visited the exhibition on our last day in Iceland. actually we did it because the weather was quite bad and we had to spend the time somehow. But we were really pleasantly surprised!
We did the complete tour with the northern-lights show (nicely done, absolutely great pictures and film-snippets ) and ice cave visit (careful - it's -10 degrees, but an unique experience).
Over the different floors we learned a lot about several topics like volcanos, ice, water, glaciers, global warming and animal life. Very fascinating and interesting. Highly recommended!
Also it is possible to do a zipline tour from the top, we didnt because of the weather.

Iceland,George L,Perlan,5.0,"Miro made check today, Thursday, September 30th super easy and the Northern Lights show itself was extremely fascinating and informative. Miro handled sooo many customer requests while we were there and was courteous and kind to all. He juggled many requests and encouraged us to view the other exhibits including the volcano, ice cave, and glaciers. All added immensely to our experience at Perlan we send virtually a bouquet of flowers for Miro!!!

Iceland,Flocko04,Perlan,3.0,We stopped here after doing the golden light tour. It was near closing time but had a drink. There was fabulous views of the city,Oct 2020
Iceland,Raymond,Perlan,3.0,"It starts out by visiting the planetarian which emphasizes the Northern Lights. then you make your way into the museum itself which showcases the fauna of Iceland and the surrounding ocean. There taxonomy birds but the cliff birds are fake. The ice tunnel only allows visitors at timed intervals. The ice tunnel is a short walk. The ice cream shop upstairs had no available employee even though there was quite a few interested potential customers . It's major claim is the few of the city from the rooftop but you can get that from the Lutheran Church steeple. It's best feature is it's volcanic exhibit, really nicely done.
Take a cab or purchase a shuttle ticket that leaves hourly because it's really out of the way.
Really overblown with hype.

Iceland,NY_US_Lizzy,Perlan,3.0,"Came here on a rainy day so visibility from viewing platform was poor. No option to exclude this from entry price.
Exhibitions on glaciers, volcanos etc were ok but expected more specialist insight given Iceland has more examples & able to do more research than other places. Didn't feel I got much new information.
Expected more interactive elements in the displays.
Aurora show was ok but spent a lot of time on background, auroras on other planets etc rather than showing actual displays from Iceland, which most people were probably more interested in.
Overall filled some time & kept me dry for a while on a rainy day but didn't feel it was worth the entry price & wouldn't recommend.

Iceland,reise-tanta-di,Perlan,4.0,"The exploratorium is overwhelming in size and the various exhibitions. We did not have much time so we wandered around just peaking in here and there. It would have been worthwhile to explore the northern lights display for example. But we enjoyed the view of Reykjavik from the top floor and examined the various volcanic rocks on display there.
I loved the form of Perlan and the sculptures at the entrance.",Aug 2021

Iceland,Steviefull,Perlan,5.0,"After moving around our schedule we managed to fit this in our first day. Not really knowing the layout of Reykjavik and time being of the essence we got a taxi from our hotel (Hotel Island) which as expected wasn't cheap (just under Â£20.00).

We paid entry which was around Â£26.00 per adult, so again not cheap, I'm sure you're noticing a pattern here.

The museum has a wide range of exhibits from how the country was formed and continues to change, an area about the wildlife of the country and the two highlights of the Ice Cave and the Planetarium video of the Northern Lights. Add in the view from the roof over Reykjavik and you have a good way to spend a few hours.

We didn't take in the zip wire, Ice Cream parlour or restaurant as we were off for a meal straight after.

This is a great place for all of the family with informative exhibits and interactive parts for those easily distracted. All in all another highlight in a city full of them.

Iceland,DrMarkES,Perlan,5.0,"From films, to the ice cave, to Puffin birds, and volcano education this museum was just terrific and nicely done. We had a 360 view of the city from the observation deck with rainbows off in the distance over the harbor. The price may be higher than expected, but when you are done (including the Arora show) it is worth paying for it.",Aug 2021
Iceland,DrMarkES,Perlan,5.0,We paid for the full Perlan museum and Arora show. The show was so good we watched it at the beginning and the end of our time at Perlan. The rest of the museum is really worth the price and seeing all that you enjoy in Iceland. We went here in the first couple of days and were glad we did as it gave insights of many places and geography that we were planning to see. This show is terrific and gives great insights to the Arora on other planets.,Aug 2021
Iceland,bonnie481,Perlan,5.0,"The architecture is unique and inspiring. It feels grand there and seems like a concert/opera hall for a much larger city than Reikjavik. Go inside to look at the grand design and creativity. There are tours, but you'll need to plan ahead to join one. Only offered at limited times.",Aug 2021

Iceland,VoyagerZ5533OA,Perlan,5.0,"This was a great place to be on a rainy afternoon. My 6-year-old loves our local science museum and this was it x 100! The planetarium show, the interactive setups, the ice cave, the observatory deck, the rotating cafe where he enjoyed a cookie break... The technology involved in some of the exhibits was really slick. I don't think the usual family would spend more than three hours there, but it felt like we could have stayed longer because, once we reached the top, the little one wanted to revisit parts of the museum.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Maggie_NHam,Perlan,5.0,"Amazing space. You can see the glass dome from far off even if you quite can't see how to get to it! There's several huge tanks that house the exhibition space, with the dome on top. Covers early geology and geological forces from millions to thousands to a thousand years ago as it relates to the formation of Iceland. Lots of screens, large and small, interspersed with sitting places. Lots of info on fauna and flora with life sized stuffed ones, including a polar bear who meandered off an ice floe onto the North of the island.

There's a brilliant Ice Cave you can go into and experience, doors are opened to that every 15 minutes or so.

There's a Planetarium that explains the formation of the Aurora. Very interesting, 25 minutes long (its under half an hour) in a good sized auditorium.

Top floor, 5th, lovely open space under the glass dome for refreshments, there's a cafÃ© and a restaurant, bistro style rather than 'cheffy'. Spacious surroundings with fab views to linger in. There's Ice Cream Parlour on 4th floor, go all out and have 3 flavours for 990 isk, about Â£6 and try the black Turkish Pepper, very slightly liquorice-ish. The outside balcony is also on 4th floor, amazing 360Â° views over Reykjavik and the waterfront. And ...if you're so inclined you can jump a zip line from the 4 th too. From 2 pm in the afternoon, weekdays, suspect its earlier at the weekends.

The cost is 4490 isk, Â£26 for an adult, but you could spend the whole day there. Be aware, there are no lockers to store your things, but you can hang your coat up and hope for the best. You don't need to go to a tour company to book tickets, I stood in line for 2 minutes, mid-week.

Its been open 20 years, but it seems no thought has been given to arriving by foot and bus. Nearest bus stop is No.18 on main road, Bustaovegur, which is very difficult to cross (Aug '21). No bus actually calls in at Perlan! Unless you're on a tour. And, there's no straightforward way to Perlan from the bus stop, sort of meander in general direction thro bushes to find windy paths. Hmm.

Iceland,beans987,Perlan,5.0,"Made a stop here on our way to the Sky Lagoon and we really enjoyed it. We went through the ice cave which was pretty fun and looked at all the different exhibits that they had on display. It was a nice overview on how Iceland came about and their history.

The observation deck was nice to get some pictures of Reykjavik and the surrounding area.",Aug 2021
Iceland,darrenbretton,Perlan,5.0,"The Perlan used to house the Saga Museum (now elsewhere) but has been transformed into an amazing educational venue that will keep you occupied. The ice cave was the highlight - several below freezing tunnels beneath the building. The different exhibits covered the glaciers, the water systems, the nesting cliffs amongst others. Looks expensive but is value for money. The aurora planetarium show (35mins) is excellent and allows all to see the impact of the Northern Lights even if it is the wrong time of the year!
Only thing missing - a gift shop!",Aug 2021
Iceland,Susie W,Perlan,5.0,"We came here because one of our scheduled tours turned out to be not scheduled. Frustrated and unhappy, we came to the Perlan. It turned out we enjoyed the museum very much. It was big but not overwhelming. The exhibits were interesting, the ice cave was a lot of fun, and the photos of the vocanos were really beautiful. And the cafe at the top of the museuam had a 350 degree view of Reykjavik and was even rotating! It was a saved and enjoyable day.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Robert R,Perlan,4.0,"We went here on a day that was cold, windy and rainy. Nice escape. Best part was the ice cave. Other parts were interesting too and the top floor would have given a great view of the city if it wasn't raining and cloudy. Great ice-cream at their restaurant.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Li S,Perlan,4.0,"Itâs always worth a free visit to Perlan if youâre unfortunate enough to be in Reykjavik. Unfortunately the savoury buffet has been replaced by an extreme zip wire area, as it brings in more money (does look fun tho). We went to the top floor for drinks which is still nice, especially as it rotates slowly!

Iceland,ashphy,Perlan,4.0,"There is a planetarium, a walk-through ice cave, some interactive things to look at, and an outdoor zipline and bounce 'house' area. (these last 2 things were closed when we were there because it was raining) We ate upstairs--the food was good, but there was a long wait for it. (I did see others taking out food from their backpacks, though) I'm sure on a good weather day the views are amazing and the bounce house is fun for kids, but unfortunately we had neither. Otherwise, everything else was fine.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Brian D,Perlan,5.0,"Did not visit inside the Perlan, but the surrounding forest was excellent for a fun hike and evening walk. Best of all, the forest surrounding the Perlan has some ""wild"" bunnies that inhabit the forest and they are HUGE! They are difficult to spot at first, but once you find them, you will be hooked on trying to find more of them. Completely free and a fun walk around the forest features birds, bunnies and many trails. A great place to picnic or enjoy the scenery next time you visit the Perlan.",May 2021
Iceland,OscarTraveler,Perlan,5.0,"Nice museum. Interesting exhibits with both Islandic and English captions. Planetarium show was impressive with multiple video projectors seamlessly illuminating the dome. Show combined some science and some folklore about the northern lights. Walking through the ice cave was like being in a walk-in freezer. But notice the beautiful ice crystals on the ceiling (probably from exhaled moisture). Balcony provided a nice 360 degree view of the city. We had planned to eat lunch there, but the cafÃ© was reserved for cruise passengers. We walked there from city center, but it was a little tricky because there were no signs. We saw everything we wanted to see in about 90 minutes.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Lorimendenhall,Perlan,4.0,"we spent a few good hours there. expensive but that's Iceland for you. the ice cave was a bit of a disappointment, it wasn't like a real ice cave, it was more like a little passageway with an ice throne. we were not well prepared for the cold so that;s probably why we didn't enjoy it that much. the exhibits are very well done and so packed with information. the restaurant upstairs had very comfy couches to rest on while eating your $6 croissant or $9 ice cream. lastly, the planetarium show was beautiful. I would have prefered to be immersed in Northern Lights or learned more about them then the silly narrative they gave instead.",Jul 2021

Northern Lights planetarium show was good. Ice cave was meh. Museum seemed to be staffed by young people who werenât very professional. We had a snack at the fourth floor cafe of delicious French fries and very salty mushroom soup (found out it was the last of the batch when we overheard it was sold out right after we ordered it) and the staff left our food siting on the pickup counter without buzzing the buzzer to let us know it was ready. The staff was too busy socializing with each other to pay attention. Some of the young staff were friendly though, especially the young lady with the black pug.

Iceland,Poggibonzzi,Perlan,5.0,"I took the public bus to Perlan and did all three activities- the arora, the wonders of Iceland and the ice cave. They were all very well done and enjoyable. The arora was projected overhead, so it was like seeing the best of the real thing. The Wonders of Iceland includes a bird cliff and a volcanic crater; the seats shudder and shake like youâre in an earthquake. The ice cave is kind of small but it is cold and you can take pictures giving the impression to friends back home that you are hiking an ice cave. My friends back home could not tell from the photos that i didnât get to see the real Arora, or stand near a real puffin bird cliff or hike an ice cave. Just the fake adventure photo ops were worth the price of admission.
Tip: donât miss the ice cream bar on the top floor. Ice cream is free if you do all three activities.
Tip 2: it is a short uphill walk from the public bus stop to the museum. Maybe hard if you are a senior. Consider taking the free bus from Harpa Concert Hall instead which will drop you off right at the door. But check first to see if Harpa busses have resumed service.

Iceland,ParkyYorkUK,Perlan,5.0,"At first look before visiting, I did think the entry price a little high, even for Iceland... Nevertheless there was a sensibly reduced entry fee for ""Seniors"" that I had not seen on the Perlan booking website, or any of the booking sites that offer a reduced entry fee. (Buy the day ticket)
The Museum contains an array of High quality exhibits, with wraparound widescreen video content, interactive elements, and visual information, with supporting text in both Icelandic and English.
The Ice cave which the Kids will enjoy, is a must, as is the Planetarium showing, about the Northern Lights, which has supporting audio in both Icelandic on the hour, and in English on the half hour.
The higher levels at Perlan,allow access out onto the external viewing area, with great views of the surrounding area. At this level you will also fine tasty Ice Cream, don't miss it.
The highest level in the domed area has a nice restaurant and cafe, serving a nice array of food and drinks. Its an air conditioned area, and not too hot to say that you are under glass.
There is lift access to all floors, and there are various restrooms within the building.

Iceland,a may,Perlan,5.0,"If you do not go here when you are in iceland, you are crazy! It is amazing inside, one of the highlights of my trips. Firstly, as a geological student the information and rock samples inside are extremely educational, however for those who go to site see and experience you will not be disappointed. With a real life size ice cave inside, i think tempretures were -16 when i went inside, and the amazing planaterium with videos of the nothern lights. Not to forget the 360 viewing platform of iceland, from one direction you can see tall snow covered mountains, and the other direction a small air travel base and the sea. i would rate this 10/10 if it was an option.

Iceland,Hilaria F,Perlan,5.0,"The views from the cafe are really good, but the cafe service was very slow. It was quite noisy and hectic in the cafe, however the space was amazing, sofas and comfortable sitting arrangements around the full circle of the building.
We enjoyed the ice cave - probably the best fun for tiny children - and it's apparently -15 degrees so we didn't spend long in it, having left our coats in the car.
There are two main exhibitions - quite interactive and informative - about the ice and glaciers, and about wildlife and water in Iceland, also about the geological history. you will leave here a whole lot wiser.
We didn't intend to go to the planetarium but the lady at the desk misunderstood us, so we ended up paying for it even though we didn't really have much time, and watched the Northern Lights film. I appreciate that a lot of work has gone into it and it's a good experience, but I could easily have done without it - one day I want to see the real Northern Lights instead.

The view from the top is excellente. It is almost always quite windy up there, and yes you have to pay to go out on the scenary platform, but it is worth it. The forest around Perlan is also fun ti visit, it has wild rabbits bouncing around, a small geyser and if you look closely there are a lot of WWII ruins.",May 2020
Iceland,GoddardMalaga,Perlan,4.0,Travelling with a teenager its important to find things that are informative and interesting. There is a diverse amount of things to visit in the city but nothing really outstanding compared to other cities in the world. The best thing about Iceland is its stunning raw landscape but if in town you need to find things to do. This building dominates the skyline and it worth a visit.

We paid for the full experience, the museum, observation deck and the northern lights planetarium show. Well worth it.
The northern lights show is fab, music really atmospheric and very informative. we visited the Ice Cave and whilst man made, was very similar to the real thing we saw the next day on a glacier.
We visited the cafe and it was a lovely atmosphere, the restaurant was closed due to coronavirus but the cafe and shop were open and all precautions in place, and lots of hand sanitiser everywhere.
Highly recommended to spend a good 3/4 hours and good fun for the kids too.

Iceland,Alex M,Perlan,5.0,"built atop 5 water towers - the view from the restaurant on top is fantastic!... we went on our last day and shld have gone on the first... I imagine a view at night wld be spectacular!...

it's a well organized facility easy to walk with separate floors for different things... the information about the rock formations and geothermal waters was very easy to absorb... another floor had indigenous animals including a bird wall... we wandered around for about two and a half hrs - which included the 20 min northern lights film... that was worth the price of admission...

the ice cave was just a cold room with ice on the walls... although the menopausal among us will enjoy it - that was not the highlight... the domed restaurant on top is!... check it out - you won't be disappointed...

Iceland,Jodi L,Perlan,5.0,"We did the full museum tour - ice cave, exhibits, observation deck, and aurora planetarium show. Definitely worth the visit - alot of the exhibits had an interactive component. The exhibits were primarily about the geography and natural beauty/resources of iceland. The aurora show and ice cave were pretty cool. Entire visit took about 2-3 hours, but we took our time. I'd recommend coming in the evening, just before sunset so you can see the views from the observation deck in both day and night. Finished up at the bar/restaurant on the top floor - great way to the end the visit.",Mar 2020

The whole place is amazing and has the latest technology in AR, motion detection and interactive displays which keep all the family occupied. The views from the higher levels are stunning and its worth going just to watch planes come in and the surrounding areas. You will not be let down. Walking through a man made indoor glacier (Made from icelandic ice anyway!) and seeing their artificial cliff display were impressive. The aurora show is well worth it and I loved every minute of it. Not just for kids!!",Feb 2020

Iceland,Lynda C,Perlan,5.0,"We did it see the real northern lights but this was surpasses in the planetarium at Perlan where, as well as stars, they showed a film of many real northern lights inclduing the ones with very unusual colours.
There is also a natural history type exhibition done very well with lots of interaction. Especially good is the replica wall for the puffins with places to view real film of them.
Also upstairs, exhibitions about water and ice.
Good cafe - there is also a nice looking restaurant but we did not go in there.
We spent a long time here - 3 - 4 hours.

Iceland,Nev G,Perlan,2.0,"We visited the Perlan on a very snowy day in February after reading a number of positive reviews of the exhibits and other folksâ experiences. Sadly it didnât really live up to expectations.

The exhibits are interesting, but a fair few of the interactive ones were not working, we were herded through the ice caves as quickly as possible and the IMAX film that was supposed to be in English was switched to Icelandic just before we went in. Donât get me wrong, the Perlan has some merit and the views from the top floor cafe/restaurant are great, but at the level of entrance charge youâd probably be within your rights to expect more.

Iceland,ramagar,Perlan,5.0,"A really excellent place if you want to learn something about the geology, flora and fauna and aurora of this beautiful but strange island.
A lot of of clever technology is used and so would fascinate children. A great place to visit at any time but particularly if the weather is bad.
WE did not really know what to expect before we visited but were very pleasantly surprised and it was definitely the best of the various museums and attractions we visited in Reykjavik.
Tere are several attractions within what is really 4 enormous storage tanks, so you can choose what you want to do. We chose the ticket for all. and i hinkthey were all equally interesting. Children wil be particularly intersted in the ""ice cave"" in the basement.
The top has a 360 degree views over Reykjavik and the great thing if you are a photographer you will not be shooting through glass. There is also a lovely restaurant in the top, but BEWARE it is VERY expensive. We just had a couple of coffees and 2 bowls of soup with bread and it came to around Â£30!

Iceland,Stelutza23,Perlan,5.0,"We would highly recommend this museum as an amazing intro to your Icelandic adventure. We visited this museum on our first day in Reykjavik while waiting for a few hours to checkin into our hotel and it was an amazing introduction to what Iceland is. The exhibits are very thorough, clean, updated. You get to see the Northern Lights is explained in an amazing 3D visual show so you're prepared for what's to come on your Northern Lights Tours/ Hunts. The museum also explains the country's geography, volcanoes, geothermal waters, the ice caves, the tectonic plates and how they influence the country's past, current and future geography, structure, location, flora and fauna.

Last, but not least, the 360 degrees panoramic observation deck at the top of the museum offers breathtaking views of the city and the surrounding mountains and fjords.

TIPs we used to be on a budget:
(1) buy ticket online in advance of the trip - we booked it from home vs. locally
(2) sign up for their emails and get a 5% off coupon code that you can use online
(3) buy the combined ticket for 2 exhibits and save 37% off the individual price. When you add the additional 5% off coupon code, it's a quite significant saving. The 2 exhibits for us were: Aurora Borealis show and Wonders of Iceland with real ice caves and observation decks

Iceland,TortugaTravels,Perlan,5.0,"Perlan has been the best Museum we have visited in Reykjavik!

The ticket (Â£30 per adult) provided admission to all areas about Volcanoes, Ice, Water and of course the Northern Lights. These areas are interactive and informative and there is an ice cave to explore too!

The observation viewing deck gives a fantastic view of the whole area - we were lucky to be there on a clear day, which meant we had views in all directions for miles. There is also a cafe where you can take in the breathtaking views and have a bite to eat.

We felt the best part of the exhibition was the film shown in the Planetarium about the Aurora. The show outlines the Auroraâs history and the science behind the formations. It was much better than the Aurora Reykjavik - The Northern Lights Centre.

If you are thinking of visiting any museums in Reykjavik, this is the one.

Iceland,Bernadette M,Perlan,1.0,"We booked this trip on the saturday for the monday we were leaving. As time was limited we only wanted a fairly short and flexible option. The lady at the tourist office where we booked advised us this was a good option.
We were given an entrance ticket and told to pick the free shuttle bus up at the harbour outside the concert hall. Bus stop number 5. We were told the buses ran every hour between 10 and 6 and we could spend as long as we wanted or were able to at the museum.
It was bitter cold but we wanted to make the most of our last day in Reykjavik so after breakfast we set off. We had hoped to catch the 10 am bus but as it was just after 10 when we arrived we thought we had missed that bus. So rather than wait in the bitter wind we went inside the concert hall for a look around.
At 10.45 we went out to wait for the bus. We saw lots of buses but none for the Perlan. At 11.35 we gave up as time was against us and we were frozen cold. I had tried to call the number on our ticket but couldn't understand the Icelandic language so we headed back to the tourist office.
We spoke to the lady who booked it who asked had we phoned them and then she phoned them. She then had to email them to try and find out what had happened and if she could refund us. We waited in the tourist office who offered us a cup of black coffee and eventually a man who seemed more senior called us over.
By this time it was around 12.30 so we had already lost the morning! He wanted to know where we were staying and what time we were being collected for the airport. In fairness he offered to give us money for a taxi to the Perlan but by then we were short on time and didn't want to be stressing and risk getting back late plus maybe not seeing all we had paid for. He said we would be able to get the bus back but we were not reassured given it hadn't turned up to collect us in the first place!
No explanation was given as to why the bus hadn't turned up but I read afterwards online that there are only 19 seats on it and it collects from two other hotels as well as the harbour stop. Maybe it was full so didn't stop...we don't know! To add insult to injury whilst we were outside our hotel waiting for our airport transfer the Perlan shuttle bus pulled in and collected a lady? We had not been offered a hotel pick up and our hotel is not shown on line as a pick up point???
Eventually the tour office refunded us and I have an e mail confirming this but he did not seem happy to do this even though it was us who had missed out on visiting the Perlan!
We then spent the couple of hours we had left just wandering the streets and having something to eat.
We were very disappointed and this was not a good end to an otherwise lovely visit to Reykjavik!

At the top there is a restaurant in the glass observatory. It's a wonderful view all round ReykjavÃ­k whilst eating lunch.
The limited lunch menu was good. My chicken salad was particularly good. Only downside was that it took AGES waiting at the counter to order. Perhaps 20 minutes to serve about 6 people!!

The rest of the museum was also well done with lots of short videos and interactive games. The ice cave was fun to walk through as well so you can get a taste of what it would be like.

Iceland,Nicola T,Perlan,5.0,Highly recommend the Perlan when visiting Iceland with young children (aged 7 & 4) - gave them a great insight into the geology of Iceland and what to look out for whilst driving around. The ice cave and planetarium show where a big hit with the children. Best to visit at the beginning of your holiday,Feb 2020
Iceland,Niall S,Perlan,4.0,Guaranteed view of the northern lights here if you missed for them real! Ice cave was an interesting experience,Feb 2020
Iceland,Tamc288,Perlan,4.0,"We walked from the bus station to get here which is easy. The information about Iceland, it's History and Geography was very interesting. the view from outside is better than from the top of the cathedral and there are maps showing you what everything is in the local area. The planetarium was good but the ice cave was amazing. The only problem was the free transport. We were told there was a free minibus which takes you back to the harbour, but when we tried to get on it 15 minutes before leaving it was already full with people standing. We decided to walk back instead to our hotel in the downtown area using Google maps and this only took 30 minutes which was quicker than waiting for the next bus.

Iceland,adalbore,Perlan,3.0,"The show was cool but nothing special. What I don't understand is why to watch the movie when the real thing is just behind the corner.
In total fairness the show is OK but personally I love nature and prefer to see nature by going where the real action is.
What I enjoyed it was the intro part where it was described how the Northern Lights are formed and from here they come from. The video itself was reasonable although was quite in low resolution. I personally will not return there.",Feb 2020
Iceland,5m1thy,Perlan,5.0,"This was amazing.
Iâd like to point out Iâd found this through tripadvisor as one of the top things to do in Reykjavik. It was so educational and interactive I absolutely loved it. Itâs somewhere you can spend all day and weâll worth the money. Very reasonably priced and the views on the 360 point was amazing so breath taking. Would recommend massively!!",Feb 2020
Iceland,Paul A,Perlan,4.0,"Interesting place to go, planetarium good, exhibition and especially ice cave good and cafe and viewing platform worth a visit",Feb 2020
Iceland,Stuart J,Perlan,4.0,"The Perlan is more than just a visitor experience, it has of all the science and nature information you would want about Iceland and its inhabitants, but it also has some of the best views of Reykjavik you could ask for.

Be sure to have a wander around the rooftop observation platform to get some amazing views of this lovely city.

Also, be sure to experience the indoor ice cave (and yes its real ice) which is pretty cool - pun intended!

Plenty of gifts to buy as you might expect, but perhaps, more importantly, a lovely cafe with a view to refuel.

Absolutely well worth the visit.

Iceland,annando36,Perlan,5.0,"We decided to walk to Perlan from the city centre and it took us about 20 minutes so not too far. When we got there I felt as if there wouldn't be too much to do as it looked quite small but I was pleasantly surprised. The Arora show was amazing and we actually watched it twice. It only lasted about 20 minutes and wasn't busy at all. All the other exhibitions were extremely well done and I learnt so much about Iceland and its history. Great interactive exhibits as well. The coffee shop and viewing level were amazing with fantastic views over all the city. Highly recommended but give yourselves at least 2 and a half hours to browse round.

Iceland,Duliby,Perlan,5.0,"We went here on the Friday when Storm Dennis was battering Iceland! It was a great way to do something interesting inside whilst it was so wild outside. The story of the Northern Lights told in the planetarium was brilliant, so was the history of Iceland told in words and pictures out in the main area. The ice cave was worth exploring properly as was the museum too. Coffee took a while to get served in the cafe area but was good when it came. Couldnât use the Observation Deck because of the storm but the views over ReykjavÃ­k and itâs airport looked impressive through the windows of the glass dome",Feb 2020

Iceland,Joolsybabe,Perlan,4.0,"We bought a combined ticket for the Arora show in the planetarium and Wonders of Iceland. The exhibition is very informative and I really enjoyed the Arora show in the planetarium which was a visual treat and totally wonderful but on the whole felt that Â£58 for us both was a little on the pricey side. You can leave your coats on the rack as you enter the exhibition but you need them when you get into the ice cave as it is -10 in there! The restaurant was expensive and although we got a few good piccies from the viewing platform it was so windy we didn't stay out there long. The minibus transfer from Reykjavik downtown is really handy and it takes around 9 mins from Harpa to Perlan, free for anyone who has purchased tickets.

Iceland,Nicki B,Perlan,3.0,"The entrance to Perlan was about Â£25 each. That was for the second priced ticket which didn't include the northern lights planetarium

It's a nice building but we just felt it was a bit expensive for what was there. Even taking into account that Iceland is expensive. The ice tunnel was good as was the volcano and other info

The cafe was very expensive

You do get really good views from the viewing platform but it was so windy that we couldn't really walk round it

One other hopefully useful info. When you enter the wonders of iceland exhibition there is a rack to hang your coat - which I used - the only thing is you get to the ice tunnel before you get back to where your coat is and the ice tunnel is something like -10. They do have sleeveless jackets you can put on but it would still be better to have your own coat so either don't hang it up or go and get it before you go to ice tunnel

The viewing deck gives amazing views of Reykjavik so be sure to go out and enjoy it. The ice cave is an experience and children were really enjoying it. The only gripe we had was that we ended up missing some things because we had to get to the planetarium for a show and had to am rush through things.,Feb 2020

Iceland,Dustin M,Perlan,5.0,"The Perlan observation deck provides tremendous views of Reykjavik and the harbor. Besides the outstanding views, the museum itself has numerous interesting exhibits that help visitors to better understand the natural features and forces of Iceland.

The planetarium show about the northern lights provides beautiful images of northern lights that can be seen year-round even when the northern lights cannot be seen due to the time of year or the weather.

The ice cave is also interesting to experience. We enjoyed the blue and black ice caves in the glacier more, but this is a nice substitute for those unable to travel to the blue and black ice caves.

The Perlan is a comfortable museum that mixes informative exhibits with fun experiences. We also enjoyed eating lunch at the cafe and enjoying the views of Reykjavik while we ate.

Iceland,Roydan,Perlan,3.0,I thought we would see actual pictures of the Northern Lights instead it was more of a presentation. The show was well done and very informative however I thought I got just as much information with actual photos of the Northern Lights at the Aurora Reykjavik Museum. The 360 degree view was worth the trip and we got some great pictures of the city.,Feb 2020
Iceland,AppleCrazy,Perlan,5.0,"I visited here 6 and a half years ago and it was good then , but on my visit this last week we were really impressed with just how good this museum is. The show at the Planetarium is really well done and was enjoyed by myself , husband and daughter . We were also extremely impressed with the exhibits and displays in the museum . The ice cave for us was perhaps the highlight . It was a great experience. The cafe has great views and although itâs a bit expensive we particularly enjoyed the seafood soup and a piece of lemon skyr cheesecake .. just delicious . If you enjoy photography the observation deck is great for taking photos and panoramic shots of Reykjavik and the area around . We also lived watching the small planes and helicopters come and go at Reykjavik airport . The gift shop is also good and has some really good quality gifts and stylish cards . It was an excellent way to spend a sunny winterâs morning in Reykjavik. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Beautiful building inside too

The museum is also very good at explaining vulcanism around the earth. There is an ice cave within one of the decommissioned hot water tanks, but this is not all that inspiring.
The building is perched on top of a small hill in Reyjavik and has a high level observation walkway around the glazed dome. Views should have been good except that the weather and sun rise were against us.",Jan 2020
Iceland,Yasmin,Perlan,5.0,"My partner and I spent about 5 hours in here and we loved it! It is very interactive and very educational.
We were able to see the northern lights (haha!) and the history about it was very interesting.
Learning about volcanos, tectonic plates and even experiencing -15Â°c in the glacier was so good!
We definitely would recommend it.
There is also an 360Â° observation deck - definitely worth going to.
We also had a coffee in the cafe upstairs which was lovely and fairly reasonable considering prices of everything in Iceland is generally more expensive.
The top floor of the museum was quite moving - the interactive spinning table showing the glacier melting in the next 100 years really hit us & we definitely made a pledge & wrote it on the board. Save our beautiful planet & keep educating people on the environmental changes that are likely to come if we donât do something to change.

Iceland,Jun David,Perlan,5.0,"To go to Perlan, you can take the public bus or the free shuttle from Harpa concert hall.

There are three major fascinating attractions; 360 observation Deck, Ice Cave and the Norther Lights Planetarium show.

The 360 observation deck you can see a 360 degree stunning views of Reykjavik. There are telescope around the deck. It was very windy and raining when we went there so we didn't stay for long.

The Ice cave is a man made cave which duplicates the experience in a real ice caves. If you did not went to an real Ice cave tour, this will be a great alternative. You need to bundle up as you will experience - 10 C degree inside. You can stay as much as you want inside.

The Northern Lights Planetarium show is a fascinating experience. You will view the show as in almost lying down position in your chair looking up at the dome. The video shows about all you want to know about the aurora borealis.

This place is big unlike the other museums in Iceland. There other exhibits in the building like the puffins, whales, vulcans etc.

I recommend this place when you are in Iceland. Entrance is a bit expensive but hey you are in Iceland all are expensive.

However, the best part of Perlan is the Northern Lights Show in the planetarium. Itâs both informative and mesmerizing. The only downside to my visit to Perlan was the food at the restaurant on the 5th floor. While the cod dish was delicious, it was a hot dish that was served barely warm. I couldnât finish my food as it was too cold to eat. While our server offered us a free dessert, we declined. The food experience was already ruined for us.

We headed to the cafe first, the food was good and not too heavily priced and had a good selection of food (egg and avocado on toast, burgers, chips, cake, salads). There is a restaurant with 3 course meals available. The views were great of the city and airport, it was cosy as there was many storms which had closed the airport that day.

We spent Â£55.13 (8,980 isk) for muesem entry. It started with a planetarium experience of the northern lights, there was an ice cave which was good and lots of interesting facts on Iceland, nature and glaciers (lots of information on the effects of climate change).

Iceland,Sue S,Perlan,5.0,What a great place to experience some of the wildlife facts. The ice cave was great fun and loved the viewing deck - what a fantastic view of the surroundings.,Jan 2020
Iceland,Laughingbear,Perlan,5.0,"Havng been to Iceland a few years ago, we were surprised to find this place very high on a list of things to do. It wasn't opened on our last trip nor had we heard anything about it from reference litterature we had reviewed prior to the trip. However, once noted at the top of a 'things to do' list, we selected it and decided to catch the courtesy bus that ran from Harpa. This place is fantastic for young, old and anyone in between. We opted for the cinema experience seeing as the forecast for seeing the real lights wasn't good. The cinema experience is literally out of this world. Very well presented. The rest of the exhibition centre also ticks all the boxes for those who are interested in natural and geological sciences with Iceland rich landscapes providing an extensive range of interesting details. More than happy to recommend this place to anyone visiting Iceland. Excellent.

Iceland,SS0718,Perlan,4.0,"We went to the Perlan as our day tours were cancelled due to weather. The shuttle from the Harper was very useful. The view from the observation deck was incredible if not very windy! Ice cave and interactive parts were amazing. Unfortunately the aurora section was having some IT difficulties so were unable to see that. The interactive table in the water section was particularly impressive. Spent approx 3 hours in total. We attempted to go to the cafe but was very busy (most other people's excursions had been cancelled too) but decided to get the shuttle back into Reykjavik.
Definitely worth a visit when in Reykjavik.",Jan 2020
Iceland,Kerry T,Perlan,5.0,"This was fantastic! The best for me was seeing the Blue ice caves, a small exhibit within the Perlan, as well as the aurora planetarium. Very education for children and adults alike. Some exhibits within the perlan are also 3D and offers experiences for the visitor- summit glacier for example and fish migration game.
Also learn a lot about how Iceland came to be through the ages from before Vikingâs to present day.",Jan 2020

Iceland,debbiewalker36,Perlan,4.0,Easy to find and lots to do. We enjoyed the ice cave and exhibitions. Unfortunately the venue was experiencing problems with IT and the planetarium wasn't open in the end but they gave us a refund. We still enjoyed our visit as lots to do and see.,Jan 2020
Iceland,Ann H,Perlan,5.0,"We bought our tickets beforehand and hopped on the free shuttle bus for ticket holders from Harpa to Perlan. The planetarium show was spectacular. We then walked round all the rest of the museum and the ice cave, each floor giving a different insight into Iceland's natural history. The views from the outdoor viewing platform of the surrounding countryside were stunning despite the freezing temperatures. We had coffee in the cafÃ© at the top of the building. All in all, a great day out.",Jan 2020
Iceland,alice_lenthe,Perlan,4.0,The show here is a great opportunity to see what the Northern Lights are like if you visit Iceland out of season. Admissions in the attraction are pricey and getting there on public transportation was a little difficult.,Oct 2019
Iceland,Jess P,Perlan,5.0,"This was one of the best museums I've ever visited. There's so much to do - we started off with the planetarium show, which was brilliantly conducted and had very comfortable seats (needed after a day walking around the city!). It really made up for not seeing the actual Northern Lights!

The exhibits themselves were interactive and really interesting - there's a cool wall of birds, an exploration of Iceland's water, demonstrations of how humans are harming the planet. The ice cave was one of the highlights, with plenty of photo opportunities and cool tunnels to waddle down.

The roof offers a 360 degree view of Reykjavik, and though freezing outside, I got some great pictures of the skyline. Great gift shop too!

Arora northern lights was good, a huge dome cinema experience. Made up (slightly) for not seeing the northern lights for real.
The wonders of iceland museum was really interesting, lots to see and learn.
The ice cave was good too, cold (of course!).
The cafe had nice coffee and a nice pastry and is at the top of the building so you get views of Reykjavik. Go outside if possible to the viewing area, awesome views

Iceland,Darlene P,Perlan,5.0,"We visited here on our last day in Reykjavik. It was a great place to spend a few hours before we flew out, especially since it was a rainy day. The museum was very modern and bright with really interesting exhibits that told about the natural history of Iceland. We got the ticket that included the ice cave and the Aureora Borealis show in the Planetarium. The views from outside were great too. We got there at 9 am when the museum opened and spent about 2.5 hours there & practically had the place to ourselves.",Nov 2019
Iceland,Speedyian,Perlan,5.0,"Went up here as part of a guided trip with Grayline. Went for a coffee in the 5th floor restaurant. Really nice coffee and supercool surroundings.

Didnât visit any of the other attractions inside the building but they looked excellent and worth another visit",Jan 2020
Iceland,Alan B,Perlan,5.0,"The Perlan is a fabulously interesting and educational museum portraying the Wonders of Iceland.

Must visit!",Jan 2020
Iceland,MTB62,Perlan,5.0,We literally had a half hour stop to visit the observation deck and grab a hot drink as part of our tour. Daylight was just breaking and the views from the observation deck were so dramatic! The got chocolate from the cafÃ© was the best Iâve ever had with real whipped cream and piping hot too! Would love to come back to the actual exhibition. It seemed very informative. Everything was spotless too!,Jan 2020
Iceland,OurAdventures2,Perlan,4.0,"We visited twice during our visit to Iceland. The first time was for New Years Eve, we parked at around 10.30pm where there was plenty of spaces left, parking was free and we could use the toilets inside even though it was closed for ticket holders.

We then walked via the footpath to watch the fireworks on New Year's Eve. The show Iceland put on is immense. You can't imagine how many fireworks there actually was!

We then returned on New Year's Day, and parked for free again, to get inside is free and we visited for daytime views of the city, you now have to pay to use the observation deck which is a shame as it was free back in 2014 and 2016! We didn't use any of the paid attractions, but still worth the visit!

Iceland,Wai Siew K,Perlan,4.0,We walked there from the city centre. It took 30 minutes. There is a 360 degree viewing platform with signboards pointing out the names of prominent buildings.

Iceland,Jeff K,Perlan,5.0,"This is a must visit on your trip to Iceland! The Aurora planetarium show was excellent. We had gone on a Northern Lights tour the night before we went to Perlan and were disappointed that we did not see the Northern Lights. After the Aurora show we realized that we actually had seen the Northern Lights, although they were faint.

The rest of Perlan gives you a greater appreciation of the nature, history, and wildlife in this wonderful country.",Dec 2019
Iceland,Doates1,Perlan,4.0,"We booked this with the whatâs on tourist board in the city centre for our last day looking for something to fill the day before the northern lights tour at night. It cost approximately Â£ 24 per person and we caught a free shuttle bus from the Harper conference centre which we were pointed too by the tourist board. It a nice place with about 3 floors with shop and cafe with good outdoor views and will keep adults and kids entertained for a good couple of hours. It only about a 10 mins ride from city centre. Planetarium will interactive things to do and the ice cave although small was good.

Iceland,TinaHH123,Perlan,3.0,"In the 10 days we spent in Iceland over Xmas it rained 8 of them!!!! On NYE day we decided to go to Perlan to see the Aurora show, honestly it was boring..... maybe its me but im really not interested on CGI versions of auroras on other planets, then there's the cartoon bit on other nations views on where the aurora comes from and then right at the end you get some breathtaking (but very grainy) photos/videos of the actual auroras. The rest of the museum was Meh too, just seems a bit half hearted, and expensive for what there is. There was no view because it was raining so just clouds. The option was sit in the hotel or go here, but maybe for kids its more interesting, but I honestly don't think I could recommend it, even on a rainy day.

We went to the cafe at the top to warm up first and it was a lovely setting but we were very lucky to get a table as it was crowded. We also enjoyed the planetarium show and ice cave but did feel that the entrance fee was very expensive for what it was.",Oct 2019
Iceland,Geordiegog,Perlan,5.0,"Perlan has a number of exhibits worth seeing. If you have young children then the ice cave and northern light show are a must. The 360 degree view from the roof terrace is a great way to view Reykjavik. 3 hours was enough to see it all. The educational and interactive exhibits are well done and fun. There is everything from geology to troll butter, my favourite biological exhibit. The service bus is worth it too as Perlan is a km from the centre of town.",Jan 2020
Iceland,Siobhan,Perlan,3.0,"So the best bit about this was the ice cave and being able to go on the roof top. The northern lights show was in a different language, so had no idea what they were saying and didn't know if we could watch an English one after. The ""museum"" areas weren't that informative, I would say brilliant for families with children though.",Dec 2019

The northern light planetarium is a 20 minute 3D video (no glasses needed) is all about the northern lights, it was very informative.

The observation deck provides great views over the city and is good to see the sunrise in winter and sunset too.
The main exhibition is great with lots to see and read. The video about the volcanoes and the ice cave were our highlights as well as the puffin wall.

There is a cafe and main restaurant offering views from the top all over the city.
Staff were friendly and helpful.

Iceland,baldandbeautiful666,Perlan,5.0,Read plenty of reviews and to be honest if anyone complains about this venue then they either have a real issue or they need to get out of the house cmore often!! It's a terrific museum/educational/social centre and the icing on the cake is the wonderful cafe (which we tried) and then there is a high standard restaurant which we can only judge by the great lunch in the cafe and it must be good! Even on a pissy wet day the 360 views from the promenade/balcony are terrific. A must if visiting.,Dec 2019
Iceland,peter O,Perlan,5.0,"We lived the museum, northern light show was interesting, ice cave was less impressive, but interesting (we went to the real ice cave after). The best part was the view of the city and restaurant on the top. Of course the story and 13 Santas )))",Nov 2019

Light lunch for 2 with 2 glasses of wine 6000 krona...delicious",Dec 2019
Iceland,BenHarris,Perlan,5.0,"We visited the Perlan when an Arctic storm hit Reykjavik cancelling all the tours we had booked that day. We had a good time there and it was a good indoor activity for the day.

It gives you all sorts of information about the history of Iceland, volcanoes, the northern lights, glaciers, wildlife etc.

The ice cave is a good feature and the planetarium show is worth doing.

Definitely go to the top floors to see the views over Reykjavik. Unfortunately because of the strong winds the viewing balcony was closed, but we sat in the cafe and you can see out through the dome at the top of the building.

Well worth a visit

Iceland,Craig A,Perlan,4.0,"I attended today after using their free shuttle service from down-town (you pay a fee for the bus, then that fee is taken off admission price). The museum is quite good, a lot of information to read and videos to see.The Northern Lights movie (22mins) is quite relaxing and the Ice Cave is unique, you get through this in 10 mins. I deliberately arrived at about 3.30pm to capture the sun setting over the mountains as your have an observation deck on level 4 - it didn't disappoint.
The only disappointing thing about today was that when I went to leave at 6pm, I asked when the next bus would be to go back into town, I was advised the last one was at 5.30pm, no more. The guy behind the counter had the nerve to mention that I should have asked about the bus schedule, however I made the presumption that since the museum is open till 10pm then at least have the bus operation continuing closer to this time. Staff told me people complain about this all the time. Museum - take note!!!

I'm very afraid of heights, but I was able to look out on the ledge and take some great photos. The breathtaking views totally took the fear away (if only temporarily). The views of different parts of the city were absolutely stunning and there were explanations of the different parts of the city as you walked around the rotunda. This is definitely a place not to be missed if you want a real panoramic view of the city in just a short time.",Dec 2019

Really lovely building, Beth informative but not dry in how it delivers so you come out with your knowledge massively increased but not feeling like you have been on a school trip.
Ice cave is very good and cleverly built. Only takes about ten minutes but well worth it.
You also have the option to go to the Aurora show which is auditorium cinematic show but brilliantly put together with the images giving you a 180 degree experience.
On top of this there is a 360 degree viewing gallery of the area and you can see for miles. There is a revolving restaurant which we didnât eat at but the setting is lovely and I imagine itâs lovely for dinner.

The Wonders of Iceland is also great - really interesting features on the volcanic nature of the land and a chilly but fun walk through an artifical ice-cave.

They have a real ice cave which was great and an aurora 8k movie that was great especially if you didnât see the real one on your visit.

Plenty of geological exhibits and great historical take in the island. Letâs you see what the glaciers will be like in a. Few years time and makes you think about climate action.

We got the all in one price that lets you see everything and itâs good value although everything is expensive.

It talks about mythology and the science behind the lights, and finally the lights themselves all projected onto the dome above. Fantastic!",Dec 2019

We went to the planetarium first, which is stunning, shows off various parts of the solar system and northern lights, then after this you follow a path around various other exhibitions. Loads to read and watch, very informative and a good mix of interactive things.

The ice cave is superbly done, and flows nicely with the rest of the exhibitions.

Up top is a cafe which we are told has a revolving floor that slowly goes around the inside of the dome, but sadly it didnât seem to be running when I was there. The level below is an observation deck, you can walk the entire way around the building and get a very nice view over ReykjavÃ­k.

The Northern Lights Planetarium Show is probably the best thing here, it is excellent.
The ice cave is ok but small.
The unless you have a long-range camera your pictures taken from the roof of the building just end up with pictures of the roof below in it.
If you want pictures Reykjavik go to Hallgrimskirkja church and go up the tower. Its far better.",Nov 2019
Iceland,jollys99,Perlan,5.0,"We visited Reykjavik for 3 nights in late November and had pre-booked the Wonders of Iceland and Planetarium tour on the Perlan website prior to our visit.
We got the free shuttle bus to Perlan from Harpa Concert Hall and when we arrived took in the views from the top floor observatory deck which were amazing. We were fortunate to have a lovely sunset which made the views over Reykjavik even more spectacular.
There is a cafe bar on the top floor and we enjoyed a coffee and a happy hour drink taking in the views through the glass dome.
The museum is really interesting and informative and we enjoyed our visit to the Wonders of Iceland, Ice Cave and Planetarium.
The information is well presented and makes for an interesting visit with several interactive displays.
We missed the last shuttle bus back into the centre but this did not matter as you can catch a public bus number 18 - the bus stop is only a short walk from the museum.
Overall I would definitely recommend a visit to this museum.

The viewing platform would work well on a clear non raining day (not something we had). The rest of it was ok, just never worth the money. Yes pay for the viewing platform, weather permitting...maybe, or just enjoy an expensive hot chocolate that actually was delicious, shame it was only luke warm",Dec 2019
Iceland,Nirav S,Perlan,4.0,Really nice setting up on a hill - great history of the geologic formation of Iceland all the way through modern human era. The Arora show was short but provided great aerial footage of the country. You could easily spend a few hours here especially if the weather outside is not cooperating.,Nov 2019
Iceland,Jarko2015,Perlan,4.0,"A bit expensive, what used to be Reykjavik's hot water silos, Perlan nonetheless offers great views from the viewing platform that takes in all of Reykjavik in a 360 degree span. Most folks come here as part of a city tour, but it's a close enough walk from the city centre (albeit up a fairly sharp incline) to get here on foot. The combo entrance ticket is very pricey, but if you just want the viewing platform and none of the other attractions, make sure you make that clear at the ticket office. Definitely the best views in the city.",Nov 2019
Iceland,Hoppityskip,Perlan,5.0,"Visited this week and was so impressed with the experience
What a fabulous museum, with the added extras of the ice cave and the planetarium too.
Well worth the visit, choose the total experience and commit hours to it
Go to the observation level to see the sunset, totally amazing",Nov 2019
Iceland,GenoMichiganYooper,Perlan,4.0,"We had a nice tour of the facility, going through a replica of an Ice Cave, and room with a great show about the Northern Lights/Aurora Borealis.

There is a nice are on the top of museum, where you can go outside, and walk the deck surrounding the building.

There is also a large bar/dining area on the top of this building, lots of table chairs, a machine for your credit cards, a gift shop, and nice clean restrooms.

Not too far from downtown, worth the short side trip.

Iceland,Mina P,Perlan,5.0,"Like many other Museums, it has a lot of information regarding Nature in general. The great difference is the way this information is presented.
Serious scientific material together with fun. Whatever your interests are, you'll be surprised by the exhibits. Children will be overwhelmed walking around the different halls and choose what they want to watch at the LÃ trabjarg Cliff Replica or underwater journey of interactive experience, etc.
I can imagine the number of people working for many years to produce this wonder of a Museum. I bow to their efforts. my life! Moving very quickly from Arora to the next show I left
The Planetarium, Arora, is surely the highlight of the Museum and then itâs the real man-made Ice Cave, first of its kind in the world: 100 m long, built with over 350 tons of snow from the Blue Mountains! The Observation deck on 4th floor offers stunning views over Reykjavik, weather permitting and the Coffee Shop below it, perfect for a coffee break enjoying the same view.
Located on a hill, Perlan is away from the city centre. But there is a free shuttle bus starting from Harpa Concert Hall. Just check the timetable.
All the staff of the Museum very polite and ready to help you. But I must express my sincere gratitude to one young lady (I don't know her name) who picked my rucksack up from the seat where I stupidly left it and returned it to me at the reception desk. Once again. Thank you very much, beautiful young lady!

The planetarium show was our only views of the Northern Lights during our visit so we were glad to see the show.

The bird wall is interesting and the best part for me was the walk through glacier. Was nice for photo ops.

We went to the viewing platform and it was windy and freezing but lovely views. We also stopped by the cafe which again has lovely views. Wish we could have had time to have dinner there as Iâm sure itâs beautiful at night.

Iceland,David S,Perlan,5.0,"We stopped off at Perlan on the way from the airport to the Golden Triangle where we were staying. Having two very small children (3 and 2) we were limited as to what we could do in Reykjavik, and this seemed like a good compromise.

It's a really great exhibition, lots to see and interact with, don't forget your coat for the Ice Cave (-10deg! and you feel it). The bird wall has augmented reality binoculars so when you look up at the wall you can see birds flying around, some cgi some real footage, quite well done.

There's also a really good viewing platform so you get great views of the city and surrounds and the cafe has the same views.

There are lots of museums in Reykjavik, but if you are pushed for time and have small kids then I highly recommend.

The one thing to be aware of is the last shuttle bus leaves at 5.30pm which as Perlman doesnât close until 10pm was a surprise as we made the mistake of not checking early enough and had just missed it.

I was happy to know the Perlan closes late, so I arrived just in time a visit to the internal Glacier, the exhibitions (with an amazing museography), and a late session at the Planetarium, where an incredible film about the Auroras had me almost in tears. Yet, the final part was the best: Right after the film, I went to the upper terrace, to witness the sunset and the magnificent Auroras live, right above me.

They have a family pass fro 4 that was reasonable and we were able to see a movie in the planetarium that explained all about the Northern Lights. Additionally, there is a simulated glacier that you can walk thru (they have jackets if you need one so don't worry) that has different tunnels with in it. It was a fun thing to do with our teenagers. There is also a higher viewing point that you can see out and maps to point out what you are looking at. In the end I think this was worth the money. Also check out the Geothermal Beach right near here.

The main historical presentation of how the island came to be created, and subsequently inhabited, was fascinating and really well presented. Thereafter, however, things were less arresting. The Ice Cave is just a gimmick really, and the presentation in the planetarium of the Aurora was childish and simplistic I thought - a real wasted opportunity. The restaurant on the top floor, however, was lovely. Expensive (like everything in Iceland) but good quality and offering a stunning view across this charming city.

Free entrance but you have to pay if you want to go in the ice cave, watch the Northern lights show, walk outside for look-out & see the museum. On top floor is a nice restaurant, good view of the city as well. We had frappe & cappuccino. Price was from 7 to 12 Canadian dollars, depending on what you want to buy of course. The Ice cave was awesome! -10 degrees centigrade inside. They have coats if you don't have one. The Aurora show was mesmerizing! The walk outside of the building was cool but watch for your hats! So windy outside! You get to see the panoramic view of the city. 360 degrees. I'll say, don't miss it! It's one of the must place to see! We there there this month. October 2019.

There is also a ice cave which is great for younger children. Is is also quite big so isnât too claustrophobic. âï¸

There is also a gift shop which is a little expensive and a observation deck which offers you a really great view of the capital city. ð

On the top floor is a vegan friendly cafe which we really appreciated which offers a clear menu and good selection of food and drinks. However I would try to get rid of your plastic spoons in the future to be more environmentally friendly ð±

Iceland,MarkN7453,Perlan,5.0,"We spent about 3 hours here. We liked it all, and appreciated the variety. There is a nice 360 degree view of the area. The four cylinders that make up the museum used to be insulated tanks holding geothermal water for the city. The ice cave is artificial, but gives you a feeling of what inside a glacier would be like. They have extra jackets, as it is -15* C (+5* F) inside. My wife liked the narrator to the aurora borealis show, I did not, but the visuals were good. I'd rather see the real lights, but it was cloudy each night we were there. The exhibits on water, marine life, birds, whales, and more were all good.

Probably not something we would return to again for the money, but definitely lets one understand more about Iceland, why the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, why so many whales, and so many waterfalls. It also has some great visuals on climate change and the disappearance of the glaciers.

Service was very friendly and helpful. Our group watched the Aurora show, which was very interesting (we had seen the Northern Lights the previous night). The Ice Cave was very cool (literally!) and quite unique. The museum itself was most impressive and had some very modern, hands-on, interactive exhibits that I have never seen at any other museums. Our group of adults loved it and we learned a lot about Iceland's land, animals, and history.
We stopped at the restaurant for a late lunch and had a delicious meal. The view was spectacular! We enjoyed our delicious soups, burgers, fries and desserts and spent some time on the observation deck. We had wonderful weather and spent quite a bit of time walking around, learning about the lava samples, and taking photos of the beautiful city of Reykjavik below.
We spent a lovely afternoon here and I highly suggest spending a few hours here for any and all other museum and science lovers.

They run free shuttles from some spots ( BUT only if you have already bought your museum tickets online) . AND the shuttles stop in the evening at least 3 hours before the museum closes.... so plan your visit timing accordingly .

Iceland,Alan1608,Perlan,4.0,"One of things on our list of things to do in Iceland was to see the Northern Lights. Unfortunately while we were there it was very cloudy and rainy. We heard about the Purlan museum and their planetarium show including the Northern Lights and decided if we couldnât see the real thing we would try this. This museum is a must see when you visit ReykjavÃ­k. Not only was it our only opportunity to see the Northern Lights, we also saw their virtual aquarium which was very cool. Speaking of cool they have an ice cave replica made of real ice and you get to walk through it, so bundle up. This is a great museum for kids of all ages, with lots of interactive exhibits about Iceland, global warming and itâs effects on the glaciers in the region. Stop action photography shows the receding glaciers. The only downside to this museum is the location, which cost us about $18 by TAXI to get to. They do have a free shuttle that picks up and drops off at the Harpa concert hall, but we were on a tight schedule.

Iceland,Ems,Perlan,3.0,"Ok I KNOW Iceland is expensive, but at around Â£30 for entry here, I don't think it was justifiable. The ice cave is interesting and unqiue, but the northern lights show in the planetariaum was average, as were the other things to read on Iceland's nature. The viewing platform is ok (you can just pay to go into that).
There's a free shuttle from downtown to and from Perlan, but it's only hourly, and it stops hours before Perlan actually closes (useful that it's open a bit later though), so I paid for a public bus one way as it's probably a bit too far to walk if you don't know the city and are short on time.

It was Interesting dealing with the hotel and restaurant staff, a mix of Icelanders and other young Europeans.

Iceland,jcumiami,Ring Road,5.0,"Just came back from trip to Iceland. Started at Blue Lagoon (it was great and lots of fun), to ReykjavÃ­k for 3 days and then counterclockwise on the the Ring Road.

We detoured for one night in Arnarstapi to see sights in the SnÃ¦fellsnes peninsula (amazing).

The Ring Road is easy driving as long as you keep eyes on road with some easy switchbacks or no super steep mountain passes. Having said that, most of the time there are no guard rails, the road tends to be up above 8-12 feet above ground (we saw two cars and an 18-wheeler that gone off the side) and as long as you donât hit a snow storm - which we did.

Drove for 1.5 hours in heavy snow, sometimes losing control of the car. Needless to say, drove very slow. Halfway into it, plows were clearing one side of the road so we were driving on the cleared opposite side until we saw cars coming our way, moved over and continued.

I am from Miami and not used to mountain driving and I did fine.

The Ring Road takes you through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen: lava fields covered in moss, fjords, mountains, valleys - endless views. I would do it again in a heart beat.

Hope this helps anyone planning. Iâll be glad to share more info.

Iceland,iwtbab,Ring Road,4.0,"If you plan to take a ring road tour, I recommend that you go with Arctic Adventures instead of Gadventures(G). G uses Arctic Adventures to run their tours in Iceland. Arctic Advenutures own tours are cheaper & better. The Best of Iceland 7-day tour from Gadventures is actually 5 days of touring. In contrast, the 6-day Around Iceland Adventure from Arctic Adventures(A) gives you full 6 days of guided touring, goes to more places, includes the glacial hike in the price and is cheaper (even accounting for 2 extra nights of lodging from Gadventures). There are two things that G tour has but A does not have is Bogarfjorour and Solheimar Ecovillage. To go to Bogarfjorour(B) means a detour with poor roads and it adds little to the trip. B is for seeing puffins & hiking. Puffins are gone after mid-August. Among the 100-110 Solheimar residents, only 45 are disabled. They get social benefits from the government. This type of visit is not the same as supporting a place in a 3rd world country. In my opinion these two items make the G tour even less appealing than the A tour.

Iceland,3booths,Ring Road,5.0,"We drove counter-clockwise starting from the Golden Circle sites. Many travelers only head to these places so they are more populated. Once you start driving east, the crowds diminish significantly.

Do the math and figure out if you want to rent from the airport or from places near Reykjavik. We had a car service to/from and rented from Enterprise near the cruise ship terminal. I cannot imagine driving or parking in the downtown area.

Our car rental included a wi-fi hotspot - this was helpful for making phone calls.

The Lonely Planet publishes a guide that goes counter-clockwise. This is an excellent resource and we highly recommend.

Plan your hotels/camp spots in advance, you will be grateful that you did.

Watch your gas tank. There are long stretches with no services available, especially on the east coast.

The N1, Olis and other stations have basic hot food (hot dogs, burgers, soup, ice cream) at reasonable prices. Plan ahead if you expect to want food/alcohol. The ""Vinbudin"" stores that sell beer/wine close at 6 pm (1800). When we were staying at Myvatn, the closest one was in Husavik (50 mins away).

Similarly, stop for food supplies at Bonus or other grocery stores to save money. They close around 6:00 as well. We did bring some snacks from home. You can buy fruit pretty much everywhere.

Our hotel restaurants were on the pricier side - often the only option there was a full dinner. That's not always what you need - but in many cases may be the only option available. Again, plan ahead on this.

Oh - and don't expect ice or microwaves.

Many places sell outerwear basics but they are pricier than bringing your own. Don't forget hat, gloves, sunglasses, binoculars.

This is a well maintained two-lane road (you know that) that regularly goes to one lane on bridges. Minimal (if any) shoulder. We saw 1-2 police cars in 8 days. Other than Reykjavik and Akureyri, there was only 1 stoplight.

Use Google maps instead of GPS. Know where your hotels/restaurants/sites are - although there are signs, you often cannot ""see"" the building where you are heading (example - turned off for restaurant; drove up the road, saw farmhouse, then tractor barn --- the restaurant was next to the barn).

There are sheep everywhere and can be a hazard in the darkness.

There is a tunnel near Akureyri that requires a toll be paid within 3 hours of exiting - no attendants there. You pay the toll online. This is not difficult.

Our trip was Sunday-Sunday. We felt we had time to see just about everything. We also were lucky to have good weather for much of the trip.

Iceland,Sarah S,Ring Road,5.0,"There is plenty of advice on trip advisor on where to go and what to do in Iceland but I thought travelers might find it helpful to hear how we planned our two week road trip. We've been to Reykavik before, but this was amazing and I would highly recommend it, but you need to plan to make the most of it. We hired a camper van and it fit our needs perfectly. We could do what we wanted when we wanted and we were not tied to hotel bookings. Campsites are generally good. We bought an Iceland Camping Card (E150) which allows you to camp in multiple campsites around the ring road and saved loads of money. No need to book ahead, just turn up and park. It was perfect. The ring road is absolutely fine to drive on, but you need to take it steady if you want to look after your motorhome!

Day 1 - Arrived at 15:30 in Keflavik airport. Short 10 minute shuttle to Camper Iceland to pick up the camper van (see separate review), then to Bonus Supermarket for a quick essential shop (Supermarkets close at 18:00-19:00) and we camped at Vogar for the night.

Day 2 - Proper food shop then on to the Golden Circle - Stayed at Skjol campsite which sells fantastic pizza!

Day 3 - Fludir Secret Lagoon (Gamla Laugin). Lovely thermal lagoon to bath in. First one of four we did on our trip! Stocked up on food and fuel at Selfoss then on to the Lava volcano and Earthquake centre. Stayed at Langbrok campsite which was probably the worst one we stayed at, but ok for a night.

Day 4 - Waterfalls today - Skogafoss, Seljalandsfoss then on to the rock formations at Reynisfjara/Dyrholaey. Stayed at Kleifar-Mork. Basic site, but has a pretty waterfall.

Day 5 - Long driving day but WOW! Vatnajokull National Park - Svartifoss falls, Then on to Jokulsarlon Lagoon to see Icebergs breaking off the glacier. We took a rib boat trip out to the glacier with Ice Lagoon. Brilliant. Over the road is Diamond Beach - so pretty. Then 30 minutes further on the ring road to a hot-pot at Hoffellsjokull Glacier. Great! No camping card sites here so paid Â£32 to stay at Hofn. Refuel and food shop.

Day 6 - Another long drive day - the scenery is amazing, glaciers/waterfalls at every turn. Stopped at Djupivogur - a few gift shops but not much else. On the long drive we spotted a hot pot at the side of the road! Pulled over and jumped in! Stayed at Reydarfjorder campsite which was lovely.

Day 7 - Egilsstadir - Food shop and fuel. Then on to Vok Baths. Only just opened and beautiful thermal spa on a lake. (Better than Myvatn). Waterfalls at Selfoss and Dettifoss. no camping card sites so campsite at Myvatn (Bjarg) very expensive at Â£50, but beautiful views of the lake.

Day 8 - Volcanic day! Spent the day visiting all the volcanic sites in the Krafla area. Amazing. (Viti, Hverir, Leirhnjukar) then had a soak in Myvatn Thermal Spa. We've been to blue lagoon before, so tried this one this time and it wasn't as good - but its much cheaper. We preferred Vok Baths which was about the same price as Myvatn. Stayed at Heidarbaer campsite.

Day 9 - On to Husavik for whale watching! WOW. Lots of companies do whale watching here but we went on a RIB with Husavik Adventures and they were brilliant. Watched 3 humpback whales for an hour! Beautiful sunny day so ate outside at a restaurant in Husavik, then on to Godafoss Waterfall. Travelled to Akureyri and stayed at Lonsa campsite just north of the town.

Day 10 - Shopping in Akureyri in the morning (OK, but not great), filled up on fuel and food then on to Varmahlid for White Water Rafting with Viking Rafting. Again, an amazing experience! Booked a meal there - the food is great! Stayed at Hvammstangi - great campsite.

Day 11 - Swimming pool at Hvammstangi which had hot tubs, then on to the Seal Centre. You can go on trips to do seal watching, but we choose not to and pushed on to Varmaland campsite.

Day 12 - Borgarnes - Settlement Centre Museum was brilliant insight in to the Vikings settling Iceland. We then spent the afternoon on a hike to Glymur Waterfall which was challenging. Needed a shower so chose to drive to Vogar campsite south of Reykavik (after a Dominos Pizza at Mosfellbaer Â£60 for four adults) as we knew it had good facilities. (Not all campsites have showers - you go to the swimming pools)

Day 13 - Reykavik - we've been before in winter but it was nice to go on a hot day! Ice-creams and T-shirts! Gift shopping then on to the Perlan Centre. You can easily park a motorhome at the University of Iceland. Free and only 10-15 mins walk to the cathedral which you can see from the car park. Also short drive to the Perlan Centre from there which was great. Stayed at Vogar again!

Day 14 - No rush to get off the campsites in Iceland. Spent the morning packing, cleaning the van, refueling and then returned the motorhome to Camper Iceland. Booked a night at the Nordic Guest House (same building as Camper Iceland) so we could just unload straight in to our room. Great! Went shopping for food for the journey home/ate in a local restaurant etc.

Day 15 - Shuttle to airport - Home!

Iceland is expensive so to help you plan, we spent Â£363.44 on food at supermarkets for 4 adults for two weeks. We took what we could in our suitcases to keep costs down. Bonus and Kronan are cheapest. You just need to check the price as you shop and adjust where you can. We ate well. We had four meals out, spending Â£359.81 (again 4 adults eating).

We travelled 2040 kilometres and spent Â£329.43 on fuel. We had a large 6 bed diesel camper so fuel costs will be lower for smaller vehicles.

The best guide book I bought was the Lonely Planet's Ring Road guide. Take a good road map too, our sat-nav did not recognize some of the locations and a map helps you plan.

Enjoy your trip! It's amazing and we will go back to do the Snaefellness Peninsula and the Western Fjords next time as we didn't have time this holiday!

Iceland,Wecke,Ring Road,5.0,"Just completed Ring Road trip in 7 days, including visit to central Iceland high land area. This schedule was tight, but still doable, however I would recommend to use few more days for the trip as there is so much to see. You also need to plan your trip carefully beforehand as you need to sleep in little villages and there might be limited amount of sleeping facilities or guided tours available. Planning is also needed to spot all interesting sights around the trip and especially in the north part of the Iceland, many places are missing from the TripAdvisor. Also some places are dislocated (pinned to wrong place) in TripAdvisor, so it might be tricky to find if only TA is used for navigation.",Jul 2019
Iceland,Elena,Ring Road,5.0,"We visited Iceland in June and easily did the ring road in 8 whole days! We stayed at another town every night and it was all worth it! I think itâs the best way to really experience Iceland and to get to see beaches and waterfalls that are not filled with tourists! The south side was my favorite but I have to admit that on the north side I felt like we were the only tourists, it made me feel local:)",Jun 2019
Iceland,HotEarth,Ring Road,5.0,"We did the Ring Road trip over 10 days and 9 nights (if you can call it night) between May and June! We picked up a rental 2WD car at KEF and started this excursion following mostly the Ring Road in an anti-clockwise direction. We had no plans and did not do any off road driving, hence there was no need for a 4WD.

What an amazing and wonderful country! Magnificient falls, surreal landscapes, beautiful snow capped mountains and coastlines, glaciers, hot springs, geysirs, lava fields, lagoons, diamond beach, quaint small towns and villages etc in this land of ice and fires!

Our journey was during the shoulder period. And yet there are already quite some tourists. There is long hours of daylight and even from 11 pm to 3 am the sky remains relatively bright!

Driving was quite easy for most of it and even when it snows. The only exception was the drive along Route 862 between Dettifoss to VatnajÃ¶kull National Park, where it was extremely treacherous on the narrow gravel road because of the heavy snowfall then.

This country certainly is out of this world and experiencing the beauty of it just through the Ring Road made it lives up to its reputation!

We drove in a Nissan X-Trial in comfort. Satarted from Revkjavik to Western than to North round trip to Eastern and Southern back to Revkjavik in 9 days. We got to see and feel and engaged with the country's landscape and geological transformation from volcanic activities millions of years ago, picturesque villages, farm land, glaciers, icebergs, beaches and the beautiful coast lines, geothermal fields and geysers, waterfalls, lava fields etc all extra ordinary spectacular sights. We stayed at great hotels with beautiful scenery and ambience and comfortable. We ate good local foods and seafoods and enjoyed every bit. We even had a open air bath under 1 degree C in geothermal bath an magnificient experience and joy of doing something different. It was a great family holidays and our 6+ years old granddaughter and all of us enjoyed the tour of Iceland..cheers.

Iceland,Eug,Ring Road,5.0,"If you planing to spend a week+ in Iceland. You must do Ring Road. Beautiful view around every corner. We did it in a week, but it's a bit of a stretch. Allow 10 days to do it in the normal pace with most POIs. We rented car with a local company Lagoon Rental and had no problem with pickup and return. We stayed in cabins and small hotels along the road and it was nice a fun. Make sure you plan ahead and have good GPS (google maps did good for us). Skip the tool tunnel around Akuery, it will take you 15 longer, but the road around is beautiful and worth 15 min detour (also will save you money on tolls and car rentals fee).",Apr 2019
Iceland,Yummyfoodie1,Ring Road,5.0,"The ring road and most of the main roads to tourist attractions are well maintained. Yes, a few potholes but considering the hammering the roads take from the severe and extreme weather conditions, these roads are great. Snow of about 3-4 inches fell overnight and the roads were cleared early in the morning, even on top of the mountains. Safe to travel as long as you drive sensibly. Just beware of some idiots on the road. One Chinese-looking lady tourist coming the other way insisted on driving in the middle of the road and almost caused a head on collision. Stupid woman, what was she thinking?

Iceland,GRJ_11,Ring Road,4.0,Almost everywhere you need to get to in Iceland involves using the ring road.

Iceland,Mary Jo H,Ring Road,5.0,"My husband and I plus 2 teenage grandsons toured Iceland on the Ring Road in early August. The varying topography was fascinating. Everything glaciers, volcanic black sand beaches, waterfalls, hot springs, and mud bubbling out of the ground kept our rapt attention.",Aug 2018
Iceland,Joseph,Ring Road,5.0,"It was great to do Ring Road while I was in Iceland. Iâd suggest not to drive if you have no experience in Icelandic winter especially if you were rented a campervan. I myself have no experience in driving on icy road and strong wind not to say that campervan is very vulnerable to WIND! Ring road is pretty easy to drive on while thereâs no wind, no snow, no ice and no storm but not when thereâs one of the mentioned conditions. The wind was so strong that I almost got blown off the cliff (no hyperbole) especially there is little or no rail on the east coast. Please check the weather and road condition before youâre on the road to your destination. Donât risk your life in seeing the beauty of the Mother Nature, itâs not worth it.
Moreover, if you insist to rent a campervan please do not rent with CampEasy. They will rip you off when you cause a small damage on the car. Well, to be fair to the staff who is working there, he was very good and polite. Iâve no problem with the staff. But not when I returned my campervan with a small dent and cracked taillight due to the narrow street in ReykjavÃ­k city, I have to pay 300,000ISK which is equivalent to ~â¬2300. I understand that Iâve to pay that much if I cause any damage on the car and I was told that they will reimburse me with the extra that I have paid (if any)after they have it fixed. I received an email from them an hour ago saying that they will not reimburse me. I couldnât believe that it cost â¬2300 for a small dent. I could fix it with less than â¬1000. As a reminder, please buy a full protection and ask for all the details what is covered and whatâs not. They sent me an invoice with no CDW and theft insurance on it which is ridiculous cause I was told that it is covered with these two insurances. Iâm still waiting for their reply!

Be aware that there are many narrow single lane bridges and stretches of gravel road on the journey down to Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon.
Also, sheep can be found wandering in the road so watch your speed.
Gas stations are few and far between so fill up whenever you can.",Oct 2018

Iceland,Patricia L,Ring Road,5.0,"The Ring Road goes clockwise from Reykjavik to Akureyri, Hofn and back to Reykjavik. It is paved, though not for the feint of heart. and hits most of the major highlights. Iceland may in fact be the land that gave birth to giants, ogres, trolls and wee people. Very Tolkienesque! Everyone and everywhere along the route is used to serving tourists and nearly everyone speaks English exceptionally well. We had an incredible trip and loved it. If you go, get off the Ring Road and visit the Western fjords - Worth the experience! Oh, and go off season Mid Sept - Mid May. I would not want to be there in the summer. Too many visitors & cruise ships!.

Iceland,Myclare,Ring Road,5.0,"Driving half the ring road was just perfect for us - not too far, too many hours to drive every day, time to enjoy the trip - not a chore to ""do the ring road"". We had one week in Iceland and chose to spend 2 nights in Reyjavik - that's enough but it was nice to do and get a feel of the capital - we would spend that time again. Must say you could spend a few more days if you were so inclined but with one week, this was a good divide.
We then chose to fly to Akeyuri (Icelands second largest city) and quite an inexpensive flight (and most certainly cheaper than fuel), hire a car and drive on clockwise to Myvatyn. This was an easy option just a few hours.
We got there so ""early"" we decided to have lunch at our accommodation (Vogafoss farm - fabulous food - had breakfast, lunch and dinner - all excellent) and then head out to visit the geysir area and dettifoss before checking in officially. A good move and gave us extra hours the next day. We did not visit the Myvatyn baths as TA advises they are quite confected - decided on a nap after an early set off in Reyjavik.
Day two - we drove to Seydisfjordur - a wonderful little town (must do - but could be ordinary if weather is ordinary) - loved it we drove in over the mountain range from Eglistaddir in massive sunshine and the whole town was out celebrating - they don't get too many days like this. Loved our picinic lunch at the many public tables available (there is a supermarket there, not sure what they stock, we had our lunch bought in Eglistaddir where we bought fuel) - Good cafe - ""Salt"" - coffee, lunch, bathroom - excellent. Accommodation at The Bank (Aldan Hotel) - super overpriced for what is on offer but clean, OK for one night, ate at the restaurant - fine, not excellent but not a lot of choices. Their breakfast included in the tariff was good.
Day Three - onto Hoffn - we drove the coast road and got a full on rainy day - such a shame as the scenery would have been outstanding we feel. All the beat up of Hoffn is just that - a beat up - we stayed at Hotel Hofn - very tour bus orientated, clean, large, no vibe, fine for one night. Breakfast was poor. We did have lobster dinner at Pakhuus - we very much enjoyed it, expensive but worth it. Good supermarket here.
Day four - to Vik - stayed at Black Beach Suites - again expensive but worth it, new, lovely view - we cooked in for a change - great supermarket in Vik, if you are looking for a 2 day stop - make it here.
Day five - Gullfoss - stayed at Hotel Gullfoss - staff ordinary, rooms clean and roomy enough, motel like, 2 standards here , new/old - luckily we got new. The big win for this hotel is the location - enables an early morning visit to the falls - we thought these falls best of whole trip, with few people in attendance before the tour buses arrive from Reyjavik as day tours - evening meal disgusting and super expensive, but not sure what you can do about this.
In summary we were very happy with our choice of route, and our choices of stops. We would like to add if you have a bit of adventure or have more time than we did to do homework, or have more information from TA than we did, we would encourage you to do some of these stops at farmstays - we would have if we had known about them.
Farmstays are EVERYWHERE and OFTEN and many of the farms are HUGE enterprises but maybe a bit out of the towns (not that they are so big) - apparently many offer dinner bed and breakfast. If we were ever to do this again, we would certainly do a few of these along the way. In some ways we are disappointed not to have experienced this (and they may [or may not] be a cheaper stay option).
Would also like to add - driving this road in 2nd week August - easy, safe, barely any traffic, ignore any other commentary, don't panic, don't need a 4wd, dont need waterproof shoes, etc, etc - too many negatives around for this trip at this time of year at leat.

Iceland,Rick M,Ring Road,5.0,"We spent two weeks in a camper van traveling the ring road and visiting all sorts of places. Waterfalls, Fjords, Snowfields and Glaciers, Historic sites, Museums, Pubs, and the most consistently amazing scenery we've ever seen! The sites within an easy day from Reykjavik were packed with tourists. We went during the ""off-season"" but those sites were still full of tourists from all over the world. Once we got past those areas, or headed off on 4-wheel drive roads we dropped 90% of the people. We spent a month traveling via camper van in New Zealand last year and thought that place was beautiful.... Iceland blew it away. Incredible areas, some of the most dramatic landscapes and scenery we've ever seen. So many waterfalls they actually became a bit mundane! The ring road is a must. Each part of the country is unique in the geography, land use, and scenery and those differences can only be appreciated by traveling the entire country. Plan to take your time.

Iceland,Isaiah P,Ring Road,5.0,"While researching about my upcoming trip to Iceland there were altering opinions about whether or not to drive the ring road. Most of them said the ring road was a waste of time and you should just highlight certain area of Iceland. If you have less than 7 days I would agree. We spent 10 days in a campervan and we drove the ring road, and added in the WestFjords, and had plenty of time to see what we wanted. We even spent one day going to the island of Grimsey in the north and time on side tracked roads and alternate routes. There is so much to see in the vastly changing landscape of Iceland that this is the only way to truly experience it for yourself. If you chose to spend your time driving across the south part of the country and then backtrack to the west you could almost drive the rest of the loop without missing any time thus seeing new areas of the country. In my opinion, with more than 7 days, this is a must do.

All the accommodation, mainly guesthouses, were all immaculate and extremely comfortable. Would recommend this drive to anyone.",Aug 2018
Iceland,Lyndy B,Ring Road,5.0,"The road is scenic and easy to travel. There are numerous rest areas with good food, coffee, drinks and free restrooms at convenient stopping intervals. The road is paved (good condition) and frequently being updated and repaired due to damage caused by large vehicles with state mandated snow tires during the winter months. It is one lane in each direction but never that busy, except for the few large towns. I never experienced any real traffic. Watch your speed - the locals all drive the limit and not any faster. Tourists tend to travel faster and can occasionally be seen pulled over by the relatively few patrol cars that are out enforcing the speeds. There are places to pull over and take photos but you have to pay attention to staying in your lane as there really is no shoulder to drive onto. some bridges are one lane only, so be careful and courteous and you will have no trouble.

We did not feel rushed and saw pretty much everything on our list and more. The landscape is just beautiful. We would not have changed a thing. We will have to come back to see the West Fjords.

Iceland,David K,Ring Road,5.0,"My wife and I spent 8 days in Iceland in mid-September. We drove the Ring Road (Highway 1). I was a bit apprehensive about the east side of Iceland given the fact some of the road is gravel. In the end there was only a short stretch between Lindarbrekka and Hvannabrekka (about 8-10 miles) that was gravel. And they are in the process of building a bridge over the end of the fjord that will eliminate that stretch of gravel. Last fall Highway 1 was rerouted at Breiddalsvik to Highway 96 and 92 all the way to Egilsstadir.So most of the road is paved and in really good condition. Also, the toll tunnel north of Reykjavik (Halfjordur) under the fjord becomes free next month. They are eliminating the toll since the tunnel is now paid off. The toll was only 1,000 Kr. but that means there will be no tolls on the Ring Road.

I really enjoyed driving the Ring Road. The scenery is gorgeous throughout the country. Gas stations are easy to find. We enjoyed stopping at some of the churches along the road on individual farms. We encountered a sheep roundup while driving which was sort of interesting as the sheep ran towards our car. Can't wait to go back and explore more of the island.

Iceland,Sarah S,Ring Road,5.0,"We booked flights to Iceland for July 2019 - that was the easy part! Having been to Iceland before in the winter, we knew we wanted to do the ring road in summer but hadn't really thought how to do it on a budget. We considered lots of options including hiring a car and staying in hotels but it worked out very expensive as some places have limited availability. We then looked at hostels, but with a family, and it being our main holiday, I just didn't fancy communal living. Also didn't fancy living out of our suitcases, moving on every day, pack-unpack-pack etc. It also proved quite difficult to plan out where we would stay and when - what if you wanted to stay somewhere a bit longer??? So, in the end we plumped for motorhome hire which gives us the flexibility to go wherever we want, whenever we want with all our things with us, no packing and unpacking luggage! We can also take our own food which should save some money. Spent hours researching which company to go with and in the end went with campericeland.is. Easy to use website, located a few miles from the airport, so no transfers to Reykavik, aiport shuttle service, reasonably priced guesthouse available if you have a later arrival or early departure and you can leave your suitcases with them so they don't clutter up the motor home. Camper Iceland were very helpful with the booking process too. Called us at home when we asked for help with the insurance. In the end we went for the premium cover and then took out excess insurance with worldwideinsure which plugged the gap with the gravel cover. Camper Iceland seemed to be good value and we took advantage of their early bird booking offer. Very helpful company and I hope that we have a good experience when we get there in July next year.!

Iceland,Gould S,Ring Road,5.0,"We are 70 and had a little trepidation about driving the ring road the end of October. The weather was wonderful, the road was well maintained and marked. There are ample petrol stations if you keep your fuel level up. Make sure you have a pin for your credit card( it took me over 2 weeks to get mine, so plan ahead before you leave home). Everyone uses a credit card w/ pin on the road; it is quick, efficient and convenient. Traveling the ring allows you to see a beautiful country, many, many waterfalls, quaint working farms tucked up against the mountains, water everywhere, myriad displays of lava and the associated ancient moss, sheep and horse farms, glaciers, and many miles without meeting another car on the road. The water tastes wonderful, just refill with tap water. You will experience diverse, unforgettable landscapes and weather during this wonderful experience. Iceland is so more than the golden circle, Reykjavik and the Blue Lagoon (definitely visit these though), but the countryside is unforgettable. October is a great time to visit - whales and the Aurora on the same day.

Iceland,Rocinante,Ring Road,4.0,"I rented a car and drove around Iceland counterclockwise for two weeks. I had an amazing time, but given the cost of the car rental and the gas, I recommend a different tour. A tank of gas for a tiny car can cost $100.

The stretch of road from Hofn to Myvatn and then from Myvatn to the Westfjords are what I'd leave out. Myvatn is cool, but not worth the 3 days or so to get there, explore and leave. I was so exhausted from the driving I didn't really enjoy it once I got there. If possible, I'd use a combination of rental cars and flights to visit the coast from Reykyavik to Hofn,and then the scenic Westfjords and Snaefellnes. Stay at farms on Airbnb, where you save money, the locals can give you advice and you might get to play with their pets (one had an Arctic fox). If possible, change your itinerary for the weather. The best part of Iceland for me was the bright colors, which are dampened in cloudy or rainy weather.

Definitely go hiking in Landmannalaugar and kayaking in Jokulsarlorn - best hiking and kayaking I've ever done in terms of scenery. I'm not as sure about snorkeling in Silfra or snowmobiling into a glacier - both were really cool but also really expensive. There are also some great waterfalls and hikes not quite on the Ring Road, but they looked enticing. The promotional videos on the plane over show some of them.

If you get the chance, finish this 4-5 day trek. You will see some of the most incredible landscape on the planet. We parked our car in Hella, took a bus to Landmannalaugar (didn't need a reservation, just got the first bus), and then again, when we arrived in Thorsmork, we took the bus back to Hella and our car. It was very smooth. The bus ride alone is amazing. You feel like you are on Mars. Without doing this trek, we would have had a very different view of Iceland. You really must get in the mountains.

Iceland,wal-26,Ring Road,5.0,"We enjoyed driving the ring road, and stopping off for hikes and sleeping. We drove in a camper van which fit the 5 of us. It meant we did not have to book accomodations in advance. We travelled for 8 nights, which was fine for the ring road, and which did not include our time in Reykjavic. We skipped the Golden Circle and Blue Lagoon, because our time was short and we wanted to make it to the West Fjords. West Fjords was a stretch on time for us but it was worth it to be with the puffins!. 12 nights would have been better with including west fjords, so we had 2 very late night driving. this is a great family trip, highly recommend. THere is photo speed limits, so make sure you stay under the limit. The tunnel on way to Reyjkavic, travelling counter-clockwise, went from 90 to 70 quickly, so be careful. If you have already booked your Iceland trip for August, have a wonderful time. If you haven't booked, then it might be best to wait for next summer because this summer is record high rainfall for Iceland

Iceland,Peru201193,Ring Road,5.0,"This is the ultimate way to visit Iceland. Do budget enough time

Cars:
*Avis/Budget and Hertz has a counter at airport arrival lobby, convenient
*Do not buy any car insurance online, they do not provide the same coverage as car rental companies do. Although more expensive, itâs much better to buy insurance directly from rental company
*Do not drive your own car into the valleys with glacier river, there are hikerâs buses. We saw a brave car crossing the glacier river, got stuck, had to be towed out by a tractor

Maps and GPS:
* Do have a physical map with you all the time. GPS signals may be lost in the mountains
* Waze does not find all places on the island, may Ned to use a combination of both (For example, google map can locate the Herring Era Museum, not Waze)

Outdoor Equipment
* Do bring good hiking boots. Sneakers just would not work well if you plan to hike Volcano craters or waterfalls.
* Hiking sticks can be helpful on steep mountain trails or slippery ground near waterfall
* Outer layer need to be water proof: you will need those on many drizzle days and near so many waterfalls
* A warm hat can really make the summer hikes more enjoyable
* An insect hat net can be helpful near Lake Myvatn
* Do bring your own towels and flip flops if you plan visit many hot springs. You can rent towels too

Travel Guide and trip planning
* A combination of travel book and travel blog sites maybe the best approach.
* Rick Steveâs Iceland although still helpful, but it has several obvious misses, not as good as other series (after all, 2018 is the first edition for Iceland). Use this as a starting point but do not rely completely on this for trip planning
* Try not to drive more than 200 miles a day: the road is windy sometimes with one lane tunnel, with stops to take pictures, 200 miles can be a long day, even with midnight sun
* Ring road travel direction: most people start with the Golden Circle in the South Coast, it may make more sense to continue from the Golden Circle along the Southeast coast to travel the ring road counter-clock wise (some travel book suggest clockwise travel along the Ring Road)

Money and bank card:
* Most places accept credit card (except gas pump), but do have some cash just in case
* Gas station: many gas stations along the ring road are not attended by staff, just a machine. The machine will ALWAYS ask for the Lin of your card (ATM may work better then credit card), and it will hold about $200 every time you use the card. You may want to fill up the tank whenever you see a gas station, need to balance this with the $200 holding whenever you use the card. I assume eventually it will be cleared and returned to your account, but still quite annoying. Cash sometimes is not an option when no one is tending the station

Booking in advance
* Hotel rooms are hard to find during summer. Do book early to optimize the driving distance along the ring road. Otherwise, you maybe forced to drive long distance on certain days just to have a hotel room to spend the night
* Most of the activities are not hard to reserve. We booked quite a few just the day before (weather dependent).
* Blue Lagoon do need advanced booking

LÃ¡trabjarg Bird Cliff:
* There is a ~3h ferry operated by SeaTour from StykkishÃ³lmur to BrjÃ¡nslÃ¦kur, you can buy a ticket for your car too. Much easier to drive the 1.5h from BrjÃ¡nslÃ¦kur to LÃ¡trabjarg

Iceland,JC-Meg,Ring Road,5.0,"Our 10 day trip in June was exactly what we wanted, an absolute great time. We rented a Toyota Land Cruiser from Hertz at KEF and found it to be a good choice. Golden Circle travel was effortless and full of ""must see"" sights. As we headed further afield (and took a few back roads) the 4x4 was a good move. Weather was perfect for our journey, your experience will certainly vary. Overall a solid trip. We usually kinda ""wing it"", but had received some advice to plan ahead. Plenty of websites, blogs, Facebook pages, books and solid TA reviewers helped immeasurably. Have fun on your adventures in Iceland!

Helpful Iceland Tips:
- Rent a Wifi device in advance. Pick up at airport, return in prepaid box on departure.
- Make sure you have your credit card PIN number to buy gas, or use an ATM card
- Book hotels in advance!
- A mix of Waze and Google maps works well throughout country.
- Food everywhere is expensive, embrace it. Many items are imported.
- Have a great trip!

Iceland,Peyman N,Ring Road,5.0,"I traveled around Iceland in Feb/Mar 2018 for 14 days in a 2017 VW Transporter van which I rented from CampEasy.
The staff were knowledgeable and helpful.
Everything was explained in details, and carefully, before I left for the trip.
They provided pick up and drop off to and from their Headquarter.

The car, which had 40K km on it, was clean, well-equipped, and in great shape.
It had running water, heating system, cooler (fridge), bedding, kitchenware, stove, and WiFi.
I slept in the van for 12 nights (yes it was winter!) and I enjoyed the heating system which worked with two extra batteries and very little amount of fuel while the engine was off.

Just note that, if you plan to sleep in the van in cold nights and use the heating system, make sure to park the van âagainstâ the wind, otherwise the mighty Icelandic wind will overpower the heating system exhaust, and the heating system will turn itself off; and you might think there is a problem with the heating system, while there isnât.


It was a great experience.

Iceland,James M,Ring Road,5.0,"I recently completed a seven (7) day tour of Iceland with Nice Travel. It was a profound experience for me as the magic of Iceland unfolded day-after-day. This experience was made even better by the competence of our guides, Mika and Fjola. From the safety & expertise Mika demonstrated while we trekked on a glacier with crampons and an ice axe to his competence as a driver (in a new Renault van), from his commendable patience to Mika and Fjola's combined knowledge of Icelandic history/culture/language... the Nice Travel sojourn around Iceland's ring road was more than memorable.. it was profound.

Iceland,Terrance M,Ring Road,5.0,"Largely following the outskirts of Iceland, the Ring Road is the main road you will use if touring this unique land. It is almost all paved and most of it just two lanes, making passing at times a challenge. The road traverses glaciers, farms, volcanoes, national parks, passing through or near many small towns. It is often shut down in stretches in winter due to snow. It goes through various tunnels and under a fjord. The highway truly holds the country together.",Jun 2018

Iceland,Zachary F,Ring Road,5.0,"The main tourist ring though South Iceland is the smaller Golden Circle, which includes some good sites (with heavy tourist traffic). The Ring Road route (traversing the entire country via the only highway) includes vastly more breathtaking beauty, diversity, and gets you away from the crowds. I did the RR in late September, shortly before winter and did not have any encounters with snow (although it can be very rainy at times and windy).

The road can 'technically' be driven in a day, however this would be impossible unless you didn't intend to stop anywhere... If you are going to turn off and see all of the incredible natural beauty that Iceland has to offer, I would recommend no less than 5-7 Days, or maybe 4 Days if you were content with blitzing through everything and driving alot each day. One mistake I made was spending too much time in Reykjavik (honestly, not much to see there) that I wish I would've devoted to taking my time on the RR. I stayed at Hostels/Guests Houses/Bed & Breakfasts - all of which were clean and excellent. Tourism has pretty much replaced the economy of Iceland, so many of the places to stay are new construction and privately owned by farmers/families.

I took the road going east from Reykjavik. This will lead you through the Golden Circle area first, then expand out along the southern coast, up through the mountains of the east coast, through the volcanic valleys and the canyons of the north coast, and along the fjords of the West Coast, culminating back in Reykjavik.

Some advice I would offer for someone going for the first time

1) The main roads are mostly paved and in excellent condition, although you may encounter some well maintained dirt roads in remote parts of the country, particularly the East coast which has a (breathtaking) mountain pass that is mostly dirt. I had a small Kia car and did fine in late September, though there were some times I wish I had an small SUV. Be sure to read up on Iceland road policies, such as single lane bridge approaches and parking on private land.

2) Some areas are very rural - I would not trust a phone signal. I stuck to an old-school paper map (I highly recommend National Geographic's) and you'll be fine. When you encounter a dirt road, don't be second guess that you missed a turn for the highway or something - it is common. The Nat Geo map also has just about every attraction listed and was 100% accurate in my experience.

3) DO NOT USE CREDIT CARD AT GAS PUMPS! Iceland only has two major gas stations, and both use a primitive credit payment system and will place large holds on foreign cards ($250USD per visit!) that doesn't clear your credit card for 1-2 weeks! Avoid this by simply purchasing prepaid gas cards at gas stations that work across the country.

Enjoy your journey!

Iceland,Sisira,Ring Road,5.0,We spent 2 days going around ring road and to Vik to explore south coast. We found the beauty of Icelandic landscape mesmerising. Roads are good to average but they are well signposted. Some sections of the roads could be crowded with tourist traffic. There are good hikes you could do as well. We ended up going to Blue lagoon for a warm spa at the end. Got enough to do in 4 days but we could spare only 2 days.,May 2018
Iceland,STEVEN g,Ring Road,5.0,"Beautiful amazing tour of ring road. We saw beautiful waterfalls, hiked up to a glacier, watch sheep with their new born babies, Icelandic horses, and of course the stunning Black beach. The day was beyond amazing. Do miss out!",May 2018
Iceland,Sue P,Ring Road,5.0,"First trip to Iceland. We stayed in Reykjavik for 4 nights, including driving the Golden Circle route...then took 5 days to drive around the ring road with side trips. It says you can drive it in 12 hours but so many things to see and photos to take, plus we did several side trips off the circle.
We set off from Reykjavik going clockwise and stayed the night in Hvammstangi, Egilsstadir, Hofn and Ketilsstadaskoli (just W of Vik)
First advice would be to buy alcohol at the airport duty free before you leave the airport...second never to pass up the opportunity to get gas, eat and use washrooms....as they can be pretty sparse in the North. At lots of the gas stations though you can buy gas with a credit card even if they are closed. We went to Bonus supermarket and bought groceries to make sandwiches etc.
Dress in layers...have waterproof outside layer available...we had hot sunshine in places followed by freezing walk to Dettifoss through snow and mud.
Everywhere takes credit cards and we ended up never taking out any cash during our whole trip,
We rented a car from the airport from Hertz, seamless pick up and return.I would definitely recommend driving yourself as then you can stop for as little or long as you want....plus avoid busy times.
We were very lucky with the weather, had lots of sun and very little rain. Even so we had snow and fog for a little while in the N (used to snow coming from Manitoba) so care has to be taken watching the weather.
April seemed to be a great month for fewer tourists and no bad driving was witnessed.
Absolutely LOVED Iceland. When staying in Reykjavik I would recommend walking everywhere, so much to see that would be missed from a car.
Our highlights were seeing all the ponies, Arnarstapi, Godafoss, Dettifoss, Stokknes, seeing reindeer crossing the valley just before Hofn...then seeing a reindeer strolling in front of our hotel in Hofn plus the glaciers, Jokulsaron and Diamond Beach, Reynisfjara beach, Skogafoss and Seljaladfoss....and so so many more spots. Literally stopping every 5 minutes to take photos.
We avoided going to the Blue Lagoon as it's not a natural hot spring and highly overpriced...choosing to visit the smaller hot springs.

The only weird thing for us was the number of signs about not pooping outside...even in towns! Who are these people doing this! We went to see the eggs at Djupivogur and even when we had bought a full tank of gas we had a very hostile reaction even asking if they had a washroom! Answer NO. Really if they are so concerned about random poops why don't they have more toilets, especially at a gas station?? There was one public one in the town and we drove around three times before we found it, even though there were arrows it still managed to be hidden.
I know this is a big paragraph about toilets...but you will see these signs from arriving at the airport on! I wouldn't go to Djupivogur again. Super unfriendly..due to other people apparently taking random dumps!
The roads were mostly very good, a few spots in the SE were sketchy and once we took a coastal road after Egilsstadir and there were fallen boulders on it. All part of the journey!
Iceland is the most stunningly beautiful place I have every visited, especially if you're lucky enough to get good weather. Definitely recommended to drive the whole ring road if possible, to see the changing areas.

- Seljalandfoss (Don't miss walking behind the falls)
- Eyjafallajaokull eruption site (Just amazing what it did to Plane travel a few years ago)
- Skogafoss (Walk up the stairs, you will see some incredible sights)
- Reyniksfara Beach (Rock formations and beach was beautiful)
- Lava fields
- Skaftafell / Vatnajokull National Park (This is a place for waterfalls, glacier, snow capped mountains...what is not to like)

I have just indicated the main stops....You will see water falls, amazing sights all across the road while driving. Be safe while traveling and stay within the speed limits although you will see cars zipping past you. Makes no sense while you are enjoying the scenery.

Other tips:
- Pack lunch and lot of water. It will be a long day
- National Parks have cameras for checking parking payments. So pay it on time
- Some of the towns are pretty far apart. Dont wait for the gas tank to approach empty

Enjoy the full day

Iceland,tavisw2017,Ring Road,4.0,"Me and my now fiance (proposed during this trip!) drove the ring road this February just gone. One awesome experience!
We did the journey (including the golden circle) in 5 days (plus another day for Reykjavik) but i would say this is the absolute minimum to do it. We saw the majority of landmarks that we wanted to, but with around 5 hours of driving on average each day, and only 8.5 hours of daylight each day, this didnt leave much time for adventuring. We stayed at a new location each night which is a bit of a drain on time but kept us moving. Id recommend a couple nights in some of the main locations (potentially Reykjavik, Vik and Akureyri) so that you can relax a bit more and explore off of the ring road, do some walks etc.
We hired a Dalston Duster from Blue Car Rental. I would highly recommend this company (you can see my review on their page), as well as a 4WD SUV with studded/winter tyres in winter especially.
I've seen a few reviews warning away from driving in Iceland in winter if you are not 'expert'. Im certainly no expert driver and have limited experience driving in harsh 'wintery' countries like Iceland, but i am a confident driver. To that end, despite some extremely stormy conditions, I absolutely loved driving in iceland and felt mostly comfortable throughout. There were a couple of hairy moments where incredibly strong gusts of winds pushed the car sideways a bit, which you must be constantly alert to. We did see 3 or 4 cars, and 2 buses pushed or slid off the road and stranded, so people definitely get caught out. The road is good for most of the ring road but there is several km of unsealed road on the east side of the country. Ice can also be anywhere. I would suggest if you are confident with your driving ability in tricky conditions then go for it. But if you arent then probably dont drive in Iceland in winter, leave it to summer when you can relax and enjoy it more.
This is not a country you should try and skimp on insurances, simply due to the extreme weather. We got all available insurances with Blue car rental, as well as independent car hire excess insurance, because the CDW, SCDW etc excesses are still high.
Buying diesel almost gave me a heart attack. I hadnt learnt in researching for the trip (many many hours of research for Iceland!) that foreign debit cards (my Monzo card at least) get charged a 'maximum refilling price' when you 'fill up'. Half a tank cost 170 GBP on the spot, which was almost my estimate for fuel for the entire trip - heart attack! I asked a local who said this would be amended to reflect the amount of diesel you actually bought. and sure enough, a few days later it amended to 60GBP - relief! Dont forget to budget in cost of fuel- 180 GBP total for our ring road trip, at the time.
Do not under estimate how expensive Iceland is. I've been to 30 odd countries and this was the steepest. As soon as we picked up our hire car in Reykjavik, we went to a supermarket and bought all the food we thought we'd need for the week. This meant tomato pasta and pizza for dinner, corn flakes for breakfast and self made sandwiches for lunch, every day. This cost 80 GBP for 5 days, which i think we would've spent in 1 day at cafes etc.
One very warming little touch we opted for was to bring a large hot water furnace. This was great for making coffees, teas, hot chocos on the road, at a fraction of the price.
Other points:
- Blue lagoon - very cool but hugely overpriced at 80GBP each; 10GBP per beverage. There are so many much cheaper natural hotsprings around the country, if you are driving the ring road then make the most of them instead. One in particular (and where I chose to propose) was the Myvatn Nature Baths up in the Northeast of the island.
- No shortage of waterfalls. beautiful but be wary of walk times to some of them. 30 mins each way might not sound like much but that could be an hour too much in the weather iceland can throw at you in winter.
- accommodation is unbelievably expensive, 80-100 GBP on average per night for a basic double room. left a sour taste in the mouth at one place.

Iceland was stunning but we were a very disappointed to have missed most of the golden circle sights, and a couple others, due to the weather which meant the roads had to be closed. We thought it would possibly be a better option to go in summer, when weather is less of a hazard. But we wanted to see the northern lights (which we also missed due to the weather!), but this is winter only, so you'll have to weigh it up.
The people are lovely and hospitable. I hope with the growing tourism trade that it stays that way!

This trip was recommended by the car rental agent and is an easy day trip by car from Keflavik airport or the capital (about 50 km from Keflavik). The scenery is a breath taking volcanic moonscape, steam vents can be seen and geothermal green houses are in towns located along the way. The main attraction of this drive are the Geysir, which has given geysers around the world their name and the gigantic Gullfoss waterfalls, not far from the Geysir. The roads are paved and in reasonable condition.
During the winter months I do not recommend driving them unless you are used to travelling on ice and snow. Some of the areas are very remote. We drove the circle in 5 hours, not counting the stops, at moderate speeds.

Iceland,Mark N,Ring Road,5.0,"Our 3rd trip with this company, this time with tour guide whose name was Flossie. Although he was less verbose than our previous guides he was no less interesting or entertaining because this time we received more objective facts than romantic stories to give a quite different perspective on the island's history. In terms of sightseeing this was easily the most awe-inspiring as although we only visited 4 places they were pretty damn spectacular. After a visit to a massive and powerful waterfall, our next stop was a visit to the foot of a glacier which was just incredible; the ice formations, the colours, reflections and crevasses set against huge banks of black gravel deposits at the edge. Although there are warning signs not to go to the very edge of the ice without suitable gear was actually fine for us with good walking boots, but don't ascend the ice pack without crampons, helmets and a qualified guide. A lunch stop in Vik not so good unless you want to buy souvenirs or clothing that you really can't afford unless you are really loaded.The black beach near Vik was also stunning, combining the power of the sea with a backdrop of basalt cliff formations - never turn your back on the ocean because those waves will definitely drag you out and drown you; we learned that 3 tourists had died in this way in the last year. The best was saved to last, the Skogafoss where you can actually walk behind the waterfall, an amazing experience and worth every krona of the cost. It's a long day out, most of which is taken up by travel over a pretty boring landscape but well worth it for the main destinations.

For one, it is extremely busy with tourists on the ring road. When you go to the outposts such as Neskaupstadur, Bakkafjordur, Siglufjordur, and Hellnar, you get to see quiet villages with real people and feel like you are experiencing Iceland -- and not just traveling with a huge caravan of tourists, seeing the same people night after night at the campgrounds.
Do it right. Take the time and see the nooks and crannies of Iceland.

Iceland,sotms,Ring Road,5.0,"Yes , ring road is gorgeous, no sense of repeating that fact. So instead let me share some practical info from my trip.

1. We traveled in July in in order to catch some ""warm"" weather. I was concerned that high season would mean traffic on a one lane wide ring road. Luckily that didnt happen. The roads were pretty empty 97% of the time.

2. Empty road=going fast= speeding tickets. Majority of speeding cameras that I saw were around Reykjavik and Akureyri. Not much in between. You will notice a sign with an old fashion 1960 camera on it before you get to an actual camera. So slow down. Almost every tunnel that we took had a camera and that is where I picked up my 2 tickets.

3. Most books will state that the southern stretch of the ring road is the most scenic. And it is gorgeous. However once you get to the east coast dont make a mistake of staying on route 1 all the way to Egilsstadir and spending a night there.
In my opinion eastern fjords are even prettier that the southern coast. Stay on ring road until Breiddalsvik then take route 96 for some spectacular driving around fjords. Spend a night at one of fjord towns, then rejoin ring road the next morning.

4. Start that morning with the drive to fjord town of Seydisfjordur. The ride is sick. You are so high you dont know if you are driving or flying. Dont drive after it gets dark becase you will miss out on scenery and you might actually fly. Stop at every scenic overlook (there aren't many) for pictures.

Explore Seydisfjordur and now you are ready to get back on ring road.

Iceland,IowaMum,Ring Road,5.0,"Our family of five spent ten days exploring the Ring Road of Iceland. We drove Route 1 each day and each evening, we took small roads off of it to stay overnight in different small seaside fishing villages in cabins, cottages and apartments which I booked on-line via Booking.com and TripAdvisor. We loved it! My recommendations include purchasing a good road map of Iceland in the US before you arrive. We used one with every numbered road included. Do book your accommodation three to four months in advance if you are travelling in the summer. I booked our family cabins and apartments for the five of us in April for our two week holiday in August. Do get gas when you can on Route 1. Do research the towns and decide where you want to visit in advance. We rented a Toyota van at the airport and started on the west side and visited Snaefellnes Penisula first, driving north and east, then south, and taking a few days for West Man Island, and ending on the Golden Circle and finally Reykjavik. I enjoyed this clockwise route because we started quietly and ended by seeing the tourists and more busy areas after we had already seen the country. The countryside is open and vast. I felt as if I was seeing what America might have looked like in the 1800's before buildings and people arrived. Our favorite places were the quiet waterfalls on the west and east coasts, puffins on West Mann Island and Fontana Spa.

Iceland,coachvu,Ring Road,5.0,"This can easily be done as a day trip from Reykjavik. This was one of our favorite experiences in Iceland. Geysir and Gulfoss are both incredible. The waterfall at Gulfoss will take your breath away. We also stopped at Laugarvatn Fontana (a spa) along the route, which was a very relaxing break. No need to take a tour. The drive is easy to do and will give you more flexibility. Our travel book was more than enough.",Aug 2017
Iceland,igal b,Ring Road,5.0,"As other reviewers have said, this is just an unbelievable experience. With global warming and the number of tourists to Iceland increasing almost exponentially, I wonder how much longer the experience could be enjoyable.

We did this itinerary in 10 days, including the Snaefellness peninsula. We used Camp Easy for the campervan (highly recommended, read my post in the forums section). We went in August and the sites are packed, but you can avoid the hordes if you arrive before 9AM or late in the day, which is OK since the days are very long.

+1 on mortgaging your house or kids, just go!!

Iceland,brodarte,Ring Road,5.0,"My wife and I tackled the ring road in a total of 7 days. What an awesome experience. I can't imagine any other way of seeing this incredible country. We loved the fact that we were able to travel pretty much at our own pace. Unlike the various tour busses we saw, it was us two who decided how much time we wanted to spend at any given place. And trust me... its hard to leave any one of the dozens of magnificent site we encountered while there!

In summary our itinerary around the ring road was as follows:
Day 1: Arrived at the International airport very early in the morning and picked up my 4X4 rental. Walked from North America to Europe in 5 minutes, witnessed geysers explode, saw the incredible waterfall of Gulfoss and hiked over 6 kms over phenomenal views to winded up the day by relaxing submerged in the hot springs @ HveragerÃ°i. Slept in a nice AirBnb at Sellfoss.
Day 2: Got drenched by the mighty waters of Seljalandsfoss falls, hiked up the impressive SkÃ³gafoss falls canyon, was awestruck by the fantastic black, white and blue hues of the SÃ³lheimajÃ¶kull glacier and walked hand in hand with the love of my life on the black sands of the beach at Vik. Slept at some really noice cottages in KirkjubÃ¦jarklaustur.
Day 3: Trekked one of Iceland's most beautiful canyons: FjaÃ°rÃ¡rgljÃºfur. This time we visited 2 glaciers! SkaftafellsjÃ¶kull and the surrounding area is impressive... but the treat was the BreiÃ°amerkurjÃ¶kull glacier that slowly breaks away at the JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n lagoon. First time on an amphibian vehicle to enter the lagoon. Ended the day with a stroll across the quaint town of Seydisfjordur before calling it a night! Wait... there was no night!
Day 4: Discovered a treasure at the end of a rainbow at the mighty Dettifoss falls, did an interesting expedition through the thermal fields at Hverarond and hiked the rim of the Hverfjall crater. Slept at Akureyri.
Day 5: After digging in a little, discovered a great cove with a colony of puffins at the Voladalstorfa lighthouse. It was just the two of us and literally hundreds of these cute birds! Found a small village of elves at the LaufÃ¡s Museum and ended the day with an incredible whale watching expedition in the bay around Akureyri! Slept in Akureyri.
Day 6: Submerged our feet in the frigid waters around the black beach that houses the Hvitserkur rock formation; saw what appeared to be hundreds of small waterfalls appear from nowhere at Hraunfossar and enjoyed some great food and nightlife at Reykjavik. Slept in Reykjavik.
Day 7: Strolled the streets of Reykjavik and did some last minute souvenir shopping before heading out to the airport!

In total I drove a little over 2,000 kms on this fabulous journey. If you really want to experience everything this beautiful country has to offer, nothing like grabbing a car and experiencing it yourself!

Iceland,BLA74,Ring Road,5.0,"Amazing places, gorgeous scenery. It is just breathtaking. We went in August and it was a bit packed with people, but the scenery is just gorgeous.

Iceland,eisenberg,Ring Road,5.0,"Only word I can think to describe this majestic country and the scenery you encounter while doing this adventure . We did it in 8 days which felt a bit rushed ,and we have 3 young boys, age 6,9 and 10 who don't have stamina for 3 hour hikes which you can find everywhere along this drive. Truth is you should take minimum 10 days and all told 14 in Iceland since who knows when you'll be returning to this isolated wonderland. Highlights , this is tough because the names are so hard to remember but I'll give it a try myvantn thermal pool and geysers, iceberg lake, waterfalls too many to list , gotfoss and one you can walk under which we saw on 2nd day of our counter clockwise ring route , black sand beach and the coastal views , fjords and great art town in East , big , gas guzzling winding hills to get to , sadisfjord is name I believe , and perhaps the biggest surprise was today in Akureyi which probAbly the kids highlight , yes the public pool and great water slides and for adults really interesting to observe the locals enjoying their leisure time and just something invigorating about jumping in and out of warm pools and hot jacuzzis in mid 40's weather and all for 22 dollars for the 5 of us, the blue Lagoon this is not !! Btw we do that in a couple of days , also great whale watch in hjatrery something like that 20 minutes outside Akureyi. Only negative and not a surprise are the restaurant and accommodation prices, solution, supermarket sandwiches and lots of delicious lamb hot dogs and beef soups , no way around the pricy apartments , hotels etc. unless you're camping but those budget busters are still small price to
Pay for the nature trip - drive of a lifetime in
Arguably the safest most peaceful country in the world. I'm jealous of all these Icelanders with their strange , melodious language and efficient, friendly , English fluent industrious young people who obviously feel a strong sense of unity . 300 thousand vs. 300 million in my home country,amazing. Of course all this excitement must be tempered with the fact that I'm here in the nice refreshingly cold summer and not the total dark, wet frigid winter , but hey it's a vacation not a permanent move!! Finally to all those who complain about the prices Including myself I should point out that there are no tolls and no fees to visit these incredible sights and you save a lot on bottled water since tap is fine. I hate this cliched term but this destination should be on everybody's bucket list, we're here in height of tourist season and still felt more peace and quiet and less crowded than any day back in NYC.
Downsize your house, send your kids to state school , buy a simpler car do what you have to but make plans to visit this gem of an island ,

Iceland,Catherinemiller,Ring Road,5.0,"Rented a camper van and drove the ring road. Every turn provided breathtaking scenery. The road is paved and well maintained but narrow and in areas need to be attentive to bikers and sheep. Lots of spots to pull over and take in the sites. We camped and the camping spots are great. Most places have showers, washrooms and Areas to wash up dishes. Highly recommend at least 10 days. We drove counter clockwise but don't think it matters.",Jul 2017
Iceland,Mark R,Ring Road,5.0,The ring road around Iceland is so simple to navigate around. The traffic is sparse and the signs are good. The scenery is absolutely spectacular. I priced seeing everything we wanted to do and it was far cheaper and much more flexible by hiring our own car and doing it ourselves. The driving is so easy on the ring road.,Jul 2017
Iceland,CodyMav,Ring Road,5.0,"First up, planning Tip. Drive the Ring Road Clockwise from Reykjavik. I drove east first (anti-clockwise) and soon discovered, that puts you on the outer edge of mountain roads, steep elevations, no guard rails most of the time, and no hard shoulders to pull over; so if you drive clockwise instead, you will be on the mountain side for most of the drive, a much safer feel.

Most roads are like a Levy, raised from the landscape, no hard shoulders or anywhere to pull over, and the sides are often steep. Dual lane is the standard everywhere, generally narrow, with plenty of blind corners and blind crests. Also frequent livestock on the road or roadside presenting further hazards. You need to be paying attention.

Beyond that, I spent 7 days early September and got all the way around including the west fjords; and could have easily spent longer, budget permitting.

Iceland is expensive, compared to just about everything. Nice fact though, I spent 10 days in Iceland in total, and never once used cash. Everywhere took a credit card.

Follow advice on TA, map out your intended route, and try to allow as many days as you can. It's a landscape you will never forget.

There was an amazing hike around every bend. The waterfalls are incredible. CampEasy made it so easy to rent, camp, and make the most of our trip. Agent Baldur Kristjansson started us off with great tips. We went off the path on quite a few gravel roads and had a flat tire near Husafell, CampEasy mechanic Haukur left immediatley to fix the tire and went the extra mile helping us with gas purchase until we could get N1 gas card.

Iceland,Flying Dutchman,Ring Road,5.0,"Iceland Ring Road offers a great landmarks to adventurers. Few of the most beautiful waterfalls you have ever see, small villages, friendly horses, glaciers, mountain views, black beaches, moss and lava fields and many more. In my opinion for the full tour you need between 15 and 20 days and for half at least 10. 4x4 car is a must as you will go out of the ring road to gravel and want to explore things and those roads are quite bumpy full of pits and ditches. And of course as many people did to go counter clockwise is a wise idea. If you are not traveling in the summer, it is wise to rent a car that you can sleep in and as long as you respect to the nature and do not leave your left overs around there are many places to sleep in the car.

Iceland,Bea_Kwatch,Ring Road,5.0,"There is so much to see! The waterfalls get mundane after a while, but not because they aren't beautiful. Most of them are easily accessible, making the waterfall tour a ""drink-park-oogle-repeat"" type of roadtrip. Half way through our driving we decided to switch it up and throw our itinerary out the window and go where the wind takes us.

We went at the end of September so we could have a chance to see the Northern Lights, and we had two nights of spectacular displays! You do have to be prepared for wind and rain during that time of the year, but we still had quite a few days of nice weather. We saw amazing waterfalls, glacial lakes, geothermal activity and volcanoes, beautiful fjords and spectacular beaches! We had so many favorite spots it would be hard to pick just one!

Iceland,Ellie R,Ring Road,5.0,"We went with Go Campers, based in reykjavik, and had a comfortable 8 night trip around the ring road in a great little camper van. The price included an airport pick up and hotel drop off, and the knowledgable staff were keen to suggest must see landmarks. Personal highlights were the skaftafell national park and seydisfordur on the east coast. I wouldn't recommend sleeping in the van every night , the occasional hotel is crucial for staying dry if you plan to do a lot of walking (although many campsites also have drying facilities - just check first if they're open) but the vans are well kitted, warm, and a great way to see a beautiful country away from the crowds at the golden circle.",Oct 2016
Iceland,Fayjacobsrb,Ring Road,5.0,"We had a blast! If you are only in Iceland a few days, or want to stay in cities rather than countryside, the best is to go to Reyjkavik and take day trips to the sights like waterfalls and geysirs and Blue Lagoon.
But for an overview of the country, including the above tourist sites, drive around the ring. You'll see everything from black ash beaches to waterfalls, glaciers, ice berg lagoons, small villages with campsites underwaterfalls, larger towns with campsites right in the midst of town so you don't need another vehicle, fishing villages, volcanoes and a heck of a lot of waterfalls. It was a great trip, the roads were good, gasoline available often and a thoroughly enjoyable time. Favorite places: Hofn for lagostines, Husavik for whale watching and the many slightly unnerving one-lane bridges along the way. No campsite reservations were required, even in August.
But I suspect that the ring is only a great drive in the late spring, summer and early fall.

Iceland,Joezone,Ring Road,5.0,"Weâve just finished driving The Ring Road (clockwise) over 13 days in early October and wanted to share a few tips from our experience to help guide those who follow.

1. Driving Times and Google Routing. We developed the master plan for our trip based on driving times from Google Maps, then found them to be wildly unrealistic in the field as a result of detours, attractions, wind, trucks, busses, tractors, errant sheep, road conditions, etc. In some cases, like the wide expanses of the far north, you might meet those goals, but in others, you may see your actual driving time double. There are also cases (most specifically the eastern end of Rt. 54 on the SnÃ¦fellsnes Peninsula) where locals would advise against the Google-suggested route. It is always good to get input from locals before heading out.

2. Beer. No, this isnât suggesting that you drink beer while you drive The Ring Road, but understanding where you will find it at the end of each day is a critical element of a good vacation. The ONLY place in Iceland to buy packaged beer is at the Vinbudin chain of state operated liquor stores. There are just 46 of these, and their opening hours are somewhat byzantine (all are available on their website). Selection ranges from so-so to OK. Grocery stores sell a form of beer that is 2.25% ABV. Get used to Gull Lager and the offerings from Einstok and Borg, as there isnât much else out there. You might want to buy a cheap ice chest for your trip in town before you head out, as all beer is sold at room temperature.

3. Groceries. If you are using Airbnb or camping, youâll want to pay attention to the locations of grocery stores and when they are open â as in general, they close earlier than those in the US. We also brought a bunch of staples and spices from home, which helped a lot.

4. Gas and N1 stores. As others here have mentioned, the N1 chain of gas stations is a godsend. Between the not so bad espresso drinks, highly addictive bulk candy (we recommend the licorice logs), Icelandic hot dogs (add the tasty crunchy onions) and of course, gas, these are an essential part of any Ring Road trip. Make sure you have your PIN code for your credit card (some say debit cards donât work well), and get ready for some sticker shock. We were paying approximately $65 for each fill-up.

5. Wind. Embrace the wind. Driving in >50mph wind is possible, even somewhat fun, even in a small rental car. If you have an elaborate hairstyle youâd like to protect, bring a hat. Hold on to your car doors when you open them (seriously!!), and make sure you get the insurance that will pay for them if they are blown off. Extremely light people may want to buddy up when hiking to the summits of tall exposed mountains.

6. The Joy of Fall. We heard over and over about how hot Iceland is as a tourist destination these days, and as a result planned our trip for the fall to beat the crowds. There were definitely WAY fewer people (and buses!) on the road then, and we could tell from the huge parking lots at waterfalls and other attractions how bad things can get in the summer. We were surprised to have light until late in the evening (7:30) each day and also at how moderate the temperatures were. The leaves hadnât fallen yet in some places, so there was some color.

7. Deviate. When we travel, we try to stray away from the road most traveled, and while on The Ring Road, we had a number of really great experiences as a result of heading down roads and trails that werenât among those recommended in the guidebooks. Like a treasure hunt, really.

8. Learn. I spent a lot of nights on our trip learning about the places we stayed and their recent history, and this really enhanced the trip. Also check out Michael Mooreâs âWhere to Invade Nextâ and its excellent segment on Iceland.

9. Airbnb. Our trip included four Airbnbs, with stays ranging from 1-3 nights. The standard Iceland Airbnb is spartan, with a bedroom, small kitchen and sitting area (and excellent WIFI), but this is all you need if your main goal is to be outside and enjoy Iceland. Book those early, as some parts of the country donât have many offerings.

10. Food Costs. We found that it was possible to hold down food costs on the trip by bringing some staples (granola, spices, pasta, etc. â if your baggage weight allows them), hitting the many amazing bakeries, making our own breakfasts (the yogurt/Skyr is great) and lunches (if you stay in hotels, watch out for the very expensive optional breakfasts), and then either making dinner or asking locals for less expensive suggestions.

Have a great time in Iceland.

Iceland,James M,Ring Road,5.0,A trip well worth taking and you can spend as little time or as much time as you like. Iceland is a geologic wonderland and much that is on display on the ring road. You will see natural phenomenon you are unlikely to experience anywhere else.,Jun 2016

Iceland,Andy D,Ring Road,5.0,"Drove it from Sept 24-Oct 3. The road was in good shape with only some minor gravel spots on the east coast.

Tips: - Try to avoid it at night. It is filled with curves, hills, and it is just not pleasant.
- Don`t go cheap on a rental car. Some of the side roads are awful and you don`t want to be stuck in a tiny Hyundai. I had a Rav4 SUV and I was doing 20km/hr on some of the side roads, praying that i didn`t get a flat.
- Speaking of flats, the repair shops are generally open from 10am-6pm ish. Another reason not to drive at night. If you get a flat you could be really screwed depending where you are. Plan on arriving in the town you are staying at in the early afternoon and do local things... just in case.
- Have a credit card with a PIN. Gas stations are in almost every town so you won`t need to constantly fill up like some people suggest. Having a PIN eliminates having to buy a gas card or fill up during daytime hours. Diesel is available everywhere and is clearly marked.
- Check the rental car for damage! People drive these cars hard and on crap roads. Rocks and debris are going to damage your car (It`s Iceland). It`s another risk of driving yourself as opposed to a tour.

overall it was a great experience and I ended up putting 2500km on the car in 8 days. I was exhausted after all the hiking/driving/excursions etc. To do a proper ring road you should have at least 2 weeks.

Just when you think you have seen the most magnificent scene, there is something even more remarkable around a curve or over a hell. Eleven days was enough for us to substantially get off the Ring Road in order to see even more hidden gems. I planned the tour from start to finish. It had its challenges, particularly on the lodging side, but I am glad that we did it that way. Other than reserved lodging it was a self controlled adventure. Do your homework and you will have a wonderful time. We ran into people who had not done their homework, from failure to have PIN for credit card at a gas pump or poor clothing (particularly outer) choices.

We were sticker-shocked at how EXPENSIVE food and lodging was. I did research and wish we would have stayed at more AirBnb's and apartments, for cooking our own meals. I found the food in restaurants to be very poor. $25 USD for a hamburger, $16USD for cheese at the grocery store, $62 for Reyka vodka. We prebooked our lodging ourselves(mid-Aug). I have been to Europe many times and Iceland was neat but I cannot say I would be returning anytime soon.

Iceland,Kathy S,Ring Road,5.0,"We just came back from driving the ring road in 8 days, Aug 28th to Sept 4th. Yes, it can be done and we did it with all the major stops along the way. We even drove out to the Snafellis Peninsula which was also very beautiful but gravel roads were the only way driving from Aukeryri. Luckily we hit it on a sunny day but it did take us 5 hours with gas stops to get to our overnight resting place Grundarfjordur. Yes, we saw the northern lights in the north 2 nights in a row. It was spectacular and a dream come true as I had prayed prior to taking this trip that they would come out to dance in the sky and they did and they did not disappoint! Some tips I would recommend pack snacks and although you can drink their water from the tap I found it more convenient to bring some bottles of water so that we could fill up along the way. It was more of a matter of keeping us going. The N1 gas stations are a good place to stop as they provide good ""gas station food"" at a reasonable price. The average meal in Iceland was about $50 USD for two so eating at gas stations (the hotdogs are so good) was much cheaper. Also you need to know your pin number on your credit cards when gassing up. My debt card would not work. Many gas stations are unmanned and you are at the mercy of the gas pump and it asks for your pin number. Also, let your credit card companies know you are going to be traveling to Iceland. I got a phone call from one of mine that shut my card off because I forgot to let them know I would be in Iceland so they thought the charges were fraud. The average fill up for a mid-size SUV such as a Toyota Rav or Nissan Quarion was $90 -$100 USD. Take several credit cards, we had to alternate between them and I would suggest using one that does not charge a foreign transaction fee which can take on a a few dollars to your bill. We stayed in a combo of AirBnb's and hotels which we planned ahead. The best places to stop were Reykjavik first and last night. Vik, Hofn, Egilsstadir or Seydisfjordur (Visit east fjords you wont regret it), travel to Husavik for whale watching, it is so worth it, (Gentle Giants Rib boat, don't take the wooden boat it can't catch up to the whales fast enough, Rib Boats is the best) and Aukeryri overnight, then the Snafellis Peninsula so beautiful! Have fun, bring some good tunes. Google maps GPS was very helpful and I would recommend you print out point to point maps as well, sometimes you will lose signal and printed maps help keep you on track. This was one of the best vacations I have ever taken. You will have the time of your life, we did!

Iceland,I_Roam_AB,Ring Road,4.0,"Reykjavik is great but it is a modern city. Get out and experience rural Iceland. Although we did not drive the entire ring road, it is a great way to see the country All parts if the road (mostly from SE to SW of Iceland) that we drove was in excellent condition. Landscape can change greatly in a short time. Land of volcanoes - yes - but also a land of waterfalls, lush green meadows, craggy peaks, and quaint villages. At times it felt like I was driving through the great plains of my home in Southern Alberta and then suddenly I was in the mountains and then along what could pass for the maritime coast of Canada - and everything in-between. Iceland is beautiful for both its starkness and also its abundance. A land of contrast.

The communities were very small, less than 5000 folks, but very friendly. Sheep were loose and everywhere on the roads. The scenery was breath-taking. Dirt roads were narrow, but worth the effort.

It was a little to much especially the first day when we picked up the RV at the airport, drove to the Blue lagoon, then the golden circle, then hit the south coast. Everything worked out though, the kids could sleep and play cards while the adults drove. Roads are good with little traffic, but no shoulders and the one lane bridges means you need to be comfortable with that kind of driving. If I had to do it over again I would save the Blue lagoon for the way home to the airport - or just visit another hot springs up north. People were great everywhere. Glad I had a credit card with a PIN for gas and learned early in the trip to get gas when you hit a half a tank - long way between stations.

Iceland,Angela C,Ring Road,5.0,"RING ROAD tour: We went in late July, had a wonderful and very different holiday experience. The itinerary arranged for us had excellent suggestions, and in eight days we managed to do most of them including two pre-booked tours plus we had enough time to fit in a few freelance extras including a pony trek, a classical concert in Reykholt, and visiting a Puffin sanctuary (at the very end of the Road north of Husavik). You surely won't be disappointed in the waterfalls, geysers, boiling mud pools, glaciers, scenic views, whales, lava fields, Fjords, spas, and sulphurous fumaroles!

Don't come on this holiday if you are not up for some fairly challenging driving, including unmade but well graded gravel roads, and fog on mountain passes with no edge markings other than snow poles: Have at least two people on the car hire as you will be doing 200+ miles a day. Bring some decent walking shoes. If you are prepared for it, you will have a Whale of a time (sorry!)

We did experience one slight booking hitch, with a triple room available at one hotel instead of a double plus single as booked, but this was compensated immediately and we then had a surprise luxury upgrade at our next night's accommodation. Very customer responsive.

The free Icelandic SIM card was very useful, there was also free wifi in all pre-booked accommodation on our ""economy/comfort"" mixed booking, Breakfasts were very good: Cost of eating out/coffee/drinks is roughly double that of UK but if you know that and budget for it it won't spoil your experience -we picked up basics from supermarkets & had quite a few picnics! We did not experience ""Bad"" driving from other road users any more than you would experience in any northern european country. We had a car with automatic transmission and cruise control which was handy for the long empty roads.

It's not a restful or budget holiday, lots of driving and long days, but very rewarding for the effort and cost.

Iceland,visitall50,Ring Road,5.0,"We drove the Ring Road in July 2016, spending 5 nights on the drive and highly recommend seeing Iceland this way despite the expense of food and lodging. We drove clockwise and didn't see any advantage to one way or the other-- just the way we booked. 5 days worked for us, though we could have spent longer and hiked more.

The essence of the drive is the amazing scenery and the numerous walks and hikes available along the way. Get out of your car and enjoy!

Northeast of Hofn keep your eyes pealed for reindeer,

Stop in any town for cake and coffee and take in the local calm,

Pick up Skyr and keep in a cooler in your car for when a snack isn't readily available,

Many of the roads off of the Ring Road turn to dirt and gravel after a short distance, while 4x4 only roads are marked, even dirt roads that allow all vehicles often require very low speed for non-four wheel drives.

July is an ideal time to drive the Ring Road. With nearly 24 hour light (even after sunset the sky is light) there's no need to rush to the next attraction before darkness.

The road itself is narrow with pretty much no shoulder. If you want to stop for a photo, be kind to other drivers and find a legitimate place to pull all the way off the road.

There are numerous 1-way bridges without any road signs to alert on-coming traffic, you just need to have keen eyesight and a polite nature.

Iceland,guana007,Ring Road,5.0,"Instead to telling you what we did (from what place to the other, etc, I will share some of the concerns I had before this drive:
1. The ring road is the best way to see this beautiful country, 100 of Icelanders are NICE, they are just nice people, 100% of the speak English and 100% of them are ready to help you it is just a perfect country for nature lovers.
2. We did counterclockwise, the south is a lot nicer with more things to do, more attractions to walk, packed with waterfalls. The north of the country has less attractions but has Akureiry, second city in the country.
3. The road is safe, few cars here and there, IMPOSIBLE TO GET LOST, even if you try to get lost you will always be back on road 1. USE A MAP (in the phone, paper, whatever) You do not need GPS things are very simple here
4. The whole road is paved, out of the road there is gravel, but fine for any cars. The only risk of driving is that the bridges have one lane but there are no cars and if you find once coming everybody is so friendly and it all works out. Basically 100% safe and NO RISKS
5. Go out of road one to see the Snaefelsness peninsula, yes do it is worth it, stay one night here, HELLNAR IS AMAZING!
6. DO not MISS THE HIKE to the highest waterfall in Iceland: GLYMUR is JUST TOO MUCH, if your are reasonable fit do it
7. & days is more than enough to do it, sleeping one night in different towns as you go, remember the attraction is not where you go, rather what you see on your way to where you are going to spend the night.
8. No need for cash, we don't evenknow how the currency looks like, credit card 100% of the times for what ever you want. MUST USE A PIN AT GAS STATION THEY have no one there.
9. Fill the tank when you reach half, Don't wait more, gas stations are here and there.
10. RENT A CAR that uses DIESEL save a lot of money, gas there is EXPENSIVE

IN review this is a easy vacation, plan one year ahead to pick the hotels you want, they fill out fast and they are limited number of beds. Enjoy this beautiful country full (or empty I should say) or nice people

Iceland,John B,Ring Road,5.0,"We rented a camper van and completed the ring road in seven days and had a wonderful experience. We stayed in campgrounds and planned our day ahead each night. For us we enjoyed the detours and losing the crowds at the big attractions. Yes, the waterfalls are amazing but they will also be packed with tour buses and campers. To each his own but we have no regrets about skipping the golden circle. The frame of mind to let the adventure unfold instead of keeping a schedule was the key to our trip.

A few tips and observations:

â¢Do not buy a camping pass. We were turned down several times. The fee to camp is nominal just pay as you go. worst money I ever spent.

â¢Many blogs I read made Iceland to be a food desert and I would be eating hot dogs the whole time. Not true. We ate in nice restaurants every night. Fresh fish and vegetables. Surprisingly, most gas stations(all are called N1) serve hot plates(fish, lamb, salad, veggies) and they are great. Many also have grocery stores attached. If you are watching your wallet many places have a all you can eat soup and bread option.

â¢Never used cash. Not once.

â¢Wish we took more detours. The ring road is awe inspiring. Just try and include some detours.

We detoured to Husavik went whale watching on a schooner and had incredible grilled fish skewers at Naudstid.

The Vatnsnes peninsula has a dirt ring road through farms and old homesteads. It's like stepping back in time. Birds, horses, and sheep abound and the sea stack at Hvitserkur is a marvel to look at and a great picnic spot. You can camp in the sea side town of Hvammstangi.

Vesturland. We felt alone in the Snaefellsjokull National Park. The trail to Londranger was a peaceful walk in the meadow that revealed a hidden pond with a family of swans. Hellnar is worth stopping for the old church, sea stacks and a nice meal at Hotel Hellnar.

Wished we saved time for the western fjords. I have a feeling they are criminally overlooked.

â¢Dress. It was fifties during the day in July and fairly cold at night. I wore wear a t-shirt with a microlight puffy jacket and jeans with light hikers. Sometimes a toboggan. Sometimes a light rain jacket was needed. I am glad I did not over pack.

â¢Buy a paper map. Best way to find the detours and makes a nice souvenir.

Iceland,Empty nesting,Ring Road,5.0,"Drive the ring road... If you have a confident driver. You do not need an suv, but that would help for some side trips and for rutted gravel (regular main gravels or to get to some sights down lanes). If you really want to reach the inland highlands or spend time in west fjords-- get a real suv, not a city in like a rave 4.

We rented a camper van without 4wd and did fine.

Benefits of camping, you can plan around the weather. Cheaper eating because you are cooking. Also can go day to day on itinerary for sites/hiking/driving.

Do not suggest purchasing a camping card unless you are there for two weeks or more. Most of the participating campgrounds are clustered ... So you have to plan your travel for those campgrounds and it isn't worth it. Also, some you may still have to pay for showers etc. we camped 8 nights and used the card on 3 (loss of $60 or so)

Even in high season and especially before 8-9 pm... Campgrounds are not full... There is space for one more tent or camper. With the exception of Reykjavik (that might fill up)-- just find a space before paying/registering there.

But food in larger towns-- everything doubles and triples if not at Netto or Bonus.

Hiking boots or good shoes a must and good rain coat or wind breaker. Mid July it was in the low 30f up north at night. Take old towels with you (can toss after camping) so you do not need to rent them.

Iceland,NorthernWanderlust,Ring Road,5.0,"The best way to see this country is to drive it. Get beyond Reykjavik, get beyond the Blue Lagoon and the Golden Circle, and see what it has to offer. It's long and extremely pricey, but if you have a week, see Iceland this way.

The highlights of the Ring Road are an ever-changing, more unique experience. There's waterfalls, glaciers, and volcanos in the south, long, narrow fjords and stunning volcanic activity in the east, whales in the north, and history/culture west. Since the majority of Iceland lived outside Reykjavik until recently, this is also a chance to see how the country really used to live. The scenery is picturesque and variable too.

The downsides of the Ring Road are that gas is incredibly expensive and cars are highly fuel inefficient. We spent about $500 in gas to drive the Ring Road, although this included the Golden Circle and the Reykjanes Peninsula). That's about 2,300km (1,400 miles).

There are also long distances between places to stay, which are also astronomically high to rent anyway; unless you are camping, it's going to cost you. Try to book places months in advance for lower costs, and ensure they include towels/sheets in the rental costs. Food is also more expensive as you drive the road too (and food is already quite expensive). Finally, I should add that there's sketchy driving conditions in the eastern fjords (blind corners/hills, no road barriers, no paving, etc.). Also, if you're Canadian or American, some of the gas stations (namely, N1), do not accept your credit cards - cash only.

That said, if you want to see a more original Iceland, beyond the tourists and the photo ops, do the Ring Road. See the glacier and icebergs of the Jokulsarlon Lagoon, visit the old monastery of Skridukluastur, explore in the volcanic activity near Myvatn, marvel at the power of Dettifoss, or watch for whales in Husavik. There's a lot of potential, and plenty of customization if you want it.

We did the Ring Road in about six days, visiting the Golden Circle/environs on Day 1, the south coast on Day 2 and Day 3, the eastern fjords and Dettifoss on Day 4, Myvatn and Husavik on Day 5, and returned to Reykjavik/visited the Blue Lagoon on Day 6. We spent our seventh day in Reykjavik. I don't think I would've done my visit any other way, I just wish that Iceland wasn't so prohibitively expensive.

That said, the roads are well-paved on the Ring Road for the most part; traffic is also quite light. The scenery is very beautiful too. So, if you ever wanted to do something a little different, rent a car, grab a GPS, and drive around an entire country. It's yours to discover, and deserving of the experience, if you can afford it.

Iceland,badgergirl01,Ring Road,5.0,"We drove the Ring Road the end of June into July 2016. It is a lot of driving! The sights are incredible and we especially enjoyed the glacial calving at Jokulsarlon lagoon, Myvatn Nature Baths, Akureyri, and Snaefellsjokull volcano off the Ring Road in the eastern Vesturland. There were two times when the roads were extremely bad. The first was a shortcut off Hwy. 1 on Hwy. 939 (Oxi Pass) towards Egilsstadir. It was so densely foggy the day we drove it, that we could easily have gone off the edge or been hit. We could not see more than 10 feet in front of our car. The other road that was far too rutted and rough was Hwy. 864 to Dettifoss in the north. Hwy. 862 seems like a better road.

Iceland,zuni P,Ring Road,5.0,We took 1 week and did more than just the ring road. We added the snaefellnes peninsula and 2 others a bit off the tourist maps . We are anted to see wild Iceland,Jun 2016
Iceland,vwp,Ring Road,5.0,"Obviously you can do the Ring Road many different ways. We chose clockwise because Icelandic Farm Holidays had their itinerary set up that way. We left straight from KEF and the first day went to the SnÃ¦fellsnes peninsula. The trip was 8 nights all at guesthouses at farms except for the last night, which was a hotel.

Besides the Ring, we did side trips to the SnÃ¦fellsnes peninsula, the towns of Siglufjorder, Olafsfjordur, Dalvik, up north to Husavik, and then farther east the town of Bakkagerdi.

The Ring Road is two lanes throughout except where it crosses bridges, and they are often 1 lane. Some, but not much, is gravel. You do not need a 4WD, though it does give peace of mind. The entire road it built up off the surface about 5 or more feet and there are NO shoulders, only yellow sticks to mark the sides. This makes for some alert driving. There are occasional pullouts.

It must be noted that there are NO restrooms. Sure, there might be a gas station that is open, but there are none in the small towns, like the public ones in Australia. There are no trees or bushes or sometimes even rocks to hide behind. Kilometers go by. There are picnic tables but no portopotties with them. Main attractions will be there in all their glory, but no facilities. It is a problem worth noting. I will give a shout out to the off-the-beaten-track town of Bakkagerdi for having a very nice restroom made out of a small size shipping container, complete with 3 toilets for women and sinks, and the men's room. So it can be done.

Our weather was delightful for all 9 days - 35-65F, some drizzle twice. Every day brought new sights and scenery. Extraordinary scenery and views. Fog makes the going tough. I can't imagine doing this drive in the dark or snow. There are long stretches with no food, gas or coffee. We did go to Bonus grocery store the first day and had picnic lunches 5 of our days.

It is a trip definitely worth doing. We could have used more time.

Iceland,champoux,Ring Road,4.0,"We had a terrific time driving around the ring road. We found the East side of the Island much more stunning and diverse.
We also did it in 4 days, still getting in our hikes and seeing the sites.
Down side is the cost of the hotels and food - totally outrageous!! You also need to book the hotels way in advance!
We ended up buying food from the grocery store and eating meals that we made so we didn't have to pay $20 just for a bowl of soup.",Jun 2016
Iceland,StowTravels,Ring Road,5.0,"My wife and I are presently halfway through our Ring Road tour. Today actually finds us in North Iceland at Siglufjordur before we start working our way back toward Reykjavik. This is meant to be more general impressions and suggestions than a full trip report, but Iâm happy to answer any questions while our thoughts are fresh.

WiFi is everywhere! You will never have a problem with connectivity. We were 12Km down a dirt road in Skalanes and still had terrific service. You can stay in touch with your friends very easily, including Skype for cheap voice communications home.

Youâll be spending a ton of time in your car (I mean a ton!). As I write this the roads to the interior are still mostly closed. We were sweating about what to get, and now we know to go for comfort first and donât worry about a 4WD. You will be driving on gravel at some point, but regular cars can handle it.

Each day was roughly 3-4 hours driving and 2 activities. Even if your towns look close on the map, allow for a full day to get there.

Bring your hiking shoes and rainsuit. Iceland is very much an outdoorsy place. Be prepared for rain. There are no cities so if it rains you canât go to a movie theater or museum.

Great surprises:

Soaking in the geo-thermal heated river, Reykjadalur above the sporting complex in Hvergardi. Bit of a hike getting there, bit of swallowing modesty while changing behind âprivacy screensâ and total relaxation in the stream. The top stretch features hot water that cools as it flow downstream. Just choose the right spot to relax in! We did this on day 2 and fell in love with Iceland on the spot. Donât hike in your bathing suit though as youâll be quite uncomfortable on the way back.

The floating icebergs at Jokulsarlon. Itâs on everyoneâs list of things to do and see, and it far exceeded our expectations. Stunningly beautiful and mesmerizing. Hated to leave it!

Our 3 hour hike in Shaftefell was a highlight. The hike to the falls was OK, but honestly we had already seen much better. The real treat came from hiking over to Sjona â¦ sorry forget the rest of the name. The S6 trail carries on from the foss and is incredible. Very easy across the top of a mountain with fabulous views in all directions. It ends at a lookout over the glacier which is unreal. Highly recommended!

Husavik was surprisingly upscale. We went there for dinner at Salka and liked the town quite a bit. Wish we had stayed there.

Siglufjordur has one of the better history museums Iâve seen. They call it the Herring Museum after the industry that built the city and then crashed when the herring became overfished. The museum is very well done including a recreated pier in one of the buildings.

Yeah, exactly no where else! Only on Iceland's Ring Road! Don't think about it, just go! Fly into Keflavik Airport, rent a car, and just go! Counter-clockwise preferably, and no less than 5 days! Best road trip on planet earth, period.",Apr 2016
Iceland,Sandie531,Ring Road,5.0,"We loved the trip around Iceland on the Ring Road in early May, 2016. I got a lot of ideas from this forum and wanted to contribute. We met other family members in Reykjavik for the first two days. So this was not the typical Ring Road tour. The first day we drove the south coast, 4 spectacular waterfalls, including Urriofoss between Selfoss and Hella (we were the only visitors there). We ended at Reynisfjara and returned to Reykjavik. Long day, but if you only have one full day, I would do this drive over the Golden Circle. We did the Golden Circle the next day. It was nice but not as spectacular are the Southern drive.

Once our family members left, we started our Ring Road tour. Since we had already seen the Southern sites, we got the ferry to go to Vestmannaeyjar Island at 12:30 and returned at 6:30. We took our car and would only recommend going it you could take your car. The island is small but the views are unbelievable. We did not do this, but I would highly recommend bringing a picnic from on of the grocery stores in Selfoss. The town was depressing and we could not find an open restaurant. We drove the whole way around the island with best view from the Pirates Beach, looking back to the mainland. We are anxious to get back on the ferry. 6 hours was too long to be there. With all the views coming up in on the Ring Road this side trip would not be important if you did not have the time.

For the rest of the ring road, I planned hikes and drives based on reviews. Everything worked out really well. The cottages and hotels could not have been nicer. When breakfast was included, each time is was great. We did buy bread, peanut butter, jelly, plastic knifes and plates only because we wanted to have freedom to do hikes more than plan on where to get lunches. I wished we had brought instant coffee, creamer and sugar from home. We would have enjoyed that in the nice cottages before we started for the day.

We enjoyed some very nice fish dinners but after taking so many pictures of baby lambs and watching them run and play, we really did not want to eat lamb. We did not want to eat horse either, so we avoided ""meat soup"". This was no problem since we did not come to Iceland for the food. As you probably heard, the hot dogs (which probably are made from these meats) are great and readily available to gas stations.
The gas station restaurant just a few miles north of the entrance to Skaftafell had a great selection of food and a very good hamburger.

I regret that we did not stay overnight in Hofn. We went to that town in the morning, so there was no chance of tasting the langoustine. We saw fisherman returning with their catch, but the restaurants were not going to be open until 6PM.

We really enjoyed Myvatn Natural Baths. Only about 10 people when we were there around 4PM. Lock up your towel with your clothes. Mine was stolen, making for a wet departure. We also enjoyed the hikes and views around the lake. Get local advise and maps, it makes it very clear versus the Lonely Planet.

The views were intoxicating in the east and the north. We loved walking through the old time part of Akureyi, as well as the center of town. We got the best advise about what to see in town from the N1 gas station at the end of the fjord right before you enter Akureyi.

Our favorite lodging was the cabin at Ytri Vik in Hauganes, in the north. We stayed for two days. Most beautiful view and a hot tub on porch.

The biggest mistake we made was to drive too much. The second day at Ytri Vik we were addicted to more views. Instead of taking hikes or just enjoying the view from the cottage, we took a one day drive around the Trollaskagi Peninsula. The views were great but the road had many frightening hairpin turns without guardrails. It also had three one way tunnels. In our opinion Stykkisholmur was not worth seeing. It would have been better to relax and do some hiking.

Another mistake was to drive to the Snaefellsness Peninsula in addition to the Ring Road. I would only recommend this peninsula if you did not have time for the Ring Road. After the views in the North and East, it is a let down. We heard from several locals that this is their favorite but we did not agree. Coming from the north, we were going to stay around Reykholt for our last night. Instead we decided to add about 6 hours of driving to see this peninsula. We took a right on Route 586 and 54 instead. This was more than 80 KM of gravel. Not at all relaxing for our last full day. It also extended our drive to the airport the next day.

We used the Lonely Planet guide throughout the trip and found it very accurate. The maps were better than what the rental car provided. The only error we found was the description of Reykjadalur. It said ""a 3km hike through fields of sulphur-belching plains."" It actual was 3.5km hike up a mountain first, but thermal stream where you can soak in was well worth it. When you get there, the stream is a y. The left side is the best. It is hotter as you walk further from the boardwalks. It is fun to try all different temperatures.

For the car rental, after the drive we were relieved to have gotten the maximum insurance possible. Although we had no damage, we could see how gavel, sand and some road conditions could damage the car. We did not take any F roads and did not need a 4 wheel drive.

I hope this answers some of the questions I had tried to figure out before we left. I think everyone should visit Iceland if possible. It is close to the east coast of the US. I think it is more scenic than Alaska, the Rockies, the Alps and any other place that I have been.

Iceland,VÃ­tor,Ring Road,5.0,"I was in Iceland from 27/02 till 05/03. Before going to Iceland, I did extensive research about doing the whole ring road in a campervan during the winter time in a week and I found the majority of the reviews discouraging it, especially because of possible blizzards, road blocks, etc. Still, I wanted to try and give it a go - and I'm glad I did.

This was a very ambitious idea. Even when I was on the plane, a lady sitting next to me who had visited Iceland several times (she's a dutch tour guide) was telling me not to risk it. I told myself once I reached Jokulsarlon, I would check on the road conditions and weather forecast. Depending on those, I would then decide if I'd move on to the north, or if I would stick to the south and explore it for the week.

I rented a campervan for the whole stay. It's not the most comfortable way, but it was alright for my standards. I started in Keflavik and started doing the route 1 counter clockwise. In the south the weather was fine, no problems at all. On the 2nd day, I reached Jokulsarlon at night, and this was the decisive point. The next morning, I explored the glacier area and the black beach accross the road. At around lunch time, after checking road conditions and weather forecast, I headed north.

I must say (and I would like to underline this statement) that I was very lucky with the weather. Absolutely no blizzards, heavy rain, or anything of the sort during the whole stay. The eastern coast is absolutely gorgeous and I'm very glad I could explore the good parts of the north, such as the Myvatnn area and Godafoss. I only needed to make a small detour in the northeast, as the road was blocked.

Keep in mind though that renting a campervan during the winter time can be very tricky in terms of hygiene. There are no camping sites open during this time. I even tried to talk to a guesthouse keeper if I could pay just to access the shower and she said no. Be conscious of this if you're visiting during this time, because if you book hostels during the majority of the nights, you end up making the campervan not that worthy, as one of its most prominent features of it is the money you save in lodging, which is very expensive in the country.I eventually booked 2 nights in hostels during the whole week to get access to showers - and that brought up my comfort levels sky high.

As a first visit to Iceland, I am very glad I got a taste of a lot of different areas of the country and the amount of sightseeing I did. I really want to go back and next time I will focus more on some of the areas, and I'll probably go in a different season.

So basicly, yes, it is possible to do the whole ring road in a week during winter time, if:
-> You're lucky with the weather - Check forecasts and road conditions constantly
-> You don't mind not showering everyday - It's fine as you won't sweat much during winter and there are not many people around in the whole country to smell you
-> You're fine with being a bit on the run - though the only time I felt pressured with time was when I doing the east coast, as I had booked a guesthouse in Myvatnn and I had to check in before 20h.

Iceland,Chua Ban Hoo,Ring Road,5.0,"The ring road is the best drive all over the world. It gives you an immense extra ordinary views of the snow peaks, glaciers, mountains and fjords. The scenery is extremely awesome and no others can match. It is worth the drive all over the ring road.
There are many attractions all along the ring road.",Mar 2016
Iceland,glasney1,Ring Road,5.0,"Here are some tips after a Ring Road trip from 20th Dec to 29th Dec 2015 that I would find helpful if researching it for the first time.

1. We spent nine days driving it which meant that we were not driving more that 6 hours in any one day-see itinerary below. We did allow 3 days in Seydisfjorder to enjoy Christmas- recommended. You could do in less with less time to stop and photograph- you do find yourself doing this a lot!
2. All pricing based on the British pound converting to 195 Icelandic krona
3. We used Blue car rental for a 4 x 4 Suzuki (needed in winter). Smooth car pick up and return with minimal formality. They meet you at the airport. Cost for 9 days rental was Â£515.
4. Fuel was equivalent of Â£1 per litre unleaded (diesel is cheaper). Filling up is easy- half are manned but more remote areas are automated. As others have noted, ensure your card works abroad with your PIN. Be warned, in the East from Hofn to Egilsstadir and from Egilsstadir to Akuyeri there are few if any petrol stations. As long as you try and ensure that your tank never dips below half, you will be fine.
5. Food- perhaps the biggest grey area of cost. Yes, more than at home but with checking out places ahead it does not have to be prohibitive. If you are eating in a restaurant, allow Â£25 per person for the main course plus alcohol (more expensive than UK but as with food- think London prices for an approximation). You can eat cheaper in the evening but probably not in hotels. Choose hotels/guest houses that include breakfast. That way you can eat heartily before you go and have some snacks in the car for lunch (or have a hot dog in one of the N1 stations). We spent slightly less than we budgeted- but we kept an eye on food spending. Fifty pound per day was the average cost for three of us to have lunch and evening meals (plus drinks). If you can self cater some of the time, this will help with food as the Bonus and Netto supermarkets are very reasonable. Alcohol, is only available outside of restaurants/bars from the government stores. There are online sites that show where they are - in winter the times are reduced but many open in the afternoon until 6pm.
6. Weather- you will read a lot about how variable it is and that is true. Our own recent experience has been to drive around a winter wonderland for most of our 9 days. That being said, we had challenging driving for 2 days ( heavy driving snow, very icy roads) and we had a 4 wheel drive. We were almost snowed in at out chalet in Seydisfjorder but the weather lifted just in time. Be sensible, plan ahead and have a road map with you in addition to sat nav (recommend the Reise Island map of Iceland 1:425000). Keep some drink and snacks in the car and DO NOT go off road.
7. Itinerary:
Sunday 20/12 Kevalik to Blue Lagoon 20 mins drive time
(you can stay as long as you want)
Sunday 20/12 Blue Lagoon to Reykavik 1 hour
(stayed in Reykjavik Lights- pizza next door)
Monday 21/12 Reykavik to Vik via Golden Circle- Thingveiler, Geysir,Gullfoss
about 7.5 hours with stops
(stayed in Icelandair Vik- good but a little pricey)
Tuesday 22/12 Vik- Hofn- via JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n lagoon en route about 4.5 hours with stop.
( Stayed at Dynjandi Guesthouse and drove in to Hofn for
evening meal at Kaffi Hornid- wooden chalet by road)
Weds 23/12 Hofn- SeyÃ°isfjÃ¶rÃ°ur 4 hours drive. (stayed in Langahlid Seydisfirdi-
with snow around - unbelievable)
Good supermarkets/fuel stations on way in Egilsstadir . Thick snow.
Thurs 24/12 ""
Fri 25/12 ""
Sat 26/12 SeyÃ°isfjÃ¶rÃ°ur - Akuyeri 6 hrs with photo stops
(the scenery in winter is stunning)
Sun 27/12 Akuyri-Reykholt 5 hrs (google states 3hrs 35 mins).
Stayed in Geirshlid Guesthouse- highly rated and rightfully so.
Mon 28/12 Reykholt- Reykjavik 2 hours unless you stop.
(stayed at Radisson Blu Saga- excellent stay contrary
to many reviews and a genuine pleasant 10 min walk to town).
Tuesday 29/12 Reyjavik- Kevlavik airport 50 mins

If you want to experience road that are often empty for miles then go for it. But plan ahead and dont be sloppy- if the weather closes in you want to feel that you have anticipated any problems. Some final suggestions- use the Icelandic road site for closure of road and the BETA web cam page- brilliant and essential. For those elusive Northen lights, the Icelandic weather site has a great Aurora forecast link.

Iceland,April M,Ring Road,5.0,"I was in Iceland for a week and decided not to do the whole ring road but instead drove from Reykjavik along the south coast up to Skaftafell National Park and back. It was the first time I had ever driven in another country and was a bit worried about driving on the ""wrong"" side. I also hadn't driven regularly in a number of years but found driving in Iceland very easy and enjoyed it immensely. We went in September and rented a small Clio (an automatic so I didn't have to think about changing gear with my right hand) . The ring road is pretty quiet once you've passed Selfoss. Beware of the wind though, there were times where the car got swept about a bit. We got the car ferry across to the WestmannIsland for a day then drove up to Skaftafell. We did the drive back in one day which only took around 5 hours, with a few sight seeing stops. There are petrol stations along the way, good idea to just to see where the stations are so you don't run out. Doing a small part of the road allowed us to spend a few days in each place which was great. I downloaded a free Icelandic traffic sign app which told you the meanings of all the different signs. It was so useful. Most of them were obvious, but for example, they have a one way bridge sign that I'd never seen before, luckily I had seen it on the app otherwise I'd have been unsure of what it meant. Driving the ring road is such an experience and really is the best way to see more of Iceland. Unfortunately we didn't have time/or the right car to venture into the interior but will definitely do that next time!

Iceland,smjbab,Ring Road,5.0,"Some general tips on the Iceland ring road- do it in summer! Was there in April and the weather was horrendous at times. I grew up in the northeast and have never seen weather like that. The best is the Icelanders thought nothing of it! they are a tough, hardy people!!

Ring Road- clockwise or counter-clockwise? Depends on if you are an instant or delayed gratification type. Clockwise front loads the long stretches of driving. There doesnât seem to be a lot to the northwest. I decided counter clockwise because there are sights and stopoffs every two hours until more than halfway around, then it stretches to 4-5 hours between destinations. I had kids, 7 and 10, and thought theyâd need to be interested sooner rather than later.

Day 1- arrive in the AM, nap in Reykjavik flat using airbnb, blue lagoon- awesome! People say it's touristy, I'm sure that's true, I didn't really care, the place is outrageous.

Day 2- Golden Circle- used Geoiceland, excellent tour! This was our one guided tour the whole trip, well worth it, got tons of information, was great to be bused around instead of finding our own way.

Day 3- Begin ring road tour counter clockwise- Reykjavik to Vik, about 2 hours drive. stopped to see seljalandsfoss, and glufurarbui waterfalls- amazing! Parked right off the road, right by the waterfall. Little did we know that most of the rest of what we saw in Iceland would make us work a lot harder than that!! Like Seljavallalaug, a concrete hotspring in a valley about a mile hike off the road. Amazing location but the spring was lukewarm and changing areas were pretty gross. Worth it though- great hike but if you have any physical issues, skip it (in fact, skip Iceland- if you are not physically fit and motivated, this is not the vacation destination for you!). Slept in Gardar guesthouse- has to be one of the most beautiful place on earth.

Day 4- Vik to Hofn. 3.5 hours driving (took 5.5 because of the sudden bad weather) How is Vik not a major tourist destination?? I could have spent days here (actually, thatâs true of everywhere we went in Iceland). Rynisdragur (sea stacks), horseback riding on the black sand beaches Hvoll- great horse farm, really nice and accommodating!, reynisfjall. This whole area was gorgeous! There were also Viking caves and super cool rock formations nearby, we just happened to find them. we also tried to hike on the sulheimajokull glacier but were too tired. Tried to see Glacier Lagoon but had to drive past it, major white out, couldnât see a thing. This was a big bummer. We stayed in the Hofn hotel- expensive, but very nice, much needed spot of civilization.

Day 5: Hofn to Lake Myvatn, supposed to take 3.5 hours- took 6, at least! We didnât do anything or stop anywhere really, didnât seem to be much obvious to do other than stop to take pictures along the road. I hadnât done as much research on this leg. Also, we were starting to get exhausted from the harrowing driving- day before was a white out, this day we didnât really know where we were or where we were going, our phones didnât work, the ring road turned into a gravel road and then stopped- was closed going over a mountain pass. That was an unpleasant surprise. We had to backtrack an hour and hug the fjords. For people who like driving in spectacularly beautiful places, this is heaven on earth. For people anxious to get to the next destination, or with young restless kids in the car, or just nervous nellies in general, this could be a bummer. We fell somewhere in the middle.

Day 6: Lake Myvatn: (pronounced meevah) By the time we got here we were exhausted. In retrospect, we should have turned around at Glacier lagoon and taken our time heading home. That said, we saw the pseudocraters which were very cool, Dimmuborgir was amazing. Lake myvatn hot springs were gorgeous- on par with the Blue Lagoon, it was slightly smaller and much less populated. The facilities were newer as well. There was supposedly a lights-out waterfall nearby, and a big volcano crater we could have hiked but again we were done at this point- had seen too much, done too much in too little time. We stayed at the Vogafjos Guesthouse. The restaurant was great- dinner, breakfast buffet was wonderful, being able to meet the indoor cattle was a hoot, drinking fresh, raw milk was...interesting, but very appreciated! We weren't crazy about the guesthouses- we were 4 people staying in what was essentially a cabin. they'd have been way better off with two bunk beds and a couple of couches. As it was, there was no where to walk or sit, except around or on the beds. Not a place you want to do anything other than sleep, so I guess pretty uncomfortable. Kind of reminded me of a bare bones dorm room.

Day 7- Husavik. drove from Myvatn to the quaint fishing village/city of Myvatn. went whale watching with gentle giants. It wasn't the season, but still got to see a humpback- very cool. Drove from Husavik to Hvammstangi, which we picked as a halfway point to Reykjavik. Nice little town with at least one (totally unexpected) posh high end restaurant. I really don't think a comparable 1000 person town in the US would have a restaurant like that. Stayed at Hvammstangi Cottages basically just a warm room to crash in, served us right at that point.

Day 8- Hvammstangi back to Reykjavik. Toyed with the idea of hitting the Blue Lagoon one more time, decided instead to eat and shop in town, then head to the airport.

Overall, I am STUNNED at how incredible iceland is on so many levels. This was a huge hit with my kids- it felt like adventure travel. I'm happy to answer any questions.

a note on the Northern lights- that was our whole reason for going to Iceland. Didn't realize what a crapshoot it is to actually see them. Thankfully we got really lucky one rare clear night. It was beyond spectacular. However every other night- nothing. So that was 7:1 odds of not seeing them :(

Iceland,"Yannis F Chatzis, CFA",Ring Road,5.0,"I went to Iceland for 1 week and i read around reviews about the ring road not being possible to complete in 7 days. Well my answer is that this is really possible driving 200 km a day which is not even 2 hours. The cost of fuel will be approximately 300 euros and the cost to rent a cheap car something around 450 euros. If you go in Iceland for more than 5 days, just go for the ring road... (don't forget to fuel up all the time)",Nov 2015
Iceland,Seven W,Ring Road,5.0,"This is a must to drive Ring Road in Iceland. We rented an economy car from Enterprise because I could get refund when we return a car early. At least Enterprise Keflavik Airport, they seem to rent the car back-to-back without any thorough inspection. After our trip, we know how much abuse a rental car would go through after one customer because we abused the hell out of our car.

Ring Road goes through most of Iceland. But if you have time, go off Ring Road. Most likely these roads are gravel (not all the way most of the time), but scenery was amazing, e.g. west fjord. Big note, if you don't have 4WD, don't go to F roads ever. I saw a tourist going to F road with VW. And, for god sake, please just don't park your car in one-lane R1. We saw more than a few times. This is just common sense.

We took a little more than 2 weeks to do Ring Road. We regretted that we didn't explore more in east Iceland.

Tips:
* Bring a tire pressure gauge. We put too much air in the mid trip as the tires looked very low. One tire bursted on R1, luckily near Keflavik Airport where Enterprise Rental is at. We saw a rental car abandoned on the top of mountain in west fjord with burst tire.
* Stock up groceries. Sometimes we arrived the hotel after 8pm, and no restaurant was open. Sometimes we just didn't find any grocery stores, gas stations, or restaurants.
* If you don't drive a car in your home country, learn the basics on how to change tire, what to check when you have problems, ...etc. Even though your rental car company would send someone, chances are it'll take a long time to get where you are at.
* Make sure your cell phone works in Iceland. As our AT&T & T-Mobile iPhones are locked, we couldn't use Siminn SIM card.
* Record any small scratches or dent.
* If It's raining when you rent a car, make sure to wipe the window for any cracks.
* Gravel Protection is a min must. We drove so many gravel roads in our trips.
* Check fluid levels before signing the rental car contract. We had to add engine oil as Engine started coughing noise.
* Buy N1 Gas Cards. Our car takes about ISK 7,000 to fill up. While at N1, gran some paper napkins. It'd come in handy handy when you're checking fluid levels.

Iceland,MaMilbs,Ring Road,5.0,"So we have had a somewhat tricky past few years with job challenges, family members deaths and near misses of our own and we wanted to have a holiday that made us feel alive. Where do you go with three children 13, 11 and 11 who arenât the sitting around relaxing type oh and parents who arenât either! Throw into that the budget â not huge and a restriction to the school holidays. Well we usually take a caravan away and enjoy giving the children the kind of freedom that is cited as a memory for those over a certain age: the opening of the door with the knowledge theyâll come back when theyâre hungry. But no this year we wanted/needed/deserved a treat: something special, something for everyone and memorable (for the right reasons). Yup Iceland â plenty to see, not too hot (quite cold in fact), manageably short flights. Well I guess it is a marmite country because the reactions we got when we told people we were going ranged from âOh thatâs different, not for me thoughâ or âWow you know thatâs somewhere Iâve always wanted to goâ or âOoh itâs really expensive over thereâ and âMy Mum went to Reykjavik and loved itâ.
We printed off an A4 map and were really pleased to find out that there was a road that travels all the way around the country (Route 1) (it is the only route!!!) and by following that you have the possibility of seeing most of the recommended tourist sites. Perfect but where to stayâ¦
Well you might have already guessed weâre not really hotel types so we started out looking at the possibility of hiring a campervan and travelling around: but as we were going in the summer and the F roads are open we wanted to explore them and in a campervan that really isnât possible. (F roads â theyâre the ones that only open when the weather is good â probably about 5 months of the year). But this could have been a really cheap option for the five of usâ¦.hmm time for a rethink as Dad really wanted the âoff-roadâ experience. Well we stumbled across Booking.com and Holidaylettings.com â they had cottages we could rent and use as bases. Perfect and many even had hotpots (not Betty from Corry sausage and beans hot pots but proper hot tubs!) After lots of deliberation we decided to book 3 cottages strategically placed around the country and explore from them. The last night would be in a b&b at the airport. Dad got his own way and we hired a 4x4 Jeep Grand Cherokee! (hehe it was hideous to drive and my âstyleâ in it really scared him so he did all of the driving!)
I ought to mention the midnight sun: a phenomenon not to be missed but how odd. Your body says sleep (it does a lot nowadays though) and your eyes say party time. Ah and for the children I would definitely recommend sleep masks â I made the mistake of trying to buy them online and now have some seriously 50 Shades recommended purchases; pound shop a safer bet! (And the kids look so cute sleeping with them on, bless!)
So the first cottage we booked was a lush little cottage just 10 minutes from the airport, with a hotpot in the garden. What a jem. We were able to use this base to explore Reykjavik, Geysir, Gulfoss and the Reykanes Peninsular including the transcontinental bridge; we did get a trip to the Blue Lagoon in too. Classic who knew that rejuvenating mud could be applied all over with showers in between applications (11 year old boy), needless to say they put someone on duty doling out the mud and we werenât invited to return! The kids were all delighted that they could now legitimately casually swear: slush puppy is called Krap â hmmm guess what their favourite drink became? We saw a low energy power station, boiling mud, geysirs, nesting birds, waterfalls and lighthouses; we even thought we might have caught a glimpse of a whale but I think it was wishful thinking more than anything else.

After three sleeps we had to move on â I donât mind cooking on holiday but I do object to cleaning so we paid for cleaning and linen at each property.
Top tip take packed lunches/snacks as you can drive long distances between cafes. There are not cafes at all of the tourist sites. Also a loo roll in the boot advisable as there arenât many loos on long journeys. Fill up when you can!
Well the journey North was long (longer than we thought it would be what with the hideous 4x4 and the speed limit of 56mph) but the cottage was exquisite. The owner had described it as luxury and it really was â based up on a hill overlooking Akeyuri with waterfalls coming down behind and snow on the ground. So from here we visited Akeyuri and Myvtan. Well Akeuri was hilarious as a cruise ship was in the harbour so the town was heaving with overdressed, over wealthy and over cameraed American tourists. The kids, by now were missing wifi and would have sold me and their father for a quick go so we sidled up to the moored âCosta Fortunaâ (ha ha who would have ever come up with that name?) and tried to log onto their wifi â huh tight lot have passwords! Akeyuri is a lovely town and there were shops to explore but were pretty tired from the journey so really made a poor stab at it. Myvtan is an amazing lake with fantastic lava field area to explore (Dummiâ¦) We climbed up the side of volcano which had a crater of 1km then we went in the natural baths! Hmmmm they sell themselves as the Blue Lagoon of the North and they are, to be fair, lovely except for the smell! (Oh and something to bear in mind in Iceland they donât appear to chemicalise their pools much so they expect you to shower naked (they are very strong about this) before you enter the pool) (In places there were changing room assistants checking on the nakedness!!! â great if you are travelling with prudish 11 and 13 year old girls who clearly have bodies that are so different from anyone elses they cannot be seen in public). Well after pretending to have enjoyed it for an hour âOh itâs so good for you, you can feel the magic of the waterâ we had a quick Krap and left.
Ah yes for the health and safety conscious â hmmmm Iceland seems to employ a âif you are stupid enough to step off the edge of the cliff, waterfall, into the boiling mud you deserve what is coming to you policyâ. They might put up a small string in places of real danger just to help you out.
So after Akeyuri we trekked down to Hofn to explore the South. To get there we travelled on route 1 and were surprised to find that parts of this road are only passable if you have a 4x4, it is gravel and to be honest a bit scary in places. By this stage we realised that we needed to break up the final leg of our journey so we had shortened our stay in Hofn to two nights and booked into a mountain cabin for one night â near Vik. All of the towns have swimming pools so we swum in the town pool at Hofn â which was wonderful and we caused a great deal of entertainment by challenging ourselves to lurch between the icebath and superhot hotpot! (The locals are probably still talking about the crazy English family). We drove out to a meeting point to be taken up onto the glacier â this road was properly scary and as I was up in the front performed the grip scene out of Planes, Trains and Automobiles â yup the dashboard probably still has an imprint of my nails. Now we were not so lucky with the weather â it was cloudy but weâd survived the journey so we were jolly well going to take ski-doos out! The instructions were given, briefly, and off we went. Our guide would stop every so often to check we were still there and not fallen into one of the crevasses â he even went back (taking one of my children for the ride) to look for people. Even though we couldnât see much it was a great experience and we all loved it.
Now have I told you yet that all of the natural exploration you do is free? Yes thatâs right â Geysir, the waterfalls everything except for swimming pools and excursions. Even the parking is free too â so you can see and do loads; we must admit that we spent too much time saying âWell in England that would have cost Â£80 for us!â (we also smiled at all of the speed cameras, Griswold style!)
We left Hofn and drove towards Vik with plans to go out on a boat at the Glacier Lagoon â all I can say is it was a magical place and the boat trip really wasnât necessary. It is this lagoon where chunks of glacier fall into and then turn into icebergs and make their way out to sea. The family and I spent ages there. The kids spent hours pelting icebergs with stones and Dad even joined in kicking one in to retrieve a stone for me that had been stuck in a glacier for probably 1000 years. (I keep it in my coat pocket) (and no we werenât the only ones doing destroying â it was an international male/young person bonding ritual.) So from there we journeyed in land to our cabin â Helga had agreed to lend us bedding as part of the price but this was not a normal service. Ok so the cabin was small and basic but it was in the most beautiful location. The dining area of the campsite was a cave, yes a cave all lit with tea light candles. There was a waterfall on site and it was worth the 20km gravel road journey to get there. Clearly we are spoilt Brits because by now there was a pattern emerging â weâd spend a journey making comments such as âOh thank heavens we have a 4x4 weâd have never got here otherwiseâ and âhow do people manage without a 4x4?â to arrive at our destination to be met by the sight of what became a ubiquitous Toyota Auris and a Campervan. We didnât stay long in our cabin as the 11 girl had developed an inextinguishable desire to see Puffins, Dad also announced heâd always wanted to too so we set off having discovered there was a nest site nearby. We werenât holding our breath but to our pure delight there were loads to see in fact to quote Dad âThereâs bloody hundreds of the thingsâ. One happy daughter.
So now to complete our holiday Dad wanted to do some serious off roading and fording. Many of the rivers we had passed were commented âI could have forded thatâ with accompanying support from the boy child! Well on the way to edge of the Eyjafallerâ¦. Glacier (our chosen off road experience!) we visited the coolest waterfall â it had a cave behind so you could actually walk behind it. Now that made us all happy (but not happy enough to forget the off road/ford bonanza!).
Well we travelled in land over rocks and gravel, through water and saw the point beyond which no Aurisâs or campervans could go. We got to the edge of the glacier and parked in what had been a lake before the eruption of 2010. We made a stone heap (an Icelandic thing!). We had truly seen and explored Iceland to the max. Everyone had new experiences we had achieved our dream: a perfect summer holiday for our family. We turned back and crossed all of the fords again, laughed at the no further point for the Aurisâs and made our way back to the airport. So with sadness that it was all over we checked in at the B&B, handed over the keys and prepared to return. We would definitely say if you are thinking of going just go for it, it is amazing and wonderful. No itâs not really expensive and it only cost us cÂ£1,000 per head all in. The only question we ask now is â where next?

Iceland,Dianne D,Ring Road,5.0,"After nine days and 830+ miles we finished our journey around the Ring Road of Iceland! :)

Now that we've made the journey we are so eager for our fellow travelers to book their first trip to Iceland. It is such an amazing experience.

Here are the kind of things to keep in mind to determine if an Iceland road trip is right for you:

If you're searching for an unforgettable adventure travel experience, a road trip around Iceland's Ring Road is for YOU. It really is tough to describe in words. But the country is visually captivating in ways we have not seen elsewhere. Lurking around every turn is a stunning new landscape that reveals itself. As you drive Icelandâs Ring Road you will see bubbling geothermal springs; completely random, sparkling rainbows; beautiful horses, tumultuous waterfalls, and rugged mountains in a single day. And of course sheep - - lots of sheep!!!

Now repeat for 7 - 8 days, throw in the occasional glacial ice cave and many volcanoes, and youâll start to appreciate what traveling in Iceland is actually about. However you simply must experience the country for yourself (and be prepared to make a lot of stops!) to understand!

Some things we grew to love:

1. Coffee or Kaffi - - no one does hot, strong, bold coffee like Iceland. I loved my morning and nighttime coffee. I will never see my Keurig in the same light again! I am thinking the sparkling clean glacial water is part of what makes the difference. Just so yum!

2. Hot Dogs - oh Icelandic hot dogs, I will miss you as a quick lunch on a tight time schedule!! I cannot believe I've had one a day for the past week and a half! I have always disliked hot dogs but now I know it's because we don't do them right!! It's about the right dog, grilled bun, spicy mustard and the Cronions - - - !!!! YUM! A great, quick lunch to keep you going on your adventure.

3. Fjords - - how I love Fjords! Around every bend is a new and exciting experience. So many mountains, waterfalls, green landscapes, and lovely towns!

4. Waterfalls - - I just have to mention them again. It's easy to see 4-5 waterfalls a mile as you drive the Ring Road. They are just everywhere, cascading down the green mountains. I am so glad we got to see them in the summer where they sparkle against the greenery like flowing diamonds.

5. Rainbows and Lavender Night Skies - - seriously - these are pretty common. Random rainbows pop up everywhere. Either hovering over a waterfall or randomly appearing in the sky. We saw complete rainbows numerous times. Alas - there was never a pot of gold! And the lavender skies appear right after the sun goes down and the stars begin to appear. The entire sky turns a beautiful lavender - - positively break taking!!!

6. Tiny Towns - we fell in love with Iceland's tiny, prosperous towns. With so much sparse population in between, Iceland's remote towns are a big deal. You can go miles and miles with no services and then you see a town of 200 people that looks like Chicago to you!!! These towns are central meeting places with services and community that are vital to the people of Iceland and her visitors.

7. English - thank goodness that nearly everyone is Iceland speaks English. It was so nice to be able to go pretty much anywhere and be able to converse and understand. Icelandic is a very difficult language and it's hard to be able to look at the words to figure things out. I am so thankful that the people of Iceland take the time to speak English so all of us can figure out how to get around..

8. Physicality - without a doubt this was the most physical trip we have ever been on. Between climbing to the tops of waterfalls, walking across lava fields, and traversing up to volcano rims we have never worked so hard on a vacation in our lives. But each effort was so worth it. There is nothing like the sense of accomplishment after working so hard and being rewarded by a view few people take the time to see. It was invigorating, rewarding, and all that glacial air really cleared our minds!

9. Assessability - for Americans, Iceland is not as far away as you would think. Once you get to Boston you can catch direct service through Iceland Air. It's about a 4.5 hour flight - - piece of cake. And if you watch for specials you can find a round trip for around $525 or so.

Also - Iceland is a place that is in reach for everyone, regardless of budget. Many people rent small campers and sleep in them as they go. There are many who tent. Or you can stay in guesthouses or hotels that fit any budget. If you want to go to Iceland, there is a way to make it fit your vacation dollars.

10. Our Travel Company - All-Iceland - we cannot say enough about this company. Solveig and her team really know how to get you around Iceland in one piece. We are so glad we went through them or we never would have been able to stay on track. Their perfectly timed itinerary made sure we saw all the things we wanted and them some. If you decide to go to Iceland start by going to their website - all-iceland.co.uk and review the various packages. Even though they are a UK company the time difference was no issue. Each morning we would wake-up with answers to our email questions. So - give Solveig a shout at info@all-iceland.co.uk

It was an adventure we will always remember. My husband and I are such good travel partners and we loved our time together in such an amazing place!! In fact - we already have our sights on a return trip!! This time to the Western Fjords. They are not on the ring road and we hear their are endless treasures to be seen! :)

Iceland,Graham,Ring Road,3.0,Great views but be prepared for the crazy coach drivers and dreadful road surfaces. We had a basic car which really struggled,Aug 2015
Iceland,Kairho1,Ring Road,5.0,"We consulted with a tour company mainly to facilitate hotel bookings and for backup services, got a rental car and headed out for an 18 day ride along the Ring Road and many nearby roads. Was an excellent adventure, exciting at times, a bit boring at times, but always with the promise for something new and really different around the corner.

We went counterclockwise and although I cannot call it the best direction, it sure worked out well for us. This only thing I would advise is to skip the Westfjords and spend those 3 or 4 days relaxing more on the main circuit. There's not really all that much that hasn't already been seen to spend the time.

Iceland,Susan K,Ring Road,5.0,"We did a self drive trip around the Ring Road this past July and it was amazing. There is so much to see right off the RIng Road- gorgeous water falls, hiking spots, etc. We rented a 4 wheel drive vehicle that we could use on F roads. Even though we went in the summer, many roads were just opened of still closed due to a late winter- so make an alternative plan in case of weather and road closing.
Things to take in consideration in terms of the car is gas, having a gps or downloading an appropriate app for your cell phone is very helpful, and having a phone card. We did not rent from a place that provide a cell card and found the people of Iceland very helpful. Representatives at visitor centers called ahead for reservations, etc. Depending on which country you are coming from, you might need a pin number to get gas or you can purchase a N1 gas card. You can not purchase a card at the self serve stations and often the gas stations on the Ring Road are far apart. We have met people that ran out of gas. Also there are no mile markers so it is difficult to pinpoint your location if you are out of gas. We ended up with extra money on our Ni card as we purchased several after a close call looking for gas. If you end up with extra money, you can always buy items, other than gas such as snacks, drinks etc. at the full service stations. There were other stations that did accept our credit card but again you are taking a chance and we made it a habit of always filling up when we were between 3/4 or 1/2 full after two incidents of looking for gas.
Another important tip is to be careful of the animals crossing the road. In most places we did not see fences on the ship would dart out in front of you. Also, carry a garbage bag in your car. Iceland is the cleanest country I have ever visited and along the Ring Road we saw few garbage cans.
What to see- We picked up ou car at the airport and started driving to the Golden Circle- highlights which I will individually review include Pingveiller National Park, Gullfoss waterfall, and Geysir, not Yellowstone but still worth seeing. We planned on doing Landmannalaugar but the F road was closed so vistied a wonderful tomotoe green house and a few other sites. We went to Akureyri and saw their amazing church and went to the best restauant of our trip- Rub 23, see my review. We drove to the Myvatn region and saw the Dettifoss waterfall, Skuitustagigar, Dimmuborgir,

Iceland,nmontesa877,Ring Road,5.0,"A must do in Iceland if you want to experience all of Iceland, but be careful and don't take the trip lightly. Stupid people die in Iceland and no amount of lawsuit is going to cure that for those American travelers. For my wife and I, it was a grand trip enjoying all of Iceland, it's beauty and danger. In our early May 2015 trip, we experience the Ring Road covered with snow and ice. We experience white blind out as the winds whipped around our Jeep. We traveled high up the mountains and see high cliffs. It's not for the faint of heart, but it will show you how people is so small relative to what nature is all about. I recommend it as a bucket list item. We aim to go back, but this time see West Iceland.",May 2015
Iceland,Ed G,Ring Road,5.0,"We began our adventure on Monday June 14th . We started in Reyjkavik and traveled counterclockwise. We did the whole Ring Road with some side trips to the interior in 9 days. We drove 1,535 in those 9 days. It was an unbelievable journey the landscape was constantly changing and the scenery is unbelievable. It is best to plan your trip so you get to see many of the famous sites.Also by speaking to the locals in various towns you can get vital information to see sights not all tourists see. It is important to plan your trip and book your hotels ahead of time especially in the summer. Also a four wheel drive is the best allows you to travel all the gravel roads. It was an unbelievable adventure and I would highly recommend doing it.

Iceland,ECPONTAZA,Ring Road,5.0,"Driving in Iceland is a beautiful thing. The sights are impressive. Driving by glaciers, black sand beaches, lava fields, and glacial lagoons with floating icebergs that find their way into the ocean, underneath your car as you drive on top of a bridge. Just remembering it makes me smile at the beauty of Iceland and its ring road! Be careful, don't drive too fast, respect the local laws!",May 2015
Iceland,Stefanie04,Ring Road,5.0,If you have the time it is well worth it to rent a car and drive around Iceland's Ring Road. We detoured a bit to the Westfjords and to Snaefells Peninsula (both I would highly recommend if you have 12 days or more to drive). Do not be scared of the gravel roads. They are maintained and we managed them in a 2wd Toyota Yaris. Just stay clear of F Roads (which are clearly marked as such). Driving on one in a rented car is not allowed and voids all insurance.,Jun 2015
Iceland,Muffingg,Ring Road,5.0,"We travelled around the Ring Road beginning of June 2015 and really loved it. We first looked at it as just a means of transport, but it is a lot more than just that. Travelling on the Ring Road is in itself an attraction. You start in a very populated area around Reykjavik and there will be few villages coming up until just after Selfoss. After that simply enjoy the landscape.

It starts with a very scenic drive with the black sand beach on one side and a cliff on the other. The beach gets smaller and smaller until you are driving right next to the North Atlantic Ocean. A lot of stops should be planned as you will want to stop every few kilometers. You will see Glaciers on the left, drive past Jokulsarlon, a lot of single lane bridges, and blind hills.

After going past the town of Hofn, it becomes really good (my favourite part of the Ring Road). If you drive through the 96 and 92 instead of the Route 1, you will drive right through the Eastfjords, which are really scenic. Towns are very few here, so be sure to fill up whenever half full (or half empty if you're a pessimist). You will see some landscapes with moss as far as you can see with mountains and/or volcanoes in the far distant. Stop over to just experience the complete silence in the middle of nowhere.

After Egilsstadir to Myvatn Area, you will be driving through a lot of mountains, which look amazing as they will be filled with snow. At some places we even saw how a waterfall was being produced right from the point where the ice was melting. Driving along Myvatn is again really beautiful and it really doesn't get any worse when driving to Akureyri or back to Reykjavik.

Just be sure that the margin for error is very small. For most of the Ring Road, the road is on an inclined surface, around 2 metres above the ground, so a slight error could mean you could find yourself on the side of the road.

Overall, it's a great experience and the drive is very much an attraction on its own. Make sure to get a gopro or something similar to record driving through the scenic landscapes.

Iceland,Maya1233333333333333,Ring Road,5.0,"The locals kept telling me this was colder than it should be this time of year. The scenery was lovely, especially the snowy sections. I saw a large waterfall still half frozen, some lakes were still frozen and ice in one place was washing up on a beach and floating on the nearby river. All the roads were clear of snow, except for those in the north-west, where they were white and icy, sometimes with snow blowing across the road and the snow bank edging over. This was the first time I had driven in snowing, white, icy conditions, but I got through, although I had one fright at the top of an icy hill, when the wind caught my little car and slid it sideways across the road. I thought I was going off the road, but fortunately I managed to steer away from the situation. The winds were very strong. My little rental car came with winter tyres. The roads were lonely; I would not see another car for long stretches. After arriving at one destination late afternoon, for instance, I checked the road condition map and saw only 28 cars had driven that section of roads since midnight. It was an experience and the scenery lovely. After I finished driving the route, the roads cleared.

Iceland,Bob C,Ring Road,5.0,"We drove the Ring Road in 6 days, and totally loved it! So much different/changing scenery and so many things to stop and see/do along the way. We even saw 3 separate herds of reindeer in fields along the road. Fun! The only concern is that the road conditions were sometimes challenging. There was a lot of snow and ice in sections, and one section of the road was even closed for a while. Drive carefully! But enjoy the adventure!",Mar 2015
Iceland,Chr15t1n3,Ring Road,5.0,"We drove this route in May. The weather was a little chilly, the roads were not very busy, nor were the attractions. Very easy to get around. We did not use a GPS. Instead we would plan our day the night before and just take screenshots of where our hotel was located. The system worked for us. Give yourself about 2 weeks to drive with no pressure.

I would not recommend the drive in winter due to unpredictable road conditions. The ring road itself can be narrow at times, with little/no shoulder and there are a lot of one lane bridges/passes. The road is also VERY windy. We planned for approx. 300km of driving a day. It would take us hours to do though because we would stop at a lot of interesting points along the way. And because the road is not straight, parts can get a little exhausting.

If you do the route during the busy summer season, you may want to plan/prebook hotels as Iceland is becoming more popular as a tourist destination.

Gas is expensive here so keep that in mind. And if you plan to drive any dirt roads (or those identified as F roads) in the interior, you will need a 4WD of some sort.

Iceland,Heather N,Ring Road,5.0,"Definetly a must do!

Winter was a little unpredictable at time but driving around Iceland (the ring road and beyond) was superb. The weather we encountered including crazy snow blizzards and two of the worst storms of winter iceland had to offer but, hostel owners were amazing at keeping you up to date with road conditions, the iceland met office had road conditions map, aurora probability map and weather apps so it made it as safe as possible.

The views are incredible and at every turn I wanted to take another photo. You must do it!

Me and my boyfriend plan to come back in summer to see iceland and all its incredible views in a different season! But don't let winter put you off! It's a safe country and a beautiful sight to see!

Iceland,TravelingGianelos,Ring Road,2.0,"REPEAT: ""Don't Drive the Ring Road in Winter"". After reading several reviews where people successfully drove the ring road, we arrogantly thought we could duplicate that effort. We started off on a beautiful balmy day in Reykjavik in February and headed out of town in our rental car. About 3 miles up, it started lightly snowing. Within five minutes, we were in a whiteout. Several cars at the side of the road were hopelessly stranded in deep snow. While the professional expedition vehicles with tires the size of our car whizzed past us, we very carefully turned the car around and inched back down. We didn't see the aurora because the weather thwarted us at every turn, although it was active in some parts that week. We might not have anyway, but I think we would have had a much better experience in Iceland had we gone with professional tours that are well prepared for the unpredictable Iceland weather.

I thought we'd have more time to hike, but we took for granted how much time it takes to organize the van, make meals, clean up, prep the bed, etc. when living out of a camper van.

Iceland,curtishinton,Ring Road,5.0,"I visited Iceland for the first time in October of 2014 with my college age daughter. We did the Golden Circle our first day in country, then did the Southwest Coast on day two, day three was a day at the Blue Lagoon. This is when the tough decision was upon us. We had one more full day and one 1/2 day. We decided our last 1/2 day we were going to just stay in Reykjavik and see the sites. So we had one full day to do something. We decided on a very early start with the intent of driving to Lake Myvatn and spending some time there. So we embarked well before sunlight knowing that the first 2 hours we had driven two days prior while visiting the SouthWest coast. As the sun was rising we were venturing on parts of the ring road we had not visited. We saw one jaw dropping vista after another. Since it was mid-October many of the off-road options weren't viable so we stayed on the Ring Road just enjoying the scenery. We drove non-stop until we reached Blondus, where we drove around the quaint fishing village. We pressed onward to Akureyri where we had breakfast/lunch. Very pleasant people and picturesque town. We then moved on, enjoying the beautiful views. We stopped for a time at Godafoss waterfall which was spectacular. We then pressed on to Lake Myvatn. The landscape continued to change throughout the drive. Myvatin was beautiful. We stopped and admired the large caldera just across from the lake and then took the one hour hike around the lava field and lava tubes. Again this late in the year, we couldn't see many of the sites off the main road. So it was decision time. 1:30 in the afternoon do we turn around and go back the same way to Reykavik 6.5 hour drive or press on and do the entire ring road. We decided to press on and see as much as possible before darkness set in around 6:45 pm. We weren't disappointed. The bottom line is that Iceland is like the combination of Hawaii, Alaska, and quaint European towns/villages. We still had light as we drove through fjord country. We stopped and walked around a beach. We did run out of light around Hofn. We knew we would and would miss the great views in the SouthEast of Iceland. So after 12 hours, we had night driving through sheep land (almost hit one of them). The adventure wasn't over. We had heard about the dearth of gas stations and found out first hand. We had over 1/2 of a tank when we passed Hofn and it was around 6:30. We intended on stopping for dinner and fueling up down the road. Hour after hour passed and no fuel. We came upon one small town but its only gas station closed early. We were still about two hours away from Reykjavik just under a 1/4 tank of fuel. Our last hope was another small town 30 minutes away. We were exceeding the recommended speed to make town by 9pm. We pulled up to the only gas station at 9:03. They had closed but were kind enough to allow us to fuel up. We would not have made it to Reykjavik on the fuel we had remaining. Very relieved we grabbed some snacks at the gas station and pressed onward. We arrived back at our hotel at midnight. We had spend 18 hours making the loop. It was crazy but a wonderful adventure not soon forgotten. Iceland is magnificent. Of course, I would recommend a longer stay and taking a week around the ring road exploring each area. But for us, it was great fun and will be coming back for more adventure. That was 18 hours ignoring the recommended speed (Ahem...). For much of the way we had the road to ourselves. We hugged the middle of the road and kept a safe but very expeditious speed. Had to slow it down at night in sheep country. After dark it was us and an occasional 18 wheeler with a huge set of additional lights up top (evidently to spot sheep in and beside the road.)

Iceland,Basildso,Ring Road,5.0,"The beauty of the Ring Road, is that is largely isolated, with dotted vehicular traffic. On either side, Icelandâs evolving scenery makes it hard to keep your eyes on the road. The lush countryside with grazing horses on green meadows, makes for wonderful photographic opportunities. However, you canât stop on the ring road except for towns or designated photographic spots. Shortly after the town of Hveragerdi, we stopped for a break at Selfoss. You will find a gas station, deserted mall and a subway outlet just as you make an entry into the town. We proceeded further to the town of Hella. We made our next stop at Seljalandfoss. Clear white waters gush from the edge of a cliff to a pool, 200 m below. Whatâs fascinating, is that you can choose to walk around the waterfall, and literally witness what it looks from behind.
This is a memorable road trip, though unfortunately we did not complete it.

Iceland,EliseNor,Ring Road,5.0,"The ring road is such an amazing experience I recommend everybody to try. My boyfriend and I set out with a tent and a 4WD-car, later known as ""Good Ol' Red Tours"", in June, and I had no idea what to suspect.

Our route was as following: Reykjavik-EyjafellajÃ¶kull-HÃ¶fn-Atlavik (Lake LagarfljÃ³t)-HÃºsavik- Asbyrgi-ÃlafsfjÃ¶rdur-Borgarnes-Reykjavik.

We had bought a tent, sleeping mattress, a cooler, sleeping bags, blankets and food beforehand. We both brought hiking shoes and good and warm clothing.

We got very lucky with the weather and it was warm and sunny on almost the entire trip. It was of course cold in the nights, but a good and warm sleeping bag did the trick. Along the way we went to JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n, we went horseback riding the east and we went on a whale watching tour in the north. It was a fantastic trip, and it really showed that Iceland is much more than Reykjavik.

It started very well with a rather cold night under EyjafjellajÃ¶kull. Itâs cheap to camp and the people who own the places comes around in the morning with a card machine for you to pay. Very easy and the accommodation along the way was also good: showers, toilets and a small shop in almost every camping place. Just remember to bring coins for the showers â I ended up washing my harr in a sink at one point. I do not recommend that!

We set off to HÃ¶fn and went past the majestic JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n: A beautiful glacier lagoon where icebergs and seals were drifting around. That was one of the most incredible sights Iâve ever seen. In hindsight I wish we had book a trip to go on the glacier or maybe take a boat tour on it, but I guess that will be next time around!

We spent a night in the town of HÃ¶fn, in the south-east of Iceland. We had dinner at a great lobster restaurant that still make me drool. They are known for being the lobster capital of Iceland, and itâs a well-deserved name. I donât think I have ever been so full and still wanted to eat more. I recommend to stop in HÃ¶fn no matter how or where you are going. The lobster is truly to die for, and the town is very cute. Not much to do, but a good pool to soak in after a day on wheels.

We then set of to see the Loch Ness-monster of Iceland: The LagarfljÃ³t worm. The lake LagarfljÃ³t is in one of the few forest in Iceland, and it felt really good to be among trees again. Probably the Norwegian gene kicking in, hehe. We slept in AtlavÃ­k which without a doubt was the most beautiful place on the entire trip. I truly loved it there. It was near the water, it was a beautiful evening and we grilled the best hamburgers I have ever tasted. In the morning we went horseback riding in the forest. My boyfriend who is Icelandic was amazed with riding in the woods while I really wanted to see something more than trees. Our guide told us that this was very normal: Icelanders want to stay in the forrest, foreigners are more like âshow me you land!â. Hehe. Conflict of interest, I guess.

We then drove to HÃºsavik and went whale watching. That was an incredible experience. We saw a lot of whales, and they were very curious animals â showing off and spinning around for us. Like a big dog, in lack of a better way to describe them. I was very anxious I didnât have warm enough clothes, but they gave us a big coveralls, so not to worry. Just bring a scarf and a hat and youâll be fine. A friendly reminder is to not forget your phone in your pocket of the overalls. And if you do, please remember the number of your overall: I had to look through every one of them before I found mine. Luckily the crew said it wasnât the first time.

We then set off to the place where Mufasa died. Okay, maybe not, but it looks like it. We went to Asbyrgi and saw the majestic valley and even slept on a camping site in the valley. Another great location for camping, which I truly recommend. We then went to Dettifoss Waterfall and even drove in the highland past a mountain my boyfriend called âThe Mother of all Mountainsâ. I have no idea what itâs really called, so Iâll just leave it to your imagination. But it was a great trip â lots of dust and gravel, but the car was a 4WD, so we had no problem getting there. And it was really worth the detour â I mean, itâs a vacation. You are supposed to take detours.

We then came to Akureyri, took a (much needed) swim and then set of to OlafsfjÃ¶rdur. Itâs a small, great town where we spent two nights (relatives and stuff, if you do not have that in OlafsfjÃ¶rdur, one night is enough). We then had breakfast at a great bakery in the next fjord, Dalvik, which has a great bakery.

We then set of to Borgarnes and stayed at a very cozy apartment-hotel-cafÃ©-thingy with great personal service (and the comfort of a bed again was like being in heaven). The way from OlafsfjÃ¶rdur to Borgarnes is only a couple of hours, so itâs a good day-trip. That is, if your car doesnât break down and you have to duct tape parts of the engine and pray the entire time that it wonât blow up. But that donât happen a lot, I was reassured.

The landscape was breathtaking and I loved the steep mountains and wild rivers. Itâs such a diverse trip in regards to what you get to see and what you can do. Everybody should take the ring road at least once. We spent about a week on the trip and next time I want to travel for two: there is always more to see in Iceland!

Iceland,cmazhk,Ring Road,5.0,"I traveled in late August/first week of September which was really nice because the weather is still pleasant and peak tourist season has ended.

Iceland scenery is stunning. You don't have to venture far off the ring road to get a good taste of the country in 1 week. As I was planning my trip I was pretty confused on where to stay the night, and would like to share my itinerary (which turned out to be perfect for me) in order to help other travelers. Don't over think it. Towns are small and Route 1 is super easy. The detours are pretty easy as well and I never ventured more than 1 hour each way off Rte 1. I don't know that I would have changed anything, except thinking I needed more time in Akureyri area.

Day 1: Friday AM: Arrive in Iceland. Head over to Blue Lagoon for jetlag therapy before driving to Reykjavik. Cute and small city. Can easily see in 1 day. Had dinner at Fishmarket which is incredible.

Day 2: Saturday: Drove from Reykjavik to the Golden Circle and did the ""Big 3"". After Gullfoss drove straight down to Vik and stayed the night. There are a couple of famous waterfalls along the way. It is not too much to do Golden Circle, drive to Vik, and check out black sand beaches of Vik. Stayed at Icelandair Hotel Vik which is pricey but worth it after a long first day.

Day 3: Sunday: Drive from Vik to Hofn, with stops in Skaftafell Park for a 1.5 hour hike and Jokulsarlon to see the floating glaciers (weather was bad so did not book the boat ride. Happy to find out you can see it all without being on boat. Everything in Iceland is free besides car, gas, hotel, food and booze). In Hofn you must go to Pakkus restaurant for Langoustines. Best dinner of my life.

Day 4: Monday: Hofn to Egilsstaoir. Drive along the East coast which is stunning, but take the tunnel which leads to route 92 after a few fjords. You will stop to take a lot of photos. Egilsstaoir area is nice and you can see a truly beautiful waterfall called Hengifoss and drive to the MUST SEE town of Seydisfjordur.

Day 5: Tuesday: Egilsstaoir to Lake Myvatn. Wonderful drive which takes you tot Dettifoss waterfall detour. Also part of Route 1 has Mars like landscape which is cool. In Lake Myvatn go to the Nature Bath and bike or drive around Lake to take photos. Cowshed restaurant for lunch was superb.

Day 6: Wednesday: Lake Myvatn to Akureyri. Easy drive. Check out Iceland's second largest city (town) and go horseback riding or check out some other fjords. To be honest if you are short on time you can absolutely leave Akureyri in afternoon back to Reykjavik and not feel like you missed anything.

Day 7: Thursday: Akureyri to Iceland. Nonstop 4.5 hours. Not much to stop for in all honestly. Spent more time in Reykjavik last night with an amazing meal at Grillmarket.

I would recommend getting a diesel engine while renting a car as it was fabulous to stop only 3 times the whole trip!

Hope this helps!

Iceland,regulartraveller01,Ring Road,5.0,"Have visited Iceland twice and done the Golden Circle but had to do this again as the landscape is so mesmerizing. You go to the Gullfoss Waterfalls which were particularly spectacular as they were frozen solid in January! Fantastic winter wonderland waterfall all in layers where it captured the movement of the water as it froze. Apparently it was still flowing beneath the ice. The Geysirs are very good - the giant one is now dormant since we last saw it in 1999 but on this visit we saw the smaller one that was equally as impressive - just make sure you don't stand in the spray zone. Fab photo ops as you are standing in the middle of lots of tiny thermal pools. The entire landscape is a mix of ice and fire through your journey as you pass Glaciers and then vast black lava fields. Look out for the wonderful Icelandic ponies - they are different to every other horse in the world as they have an extra gait - they walk, trot & RUN before canter and gallop - amazing to see if you are a horse lover! No matter how bad conditions are, the cars cope - even if snow is covering the grille so don't worry if you are there in Winter. We went onto do the Blue Lagoon thermal springs again - they are good but there are better, cheaper cleaner ones about. There is so much to see and do - definitely worth doing.

Iceland,jtchapman,Ring Road,5.0,"On our Iceland/Norway cruise we docked at Akureyri having already been to Reykjavik and taken a Golden Circle tour. Sailed from Reykjavik to Akureyri and crossed the Artic Circle in doing so. Both are on the Ring Road and we traveled parts of it in both ports. The Ring Road goes ALL Iceland close to the coast. It would be a great adventure to drive all the 800+ miles and see more of Iceland. A very varied land indeed. And it is most clean. We NEVER saw ONE piece of trash on any roadway anywhere! Most Icelanders live near the coast and close to this road. The âhighlandsâ are barely populated. Sheep herding is a major farming activity in Iceland. Farmers herd their sheep to the highlands in the spring to graze on communal land. In the fall they all join together to bring them back down over any road available. Seems to be a great family activity for the locals to see and participate in. The sheep are herded into great circular pens with chutes emanating out from the center where each farmer collects his flock and takes them home for the winter.

Reykjavik and Akureyri are very nice modern cities and not what one might expect in Iceland. They have all the amenities, even a McDonaldâs, where a Big Mac with fries and a medium soda will cost you $22 US! Nobody should have ever told you Iceland was cheap. We took a private tour with our travel group rather than the RCI ship excursion and saw all the attractions on this part of the Ring Road at less cost. Given a chance to come back to Iceland I would try and drive the whole road in summer when there is better weather and more light. Looks like it could be done in 4 days or so.

Iceland,AMSchu,Ring Road,4.0,"We did the ring road, starting at Reykjavik and made our way East, up North and then back West in 11 days / 10 nights. We stayed at 6 places along the way, all booked ahead of time. There are a lot of ""points of interest"" along the way and you will likely not get to see all of them so pick and choose the best you can. We booked through Nordic Visitor so they gave a fold-out map and we had a GPS, both together worked out just fine. They also gave us a phone which helped. One thing you will need, and this is not optional, is a waterproof jacket. You will go to many waterfalls along the way and the ""mist"", which in some cases is like rain, will drench everything, including your camera. Be prepared. We took along a waterproof camera just for these areas! There will be long stretches of road with nothing but lava fields and rock piles...and sheep...and horses...and sheep. Watch out for those sheep...they sit right next to the road and run across the road last minute! We found that even with about 23 hours of sunlight we were ""rushing"" through certain areas so we could get to our next accommodation and check in at the appropriate times. If you are going to be really late, like we were several times, call ahead. But be prepared, just because the sun doesn't go down doesn't mean they keep things open longer. Most restaurants close around 10pm or earlier and sometimes the only place to eat is at your hotel so be prepared.

Some tips about a self drive:
--After you get your rental car go to the grocery store. Buy healthy food and water and put it in your car. And get a roll of paper towels and a box of tissues. There are long stretches of nothingness and you will thank yourself for being smart enough to do this.
--Wear hiking shoes. Good, waterproof ones. You won't need much else in the way of shoes in Iceland. Sneakers are not really safe around the water areas. You will sometimes be climbing and walking on rocks that are wet and muddy or ashy.
--Wear a waterproof jacket.
--Do some of the tours offered in different areas (try to book ahead of your trip if you can). We did the Inside the Volcano, Super Jeeps to Landmannalaugar / Mount Heckla and a boat ride on the Jokarlsson glacial lake. They were all highlights of our trip and we met cool people.

Just be aware of the transportation system around Reykjavik...it is always late, really late or doesn't show up. At least, that is the experience we had.

Have fun. Don't stress. :-)

Iceland,easternsho,Ring Road,5.0,"I wouldn't stick to it exclusively but the ring road opens up all of iceland if you have a car. we ventured off to other roads and parts of the island, but the ring road was our core and it worked perfectly as a travel plan.",Jul 2014
Iceland,CPlayer,Ring Road,5.0,"I do not use the word ""awesome"" often; I use it only when something truly inspires awe within me. Simply put, the Ring Road (Highway 1) is extremely awesome. If you can visit Iceland only once in your life, travel the Ring Road. You can make all the reservations yourself, or you can book your trip through an agency that will arrange your car rental and lodging. You can even take a bus tour, but we recommend driving yourself. Traveling the Ring Road, you will not only encounter an extremely wide range of sceneries, you will encounter many of them within minutes of each other. You will encounter large flat plains of black volcanic ash; towering green cliffs dotted with white spots (sheep!) hundreds of meters above a plain, while seeing a thin gray-silver line of ocean waves on the other side of your car; white threads of waterfalls descending from the edges of those cliffs and crowned with rainbows; landscapes resembling those of Mars; green lush valleys populated by gleaming white farm houses, fields of moss-covered, car-sized boulders... . Have I made my point? My wife and I traveled the Ring Road for nine days in late August. We highly recommend traveling in late summer: the weather is reasonable and the days are still long, about 15 hours. Most of the road is paved. Most of the unpaved sections are near Breiddalsvik in the southeast of Iceland. Also, between this town and Egilsstadir, the Ring Road is difficult: a gravel surface on a steep mountain with a couple of switchback (180-degree) turns. You may want to consider an alternate route: specifically, Route 96 out of Breiddalsvik to Route 92 to Egilsstadir. Stop at the Hotel Blafell in Breiddalsvik and ask their opinion about this alternate route. Also, if you go, look up the locations of the N1 gas stations; they will serve as oases on the trip. The speed limit on the Ring Road is usually 90 kph (55 mph). We did not see many police, actually none outside of Reykjavik, so I suppose you could drive faster. My question is, why would you want to? If you have never considered Iceland as a vacation destination, then do so now, and make the Ring Road your guide to this nation.

Iceland,BBM87,Ring Road,5.0,"And you get to see lots of it on the ring road. It doesn't get easier than this. There's just the one main road. If you can't follow it, you really should be traveling without a bus group. There is soooo much to see. We did it in 8 days and felt like we were really doing a lot of driving. If I had it to do over, I would have did a little better planning, but still glad we did it. I won't speak about sites in detail (you can plan those out based on your research). I will say that the road is well marked, landmarks and sights are easy to find and the traffic is light. Eat at the gas stations, they have really good food. Give yourself plenty of time to travel. Keep a guide book with you so that you can be aware of what you want to see in the area you're in. Talk to the locals!! We got some great advice from the guys we did the glacier hike with. Be prepared for all kinds of weather. And, keep your camera handy - you never know when you'll see something spectacular!

Iceland,Ashleysmith1987,Ring Road,5.0,"We just returned from a 7-day December Iceland trip and travelled the Ring Road (route 1) from Reykjavik as far as Jokulsarlon in the South-East. With only 4 hours light, and trips taking 5 hours of driving in each direction to and from Reykjavik you have to drive during the dark. Dark plus incredibly strong cross-winds plus sleet, snow and rain on unmarked roads (don't assume the ring road is properly marked throughout - it's not), through extremely unfamiliar environments and having to ascend and descend various mountain ranges along the way is not for the faint hearted. Visibility often goes down to less than a couple of meters ahead of the car and you have to rely on sat nav and pure luck to travel safely at incredibly low speeds. That said, it's amazing - worth the risk - but be extremely cautious and aware that it's no walk in the park. At times you'll be entering conditions and landscapes and might not see another car or town for an hour or more with zero visibility around you. The scariest part is that you won't even know whether you're travelling through fields or clinging precariously to the side of a cliff. These conditions are not just in the Icelandic highlands - we encountered terrifying and dangerous driving conditions as soon a 15 minutes outside of Reykjavik. From what I understand, and travelling by car for five days solid during the winter around these regions, any road in Iceland not immediately inside a populated area can be extremely hazardous and weather changes unpredictably.

Make sure you have a proper road map and during the winter unless the weather conditions are clear and the sun is up don't even try to travel on any roads marked us un-paved or gravel (even some major roads have unpaved or gravel sections on-and-off along them). We did this through a main route from Reykjavik to Grindavik passing Kleifvartn lake, winding up and down and round and round a mountain range on black gravel, slipping and sliding all over the place with zero visibility due to a gale that blew in and no idea of whether the driving conditions and difficulty of the road would improve or worsen as we progressed along it.

If you're willing to take the plunge - go for it - if you're savvy and careful you won't come to any harm. But be prepared for a heart stopping drive.

Iceland,shirleyrobertmoore,Ring Road,5.0,"We visited Iceland in Sept for 11 days. We have traveled all over the world and Iceland is completely different. Part of the trip was an escorted trip and you were afraid to go to sleep on the bus as you might miss something. Our son asked us if this was the trip of a lifetime, and, Yes, I believe it was. We are seniors and it was more for us, about the scenery. For the younger group, greatest place for hiking and all active activities. We went around the whole island and of course, saw Northern Lights. Waterfalls all over Iceland seen right on the Ring Road. The hot pots, thermal pools, were soooo relaxing. Everywhere was clean and friendly. The weather is unpredictable. We plan definitely to go back and see the interior of Iceland and Greenland.

Iceland,BolitoVT,Ring Road,4.0,"There have been quite a few conversations and questions around whether or not one can do the Ring Road in a short amount of time. Many of the comments discourage travelers in the planning stages from trying to do such a trip. Opinions on quality vs. quantity aside, the answer is yes you can do it, and I'm here to briefly recap what I was able to experience in that time.

A friend and I (both in our low/mid 30's) spent the first two days of a 6 day trip in Reykjavik visiting with friends, taking in sights like the Blue Lagoon, the Golden Circle, and some glacial snowmobiling. On the 3rd morning, we rented a RAV4 from Blue Car Rental and started our drive along the south coast. Our first day was going to finish us up at Hali Country Hotel, which is 45 min short of Hofn. This first day was very eventful from the road; we stopped at two amazing waterfalls, two or three glaciers, the iceberg lake, and a few other attractions along the way. Driving time was a little over 6 hours, but it took us 10 hours to get to our hotel with the aforementioned stops and other stops we made for photo taking. The Hali Country Hotel has some surprisingly amazing food, by the way.

Day 2 was a long day as well, where we were looking to spend our evening at the lovely Skjaldarvik Guest House in Akureyri. This day also put us on the road for roughly 7 hours, with 3 hours of time taken to jump out and take photos; there was less activity on this day than we had on the previous as it was more driving intense and much of the scenery was duplicative of the previous day. We did not stray from the road very much on this day.

Day 3 would have started out with a whale-watching tour out of Dalvik, had it not been for perilous weather. The wind in particular was pretty bad, so we continued moving forward to enjoy the sights that lay ahead of us around SnÃ¦fellsjÃ¶kull National park. We capped our day with a fancy dinner at HÃ³tel BÃºÃ°ir, before retiring for the night at Hotel Framnes. (5 hours driving).

On Day 4, my pal needed to be back at Keflavik by 3pm to catch his flight home, so we simply drove back into Reykjavik (3 hours) where we had lunch and he then returned the car to the airport.

--------

Yes, there was quite a bit of driving, but it's hardly painful driving when the landscape is this stunning. It was mid-May, so there were plenty of daylight hours to work with (it never REALLY got dark), and our only time limitation was making sure we showed up early enough to where we were staying so someone could check us in.

We were always the first people at breakfast and were out the door no later than 8:30 each morning. If we arrived early at a hotel (like we did on Day 3) we made sure to make the most of local sightseeing. The weather at times is tricky (the wind in particular, and two instances where we were driving through snow) but at no time was it perilous. I'm certain that those who take their time can get more in, and at a more comfortable pace, but over three and a half days we were able to see quite a bit and we returned home feeling quite good about what we chose to experience!

Iceland,Aussiegrannie,Ring Road,5.0,"In june 2010 I made my first trip to Iceland, My real interests were in the Icelandic Sagas and the History of Iceland. However, all of my tours were in buses and with the crowded bus tours and the time frames to be maintained there was not enough time to experience and learn all that the country has to offer. Bascially there was un-finished business for me.

So in July 2011, I decided to return. I enquired about, and from the same agent (Ingi from TourIs) the possibility of taking the Ring Road including the Westfjords and having a Private Guide. This I was told was possible and negotiations and all arrangements were made. These included the guide and vehicle we would be using. Yes it is more expensive to have a private guide than it is to take a scheduled bus tour, but I would have willingly paid more to experience what I have had, traveling with Ãrni.

On my arrival ""Ãrni"" was there to pick me up and take me to the hotal where I would be staying for the two nights, prior to the tour commencing on Saturday July 9th 2011.
He did drive me around a bit enroute to the Hotel Park Inn, suggesting some places I might like to go and look at. These included some restaurants, the Settlement Museum, the Culture House, and the Concert Hall, In fact we did these together when we returned to Reykjavik after the tour. But, because of his suggestions I did go to the Childrens Zoo and the Gardens on my own, and Ãrni took me to the Pearlan, to see the Saga Museum. Well worth the visit.

Then Saturday arrived and Ãrni picked me at 8.30am and we began this amazing adventure.

Day 1 Reykjavik - StykkishÃ³lmur, via Reykholt, Borganes, and SnÃ¦fullness. Overnight Hotel Breidafjordur. Beautiful scenery all the way. Great bookshop at Storrastorfa in Reykholt. Ãrni explained the Cairns along the route, In fact they are everywhere around Iceland.
Day 2 StykkishÃ³lmur- Westfjords on the Ferry Baldur Overnight Hotel Breidavik. Calm crossing, and it was nice to talk the locals on the ferry. One can learn so much from talking to the local people.
Day 3 Westfjords to Latrabjard where we went to Bird Cliffs. Breathtakingly beautiful , high cliffs and puffins everywhere. I would have liked to have climbed a bit higher, but I received a definite No to that. I felt so small and insignificant in this environment.
Day 4 Latrabjard to Isafjordur. Beautiful place, magic, remote. Overnight Hotel Edda
Day 5 and 6 - Westfjords - Drangsnes a great little hotel here Log cabin type I think it may have been called Hotel Mikfigardur?? But I loved it. Then Akureyi for two days
Days 7 and 8 Akureyi at Hotel Edda
Day 9 Lake Myvatn - fortunately the Midges were not at home that day.
Day 10 (Two days) East Fjords - Egilsstardur, remote, and so beautiful, inspirational. overnight Hotel Hallormsstadur?? This greater area was significant for Ãrni and he showed me so much. I loved it here. Just to walk around the area so beautiful, quiet and again it made me feel so insignificant and small.
Day 11 and 12 Djupivogur, not sure about this, recollections are hazy, and on to Hofn. Ovenight Hotel Hofn.
Day 13 South Iceland and the inspirational Glacier Lagoon. Overnight in a great little hotel on a farm. Hotel Vellir. This was under Myrdalsjokull and Eyjafjallajokull. This area is breathtakingly beautiful, and I needed to remember to breath, as I did all around Iceland. It is so completely overwhelming, as is Iceland in general.But from what I understand this area is a little unstable. They are waiting for the ""big"" one to occur. (There was a problem of a flooding river while I was in Iceland, when a bridge was washed away)
Day 14 - Eventually back in Reykjavik and the Hotel Park Inn for the next days.
Day 15 Reykanes
Day 16 Thinkvellir I will not describe this here at all, but hopefully do it later. It deserves it's own review.
Day 17 My final day here in this special place. Ãrni picked me late morning and took me to The Settlement museum, the Culture House, The Concert Hall. All interesting buildings, for different reasons and specialities.The Icelandics are openly proud of their modern and Glass Concert Hall. Then ""Hot Dogs"" for Lunch. A must in Iceland are the Hot Dogs, and they good!

To summarise:

This amazing adventure was so wonderful. Ãrni a lovely man, but driver/guide extrordinairre, teacher, scholar, gentleman, and ""all round good bloke""

Highlights: all subjective of course,

Well the awe-inspiring scenery, the high mountains, waterfalls, some of the smaller ones more beautiful in my view, the rivers, the lakes, the lagoons, the canyons, the lava fields/flows, the flowers, the birds, the rough roads. The area is so overwhelming it's remoteness leaves a permanent mark on the mind, and heart. The patriatism of the Icelander, the traditions, the food, just wonderful.The economy may have created issues financially for the Icelander, but to me, the people are a happy and proud lot.

For me personnally,

My guide Ãrni, his stories, his efforts to teach me some Icelandic, his explanations of the geology, his knowledge of the Sagas and the History, (you may say it is his business) and yes, maybe this is so, but it was so much than that I thought, and for me I am so sincerely grateful to him, and his efforts to help me, with my research.

Then there was the ""Lunchtime Picnic Spots"" all so beautiful, so peacefull, so well chosen by Ãrni. Between lava rocks, by waterfalls, with only the thunder of the water, to hear, by lakes where only the birds could be heard and nothing else, just to sit and listen to the environment at work, to smell, to touch, simply took my breath away. I found it hard to stay in control, it was so overwhelming, and to be there with no-one else around, just the two of us, In fact somedays we did see anyone else on the road.
The smaller accomadation houses, the small family eating houses, home made soup at TbÃ¦r KaffihÃºs, run by two ladies, no English spoken, but who needs it, when the eyes say it all.
The ""sod"" houses, and churches, The oldest wooden chuch in Iceland, and one of many we visited at Vidimyrarkirkja, so beauiful, the viking re-enactment villages, the re-constructed viking areas, the History surrounding these, again overwhelming, A church where for the Alter the backdrop of the natural scene was used instead of a solid structure, by looking out through a glass window. I wondered for those people who have the ""faith"" how much closer could they really get to their ""God"" It overwhemed me, and something like this could change my philosphy about religion, in general. Actually some of the small local churches - it is so understanding why people are so close to each other in this situation.

I can not think of sufficient adequate words to describe this country or the people. Perhaps there are none in English, that will adequately describe and give the country and the people the justice it deserves. There is over a 1000 years of History here. At the moment it has great financial issues, but it has more camaradiere than all other countries put together, other than the Faroe Islands, where the same mentallity is evident.

And then at Skogar, the Museum, meeting its founder ThÃ³rdur Tomasson, a small man with the biggest heart, and mind to match. This man really took away all of my composure, leaving me feeling so confused. So inspirational was the nature of the man and his passion for the place, so obvious.

The people so warm and inviting as far as I was concerned.

The environment, the tranquility, the sounds of silence, the perceived hostility of the environment, the lava, the mud pools, to a lesser extent the hot areas, but the blue water so calming, The mountains, the canyons, the folk stories, the rough roads, and the crossing of some smaller rivers. The car shaking and sliding around. The smell of the clutch becoming hot, I felt a little anxious, about what could happen if we ""broke"" it. The remoteness of some places, the feeling of being completely alone, the emotion of feeling so small and insignificant. Like if one did not bend, with the environment then one could be broken by it.

How to explain all this. Perhaps there is not an explanation to be had, for this journey of a lifetime, except for this- perhaps..

I have had the time of my life, thanks Ãrni and a purple VW Caravelle

Make sure you have a waterproof jacket and be prepared for the smell!

I definitely recommend spending some time visiting Reykjanes Peninsula and the unusual sights. May not be as spectacular as the sights on the South, or photogenic, but they are unusual and worth seeing.

There were clear walking paths and a few good view points. The day we went it was incredibly windy and VERY steamy so we did not get a great view of the ground. There are also areas that the wind blows the steam over the walkway and you can get very wet!!

If itâs a windy day be clever about where you stand when the geysir goes off as itâs extremely hot water.

We managed to see it erupt three times in the time we had (the first time it made me jump as I wasnât expecting it!) And you can get some really cool videos, I captured it in slo-mo on my Iphone XS which made me feel like a pro photographer as the result was great and everybody loved it!

It was amazing to watch and definitely worth a visit, you donât need to spend more than an hour and a half there depending on whether youâre having food or not.

Allt Ã¾aÃ° besta!

Iceland,Bernard G,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"There is a legend that this hot spring holds the screaming ghost of a witch. The broken observation platform taken out the hot spring seems to say: she is still not happy.

Plumes of smoke rose from the hotspring, thick and tall. All around the landscape, steam rises and the ground bubbles and hisses. Itâs a different place. Itâs a look at a different time.

The best part: unlike the more famous parts of Iceland, this place is in-mobbed by tourists. You can drive right up to the viewing platforms and enjoy the otherworldly view by yourself

I really enjoyed visiting this gem. It is not far from the Blue Lagoon and provides an experience as awesome as seeing Strokkur and Geysir - and you wonât have to fight off waves of your groups to do see it.

There is a very good reason why the these tour attractions are at the top of list of must see places for most visitors to Iceland! Here you combine these two magic places in a one day tour with admission to the Kerid Volcanic Crater included.

This hot spring is very impressive and lacked the crowds of other similar spots. Personally I found this more impressive than Geysir/Strokkur (although both were fantastic).

You really get a sense of the enormity of the geyser sites, the power of what's just under the surface.

As itâs off the beaten track, there are very few tourists and visitors, which is great as you can take your time exploring, taking pictures, and enjoying the natural beauty of the landscape.

I highly recommend this as a stop over some of the other geothermal areas, which can be quite touristic and crowded.

This is a fairly large geothermal area, and two geothermal electric generating plants are built nearby. The winter conditions and the low sun near the southern horizon offered unusual photo opportunities. Worth a visi, especially if you check out the other attractions, too. Access is free.

If you have a camera, bring something to clean the spray and minerals off your lens; it will be hard to take any photos without getting some spray on the lens.

Iceland,santjordi,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"Reykjanes Lighthouse and the Gunnuhver Hot Springs are two of the must visit spots on Reykjanes Peninsula. Most people know Reykjanes for Keflavik and might stop at Blue Lagoon if they get reservations, but there is so much to see in Reykjanes.

Reykjanes is about 60-70 minute drive from Reykjavik, but it is raw wild landscape. Filled with bubbling pits of water sending steam scores of meters high into the winter air. Gunnuhver used to be the site of someoneâs home until the ground began to boil and the homesteaders were forced to abandon their home.

Reykjanes lighthouse sits on a hill above the coastline and looks out into the sea stacks of Eldey, home to the last breeding pair of Great Auks, now extinct. The coast is terrifically dramatic with crashing waves and rubble fields with the sea stacks, curved rocks sitting in the water and the lighthouse and Gunnuhver behind

This is a really easy drive and well worth doing on your own. The whole peninsula can be visited in a day and besides the blue lagoon, is largely devoid of tourists.

Iceland,Zimminaroundtheworld,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"I highly recommend visiting the Reykjanes Peninsula, there is so much to see here. Obviously, there is the Blue Lagoon, but so many other attractions worth visiting. While driving to the Blue Lagoon, I stopped here at Gunnuhver Hot Springs. It is easy to see from the road and easy to drive to. Once there stay on the designated paths and enjoy the geothermal activity! Don't venture off the trail, there are so many hot spots and you never know what areas are safe. The views are spectacular here, and the mud pools and vents are fun to watch. There is one vent that constantly steams. This attraction is free and does not take to much time from your day.",Aug 2017

Iceland,Charley H,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"We visited Gunnuhver as part of our self driven day tour around Reykjanes Peninsula.

The mud pool (not really a hot spring) is a really cool display of how quickly and extremely places can change over time. There are signs around the pool talking about folk history and factual history about the pool, make sure you walk all the way to the end of the pool to see both signs!
Make sure you keep an eye out for the remnants of an old house.

You can also walk to this location from Reykjanes lighthouse, which is a nice addition to a sunny day trip to the area. I think it takes about 15-29 minutes to walk.

Well worth the stop.",Jun 2017
Iceland,Kimberly J,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"This was an area of steam vents coming out of the ground. There was one large one that was blowing a huge cloud of wet steam that we had to run through (on the boardwalk, don't cross fences or go off the boardwalks/walkways) due to the wind direction, so we got a bit wet and smelly (like sulfur), but that was all part of the experience.

There is one dominate hot spring with boiling water and considerable steam which has consumed a section of old boardwalk. The other areas are predominately steam vents. The smell of sulfur is quite strong and the earth is yellow and orange colored.

On arrival, the car park was quite so no problem parking. We followed the signs and came across the springs. The amount of steam emitting was really impressive.

There are several hot springs bubbling away a short distance from the nearby power station, the smell of sulphur is strong and there is plenty of steam from the vents but this is nature at it's purist so take it for what it is. There are 2 small car parks (no other facilities) and safe boarded walkways with hand rails which make it less slippery and also safer as the ground nearby is hot and unsafe to walk on. Under the steam you can see the boiling water pumping out of the ground like a kettle and it really is a sight to see.

Iceland,dsjmj5,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"After a drive across a tarmac road across amazing lava fields we found a small car park up a well made but gravel road. Safe board walks and viewing points by bubbling small pools and vents with a slight smell of sulphur. The main vent was pouring out superheated steam with a roaring noise. Fascinating to see the remains of the former boardwalk and the foundations of a house that are now on unsafe, geothermally active ground. Makes you think how alive this region is. We went for a second visit as the first time it was very windy and raining and the steam was obstructing our view. Worth visiting if you are near but do not step off the marked paths as the ground is very unsafe.

Iceland,LaNyonsaise,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"The Reykjanes peninsula is clearly an area of intense geothermal activity. Driving the 425 road you can hear the roar of steam from the small power plants before leaving the road to follow the track down to the lighthouse that is wreathed in steam. The hot spring is reached by a boardwalk that passes a number of smaller steaming vents and, incredibly, the foundations of a home. Standing by the main hot spring is a reminder of how thin the earth's crust can be and what lies beneath our feet. It's a roaring, ferocious spectacle.",May 2017

Iceland,Margot M,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"Ok, so Most people go to the blue Lagoon and that is a MUST! but if you have a little bit of extra time in Iceland (I'd say more than three days to spend there) then I highly recommend you book a trip here it's off the beaten path so you might have to do it through a tour group that's what we had to do. But if you're renting a car I'm sure it's easy to fine with GPS
we were dropped off and had about two hours to spend here and I must say it wasn't enough time. The place wasn't crowded at all! in fact there are several pools and most of the time we were the only two in there. Which was absolutely lovely and romantic.

Iceland,M H,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"We visited this free to enter hot springs area in March as we had a few hours to spare before our flight home.

There is plenty of free parking and a wooden platform that takes you to the viewing area (there's also an interpretation board in English). When we visited there was a constant huge amount of steam (rather than the rather more impressive eruptions that you see at the geysers on the Golden Circle route).

When at the hot springs you can see a light house in the distance, we walked beyond this to some quite dramatic sea cliffs that could be climbed.

Whilst not a 'must see' in our opinion it's a good filler prior to the airport (unless you'd prefer to go to the Blue Lagoon along with everyone else!).

Lots of industrial buildings in the background make it a little less photogenic than some other sites (or more, if that's your thing, I suppose), though they can be avoided with careful camera angles or by waiting for a well-placed puff of steam...

Interesting (and slightly worrying) to see the remains of the old viewing platform, now right in the middle of one of the more active vents, which apparently opened up there without warning! I hope no-one was on it at the time...

The Hot Springs, do smell of sulphur, which was quite overpowering at times, the noise and experience of these hot springs is amazing though, the amount of power in them is incredible, it's other worldly.
It is definitely worth a visit, we spent over an hour, walking from the hot springs, to the lighthouse, to the coast, admiring the fantastic views, before walking back. For those who do not wish to walk there is a road you can drive along and plenty of parking available.

Well groomed and maintained walking paths and viewing decks. The power of the spring is awe inspiring. The remains of the former viewing deck are in the spring. The landscape is amazing with steam rising from the Earth. There was a family home on the grounds. The family made natural red clay flower pots. However; the ground became too warm and the family had to leave. All that remains of the home is the eerie foundation like chalk lines at a crime scene. As bonuses, a lighthouse is nearby and a geothermal thermal plant can be seen and heard in the background. Also beware of the resident ghost.

It's another of Icelands geo thermal areas, just a fantastic place and has a great story to go with the area. The story of Gunnuhver a female ghost who haunts the area.....one which many locals and visitors have claimed to have seen in times gone past.

mud pools and steam vents surround you....... it's important that you stay within the cordoned areas for your safety.
Thee are a couple of ramps which allow you to close enough but remain safe to view the spectacular hot springs. The temperature of the largest one reaches 300 degrees, not only a magnificent sight but the sound is tremendous, as the boiling water bubbles away and steam verosiously bursts upwards and outwards!
This is an amzing place, it's how I imagine the birth of the earth.

Only afterwards did I read about the bridge between the continents, but will make sure we go back on our next visit.

There is no fee to come here so do pop along and join in the fun. Stay to the paths that are makred with a pole and rope. The thermal steam that comes up was a highlight for the students I was with to walk through and video themselves.
Tip: Take your shoes off before you get back into your vehicle as it can be very muddy, sticky, icky.
Don't think there were any toilets here, or there may have been portaloos so remember that if you're busting to go.

Iceland,Ivor M,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"These hot springs are located near Keflavik airport and worth a quick spot if you're in the area. We drove here after visiting the Blue Lagoon and while it was cool to see it was one of the less exciting spots during our Iceland adventure.

Worth a look if you're nearby but don't go out of your way for this one!",Dec 2016
Iceland,Anita O,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"Gunnuhver was amazing. Everything was bubbling, gurgling, shooting up. It was a feast for the eyes and the brain.
And when I looked up from all that bubbling, gurgling, etc, the landscape was incredible. White snow and Black Lava mountains created all these abstract shapes agains a pure blue sky. Amazing.",May 2016
Iceland,declan,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"Stopped here to see, we'd seen other hot spings on our trip and you can smell the sulphur which isn't too bad, but these one stunk! I think it's because its mixed with mud/sand which makes it a lot worse... they really do smell awful!
Aside from the smell a nice little walk around them with good views of the area!",Dec 2016
Iceland,Traveler Jess,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,This was pretty awesome and if you are going to do the Golden Circle this stop point is pretty awesome! Not as many people as I was told I would encounter that was a plus.,Dec 2016
Iceland,Debbie H,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,3.0,"I happened to visit when the weather was windy as hell and rainy so it did damper the experience a bit but obviously that's just Icelandic weather for you.
The only thing I would say is look for the signpostings because they are right before the turn off you need when driving here and the roads are narrow.
Hot springs like these can only be seen in a handful of places so of course include this in your itinerary, especially as it's so close to the airport anyway. It's not too big and of course the smell is 'sulphuric' to say the least but you do appreciate the geography of our planet by seeing these areas.

Iceland,Cliffkol,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"Gunnuhver is a hot spot with several steam vents. Its main feature is the largest mud pool and mud geyser in Iceland. Gunnuhver is in the same geological region as Blue Lagoon, Krysuivik, and the Blue Diamond region.

The geyser at Gunnuhver is continuously erupting, violently, spewing steam with temperatures well over 212F. There is a constant background smell of sulfur and rotten eggs in the air. I witnessed the constant spewing and once back at the car saw an even larger eruption of steam. There was a boardwalk and paths connecting the viewpoints. Gunnuhver also had brightly colored soil, along with a variety of steam vents and mud pots.

There was also a huge geothermal electric plant in the area, with its pipes extending from the main plant. Itâs great that Iceland has figured a way to harness nature to the extent that 100% of its electricity is derived from rivers and the earth.

This is the heart of the âBlue Diamondâ, a region where the North Atlantic ridge is rising from the ocean, with hundreds of craters and lava, bird cliffs, geothermal areas, hot spots and geysers, sand beaches, power plants and lighthouses. The area covers about 50km looping from Reykjavik into the Reykjanes peninsula and back. It is situated in the Reykjanes Geopark area with geological international significance since it has geothermal areas near the ocean.

Iceland,kurogomajpn,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"Gunnuhver is quite an interesting high geothermal place. It has pools of bubbling mud pools with steam rising from them. There is the smell of sulphur and rotten eggs in the air but it actually isn't too bad.

Gunnuhver is named after an angry poltergeist, Gudrun, whose spirit was trapped in the hot springs by a priest 400 years ago. Rumors has it that one can spot her figure standing over one of the pools about to fall in. The steamy area does have an eerie atmosphere when the steam vapour blows in creating a thick fog,

The landscape is quite surreal, like you are walking on Mars, although you aren't exactly walking on the ground surface, but on platforms. A worthwhile visit.

When getting closer to the hot springs, our young children were in hysterics due to the smell! (sulphur smells delightful!) As you walk along the pathway, the colours of the ground were completely fascinating! the power that the steam comes from the ground is incredible and to make the visit even better, our children loved it here!

Iceland,Wanderer648700,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"I wouldn't suggest that you drive all the way out here to see this unless you happen to already be around the Grindavik area, as you'll get your fill of geysers along the Golden Circle. That being said, I thought this was a lovely little stop before heading to the Blue Lagoon. The wooden walkway gets pretty wet from the geyser steam so tread carefully, and by all means, don't run! There are a few geysers at the site but they are roped off for your safety. (I saw a couple people hiking up to them but I don't think that's what you're supposed to do.) The springs are named after the ghost of Gunnuhver who supposedly lives here.

As a side note, the lighthouse is hikeable from the Gunnuhver walkway entrance but you can also drive up to it if you drive back out to the main road and take the next exit.

It's a quiet dirt road with little signage, but look for all the steam. Far more steam than we saw at Geysir and a far worse smell. If the steam blows your way, you will get covered in droplets, so careful with your camera.
No facilities other than a car park, info signs, and walkways, but well worth a visit. Just seems a lot more natural and less commercial than Geysir.

Best avoided if possible, but if needs must it's rewarding to complete the circuit of the site on the custom made board-walks. Don't be tempted to stray off these, as our guide advised us that the crusty top layer of soil can be fragile in places and you won't know what's underneath.

There are two separate ways to get there, we took the dirt road path. Very narrow drive but pretty smooth as there are cars, bikes, and buses that consistently go down. There is not many spots to pull over so other cars can pass through so it can be difficult. The views are pretty cool, very foggy and steamy. There used to be a bridge that collapsed mixed into the mud pool. Easy Walking to and from the car as well.

The Gunnuhver area is small. There is just the one main large steamy hot spring which is really fierce. You cant get very close to it though, and I'm sure opinions are mixed whether the derelict walkway that has been consumed by it and adds or detracts from the spectacle.

There are several nice views and some small spring/mineral deposits to see.

Iceland,Einar-Thor,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"It is really worth while to see Gunnuhver and to take in more of Reykjanes area, close to KeflavÃ­k. Gunnuhver is a geyser that constantly spews out hot steam, much more energy than Strokkur but because the eruption is constant it does not go as high. We talked to a local man there, he was filming using his drone, and he told us all about how Gunnuhver came to be the powerful during a resent earthquake and when I asked him what the ""stuff/rubble"" in and around Gunnuhver was he told us that these were the remains of the old ""safe"" wooden walkway. The rest of the walk on the new walkway we (I was there with my 11 and 13 year old boys) wondered if there was going to be another earthquake and if we would see a new Gunnuhver; we were quite exited about the possibility though the chances of witnessing such an event would be smaller than being hit by lightning. Note this is an active volcanic area and there are frequent small earthquakes in this area; check out http://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/earthquakes we didn't feel any of these earthquakes, fine with me.

I was really impressed with the area and was surprised how big it was since I hadn't heard much about it. It is steamy, smelly and very cool. We then found the Leif the Lucky bridge which I was very excited about. It is a great photo opportunity of a walking bridge between tectonic plates. It is easy to find, right off the main road.

After that we went to Keflavic to walk the harbor and to see the giant troll in his cave which is found directly in front of the hotel Berg.

Windy day and the steam was thick -.really smelly. Never experienced anything like it as kept losing sight of anything as the steam enveloped me and condensed on my sunglasses!!! Every so often got a view of the mud pools when wind changed direction. Spooky!

Safe wooden paths to walk on.

Did I say it smelt?!!!

Iceland,avsm,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,3.0,"The hot spring area is located in the backyard of some industrial facility (looks like factory), emits a lot of vapour (can't see much if wind blows towards you) and smell of rotten eggs. Everything is cordoned off so impossible to approach except one small fissure. Overall, not very impressive - better visit Geysir national park.

There is short walk from there to the shore (past the lighthouse) where sea, cliffs and birds can be observed.

There are no facilities except parking lot.

Iceland,Food_Lover186317,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,5.0,"We visited Gunnuhver a couple of years ago and I think it has changed and become more active since then. Not surprising when you think that the whole of Reykjanes is part of the North Atlantic Ridge and very active. Expect to see hissing steam, huge bubbling mud pots and scary landscape. If you look at Gunnuhver, if the steam lifts enough, you will catch site of a broken down wooden walkway that used to pass over where it is now boiling away happily. If you bend down anywhere in the area the land is anything from fairly warm to damn hot! Sure makes you think and, as before, I left feeling a little uneasy!!

Iceland,Ella_RM,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"We spent about 20 minutes walking around. There are hiking trails that will take longer, but 15-20 minutes is enough. It is definitely not Yellowstone, but a nice stop from the airport to Reykjavik. The most direct route between the two is Route 41 (45 mins), but the drive along the south coast (Route 427) of the penisula provides a good introduction to the desolation of Iceland - the lunar landscape, the vast emptiness, the tiny communities along the coast, the snowcapped peaks in the distance.
Lake Kleifarvatn is a 5 minute drive north and has the black beach (to walk on, not to suntan).
Another local 'attraction' is the black ice on the road (42). It appears on only a short (2-3 miles) stretch south of the sulfur baths.

Gaze on an area where you can physically see what is happening as the two continental plates are slowing drifting apart and opening up to the earth beneath our feet. We stood ever so close to a very active, steaming fumarole that looked just like a baby volcano. Then through the steam clouds, we could see the visible remains of a collapsed visitor platform now draped over steaming rocks and abandoned. The words of our tour guide from the day before echoed in our heads. ""You're never 100% safe - close, but never 100%."" Time to go - but what a great mini-adventure.

Iceland,NeilandBarbara,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"I studied Geology at University many years ago, so going to see some geothermal activity was a must for me when visiting Iceland. The activity is caused by Iceland sitting on the spreading join of the North American and the European plates (the mis atlantic ridge). Lots of bubbling mud, hissing fissures and plenty of hydrogen sulphide and sulphur smells. So unusual and so much fun. No entrance fee.",Aug 2012
Iceland,Melliehi,Gunnuhver Hot Springs,4.0,"This outdoor phenomena can be reached via road 425 between Grindavik And Hafnir. The road is a gravel one and quite narrow in places however we managed to get to the place without any mishaps. There is a small gravel parking area but not much else and no admittance fee. It consists of a geothermal area full of sulphur and bubbling mud pools so the air around all smells sulphurous. A wooden walkway takes you round the whole area and offers excellent viewing opportunities. Young children should be watched as it is possible to stray off the path in some places.

We found the story of the disagreeable Gunnuhver, who seems to have ended up in one of these pools, quite entertaining especially since the story suggests that one can occasionally hear her scream and the place is full of hissing and high pitched whistles.

Our concerns were with safety and convenience. Masking was required, though a number of patrons didn't wear them, and we saw no signs in the public areas to remind them. Also, attendance was not limited to the 500 people that their email the day before said would be the maximum because of Covid. We estimated at least 700 in the orchestra section alone, and many were in the balconies.

In addition, we were mystified that no coat check was visible. We only found one very small rolling coat rack in the lobby areas.

Iceland,Brian T,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,3.0,"This angular, geometric, box-like piece of modernism dominates the foreshore of Reykjavik.

Opened in 2011, its design was a collaboration between Danish-Icelandic artist Ãlafur ElÃ­asson, and the Danish firm Henning Larsen Architects.

The structure consists of a steel framework clad with geometric shaped glass panels of different colours, particularly shades of green, grey and blue. The design apparently was influenced by Icelandâs exceptional and dramatic nature, particularly the greens and greys of the moss covered lava that covers a lot of the country. Situated on the boundary between land and sea, the building is a gleaming sculpture reflecting both sky and harbor, as well as the vibrant life of the city.

Inspired by basalt crystals, the faceted glass scatters reflections of the surrounding harbour and sky, and presents a glittering wall of light after dark.

I didnât find the structure particularly beautiful, nor do I think itâs going to occupy a place in the worldâs list of iconic cultural buildings in the same way that the likes of the Sydney Opera House does. But it is worth a peek inside. Whilst we didnât visit the concert theatre, the vast foyer with light streaming in was quite lovely to see; the light streaming through the glass panels creates an interesting kaleidoscope of colour on the floor of this space. Itâs even better from the balconies at higher levels. We didnât take the cinema experience; itâs just too expensive for a short film about whatâs on in Iceland, and seemed a bit gimmicky.

Iceland,Roving588670,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"Guest pianist Olga Kern is the best âperformerâ Iâve ever heard. Not only did she play Rakhmaninov from memory, with the intended dynamics, she put such emotion into her performance that she brought the piece alive as an actress would, it was incredible. She must have been exhausted by the end!
It was a delight to observe young conductor Bjarni Frimann Bjarnason. Such brio & vigour! His obvious enjoyment of the music was a delight to behold, he got what he wanted from the wonderful Sinfoniuhjomsveit Islands (Iceland symphony orchestra), who appear to be very tolerant of their conductorâs idiosyncrasies. That said, Bjarni had obviously done his homework: he had no need to refer to his score, it was apparently all committed to memory too, with his page turning more for the benefit of those of us sitting behind the stage in the Eldborg Hall.
A well constructed modern hall after the style of an old music-hall theatre, including the colour , it was comfortable (if a little warm).
Toilets are aplenty, there is a bar (which sells average red wine), the internal & external design of the building is beguiling. Such a delight for visitors to Reykjavik. I look forward to visiting again when I return.

Iceland,Tomas K,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"Before arriving in Reykjavik I went to Google maps to find out how it looks, when things are and so on.
Harpa is used as a meeting point for some city tours and I wanted to know how far it is from a hotel I booked and how it looks. Well, what I have seen was a bit on the ugly side.
However, the real thing is a different story and most images on Google doesn't reflect its true beauty.
Apart from being a music and events hall, meeting place and running their own tours, Harpa is a very interesting architectural 'event' or feast if you like. It's front wall is a metal & glass structure in the form of haney comb with inclusion of colour changing lights on it's outside (a reference to Northern lights). The ceiling is made of mirrors and non reflective surfaces adding an extra visual effect to the front structure. The main staircase... hmm, I think you should see it for yourself.

Iceland,Alex W,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"Iâve not been to a performance here, but it is free to go in and wander around looking at the architecture and that is what Iâm reviewing here.

The building is a marvellous multi level construction of basalt and glass. There are five levels that you can walk around and every corner has exciting new vistas and unusual angles. The frontage is made of glass panels with lights embedded within it that are programmed with a variety of patterns.

We spent about 45 minutes wandering around, admiring it and taking photos.

If you enjoy looking at architecture it is definitely worth a visit.

The concert hall is breathtaking and will be a great addition to Reykjavik for generations to come. The surrounding area is slowly building up to accommodate more travelers for the many concerts, plays and shows at Harpa. We were treated to a 30 minute concert in a small hall with outstanding acoustics which made us want to return for a future concert! Highly recommend this informative tour.",Jan 2020
Iceland,Taylor W,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"The Harpa is a gorgeous building right on the water in Reykjavik.

Primarily a concert hall and conference center - it also has a restaurant, shops, etc inside.

And also a public bathroom if you need a quick break!

The building itself is pretty amazing, the way the light glows off the windows is fantastic to watch.
During the evening hours the Harpa is lit up with lights glowing in the windows projecting different colors and patterns, and even the Icelandic flag.

Even if you donât venture inside I definitely recommend stopping by to check out the outside of the building.

The tour guide showed us this gem, as the ceiling is his favorite part. The lights on the outside of the building are miraculous and so colorful! The views from inside as you look are unlike anything you have seen before, as they are hexagon-shaped and they give you a different perspective than looking out a square window.

It's very much on display when you peer through the honeycomb of glass to the city of Reykjavik and the mountains in the distance. I was there for a forum once and suddenly saw everyone rushing to the west side of the building. The sunset as viewed through the honeycomb was breathtaking.

Iceland,Mary,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"We found this tour while looking for performances at Harpa - our tight schedule wouldn't allow us to get in a full show, which is why we chose the shorter (and daytime!) acoustical tour. Our guide was so wonderful and treated us with several opera songs in each of the halls that we visited, with context about the parts of the Icelandic sagas she was singing from. We got to learn about the actual design and build of each of the halls and enjoy a little music, and it was a just perfect way to experience Harpa. I'm so happy we took the time to get a real tour and that it was so special and personal. Thank you for the wonderful time!

Iceland,Johnny_vegan,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,4.0,"This is a bit of a cheat review as I didn't actually go inside the building, so my review is just of the stunning external architecture of the Harpa who's huge frame (over 140ft tall) dominates the old harbour area. We saw it in the daytime reflecting the harbour and the sky, but it was at night that it really came to life with its gleaming geometric glass panels of various colours. It is interesting how people's views of the building differ, as although I loved its design, 2 of my friends felt it was an ugly monstrosity (especially at the rear) that reminded them of a cheap disco ball. Perhaps I lack culture but I really liked its mirrored panes and strong position facing the ocean.

From what I know, the building was started before the financial crisis hit Iceland over a decade ago and was finished after a pause in proceedings, and it seems it is somewhat controversial with the locals because of the cost of building at a tricky financial time when many other building works were stopped but regardless of that to me it is an imposing and beautiful piece of modern architecture.

Windows tilt at crazy angles and light up at night in a representation of ""Aurora Borealis"", the ceilings inside resemble smashed mirrors.

Itâs a magnificent modern building (in Scotland, think of Dundeeâs V&A museum or The Hydro concert hall in Glasgow) We weâre fortunate enough to book ticket# to see Professor Brian Cox on his last venue of his âlectureâ tour/show. The young man at the Box Office was very, very helpful and in his advice we booked seats on the first floor on the first floor. We had a perfect and relatively close view of the stage and could shuffle these seats around to suit ourselves. The two and half our show was superb. The audience (for whom English is a second language) were well informed and receptive to Prof Cox. The theatre itself has is superbly well designed and impressive and the seating is comfortable. Harpa is magnificent at night when Iclandic icy blues and greens punctuate the exterior glass structure and reflect the carefully positioned water features.

Her presentation was fulsome and highly technically informative. No detail was spared and she even knew enough about the Sydney Opera House and its architect to compare the two, including the acoustic engineering involved.

A great tour to a great architectural feat built in the midst of the 2008 GFC.

BTW we went a fantastic jazz concert later in the week at Harpa. And it was a joy.

It was nice to attend a show for the evening, in this architecturally interesting building.

There is a free movie in the lowest level, on Iceland and it's volcanos, which was good also.

Iceland,Dorothy P,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,The concert hall was everything written about it and more. The red wood interior and the excellent acoustics made the experience the best I've had at a classical concert. It was being filmed for broadcast but it was not distracting. We ate dinner before in the 4th floor restaurant with pizza for my granddaughter. Rather upscale restaurant but were accommodating for an 8 year old. The Harpa is an incredible building.

Iceland,Traveldoc,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"A softened stone building, very much in the style of Lincoln Center, with lofty ceilings and huge spaces. On the harbor. Attended a symphony performance with marquis singers. A smorgasbord of ""pops"" like offerings from Prokofieff to Mozart and back. The orchestra was up to it, although they took a while (till an excerpt from the Tchaikovsky 4th Symphony) to wake up and put energy in their playing. But because this was a pops with a somewhat random selection, that may not be entirely fair.

The acoustics were very good if you choose your seats carefully. The quality of sound drops perceptibly as you move to the sides in the front of the orchestra. Best seats are probably the front of the first balcony or the second to section orchestra almost to where the stalls would be, if there were any. It is a large hall but dynamics were not a problem.

Iceland,KJKNYC,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,5.0,"What a beautiful piece of architecture! It is worth going in and exploring the different levels. The forms, the light, and the shadows make for remarkable photos. They have a nice schedule of events, so it is worth checking before you plan your trip. Currently they are running two seemingly campy shows about Iceland. We went to their pricey ""cinematic experience"" about Iceland. It is shown in a small room on all four walls and the ceiling. We thought it might be cool with our 11 year old daughter. It is totally not worth it. It should be a freebie they give to visitors. Actually, even if it were free, I'm not sure it would be worth the time unless you just wanted to sit down for a few. They have a very nice gift shop with Icelandic goods. It may be a little pricey, but at least you're supporting the arts!

Worth a look and there was quite a few concerts and shows on if you have the time.

If feels like a standard 'visitor centre' promo reel and only lasts about 13 minutes. But no, this is not free, it cost 1500 ISK each and with a family of four ended up costing me about Â£40 GBP...

It was so bad, to actually be funny (indeed, I embarrassed my wife by laughing throughout most of it). It plays like a student film, trying to be artistic, but without worrying about the basics such as contrast, focus or exposure.

If you want to see the inside of auditorium, you have to attend a show. We wanted to see what the auditoriums were like and how good the acoustics were. We saw the ""How to be Icelandic"" show because it has showtimes almost daily. It was about an hour and was cute. We learned the auditorium itself is nothing special or ornate architecturally speaking. If you want to say you saw a show at Harpa (which was what we wanted to do) and you want something light and funny, this is your best bet. if you are not a theater person, you may just want to walk around the free areas admiring the stained glass windows, grab a few pictures, then go on to the next thing.

Iceland,Brian T,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"These comments relate to the the beautiful black beach right in VÃ­k Ã­ MÃ½rdal, rather than the popular black sand beach of Reynisfjara Beach, which is a little further afield and not as easily as accessible.

Vikâs black beach is a beautiful spot. The sand is volcanic, pulverised lava. From the car park behind the small shopping mall, youâll see a path which leads you down to stretch of black beach. Itâs clearly signed. You can walk quite a distance along the black sand to the east. The silver-lined waves of the Atlantic Ocean wash across the volcanic black sand with tremendous power, so take care as you are walking. From this beach you will also spot the basalt sea stacks called Reynisdrangar just off the eastern shore. Legend has it that the sea stacks used to be trolls. They were pulling their ships to shore when they accidentally got caught in the light of dawn and turned into stone.

I donât think you can walk to f Reynisfjara Beach directly from the beach at Vik. Itâs accessible by Road 215 off Route 1 to the west of Vik.

Itâs an extraordinary sight and a stop you should make time for if you are in, or passing through, Vik.

This is a popular tourist attraction and FREE! It also has a nice restaurant located there to take a break from exploring. Make sure to take a closer look within the arch to see the various type of rock formations to include shale on one side and columnar basalt on the other. The tourists visiting also seemed quite polite and made sure to get out of the way so folks could take a pic of the rock arch. Please be careful with the incoming waves--they can be quite deadly. If staying in the area, I recommend visiting off-peak hours since this is a bus tour stop. Also, there is light all night long in the summer so avoid the crowds!

Iceland,Jun David,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"It is located in the south coast of Iceland near the little town of Vik.

I've been to black sand beaches from the Caribbean and the Philippines but this beach do not have fine sand but black gravels and pebbles. This is a beautiful non tropical beach.

The picturesque beach includes caves, basalt formation and two rock formations in the sea. It was the film locations for Game of Thrones, Rogue 1 and Noah.

Please be warned that beach has extremely strong water and often push a lot further up the beach than one might expect.

This is a must see attraction in Iceland, Usually included in the South Coast Tour.

Iceland,Flyer,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"A few friends and I went to the Reynisfjara Black Sand beach in a rental car, and while there are a lot of tourists here, I thought it was a fun natural wonder that is worth a visit.

This is kind of in a secluded place, but you can pair this visit with a visit to the nearby town of the VÃ­k for lunch and some different views.

The beach itself is rather upfront. Itâs about half a football field of black pebbles (more than sand) of varying sizes. You canât exactly get sand in between your toes here, but it is still an interesting texture.

There are also some very cool rock formations for some pictures, but the water can be treacherous and there are signs everywhere to be careful because this is Icelandâs âdeadliest beach.â

I had fleece lined tights and my calves were stinging. When you do find a place you can look, it is beautiful!!!!

Iceland,Rafiq Patni - Tour Consultant,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"BACKGROUND:-
Reynisfjara is a world-famous black-sand beach found on the South Coast of Iceland, just beside the small fishing village of VÃ­k Ã­ MÃ½rdal. With its enormous basalt stacks, roaring Atlantic waves and stunning panoramas, Reynisfjara is widely considered to be the most beautiful example of Iceland's black sand beaches.

DISTANCE:-
Reynisfjara Beach is located on the south coast of Iceland, 180 km from ReykjavÃ­k

HOW?
REYNISFJARA BLACK SAND BEACH IS MADE OF LAVA
Reynisfjara black volcano beach on Iceland's South Coast is one of the most unique black sand beaches in the world. It's not a tanning kind of beach. More look than touch, it was created by lava flowing into the ocean which cooled almost instantly as it touched the water

ABOUT?
Black sand is sand that is black in color. One type of black sand is a heavy, glossy, partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands, found as part of a placer deposit. Another type of black sand, found on beaches near a volcano, consists of tiny fragments of basalt.

SWIM & ETC?
But this does not stop the most dedicated ocean swimmers! ... And then, after a swim in the sea, you can run back up the beach to the hot tub which is a comfortable 39Â°C (102Â°F). A unique experience! If you want to truly experience Icelandic nature, and try something new, you should certainly check out NauthÃ³lsvÃ­k beach!

CAN WE?
We later learned that it's not allowed to take anything from the beach or natural grounds. We are so sorry about that and return both the sand and pebbles back home to Iceland

SAFE?
The crime in the capital, Reykjavik, is almost non-existent. However, petty theft and anti-social behavior may happen, especially around bars at night in downtown. Tourists are very unlikely to see anything unpleasant as homelessness and drugs are not a problem. There are no unsafe or bad areas in the city.

On top of that a photoshoot was going on that totally gave me less option to have a one second click on my iPad for a simple pic. FYI, I was there in the late afternoon, late August, solo, nonintrusive!

Your experience at this beach, which must be seen from both ends, will be dictated by weather. In good conditions it is fantastic from the basalt rising right out of the black sand with the sea stacks right off the coast to the other end on the bluff looking down on a seastack that rises right out of the black sand with white foam waves sweeping in. Try to see it on a day without rain or wind. Sun is best, but clouds are okay. Rain would not be fun and mute the beauty.. just wind may be okay, but cold. Rain and wind will diminish the experience.

Black sand/pebbles are incredible as are the views of the basalt rock formations called the ""Troll Toes"".",Apr 2019
Iceland,MC F,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"We came here on a windy summers day in August. We actually got confused with another black sand beach on Google Maps which is near the Solheim plane wreck. This is the actual Black sand beach which is further east to the plane wreck and puffin colony.

Here you can find ample parking, and even if not, there is loads of space up the road to just pull into the side of the road leading to the beach. There is a small cafe there so you can buy some nice coffee to enjoy in the cold wind.

The basalt columns are pretty awesome. I understand they belong to the same family as those found at the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland. You'll find hordes of tourists climbing these stacks for the perfect instagram shot - yes, we did the same thing too. There is evidence of erosion on the stacks, probably due to to many tourists in the area.

The rocky nature of the beach is gorgeous. You can find many cool shapes of rocks and pebbles most probably derived from the volcanic matter. Further down the beach are the rock stacks - absolutely amazing. Do walk down the beach to get a better sight of these formations.

The colours of this sight are purely awesome. Do give this area a visit if you are in the vicinity.

A note is that you can't reach the black sand beach from the puffin colony / lighthouse area and you will have to drive around the mountain and Vik to reach it.

The weather was pretty windy and grey but that did not take away the beauty of the place. The different shape of the rocks were for us the most interesting and beautiful part of the beach.

You dont need to be a geologist to appreciate the beauty of these rocks and it was too bad that tourists were climbing the rocks for their pictures.

Most of all our stops in Iceland were much later in the day usually after 3pm. So it was late in the day when we arrived, usually plenty of parking and not too many people during most all our stops. We hiked up and down the black beach. We have 11 yrs. twins and they were very interested in the rocks, sand and formations.

There is a large parking area, I did not see any facilities anywhere, although I believe there was a gift store or cafe. Wear good shoes, the rocks and sand can be a bit tricky to navigate.

At least at the end of June it was a very peaceful place, and slightly exotic as well. Numerous birds nesting on a huge cliff less than a kilometer away gave their own pleasant addition to the sound environment, caused mainly by the waves of the ocean. The rock formations further added niceness to the scenery. All in all, it gave us perhaps more than we expected.",Jun 2019

Iceland,Jon_R_Travel,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"The black sand beach is overrun with tourists in high season - and while parking is limited, at least you do not have to pay for it (as of June 2019). There are interesting basalt columns (good for instagramming - ugh), a neat cave, interesting rock formations out to the sea and lots of room to get away from the crowds if you walk to the west on the open part of the beach. As the signs say, stay away from the water's edge, the Atlantic ocean can be unforgiving.

Having said that, the best views are from hiking the cliffs above the beach. One can access the above plateau by driving a little further east on the ringroad, to Vik. The access path is an offshoot of the first inhabited east-west road to the right of the ringroad just as you enter Vik - it is a dirt/gravel road that switchbacks up the hill past a number of nesting birds, with great views of Vik to the east - it was roped off to vehicles when I walked up. At the top, one comes to a fence, and one can turn left and start a circuit following stakes with yellow tops - though once you pass the view over the black sand beach - which is great - you have to keep your eyes out for the turn as the yellow posts turn white and head back down after the views of the black beach (so there is probably an entrance to the route on the black sand side (ie. west side) of the plateau). The top of the plateau is generally a meadow, the path is well carved out, there are sheep wandering around and there are great views looking north to the glacier. I highly recommend the hike - it is about 5km or so in all. It took me about 1.5hrs (I missed the turnoff, hence my knowledge of the white post route...), though others reference the hike as closer to 2+, depending upon how much you stop.

Iceland,Tahoepov,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"Iceland is a minefield of explosive volcanic energy, and because of this unique beautiful shapes and patterns are formed across the landscape.

As basaltic lava cools over an extended period of time, beautiful geometric forms emerge; incredible columns of hexagonal basalt rock that often form cliffs that stretch as high as the eye can see. These Basalt formations can be found all around the world, but Iceland is one of the best places to find these geological treasures.

From the beach you have a view to the Reynisdrangar sea stacks. These bizarre looking rock pillars are said to be petrified trolls that were caught outside at sunrise and frozen in time, but some strongly believe that theyâre actually basalt columns that were once part of the extensive shoreline cliffs that remained standing while other parts were battered down by the ocean. What you believe depends on how much you believe in the fairies and trolls of Iceland.

This is a busy attraction, close to the Ring Road, a short walk allows you to experience the rock formations...but if you walk a little further down the beach you will have it all to yourself leaving the tourists behind. As with most beaches in Iceland- be careful. The currents are strong and coupled with cold arctic water and strong undertow- never turn your back. Rogue waves and the ocean are serious business, getting close is never a good idea. No picture is worth it.

Near the parking lot is a small restaurant offering hot beverages and a small menu. Hot soup and free wifi always available. If you don't see something you like Vik is a short drive from the beach.

Iceland,GirlieWeekender,Black Sand Beach,5.0,First and foremostâ DO NOT GO NEAR THE WATER. The winds are no joke. The black âsandâ and the basalt stacks make it look like youâre on another planet. It was stunning.,Mar 2019
Iceland,Aussiepam,Black Sand Beach,3.0,"on a windy rainy day it is NOT the place to go. As we drove to it the rain was quite heavy and fog kept us from seeing too far in front of us. I was sure others would bypass this place but the car park was quite crowded (and wet). Since we were there we decided to have a walk to see what it was all about. The beach sand is black as you would expect and rather hard to walk thru. We did manage to walk to the cave and found that a couple had gotten married and were having pictures taken inside (how on earth she managed to get to the cave in the rain and wind wearing a white wedding gown was a question I wanted to ask). Since it was so cold we just looked, took a few pictures then headed out. I'm glad we saw it but it really would have been so much better on a sunny day. We were totally soaked to the skin and rather miserable for the next hour in the car while our heater dried us out.

Iceland,Francesco G,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"I had a stop on the black sand beach in a tour, the weather was really foggy and it seemed to be on another world. The ocean was mixed with the fog making difficult to find the split between the two. Just be very careful that the ocean is quite strong and an unexpected wave can occur at any moment. From time to time some tourists pay even fatally this. I recommend to enjoy this place at safe distance. I can ensure you that it can be fully enjoyed at such distance.",May 2019
Iceland,Roosmxrijn,Black Sand Beach,5.0,We stayed at the Black Beach suites. That is like 5 minutes by car. IT was a foggy and rainy day. We went in the afternoon when iT was almost dry. The water was so wild so the waves were very big and powerfull. This Made the experiece very cool! Unfortunately there was not that much sight because of the fog. But of course we saw the famous wall of the Game Of Thrones and it gave a really cool image with the wild water and the Game Of Thrones wall.,May 2019

Iceland,deedee8,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"OMG!!! We went late afternoon (trying to do one more thing in Vik) and it was chock a block with people. The parking lot was insane (I felt badly for the people who were there for the restaurant. Pretty sure patrons donât expect to fight through the crowds for food). Visit first thing in the morning to see if its not so crazy busy and dress warmly. The wind was fierce when we were there.

but...
WOW!!! Impressive! You can see why itâs so popular. Nice long walk on the black sandy beach (itâs more gritty than sandy) and the awesome rock formations reminded us of Giantâs Causeway in Northern Ireland.

Iceland,SnoopyHo,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"We drove about 3 hours from Hotel Vellir on a windy, foggy, rainy March day. Even the weather is bad and unpredictable, still worth to visit. The black sands were really fine, pretty, and very clean. The rocks and marbles were shinny. I personal think they are prettier than those from Hawaii and Malaysia. Of course, others may have different opinions. Then with the towering cliffs, we posted some interesting pictures. There was a small cave next to it, where you could hide from pouring rain. There was only one restaurant at the entrance of the beach, in front of parking lot. You can use bathroom if order from restaurant. They had good turnip soup. Carrot cake was little sweet, not enough carrot taste. One thing please note. About first hour drive from hotel to south, the path was uphill and pretty foggy due to the weather. I couldn't see two cars in front of me. Be careful driving to destination. Not sure if it's from the rain or uphill? just be careful. Enjoy and be safe.

We were warned that many people have been caught in an undertow and were warned not to get anywhere near the water. I guess the tide was up because the waves were coming up to the path that leads to the rocks coming up from the water. I halfheartedly tired to get over there, but a wave came up and I decided to not risk it! I did get a few distant pics of the rocks, so I was satisfied.

Iceland,atravellerobserved,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"On our trip back along the south coast back to Reykjavik we were told we should stop at Black Sand Beach, even though it's a small detour. We were really glad we did. This beach is black sand - as the name suggests - but it has the most massive waves we'd ever seen. Granted it was a very windy day but it was stunning to see. It's a very short walk to the beach from the car park.

The waves are so powerful, and a bit frightening each time they suddenly shoot up the beach towards people. Beware the section with no footprints! Apparently the beach area sort of just drops away which is why the sea is so fierce. There's a rock formation in the sea and against the cliff that is well worth seeing too.

Although parking is free it isn't the place to stop for food and the toilet because you have to pay for both and just for a pasta dish it was around 2600KR (Â£16).

Iceland,Pepe PeÃ±a,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"Another world.

How to get there? From Route 1 turn to (right or left depending which direction you are going) Route 215 and go 5.9 km (6 min) to the parking lot (there is also a restaurant called Black Beach Restaurant). This is just 10 minutes from VÃ­k Ã­ MÃ½rdal (approx. 11 km), which is the closest town.

Experience: from another world. I have never been in a black sand beach and is really impressive; this is not the only place where you can see black sand beaches in Island, but seems to be the most popular spot, maybe because it is close to VÃ­k Ã­ MÃ½rdal and the DyrhÃ³laey Lighthouse, also has a basaltic wall and last but not least, the awesome Reynisdrangar (lot of stories around these rocks).
No, is not a beach for swimming, specially because of its aggressive and treacherous tide. So, keep that in mind if you are getting close to the water.
Just walking in the beach is enough for appreciate this beautiful spot. There is a small cave with basaltic formations; you can also see at the distance the arch of DyrhÃ³laey and you can try to get as close as you can to the shore and get a closer look of Reynisdrangar.

Opening Hours: all day (not sure if you can see something during night).

Cost: parking and admission are free.

Duration: one hour and a half.

Other: prepared for the crowd.

Iceland,Lesley H,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"We stopped in this town the first time for the gift shop/coffee shop/grocery store. Other tour buses were there, and we didn't know to look behind to see the beach. On our way back, we finally found the Black Sand Beach which was further down and a drive from the shop. The drive to the beach was pretty, but when we got out and actually walked on the thousands of small black stones and sand, while looking up at these gorgeous almost pillars in the rock, we were completely blown away. It was 3pm, and the sun was more golden, as that is their twilight in the winter. My photographs are sensational with the gold and rainbow reflections on the black stones. There are lots of tourists there, as we expected, but we were patient and not on a time schedule, so we stayed about an hour and a half. The Black Sand Beach is going to be in an upcoming Star Wars movie ( I was told), and I can completely believe it. Oh, be sure to look up at the cliff birds going in and out of their nests! The whole experience was magical...Thank you to beautiful Iceland for sharing this wonder of the world with us!!!

This beach was COLD, WINDY and as you'll see from the signs, can be fatal. As our guide said, don't turn your back on the water.
Geology fascinates me, and this beach is edged with huge black cliffs, with a selfie inspiring shallow cave.

The Icelandic landscape is by turns dramatic, stunning and otherworldly; there are waterfalls that carve up the volcanic landscape, glaciers that seem to push against earth and sky and jagged, angular snowcapped mountains that rise dramatically from the ground. Icelandic horses and sheep dot the magnificent landscape. We drove in and out of the rain for hours, and when we got to the beach, the precipitation had intensified; however, the stormy weather couldn't hide the black sand, I think composed of crushed volcanic debris, and the mammoth waves and surf that pounded the Icelandic shore. What a treat! Afterwards, we had Icelandic meat soup at The Soup Company. All in all, an incredible day!

Most places in South Coast can get really packed with big and noisy groups and their buses. So getting in these places as early as possible is the only way to enjoy the view and take a pause from the world.

The spot counts with a tourists facility with a cafe and restrooms, but Iâm not sure about their schedules during the seasons. Thereâs a large parking site as well and very close to the beach.

Since I went at the beginning of winter Iâll share so relevant points regard the environment:

1) Check the tide and the weather. Some specific parts of the beach are unreachable on the high tide. Plus, Things can get pretty ugly with the wind and the ""sneaker wavesâ that come out of nowhere and literally drag whoever is silly enough to give their back to the sea.

2) The wind gusts sometimes reach 80-120km/h. On the day I was there I struggled by simply trying to get out of the car and ended with a dent on my calve when it got hit by the door. In these conditions, pay attention with children and the elder. I saw a old lady simply being pushed against the rocks with a sudden wind strike.

3) if have a small car, beware of the wind conditions: the day I went to this spot, a small car simply got out the road with a sudden wind gust and hit a stone wall.


That said, the place is beautiful no matter if the weather is good or post-apocalyptic.

Iceland,Joel B,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"The black sand beach is a unique sight to see as well as the lava rock formations and caves that adorn it, very picturesque with lots of photo oppertunities.

If you can get down to Vik and see the Lava show showing at I think 1330 and 1700 book on their website using promo code 'ONLINE' they will teach you all about how the rocks form and why the sand is blaxk, you even get to see and feel the heat of real life lava flowing Infront of you

I cannot stress enough though you must be careful visiting this beach and the surrounding coast, particularly if you have children.
whilst the sea may seem calm 'sneaker waves' have taken many lives from where people thought they were safe and also from tourists pure stupidity

Then as you walk around the corner of the beach there is a cave like structure. Although it was cold, it's worth the visit. Our guide did warn us never wander too close to the waves or turn our backs to the waves as some waves can sweep up suddenly further shore and drag you into the water. We witnessed some people swept up by the waves to their knees suddenly and being January, it is absolutely freezing.",Jan 2019
Iceland,paulanchris,Black Sand Beach,5.0,The black sand is amazing to walk on it leaves footprints like soft sand and glistens with the sun when the waves wash over them. The crunch sound is mesmerising care needed as the waves are deceptive and fast.,Jan 2019
Iceland,Mrs F,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"This Is an amazing place to visit, 15 minutes from the small town of Vik, we arrived about 11.30am the tour busses and visitors were all heading to the black beach, the basalt stack and roaring Atlantic sea with it waves that give no warning or care who they knock off their feet were waiting.
I was stood probably 50 metres from the caostline and had read the notices about sneaker waves and how dangerous they can be. We were stood admiring the coastline and the waves crashing in and not for a minute did we think we were too close when one wave came rolling in, I turned to run but my foot slipped on the soft black sands and down I went, luckily we were far enough from the sea to get the remenants of the wave crash over my back and legs! There I was In January freezing and wet.
We headed straight to the car I stripped off my lower garments and my legs were blue with the cold. Not what I had planned for our visit to the beach.
Please be careful, so many people told me afterward how lucky we had been as many people had died standing in the very spot we stood admiring the forces of nature, we were stood only 10 meters away from the cave.
I was not the only one caught that day, there must have been at least a dozen more who were around the corner from the cave and basalt stacks.
This has not put me off as this place as it is stunning, I will definitely return but will stand much further back and respect the forces of the Atlantic Ocean.
If you want to see the trolls in the water, you get a great view of these from the coastline in Vik, not worth the risk to get a great picture from the black beach.
We hired a car which gives you the freedom to see the coastline from different areas. At the beach there are toilets and a cafe, the car park is a 5 minute walk from the beach.
This really is somewhere worth seeing.

People don't go here for the waves, but to admire the spectacular view of a truly black sand paradise. Take amazing pictures and make sure to cover up, cause it's cold and windy. We climbed the rocks on the shore (to a safe distance) and took amazing pictures. There are ""beware of currents"" signs everywhere and they tell you that you WILL die if you get caught in a current. They warn you to not even turn your back to the ocean when taking a picture ...if you are getting close to the water, that is. They told us that sometimes waves can come and suck you in, to never be seen again. Despite this chilling fact, this place is a must see.

Thereâs a corner where they liked to gather and they were sheltered from the wind but blindsided by the big waves. Nobody was swept away, thankfully, but some got soaked.

The rock cliff is stepped (am curious to know how it got that way), there's a little cave people were huddling in, the beach is, obviously, fine black sand, and the Reynisdrangar Columns are intriguing.

The basalt columns are strangely beautiful and made for a perfect photo opportunity. The sand itself was so unique and I couldnât help but scoop some up and take it home with me. I loved the dramatic colours, the otherworldly features, and plummeting cliffs above you. Iâm not really a beach fanatic, but this is by far my favourite beach ever!

My tips:
- Take my advice, arrive sooner rather than later to beat the crowds. If you do arrive at peak time, take your time and be polite with other people try to pose for photos.
- Please please please follow the signs - do NOT get too close to the water, it is extremely dangerous and known to sneak up on people and drag them away.
- Wander a little way up and down the beach and take photos from every angle, itâs all beautiful and some of the most stunning pictures we took are from an unsuspecting angle.

Lava beach is hard to walk barefoot on, the water is freezing cold and the waves are too sudden and high to swim. In fact they are called âsneaker wavesâ because they just sneak up on you and therefore, no swimming is allowed.
I thought those waves sounded like an incoming fighter jet! My cousin heard it too.

Iceland,bjeronimo,Black Sand Beach,4.0,Really cool place to visit. Personally I don't think you'll need to much time. Seeing black sand is a big change to what we are use to. Don't get to close to the water as you can easily get soaked. It happened to us along with 20+ people who weren't expecting the wave to make it's way that quickly up the shore. Enjoy the views!,Oct 2018

One day a sheep will lose its footing and come bouncing down to land on a tourist...! Also make sure to enjoy the rumbling of the waves under your feet (it's like an earthquake).

Iceland,Lee T,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"My partner and I went on a South coast tour with extreme Iceland, as part of this tour we attended the black sand beach. Despite the weather being poor, the beach is really facinating to see. The surrounding caves are great to take photos of and there was a lot of people around the basalt cliffs.

The only downsides I would say are: we were warned not to go too close to the sea as waves can be unexpectedly high at times. And secondly the only toilets in the area were in a cafe which you had to be a customer of to use.

Other than that I would definitely recommend going if you're in Vik area

The rock formations are cool but it was, frankly, the least enjoyable stop on my solo tour of Iceland. I enjoyed the beach and rocks a bit further down the road far more. It didn't have the same formation of stacked rock columns but it also didn't have the same amount of people jockeying for space.
I'd say if you can find a parking spot it's worth a quick look. I'd hate to see it in prime season.

The beach is a short walk from the parking lot. It's a nice soft black sand. When you look to your right you see the Reynisdrangur sea stacks. Gorgeous view of the beach, sea and the sea stacks.

I wasn't sure about visiting it as I kind of thought - yes beach but black sand and so what - but just to see the sheet power of the ocean - you can hear the waves crashing from the car park its so loud. Pay close attention to the signs telling you not to tun your back on the waves - may have lost their lives. When we were there one photographer, keen to get a picture of just him in it went a bit too close to the waves and got knocked over - I don't even want to think abut what happened to his camera but he got soaked and could have easily been dragged in had he been a few feet further in. Very atmospheric and the sand is black as its volcanic. Make sure you stop to go to the toilet before going as you have to pay to use the conveniences there.

Iceland,BaileyL99,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"We were lucky enough to see a couple of dozen puffins at the beach on August 24th. I had heard that the day before there were hundreds. As puffins generally all leave about the same day each year, I worried that was their final day. But, we did enjoy seeing a handful of them on the 24th. I imagine they have all left for the winter by now. The beach is beautiful. It is a bit challenging to stroll down as it is made up of a thick layer of medium sized black rocks. You feel like you've been trudging through about a foot of snow instead of strolling along a typical beach. But, the views of the basalt columns are worth the walk. I would plan well over an hour for this visit. The walk takes a while & you do not want to rush it & miss the beautiful scenery. I could have spent an entire day just enjoying the birds, waves, and views. Our guide did warn us that the ocean in this area is particularly dangerous. There is a history of sneaker waves that will take you out to sea & the rip currents are quite bad in the area. The non-puffin type bird that frequents the area apparently also has a pesky habit of vomiting on people if they get too close to them. I didn't see the birds up close, but I did not try to either. If you avoid getting in the water & the wrath of the birds, it is a beautiful area to visit. If I make it to Iceland again, it is on my short list of places that I must visit again.

Iceland,bigtyke,Black Sand Beach,5.0,We did this as part of the Gray Line South Coast tour. We had plenty of time to see the beach and basalt columns. This are similar to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. It is amazing how the lava has cooled in the hexagonal columns. The columns were inspiration for Hallgrimskirkja church in Reykjavik.,May 2018

Iceland,David N,Black Sand Beach,3.0,"Apart from the very impressive Basalt columns on the beach there were far too many visitors crowding the place out.

Was worth visiting but was slightly disappointing.",Aug 2018

Iceland,Liam A,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"On our tour of southern Iceland, Vik is as far south-east as we went, and it was totally worth it. Our trip to Iceland was full of firsts as it is such a unique place and the black beach is up there. Let's face it, where else are you going to find one. We spent a good while just walking up and down, exploring the rocks, collecting lava stones and watching the surf roll in over the black sand which is mesmerising. The views from up near the church are amazing too so pop up there.

This we feel is a must see if time allows.",Oct 2017
Iceland,Debby W,Black Sand Beach,4.0,The Black sand beach is unlike any beach I've ever been on - and heed the warnings about sudden waves - tourists drown here by being ignorant of their surroundings.

Iceland,MikeFo,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"The black beach is .... well black of course, it also has a number of caves and square profile forms of basalt in the side of the cliff, formed from when soft lava rock has been worn away. There is a perch above where loads of puffins are flying in and out (save teh cost of a puffin watching expedition). This is not a bathing beach due to the waves (sneakers) being very dangerous, it is also very windy.",Aug 2018

Iceland,Judy,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"Everywhere in Iceland is postcard perfect. The drive to the black sand beach is amazingly beautiful. This is a highly tourist spot so be patient if you want a picture without tourist in it. Itâs really tiny black pebble rock beach rather than sand. So you donât really get sand sticking on your shoes or clothes. Gorgeous view to watch subset or just simply enjoy a walk along the beach. If I could I will spend half a day here to enjoy this beautiful slowly. Thereâs only one restaurant and the food is really good. Fish and chip, pasta, burger were all delicious. Dreaming to Avis it this place in winter as well.",Aug 2018

Bathrooms were available and there was a couple of options for food as well. Simply beautiful.,Aug 2018

THe cafe was not yet opened. In fact we noticed that nothing much is open early in Iceland.,Aug 2018
Iceland,amp330,Black Sand Beach,4.0,There is no shortage of black sand round the coast of Iceland so that in itself isnât that unique. The rock formations are worth seeing and the view of the Dyrholaey rock arch and the big rocks in the sea add to the experience.

Iceland,Fred B,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"If you like licorice. What gets called the Black Sand beach and Reynisfjara beach run into each other. The Reynisfjara area includes the sea stacks and cliff faces, while the Black sand beach is the stretch where wind and wave have ground the black basalt finer. We do have long sandy beaches in some places along the British Columbia coast â but those all look like most other beaches, grey to white. The black sand and smooth black pebbles here are most unlike other beaches. Itâs tempting to pick up the wee, perfectly smoothed pebbles as keepsakes; we didnât. We chose to simply enjoy the walk even though it was raining. If you havenât walked on a black beach before, it is a tad other worldly. And, depending where you are, youâll see the bizarre spires of Reynisfjara.

Iceland,Lawrence S,Black Sand Beach,4.0,My son was studying volcano and rock formations at the time we visited iceland and this beach has a great formation of columnar basalt.

Iceland,Robert A,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"Having been to beaches worldwide, as a big beach lover, this one gets my vote as a world-class beach! So unique, so scenic, so powerful dangerous surf-wise, and so embellished with the amazing cliffs, shaft-rock formations and off-shore rock formations too. I dare you to pick out ""the best"" black-grey beach pebble! And, just imagine when you are here, how many Viking Long Boats have navigated onto this beach as they surely did, and survived? Easy to see. Definitely Recommended.",Jun 2018

Iceland,Stefan G,Kerid Crater,3.0,"The water is beautiful in the sunlight. Nice views from the rim of the crater. But, let's be honest - it's a hole in the ground. You have to pay to see it (like everything in Iceland) and it's really just average. If you're in the area, then sure, why not, stop by and see it. I wouldn't drive hours out of my way for this, though.

I'd be disappointed if I hiked up to the top and there was no sunlight to illuminate the beauty of the water. So, my one piece of advice would be to reconsider paying for this if the sky is overcast.

Iceland,Kim G,Kerid Crater,5.0,"Very beautiful crater that is easily accessible from the parking lot. There is a fee of 400ISK per person.

Almost no walking from the ticket booth before you get to an incredible view of the crater from the top. It was formed 6500 years ago so something special to see. The water is a lovely blue green colour with lovely tones of green and red around the inside of the crater walls.

You can walk down to the water's edge but the view from up top is fantastic as well. This is a quick and easy stop along the Golden Circle.

Iceland,HeardItBothWays,Kerid Crater,4.0,"My husband and I visited Kerid Crater while exploring the Golden Circle on our trip to Iceland. The parking lot was conveniently located and had a small fee.

It was cool to see a volcanic crater in person. This is on a smaller scale than a place like Crater Lake but a lot easier to visualize because of it. It was incredibly windy so we didn't stay too long or drone.

I noticed some reviews mention drones are prohibited but that's incorrect. Drones are permitted at Kerid Crater, though I'm surprised when any can because it tends to be quite windy!

This is a nice stop along the Golden Circle!

The price to get in is very reasonable, and once you're in, the crater is right there and you're already at the top of it; no extra hike to get there which was pretty nice. The walk around the top edge of the crater was easy and fairly quick, even with stops along the way for photos. It's a pretty cool landmark!",Sep 2021
Iceland,Steviefull,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Another stop on our Golden Circle with Nice Travel. Unfortunately the weather at this stop was absolutely shocking so we sprinted from the car park the 50 or so metres to have a brief look and a photo before returning to the minibus absolutely drenched.

We only stayed at the top but apparently you can go down further towards the water, there is an entrance fee which is only a couple of pounds.

In short its a nice view and great photo opportunities but not worth travelling over 30 minutes just to see this on its own, as part of a tour its a lovely addition.

For me it was not so gorgeous because in UA we have even more beautiful lakes like this one. But in fact, this lake was one of the most relaxing places in the whole Iceland.

Iceland,Brian D,Kerid Crater,5.0,"The best thing about this crater is it has steps down to the lake from the top (parking lot is located at the top of the crater). Along the top rim of the crater, the path is mostly wide and for those with a fear of heights, this is one of the few craters that can be navigated all the way around without turning back. There are one or two very short narrow sections, but overall, it is one of the widest rims you will find on a crater. There is a small entrance fee that is paid at a kiosk in the parking lot. Once you pay, you have the option of navigating around the rim of the crater or heading down the stairs to the lake at the bottom of the crater. If you do opt for the rim walk, and you aren't afraid of heights, you can get right up to the edge for some great pictures and breathtaking views. Otherwise, you can stay a safe distance from the edge and still enjoy the views. Extremely rare to find a create with a lake at the bottom. You can walk all the way around the lake at the bottom of the crater. The hike takes about 1/2 an hour. Well worth it for some great memories and some excellent pictures and outstanding views of Iceland.

Iceland,Vadim,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Lake Kerid was the first stop on the Golden circle tour. This lake was formed in the crater of a volcano. Kerid is not as photogenic as the crater lakes of the Azores, but it looks pretty. The imagination paints a picture of an eruption and the subsequent filling of the crater with rainwater, but this is not the case. Kerid is not an explosive crater, but a slag one. It probably formed due to a small magma chamber under the earth's surface. Then the roof collapsed, forming a crater that gradually filled with ground water. The water in Kerid is not depleted, but changes in accordance with the ground water horizon. It is not possible to get here for free, the lake is located on private territory, so the entrance fee is 450 ick. Kerid resembles an amphitheater in shape and has good acoustics. Concerts were held here several times, with musicians performing on boats. You can get around the lake in 20-30 minutes. The tour guide doesn`t allow you to go down during the stop.

So, the original plan was not to stop, but blessed with good weather we had some spare time to kill. First of all, there is an entrance fee of 400 ISK per person. I suppose that's reasonable, considering Iceland tagged as one of the most expensive. As other posters mentioned, a visit in the winter gives you a unique view of the water totally frozen. There are a lot of writings on the surface indicating that some tourists had little fun. Perhaps ruined the view for others? But it did not bother us much. Trails around the crater are easy to follow, but some spots are little icy. Yaktrax type crampons are recommended.

as we went during the winter there was snow everywhere and the crater was frozen.
parking was free
there was a small fee to go to the crater but that was more than reasonable in cost.
the scenery is beautiful, it looks like something from out of this world.
my partner even managed to walk down into the crater and stand in the centre which was an experience also.
well worth a visit

We visited on the day that we did the Golden Circle attractions. We first stopped at Ãingvellir, then BrÃºarfoss, Geysir, Gulllfoss and finally Kerid Crater.
This was the only attraction where you had to pay an entrance fee, but it is very inexpensive.
We walked around the rim and then walked down the steps. Amazing to look at from all angles. Plenty of photo ops.
Plan to spend about an hour here.

Iceland,Jordan Leanne,Kerid Crater,5.0,"We added Kerid in as a stop on the route between Selfoss and Laugarvatn as we wanted to see a range of features and landscapes on our trip. Though this was the only 'natural' place we visited which we had to pay an entrance fee at, there was no complaint at paying as the pathways were well maintained and there were areas marked out for conservation so it was good to see how the fee contributes to the experience. We walked a lap around the rim of the crater which gave us fantastic views of the nearby area, and an deceptive view of the crater below. The info boards at the top were also great to read. After walking to the bottom of the crater we found the pool/lake thinnly frozen. There were people skimming stones across the ice which made an unearthly echo! It was so different to compare the scale of the crater from the bottom- so almost two different experiences. This is a fantastic stop for any visit!

However, I find it a bit odd to charge an entrance fee when people are literally just stopping by for 10/15 minutes. Especially when the weather is very windy and cold, people are not going to be here for long.

Itâs a small walk to the top of the crater from where the bus drops you.
Be careful in winter, a lady on our tour slipped and was taken away by ambulance. So wear sensible shoes.
Itâs high and with winds was quite cold.
If taking children be very careful.
There are no barriers to stop you falling over the edge.

Iceland,Jon F,Kerid Crater,4.0,"We were in two minds as conscious of limited daylight in November and so much to see in Iceland. Having decided to stop we didnât leave frustrated as it proved an easy introduction to Icelandic landscape wonders.

The walk around and into the crater is an easy one if your steady on your feet, although there are no handrails and the pathway is partly rock (Iceland seems to say use your common sense when it comes to health & safety rather than put in barriers - more of that please).

The walk around takes about 30 minutes at amble and the views from the highest point are impressive as is the crater.

If you also walk down to the waterâs edge then the reward is a great opportunity for some photoâs and itâs an easy enough steppes walk down.

The cost is 400 KrÃ³na per person so not high by Icelandic standards but it was the only landscape âattractionâ we needed to pay for. When we were there is was quiet, as is I suspect often the case.

We walked around the rim of the crater which was treacherous in the slippery icy conditions, Health & Safety in the UK would have had a field day here. The pathway is quite narrow & very close to the edge, nothing to stop you going over if you slipped. However, the 360 degree view from the rim is amazing.
Unlike other natural wonders in Iceland there is a charge of 400 ISK per person to visit the crater, which personally I thought was reasonable.
Plenty of parking spaces available on the day we visited, no other facilities, which I liked as I feel places like this should be left as natural as possible & not over commercialised.

We just stayed on the platform as it was drizzling an quite cold, but on a better day I would have taken our 3 and 2 year old for the walk, though probably would have carried the 2 year old most of the way.

If the weather had been kinder and our timetable had allowed Iâd have loved to walk the rim and the lake, both of which are possible and allow amazingly different views. Kerid is about 3,000 years old (half as old as most volcanos in Iceland) which is why - or so I have been led to believe - the iron deposits are still such a rich red rather than blackened. Really crimson, even on our cloudy day. Parking was free, 400Kr entrance fee, which was completely worth it.

The loop around to top takes a min of 6 minutes if walking fast, but would recommend more time to stop and admire the beauty. The stairs to the bottom take about 2 minutes. It's so blue! Very pretty and worth the admission fee. The trail to the lake cuts out most of the wind.

You can walk around the entire Crater in about 5 minutes (no joke) and they charge you $8 just to do that. It honestly felt like they were robbing us because it wasn't even a hike.

Iceland,spudnick006,Kerid Crater,4.0,"I know it is strange to say that there are just too many people - but there were - and we were in the off season. If you can try to find an early or later portion of the day to see this site (generally a rule for all of these natural wonders) do it.

The crater is amazeballs. With paths that trace the rim of the the crater and others that bring you down to the lake at the center you truly have the 360 experience of this site.

There were several people who were walking off path and gathering rocks and stones and such and I have a real hard time with this type of behavior as it damages the site for everyone else involved - so please don't be a natural wonder idiot and ruin this site for future travelers.

That said, the large amount of people just damaged the calm of the site as we tried to sit and take the the awe of the entire place - because it is truly awesome. And just to sit with it and experience it is something else and in the few moments of silence and lack of selfie taking tourists - it was magnificent.

Iceland,PH-Travel-Lovers,Kerid Crater,5.0,"Crater is not huge. But it is nice scenery and easy to get to if you are in the area.

Parking fee was about $4 dollars. They take credit cards.

You can walk around the top of the crater. About a 1/2 mile walk around. And you can walk down to the crater. A short walk as well.

Plenty of places to take great pictures. Info boards that tell you how the crater was formed.

Nothing else to do at the crater so we were only there about 30 per 40 minutes.

Warning: Avoid car rental company called Procar. What a mess that was. 40 minute wait in the airport for their shuttle. Then 35 minutes in line at their rental office. Then 40 minutes waiting for them to get our car ready. 2 hour wait after flying in on a red eye flight was ruff. And then having to agree for them to put a hold on our credit card for 2900 bucks because we declined their high pressure insurance. That was our big mistake of the trip.

We were traveling with 10 year old and 8 year old kids. There are well-defined steps down to the crater lake, which the kids easily climbed down. The steps can be slippery with rocks, so caution is required. There is a path around the base of the crater for people to walk on. It is an easy level walk; it could be slippery if wet, so would advise walking slowly if needed. We did not try walking around the top of the crater, so canât comment on the ease of doing so with kids.

The kids loved visiting the crater. Would recommend a visit if youâre in the area!

Is it worth the time on a tour to stop (and lose time at more beautiful sites)? No, it's not worth the time. The crater is owned by a family, and they have built a parking lot and paths above and down to the lake. You pay at this little booth and then can go onto the property (we were on a tour and entrance was included). If you have the stamina and strength (and bravery, the path is rocky and NARROW) to climb up, you'll get a nice view of the water below. Walking down to the water below is steep, slippery, and rocky. Payoff is nice if you have the time and the desire to see it. If we get back to Iceland, I'll be skipping this and will recommend others do the same. Property is very well maintained and clean.

There are no bathrooms available, so keep that in mind. The hike itself consists of a walk on the outside the crater from where you can get some fantastic views of the crater itself. You can also walk down into the crater and walk the perimeter of the lake in there. The walk around the lake is relatively easy but the walking the perimeter of the lake is more moderate in terms of intensity. Parts of the trail around the perimeter of the crater are relatively narrow so some people who may be afraid of heights might want to avoid this.

We took a short trek down for closer photo shot of it. Very satisfied with this nature beauty.",Jun 2019
Iceland,Julie D,Kerid Crater,5.0,We walked the rim ( short walk) after paying the small fee to see the colors of the water in this crater.

Iceland,CJW,Kerid Crater,4.0,"We sort of happened upon this and stopped. There was an inexpensive entrance fee and the walk was great and not too long. From the top of the crater, you get a good view of the surrounding countryside (including trees!) and down inside, you can see how clear the water is.

Iceland,Corihi,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Kerio Crater is a volcanic crater lake with vibrant blue colors. We stopped there on our Golden Circle tour for a quick photo op. The crater is just a short walk from the parking lot and would only require about a 15 minute stop for a photo op. You can also walk around the crater at the top or walk down the stairs into the crater. The lake is beautiful, but itâs small (as compared to Crater Lake in Oregon) and the area surrounding the crater is rather barren. There are no amenities such as shops and restaurants. There is an entrance fee, but I donât know the cost as we were on a tour. We visited Kerio Crater after seeing the Gullfoss waterfall, so the crater lake paled in comparison. After all, how can you top Gullfoss? It was still a nice stop.

Iceland,kerivvj,Kerid Crater,4.0,"This is a great stop - you can stretch your legs and enjoy the beauty very easily. Access is pretty straight forward - you park in the lot provided and pay at the entry point to the trail. The fee is equivalent to about $4 per person, kids under 12 are permitted for free. They accept credit cards or cash. There are two ways to view the crater, and I recommend doing both. There is a trail around the top perimeter, looking down into the crater. There is no siding or railings, so my daughter opted not to do the top one (we had our 2 girls with us, 6 yrs & 9 yrs). There is another path, with stairs, that goes down the water, which connects with a trail around the water. It was windy when we went, so it was nice to be out of the wind exploring the waters edge. It does not take very long to do either loop, as the crater itself is not huge.

Iceland,JF Bordeleau,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Kerid crater was our first stop on our slef-driven ""Golden Circle tour"". In hindsight and given the time that we had, this is a stop we could have skipped - but we are still glad we stopped there

What I liked: Admission prices are reasonable and the trail around the crater is well maintained. This is a pretty unique sight, like pretty much anything in Iceland. This is not too much out of the way when doing Golden Circle on your own.

What to watch for/could be improved: Parking can be an issue on busy days. Weather will also have a huge impact on whether this stopover is a ""wow"" or a ""ok, that was interesting"". On site amenities are minimal - as this is not one of the main sights that tourists go fo - but has become more popular as of late

All in, this a good place to go, once you have done the 3 other main attractions of the Golden Circle tour

Iceland,Jon_Ju1234,Kerid Crater,2.0,"We walked the circle around the crater, we found it very enjoyable even though the crater was frozen. Sadly a lot of people were throwing rocks onto the ice, leaving the ice covered in rocks.

For some strange reasons they have not yet put up signs that ban drones.

When we got to the bottom of the crater there were two guys flying noisy drones back and forth over the crater. Even though there were a lot of people around them trying to enjoy nature they kept flying their drones back and fourth over the crater. They even flew them very close to the people. This was very disturbing, I talked to the drone pilots. They felt that their drones were pretty cool and were oblivious to how they were disturbing everyone else.

Iceland,TJeinsteinwood,Kerid Crater,4.0,"We called in with a local friend- there is a 400 ISK charge (around Â£3) but this covers the cost of the landowner for the keep of the car park and toilets which is reasonable.

It is essentially a big hole to see - but as the remains of a volcano its really cool! It was very icy on the day we called in so we didn't walk down the steps to the water or around the top.

I love the Icelandic approach to safety- there is a good around the edge but they expect you to apply common sense and not step over - or you will fall down into the crater! If you have children you will need to supervise closely.

Iceland,JROHill32,Kerid Crater,4.0,"We had rented a house in nearby Reykholt and stopped at Kerid Crater on our way to Thingvellir National Park. It is kind of easy to miss, unless you are looking for it. We just saw a small parking lot and noticed some people climbing on some hills so we stopped to visit. We are glad we found it since it was very cool to be able to see and go down into the crater. There is a small entrance fee to visit and we thought it was reasonable. The crater is spectacular to look at from all angles; you can walk around the upper ring of the crater as well as well as go down and walk around the lake inside the crater. There are plenty of photo ops all around the crater. We had assumed that this was an impact crater, but after reading the various signs at the sight, we learned this was an explosion crater. Always nice to learn something newâ¦.even while relaxing on vacation. I would definitely recommend stopping at the crater for at least an hour and enjoyed walking up, down and around this natural wonder.

Firstly, they charge you to view this natural site - which is not in and of itself a problem - but nowhere else on the golden circle weâre we charged to see any other natural site.

Secondly it was frozen over and covered in snow when we were there so it was literally walking around a small crater with snow in it.",Jan 2019
Iceland,Rachel P,Kerid Crater,4.0,I enjoyed hiking around the top of the crater. You can also take the stairs down to the bottom for an up-close look at the crater. Make sure to go before as no bathrooms are close by. This stop is great for an hour or less.,Jan 2019
Iceland,Mrs F,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Visited on a very snowy day in January, was surprised to see a ticket booth for this attraction, surely having someone sat there all day could easily be avoided by charging for parking instead? But at approximately Â£2.50 each each what can you do for that these days. Iâve have read afterwards that the land is privately owned.
Not everyday do you get to experience walking around the Crater of a Volcano, or to stand where Lava once flowed, we didnât get to see the red ground that the Crater is famous for but it did look stunning covered in snow.
It takes roughly half an hour to walk around the Crater and another 10 minutes to walk down to the lake. How long it takes to get back up depends on fitness.
Be careful when itâs snowy, a pair of good snow boots really helps.

This is just one of many places to start charging over the last years. And i just cant understand how it is legal for private owners to buy public land?

In our last 5 minutes you could just see the water from up top but walked down and about half way could see fairly clearly the water.

Make smart decisions if creating your own self-driving tours and you will have an epic time.

The crater is easy to walk around and down into it and doesn't take much time to visit.

Located in southern Iceland, Kerid is unique among crater lakes because its caldera likely didnât form from an explosion but rather when the magma in the center simply depleted itself, and the empty chamber beneath caved in.

The crater itself is massive and around 55m deep. It is believed to be the result of a volcanic eruption within the Western Volcanic Zone.

The short twenty minutes we stopped there was more than enough, as once you have taken photographs and read up on the history, the only other thing you can really do is walk around it or down to the lake.

Iceland,Discover237460,Kerid Crater,5.0,"I really enjoy this spot. It is conveniently located on the Golden Circle, just off the main road, no detour. There is a small fee but the little amount is reasonable for the convenience of seeing a beautiful crater lake without having to go out of your way. This is a nice spot to see if you are just on a day stop over in Iceland; it's not quite an hour and half from airport. If you have enough time you can walk all the way around and go down to the lake.

We went in the month of April on a rainy windy day but we still appreciated it. Tip to better enjoy Iceland is to have a waterproof windbreaker with layers as needed to keep you comfortable in the ever changing weather. Stay dry stay happy :) We returned again in the month of June and walked around.

Iceland,James W,Kerid Crater,4.0,"After Thingvellir, the Golden Circle attractions are pretty short, so it's a good idea to try and squeeze in one or two additional things, of which the Kerid Crater is a great bet.

Despite having to pay an admission fee (which the more interesting GC attractions don't require), there's a lot of really cool stuff to see at the crater. The contrast between the vibrant red rock of the rim and walls, and the cool turquoise of the water is spectacular. You can walk around the edge of the crater, then descend into the middle.

What made it worth it for us was that it was winter, and the lake was frozen over. This meant that from the bottom, we could skim/throw stones onto the ice. The resulting noises from the ice vibration/the echo around the crater were like an odd alien language, which provided entertainment for 20-30 minutes.

Well worth the visit!!",Nov 2018

Iceland,irvingtonevk,Kerid Crater,5.0,"Definitely was worth the stop and the fee - it was one of the most beautiful things we saw in Iceland. While in the area, I recommend checking out where Bobby Fischer is buried and peek into the small church at the cemetery.",Jun 2018
Iceland,RogerM7525,Kerid Crater,3.0,Probably my least favorite site. Great for a couple of quick picts. The only place that we had to pay to see (as far as natural sites go). Probably worth it as you are in Iceland to see these types of sites.,Nov 2018
Iceland,ldgp14,Kerid Crater,4.0,"The Kerid Crater was the last stop we made on our Golden Circle drive you have to pay to get in unlike the other attractions but like the other attractions it is a beautiful geological spectacle, what I will say is the paths were so slippy it made it very difficult to explore.",Nov 2018

Iceland,PatriceD97341,Kerid Crater,5.0,I was amazed when I got to the edge of this crater. The earth is so very red with vibrant green moss clinging to it and then a pool of pure turquoise water.

Iceland,Craig B,Kerid Crater,3.0,"We had a lovely half hour walk around the crater and down to the pool. It was very peaceful with some good information explaining the formation of the crater. Thereâs a small admission fee of 400 Krona but children under the age of 12 are free.

A good leg stretch if youâre travelling between Selfoss and Geysir.",Oct 2018
Iceland,rosegoldmountains,Kerid Crater,5.0,"This place was so cool! It feels like youâre exploring another planet. The colors are incredible and the walk around the top perimeter is easy to do in about less than 30 minutes. It wasnât very crowded at all, we got here around 10am, hardly anyone here. I also flew my drone here as well, but it was extremely windy, so only for a few shots. Iâd expect to spend at least an hour here to do the walk at the top and base by the water. Yeah, there is a small entrance fee, but when you decide to travel, you should be ready to spend money, and it helps to maintain the park, so don't let that stop you from going!",Oct 2018
Iceland,Sonielsony,Kerid Crater,3.0,Kerid Crater is the only place in Iceland that we were disappointed with. One can walk around the rim of the crater and down the hill. From below the water is clear and one can enjoy quite time. That also holds good when you walking around the crater. But that's about it. There is nothing ecstatic about this place. There is an entrance fee of 400 ISK. If you have limited time one can give this a miss and instead spend time in Thingvellir National Park. The place is Very Touristy!,Sep 2018

Iceland,Gardenerrich,Kerid Crater,5.0,"We drove past this, unsure of what it was, so turned round and came back.

You have to pay to walk round, 400isk, but you get to walk down some (lots actually) steps and then around the base by the water.

Wouldnât really want to walk too near edge of top, as no fencing and lots of loose skree, you probably wouldnât get within 10ft if it was in Uk because of safety fencing ð.

Was nice to see, but couldnât understand why you had to pay for this but not for other things.

Kerid is a medium sized 3000+ year old volcanic crater some 55 metres deep and 170 metres wide. The caldera walls are still in quite good condition, and the Lakes level fluctuates in line with the water table.
Situated on privately owned land (and adjacent to good parking), access is by a small admission fee which goes towards maintenance of the site which is subjected to continuous visitor volumes. Definitely worth a visit, - itâs a comfortable walk around the rim and down the inside slope track to the lake.

Iceland,EDian831,Kerid Crater,5.0,Kerid sits on private property but the owners only charge a minimum entrance fee. You have to be diligent in looking for a roadside sign to know where to turn. Like most signage in Iceland itâs only on one side of the road. We drove by twice! But this is not an experience to be missed. Best time is the hour before and after high noon.

There is a small pool at the bottom and you can access this if you decide to walk down to it. We ate lunch in the parking lot before heading on our way toward Selfoss.",Sep 2018
Iceland,Karen W,Kerid Crater,4.0,Kerid Crater is just off the road and possibly one of the easiest craters in Iceland to experience.

Iceland,T-SGlobetrotters,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Entry to the site is 400 ISK, not unreasonable as it is clear there have been quite a lot of infrastructure improvements to the site of late including new steps down to the crater floor and additional shale paths around the perimeter of the crater. The walk around the perimeter and down to the valley floor and back takes a leisurely 45 minutes. Terrain is not difficult.
The red soil/rock and vegetation on the crater sides and top make the scene quite colourful and there are splendid views of the surrounding area from the top. It is a worthwhile stop particularly as the attraction is different from anything else you will see in Iceland. There are no toilet or eating facilities here.

There are three craters to see however the main one is the one with the lake.
You can't swim in the lake.
If you've already seen craters with lakes, this one doesn't offer much more apart from the red soil. However you'll need some good weather to get a good glimpse of the colours.

Iceland,Vladimir P,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"Visiting this geothermal field is very convenient.It is literary next to the main road.There is couple of geysers but two of them are the biggest .There is no clear pattern how often the water is pumped out in the air but between 6-10 min usually .There is no really much of time once the water start to boil so keep your camera ready all the time.Put the video on the slow motion mode and you will have a great video...especially second before the water is splashed out (color of the water is wonderful).If you are going to visit this place during the winter,have you crampons(ice cleats) ready...just in case that there is a ice around!

Iceland,Nicole B,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,Because of the sunny weather (next day they expected snow) we did visit the geyser at sunset and it was amazing. It errupts every 5 minutes (approximately) so you can stay and watch it multiple times. It was around 17.30 when we arrived so there were hardly any people left.,Feb 2020
Iceland,John A,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"The Strokur geyser blows it's top every 6-7 minutes but we were lucky to see two eruptions of the same size one after the other. I'm not sure why this happened but it takes everyone by surprise.
Waiting for Strokur to blow you can see the water level bulge upwards into a large blue bubble a split second before it releases it's steam.
Surrounding the geyser are a couple of smaller pits where the water is on constant boil showing just how much heat there is in the ground, yet, ironically, there is snow and ice everywhere.

There are six of them in this area and the biggest one is really impressive. The column of hot water and steam are important.
I recommend you to go in the afternoon, so you can get a really nice atmosphere with the sunset at the backside and furthermore, there are less buses and less people, so normally the tours stop during the morning and midday.
An unforgettable phenomenon of the nature that you will not forget.

The main geyser erupts approx every 8 mins. You can get quite close & may get wet from the vapours.
Thereâs a steep walk you can do taking you past creators of less active geysers & bubbling springs up to a high viewing point. Well worth it, not just for the birdseye view of the geyser, but also the panoramic view of this amazing landscape.

Nice little cafe/shop, you can get fast food for reasonable prices by Iceland standards.",Nov 2019
Iceland,graham b,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,We visited as part of the \Golden Cricle - recommend hiring a car instead of paying for a guided tour as easy to drive around - and you'll be rewarded with regular eruptions of the Strokker geysir (about every 5 mins).

The next stop was the Geysir geothermal area, home of the famous Geysir and Strokkur hot springs. The Strokkur hot spring erupts every 5 minutes or so, making it one of the most active geysers in the world. There was a Geyser Center opposite the geyser which had gift shops, restaurants, restrooms. I ideal place to stop for lunch before continuing our tour.

If you can, come early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the tourist bus hordes. We were staying nearby and came on several occasions and each was unique.
Just be aware, there is only one which erupts. The others just bubble but do not erupt. The one called Geysir does not erupt *at all* (much to the chagrin of iPhone holding tourists).

Iceland,Critch,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"1st Time Geysir Viewers....GREAT. In 15 minutes you could see 2-3 eruptions. This was my 1st and I liked it
Experienced Geysir Viewers....average.
IF you have gone to Yellowstone...skip this
ADVICE:
1. Pack a lunch...this is more overpriced than a Beverly Hills starbucks
2. Lower expectations...you are going here to see the earth actively at work, not a Las Vegas fountain show

I am glad I saw it and ""did"" a geysir once. Now, i can skip the, elsewhere.

Iceland,N.N. Shah,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"Geyser is very popular along the Golden Circle, with frequent geyser eruptions every 5-8 minutes. The frequency was great because it gave enough time to catch different views, angles & elevations for photography between each eruption. Other thermal pools were also great to see, though the sulfur smell can be off putting & linger on clothing. There is a pretty large tourist center across the street from the Geyser, full of multiple restaurants, souvenir shops & lodging.",Aug 2019
Iceland,DrSJ,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,It is one place where you can feel the earth alive. There is so much of geothermal activity everywhere and one gets to see this at the Selfoss Geyser which erupts every 7-8 min (25-35 M high). The third tallest in the world. There are innumerable hot springs every where spewing steam and boiling water.,Aug 2019
Iceland,Tayola,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"The geyser went off every 8-10 minutes, so it was nice- if you missed it, then just walk around and you'll catch the next one. Plus it wasn't crowded, people would rotate after they watched 1-2 times. The smell was offputting, but it was still pretty cool.

Iceland,Steven C,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,When driving around Iceland the Selfoss Geyser is a must stop. It erupts every 5 -10 minutes and you can get within 10 feet of the Geyser. This was an Instagram hit with my kids and it is free to visit,Aug 2019
Iceland,PrMichaelM,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"The area around the Selfoss Geysir itself is undeveloped but a sign on location shows the plans in place to make more of an attraction out of the natural wonder. The main point is to take the short walk up to the large geyser that erupts about every 10 minutes to see. Itâs a fun spectacle made better watching those in range of the spray screaming and running for cover (there isnât any...) as the warm water rains down on them. Definitely worth the trip! Longer hiking is available as well as smaller geysers throughout the area. The center nearby hosts a restaurant and a very large gift shop that runs the gamut of high end woolens to your typical souvenir junk. Something for everyone, I guess. I drove the golden circle myself in a rental car and it was one of the highlights to stop, stretch and take photos and video of the Selfoss geyser.

However the Strokkur geyser erupts every 5-10 minutes and can send up some nice tall plumes. The height seems to vary a lot, but with the short duration you can wait through a few eruptions and catch a nice photo. If you're lucky enough to have seem Old Faithful geyser in its glory days - this does NOT compare. But if you've never seen a geyser, this is worth a stop! It's along the Golden Circle path, a bit of a detour from the Ring Road. There is a nice complex with shops, restaurants, and bathrooms across the street from the geysers. Parking can be tight at popular times and when we went there was a LOT of people with plenty of tour buses around.

Iceland,Aury De Jesus,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"My friends and I were making the Golden Circle last May 9, 2019. As part of the tour we stopped at the Geysers.
This geothermal field have a surface area of approximately 3 kmÂ². Most of the springs are aligned along a 100m wide strip of land running in the same direction as the tectonic lines in the area, from south to southwest. The strip is 500m long.
The area became active more than 1000 years ago. Although the geyser is less active these days, it did lend its name to hot springs all over the world.
It was the first geyser described in a printed source and the first known to modern Europeans and along with the geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the United States, Geyser is the most famous geyser in the world. This was told to us by our Guide.
In short, this was a pleasant experience. Feeling the power and the magnitude that reaches the Geyser is impressive.

There are lots more to see. The 3 restaurants/cafes at visitor center offer a variety of food to cater to various taste buds and budget: low, middle and high end.

Great lunch spot! the active little tourist center has wonderful authentic icelandic gifts. The food center was just a bit too busy for us even during this ""off"" season, so we ate at the expensive Geysir restaurant.

Iceland,Margaret H,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"We visited this as part of the Golden Circle tour.It was a wet and cold day - to be expected in Iceland in March!!!!The hype and expectation was far greater than the actuality!! The smell of sulphur was great, but the geysers were not out to play. We had hoped for the 30ft high show, but definitely got a damp squib!!! Lots of steam and bubbling, but no great show.We looked at 3 or 4 holes in the ground, hoping for more, but not a lot happened. Maybe we were there at the wrong time. There's a visitor centre where food and drinks are available along with various souvenirs. I am not sure that I would go out of my way to see the geyser.

Iceland,alisonh123,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"This was our lunch stop of the day as part of the golden circle tour- free entrance with well defined pathway as you walk past the smaller bubbling pots and do not touch, hot stream. Great geyser to view, exploding approximately every five minutes, one of only a few in the world. Great viewing points. Seats for those wanting to keep watching. Area is cordoned off for safety- streams of boiling water!

Across the road is the car park, large restaurant, free toilets- for now, and souvenir shop.

We all had the Icelandic lamb soup as recommended by our guide. Served with two small crusty buns it was a hearty meal of vegetables and soft cooked meat. Very tasty and we would recommend. A perfect meal on our cold winters day. Several serving & seating areas so plenty of room for the coach loads that are visiting. Speedy service.

It erupts about every 5 minutes with different volumes of water be disbursed on each occasion, some are small other a quite large and itâs very enjoying to witness to see how big each eruption will be. I stayed for about 6 in total with 2 of them being big ones.

Iceland,Leisa W,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"Having arrived in Reykjavik the night before, the first activity we decided on was the Golden Circle. It did not disappoint especially the Geysir. It was easily accessible from the road and was an active geothermal area. The geysers went off every few minutes and there was plenty of boiling mud to watch while you were waiting. I recommend leaving early in the morning so as to leave plenty of time to take in the sights and soak in the Secret Lagoon at the end of the day. A packed lunch to save cost does not go astray. So stop at a Bonus supermarket on the way out of town and stock up on snacks and sandwiches. Burgers and fries can really blow the budget in Iceland. We loved the Icelandic water so be sure to replenish your water bottle regularly. Overall a wonderful attraction to visit.

Pretty much anyone doing the tour will call here so it gets very busy, but the area is large enough to get round without issue. There are two car parks, the one on the opposite side of the road to the visitor centre is a little quieter and closer to the geysers.
The main attraction is Strokkur an active geyser which erupts approximately every 5-10 minutes. At the time of our visit it was following a pattern of two fairly small eruptions and third sending a jet of water 40-50 feet into the air (so every 20 minutes or so). Some patience is required to get the best photo as the jet lasts only for a couple of seconds. There are also a number of smaller fumaroles and hot pools sending out sulphurous smoke and bubbling away frantically.
The visitor centre is quite large with gift shop cafÃ© and toilets. Entry is free.

It tends to get crowded during the day with all of the busses and tour groups. The main Geyser (Geysir) goes off in a powerful explosion every 5-8 minutes.,Sep 2018
Iceland,Mark B,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"This is definately worth the stop. Neat to see the whole area and then to wait for the geyser to go off. I was lucky to get a picture of the bubble just before it exploded and the geyser of water too. The good thing is if you miss it wait there for another 5 mins or so and it will go off again. This is free, they also have a restaurant and bathrooms here too",Aug 2018
Iceland,Ken A,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"A lot of geysers around that area , 2 big ones most active ones, the eructions are between 8 to 10 minutes.Take long time to get the right picture you need to be patient.This is something to see.Right across the gysers is free parking. The store is pretty big, has good restaurant.Prices are always expensive in Iceland lol",Sep 2018
Iceland,ChuckP440,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"The good thing about this geyser is it goes off about every 8 minutes, the bad thing is if you blink, you miss it - each 'pop' only lasts a few seconds. The geothermal area is also interesting. Worth a trip.",Sep 2018
Iceland,Chinapjs,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,Most people go straight to Selfoss (the name of the most dominant geyser) but this is a small geothermal area that includes lots of interesting spots. You need to be careful and only walk in directed areas as the earth crust is fragile and lots of really hot spots and bubbling water. Take a tour with experienced guide,Sep 2018

Iceland,334Traveller,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,Definitely worth a visit - the site is interesting and you can walk around both erupting and dormant but steaming geysers - it's tempting to want to touch the water but it's often hotter than boiling so make sure if you do dip your finger it's in a puddle that has cooled off some!,Aug 2018

Interesting geothermal activity around the park. A strong sulfur smell, but thatâs normal. This was a delightful stop on the Golden Circle route.",Sep 2017
Iceland,prmulcahy,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"This place is definitely worth a stop. The geyser goes off about every five minutes, so if you miss getting a picture, you don't have to wait long for another chance. Yes, there are loads of tourists, but this place covers a lot of area, so everybody is pretty spaced out. It's easily accessible for those who have difficulty walking or need to use a wheelchair. There's plenty of parking and a very nice visitor center.

You can do quite a bit of walking around here, including way up to the top of a steep hill where you can get a great view of the surrounding countryside. We enjoyed it and the kids we saw there really seemed to be getting a kick out of it. Take the family!

Iceland,Smo689,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"The area where the geysers are located is quite small but worth walking around and seeing. We saw Stokkur erupt a few times with varying intensity and heights.

Iceland,Welsh_Wizz,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"You have to go here and experience the might of these things.

Totally amazing and so wild.

Park across the road and walk around - the only thing separating you form these mighty geysers is a small rope. Don't be an idiot and not stick to the path - sadly there were several people who didn't on our visit - slightly disrespectful when visiting another country.

Iceland,johnmM754OI,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"As many others have noted, Geysir in Iceland is where the word ""geyser"" originated. It's not as big as our Old Faithful, but impressive nonetheless. It erupts often enough that crowds don't get too big. Other areas around also have geysers, but the one is most impressive, especially if one has never witnessed a geyser. Pay attention to the warnings, as the water is very hot. There is a large gift shop there, as well as a buffet style fast food location (also a hotel that we did not go into). Pass on the buffet, as the food was cold and almost inedible.",Aug 2018

As you enter the âparkâ you will see some mist and hot springs. This is NOT the main geyser. Keep walking along the path(keep in mind it will be wet) and you will see many people gathering at a circle shaped hole. If you continue to the left you can get a good picture, but prepare to get wet. If you continue left again, there is another geyser/sinkhole that is also pretty cool.

The Strokkur geysir erupts every few minutes, throwing up a spectacular fountain, there are warm pools of blue water, the ground is literally steaming with bubbling mud pools and there are walks all around them to view at close quarters and best of all it is all free to view and linger as long as you like.

Going there is a bit difficult as there is a lot of people so its crowded and kind of a mess but it is worth it.

It went up four times while we were there. Mind, we are intriguing by natural history and were photographing the natural flora scattered about. Particularly pleased to find wild thyme. Besides a different flora, the site does have all you want or expect in a geothermal area. The mud pots are boiling. The steam is sputtering or wafting without stopping. The soil colours that you donât find anywhere else are there. As an added plus, despite it all being real there is not the acridity of scent you find at some sites. Thereâs plenty going on and you can wander leisurely through the active area and still turn around as soon as you hear the big one going up again.

Iceland,Tucc1955,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,Wonderful to watch this marvel of nature. There is steam escaping from the ground all around Selfoss. Watch carefully and you will witness a beautiful act of nature every 5-10 minutes - a huge amount of water is pushed up through the ground to form a geyser that lasts a number of seconds.,May 2018
Iceland,Vacationer2Maine,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"If you have been to Yellowstone, this place is no big deal, but itâs also not hard to see, so it is worth the stop. Simply park in the lot, cross the street and stop at the first geysir (called Stroker) that you see. Wait a few minutes, but be ready - it will erupt without much if any warning. We were lucky that we had the camera ready when it went off about 15 seconds after we stopped walking. We took pictures, and all in all, the stop was about 20 minutes long - most of that was walking to and from the geysir. It looks like this stop is a good travel stop - with restrooms, food, souvenirs, etc. We didnât stop because we wanted to keep going around the Golden Circle.

Iceland,NSMKMelbourne,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"This is a very busy place but it's worth the effort to get here.
The geyser ""Geyser"" is dormant but there is a slightly smaller geyser that erupts every ten minutes or so and it's fun to see.
There's an extensive lot of tourist shops and eateries that are not overpriced.
Best to stay in the area and visit in the morning before the bus crowds arrive. We visited twice; once in the afternoon which was very busy and then the next day at about 10:00 and there were very few people around.",May 2018

Iceland,XinnieY,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"We stopped by here as part of the golden circle tour. Geyser is always fascinating imo, nature is a powerful thing. However, I've been to Yellowstone National Park so this to me, in comparison, is not as grand. Lots of people crowds around the main geyser for the eruption, which is usually around 5-7 minutes as we were told by our tour guide.",Apr 2018
Iceland,Ugo C,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"This is geothermal activity at is best. This place is so magical and unique. Even though the big geyser hasn't been active in some years, its little brother Strokkur delivers a great show every 4-7 minutes. Be sure not to walk on forbidden areas as the water is boiling and the ground is surprisingly hot. This is a must-see on the Golden Circle and a humbling experience as you see the mighty power of nature.",Mar 2018
Iceland,Davide Roth,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"It is rather interesting place. This is where the Earth literally farts! Don't worry, you will get used to the rotten eggs smell in 5 minutes.

The main attraction goes off every couple of minutes and the heights of the columns of water thrown up are variable. A must see on the GC.

If you miss the main attraction, don't worry, you will only need to wait 5 minutes for the next. The height depends on the wind. Just make sure you are not downwind when it blows or you could get a little damp! DON'T touch the water , it does reach boiling point.
There is a lovely gift shop, toilets and restaurant with parking across from the geyser.
Well worth a visit.",Apr 2018
Iceland,Helene L,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"Lot of mini geysers around Geysir. Just walk around and enjoy the view. The sulfur smell can be over powering, depending on the wind but easy to avoid.

Walking next to boiling water, seeing an explosion coming from the center of the earth and climbing the sky in a large boom is absolutely unique.
Did you know that the word geyser comes from this place : Geysir? How cool is that ?

Kids were awed by such an experience.

Parking and entrance is free.",Mar 2018
Iceland,Yvonne D,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"The Selfoss Geysir is, in my opinion, one of the best attractions in Iceland. It is truly a spectacle to behold, and because it erupts every 5-8 minutes, you cannot be sure exactly when to have your camera ready. Every time the water gushes out you get a little fright, just because it's so unexpected.

We were lucky enough to see the geysir blow not once, not twice but three times in the same eruption. It was absolutely breathtaking.

Take a video instead, your arms will thank you!

Iceland,Apolonia70,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,An interesting location - part of the Golden Circle tour - cafÃ© and facilities nearby. A brief walk from parking area.

Iceland,Daniel H,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"This is north of the city of Selfoss and is not really a town, but a gathering center, restaurant, and souvenir store of immense size. All of the geysirs are concentrated near one another here, and this is where you must park. It is really well organized and not offputting at all, and even the souvenirs are of high quality (most of them).

The food in the restaurant is great too.",Mar 2018
Iceland,Box Family Adventures,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"We went here as part of a day tour. It was wonderful, it erupted every 5-7 minutes, sometimes largely and sometimes smaller with a tiny second eruption. The guide rope all around the area gave a large access area for everyone to stand and get a good view. After a few attempts some good photos and videos can be achieved. Don't forget to just watch and enjoy without a lens though. We had a thermos with soup so stood and watched for a while, everyone else went to the shop and cafe. Friends said two soups and some drinks cost Â£30. We were glad of our thermos ð plus the extra view time. Such a beautiful experience. We had really clear skies and winter sun, breathtaking views and light. Word of warning the ice and geyser spray makes slippy nodule formations, I and a few others hit the ground (bruised hip) even with good footwear. I had a padded coat so I didn't do too bad.

Iceland,EConnell107,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"We visited this attraction as part of the golden circle tour with TUI.

Of course a natural phenomenon that is spectacular. The geyser erupts around about every 5 minutes or so with slightly different intensities so well worth sticking around for 15-20 minutes.

Need to be ready with the camera as there is little if any warning that itâs about to go and of course make sure you make note of wind direction and wet ground to ensure you arenât going to find yourself under a heavy waterfall.

Geyser is within easy walking distance of the car park and cafe but wrap up and wear comfortable sturdy shoes.

Iceland,Cheekycockney190757,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"Having seen the Geysir site on TV I expected to be a little underwhelmed when I saw it with my own eyes but it was better than I expected. The site is under development and sadly has the air of somewhere which is about to become commercialized and that means entry charges, but for now, it is a free car park and entry, so make the most of it. I am a keen photographer and the opportunities to get interesting shots from different angles of the repetitive geyser are many but remember to see a few with your own eyes just to enjoy the spectacle. Give yourself an hour to explore what is quite a small site, and if visiting in winter wear crampons as the site can become very icy. I did not visit the restaurant or gift shop as TBH for British visitors the cost of all purchases is very high, but if cost is not an issue I am sure you will find a refreshment or gift of your choice.

Iceland,Rachelle W,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"My husband and I joined a tour through the Golden Circle, and the Geyser is one of the stops. We liked it but it is not the most impressive natural wonder that we have seen in Iceland.

The Geyser erupts once every 6-8 minutes. Very punctual :) People tend to wait on the side and take videos and pictures when the Geyser shoots up :) The trick to catch a good shot is to read the sign that the Geyser sends - when the small pool of water starts to bubbling and building BIG, the Geyser is ready, and get your camera ready too!

In between eruptions, go up and check out other pools of small Geyser in the area. 6-8 minutes would give one enough time to check them all and come down for one more eruption.

There is a big service center by the Geyser, and one can find all kinds of food there. Expensive in my opinion (About US$20 a person) for a quick lunch. But it is normal in Iceland.

Recommended time to spend in the are - 1-1:30 hours :)

Wear appropriate footwear as there is a lot of ice and snow. Donât be stupid and jump the ropes between the footpath and the geysirs like some guy did in front of us and got burned.

The main geysir performed beautifully shooting super heated water high into the air at regular intervals. It was extremely icy on the pathways so crampons definitely recommended. Supa cafe recommended for soup to warm up afterwards.,Jan 2018
Iceland,George D,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"Ok, so due to unique geological conditions some hot water gets sprayed from the earth every 3 minutes or so. Standing in a crowd of Chinese tourists excitedly crying out every time that happens. GET ME OUTTA HERE!",Dec 2017
Iceland,HarpendenVicar,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"Even though this is was the middle of winter, it was really busy. A second visit for me but really quite amazing to see. It has to be seen to be believed.",Jan 2018
Iceland,TheWalkwoodOne,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"Much like most of the other places we visited in Iceland this place did not disappoint either. Seeing the geysers explode into life was another box ticked on the bucket list. A definite must see if youâre visiting Iceland. Stunning scenery surrounds the geysers so another fantastic photo opportunity awaits.

Well worth the visit.",Jan 2018
Iceland,Yatzie G,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,The geyser explodes approximately every five to seven minutes. It's an amazing experience for one who's never had an opportunity to see nature at its core!,Jan 2018
Iceland,Jonathan M,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,The geysers are really cool and you could stay all day watching it go off with waits going off. It should be noted that in warmer conditions this could be very different place. We enjoyed it but it doesnât take long and gets old quick,Jan 2018
Iceland,Luanix,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"A very touristy place, heaving with people even in the dead of winter, but free and easily accessible from Reykjavik. The Strokkur geyser erupts every few minutes so you've got a very good chance to see a column of water splashing out it's boiling contents onto the yellowish ground accompanied by the heavy smell of sulphur. We went in the winter and did not do any hikes as it was to icy around so the visit lasted about 10 minutes. Free parking and a visitor centre is right across from it and they're building a hotel next to it. The whole area is developing quite rapidly.",Dec 2017
Iceland,Stephanie C,Selfoss Geyser,4.0,"We visited here on our trip around the Golden Circle (we drove, much better option). Make sure you stay for more than on eruption. We were really surprised at how often they happened, the wait was less than 15 mins, and how each one was a different height. This makes sense as it is a natural wonder, not a timed programmed event. We were there for about half an hour and probably saw it 4 times.",Dec 2017
Iceland,StAlban123,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"The geyser erupted every few minutes and we took some breathtaking pictures. The small pools around however appeared more interesting (at least to me).
Facilities are just across the road. We went in the 1st Jan when there were âfewâ tourists around so really enjoyed it. However, I dread to think what it would be like in summer. Wouldnât have missed it though.",Jan 2018
Iceland,patandorjean,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,Easy to navigate the Geysers and nice restaurant with gift shop. Convenient travel from Thingvillir to the Waterfall.,Nov 2017
Iceland,June C,Selfoss Geyser,3.0,"It was an interesting nature geyser and fun to see. BUT so many tourists by the bus load and icy paths made it unpleasant. Long queues for toilets were awful with a child. Too many people and too touristy. We counted at least 30 large buses when we arrived. Much better geysers in NZ.

We did like the frozen seats with icicles - more people took photos of these than the geyser.",Dec 2017
Iceland,jkwasnick,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,Came to the geysers on a windy day. The smell of sulfur is strong when you near the geysers. It can be a little icy as well so dress prepared. There was one main geyser that went off every 5-7 minutes and for some reason I tonight it would be higher and longer when it went off. It was still pretty neat. There are several small bubbling areas but itâs a quick visit to those. If you have a cell phone it can also freeze up and shut off while you are keeping it outside waiting for the geysers to go. Cameras are better.,Dec 2017
Iceland,DominicDeBurca,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,Didn't blow as high as I had been expecting but then again perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. It was cool to see the large bubble form just under the surface of the water seconds before it blows â like watching a miniature nuclear explosion going off!,Dec 2017
Iceland,Steve H,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"A worthwhile stop on the Golden CIrcle. The geyser erupts with boiling water every few minutes, sometimes several times at once.

The geyser and surrounding bubbling pools are free to see; along with free parking.

There is also a restaurant and massive gift store with high prices but high quality local goods.

Very highly recommended.

There are more than one geyser at this location and when we were there it was all that crowded so I was able to get some nice photos and video of the geyser erupting without a crowd of people in the background. It was pretty timely, erupting every 15 mins or so. The sulfur pools were very pretty and like everything in Iceland, the scenery was gorgeous.",Sep 2017
Iceland,John A,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"I have been here twice. it is great to see the geyser. It goes off fairly often so it is easy to see it a few times. Also in the area are some bubbling pools of hot water that are fun to watch.

Watch which way the wind is blowing. Some friends failed to do so and got a bit wet!",Sep 2017
Iceland,Finn W,Selfoss Geyser,5.0,"While the sulfur smells horrific, the sites are spectacular. You can watch the Geyser flows which are up to 100 degrees celsius, and enjoy the eruption from the geyser itself every 5-10 minutes, making a spectacular video. The food is good, and the toilets and facilities are clean. Well worth the journey.",Dec 2017

Bit disappointed by the size of the area - we assumed according to the marketing materials, that it will be much bigger",Oct 2017

Iceland,Martin H,Godafoss,5.0,"The views afforded here were stunning, especially as a lot of the area was frozen which added another dimension to our photos and the experience. Be warned though, if you come in the winter months and don't have crampons, some sections can be incredibly slippery and potentially hazardous; come prepared.",Oct 2021
Iceland,Kim G,Godafoss,5.0,"This is a very beautiful waterfall along the Ring Road. Very accessible with a large parking lot and an easy walk to numerous viewing points.

Unfortunately when we visited it was later in the day and starting to rain but we enjoyed walking to it for viewing. Not as tall as some of the other falls in Iceland but definitely wider than most.

For sure make it a stop since it is very easy to see - even from the road!

Iceland,Robert D,Godafoss,5.0,"The Godafoss waterfall is beautiful. When Iceland converted to Christianity, the lawspeaker who made the decision for the country to convert, returned to his home in North Iceland and threw statues of the old Norse gods into this waterfall, which was
then named the waterfall of the gods. (It reminds me a bit of Horseshoe
Falls in Niagara Falls.)",Aug 2021
Iceland,Emilie T,Godafoss,5.0,"Another must see on the World Wide Waterfall Tour, Godafoss doesnot disappoint. If you managed to get there when thereare no tour buses, it is an added bonus. Like many of Icelands water falls, this one seeming ly appreared out of nowhere as the river drops down the lava plateau. It plum of mist rising out of the disatant plain is what gives it's location away. You can walk up both sides (which I'd recommend) but pay attention to signs advising caution. Dependng on water flow, some areas are sometimes under water. Don't be the yahoo, trying to get right next to the edge.",Sep 2021
Iceland,atravelingvegan,Godafoss,5.0,"This beautiful spectacle is right off of the main road, you can actually see it as you drive along route 1.

Iceland,507adventurelover,Godafoss,5.0,I saw this waterfall on an overcast day and found it impressive. Tour books speak of a rainbow visible on sunny days. Either way this waterfall is not to be missed. It is so powerful that the mist gives away its location as you are approaching.,Aug 2021

Iceland,Brian D,Godafoss,5.0,"This is a very scenic waterfall that shouldn't be missed. There are a couple of huge parking lots, but it is a quiet area for relaxing and enjoying the falls. There is also a gift shop/cafe across the highway. The falls empty into a rushing river that sparkles with bright blue glacial water. It is amazing how many falls there are in Iceland and how all of them are stunning. This one is very broad with a very strong current. Makes for some great pictures. There is a bridge that you can cross from one side of the falls to the other side. Both sides offer differing, but brilliant views of the falls. Be sure to take the time to visit both sides.",May 2021

Absolutely beautiful and easy to get to right off the Ring Road. I also love the lore that the pagan symbols and paperwork were thrown over the edge of the waterfalls around the year 1000 AD when the country decided to accept Christianity.

Iceland,Tobias-Henrik,Godafoss,5.0,Itâs not the most impressive waterfall I have seen in Iceland at all. But I love it because itâs so accessible and you can visit both sides and get really close to it from bottom too. Since itâs on the ring road no detour is needed. We used around 45 min in total but even with 15 min you can manage to see one side and get a picture if you are in a hurry. For people who had a hard time walking this is probably one of the easiest waterfalls to see.,May 2021

Iceland,Travel Enthusiast,Godafoss,5.0,"Upon approach to the waterfall, I did not know what to expect at all but when you walk over to get waterfall it is just breath taking!

We spent around 45 minutes walking around the waterfall and it was just spectacular and words cannot describe just how beautiful it is.

Unbeknown to me my partner proposed to me on the eastern side of the waterfall and I couldnât have asked for a more beautiful and picturesque location to start this new chapter together.

If you are in are in the area you must visit and witness this wonder yourself.

Iceland,simmondsi,Godafoss,5.0,"Stopped as part of our Iceland tour. While not as huge and powerful as the Gullfoss, this waterfall is beautiful with its horseshoe shape.

As you go up the left side, keep a look out on the right of the path for some steps which take you down to the water level. It's rocky down there but you can take photos from a different angle. Just beware the sun will be behind the falls so perhaps not so good on a Summer afternoon.

You can walk to both sides of the falls as there is bridge by the visitor centre. If you have the time it's good to see the falls from each aspect. Definitely worth a visit. The gift shop at the visitor centre is quite good for souvenirs and coffee and cake if you are a little peckish.",Oct 2019
Iceland,JobeeMom,Godafoss,4.0,"Godafoss is very easy to get to. Itâs right by the Ring Road 30 minutes from Akureyri. Itâs very accessible from the parking lot. The paths to the viewing platforms are well paved that can accommodate wheelchairs and strollers. There are two parking lots which take you to either the east side or west side of the falls with different views. The two sides are connected by a foot bridge, or you can move your car from one parking to another. I suggest visiting both sides for complete views of the falls. If youâre on a tight time schedule, then go for the east side which is the 2nd parking lot if coming from Akureyri. This is the bigger parking lot with bus parking; and thereâs a coffee shop, accommodation and washroom facilities. The platform on the east side gives you a full perspective of the falls from the top. Also from the east side, you can walk down a slope to the rocky beach close to the bottom of the falls for a different view.

While Godafoss canât compare with the powerful Dettifoss and Gullfoss, itâs beautiful in its own way. I found it much less crowded than Gullfoss, and way easier to get to than Dettifoss, so donât miss it when youâre in Akureyri/Lake Myvatn area.

There were heavy rains the days before we visited, so the water looked very muddy. It would have been even more spectacular if the water was clearer.

Iceland,Americanofficestory,Godafoss,5.0,"So this is where the Vikings dumped their âidolsâ when they had a change in their religious and belief system. They didnât mess around and had no intention of being able to retrieve them again.

Water: clear and blue
Geology: columnar jointing, the water has eaten through the basalt and exposed som awesome and possible collapsed entries into lava tubes or just lava formations caused by gas bubbles downstream if you observe the past rock formations.
Best view: I would take the first parking lot for godafoss. You get a front view of the falls. Otherwise you get a side view and actually canât see it as well.

You can still climb down a very very steep path of rocks to go to the bottom of the waterfall. Most others like Detifoss have had the path down closed.

We watched the waterfall for a very long time. It was so big and so magnificent.

If you prefer large waterfalls with nice viewing areas, this is for you. I, however, tended to prefer the smaller waterfalls in the area that have more character. The power this waterfall has is amazing. You can feel how powerful the water is by how loud it is and just seeing how much water falls through it is incredible.

ï· Later you can visit hot spring area of Namaskard (Hverarond), and Krafla Geothermal Power Station. The nearby Crater Lake Viti is a good place to stop and take a few photos, it is also very nice to see the colourful sulfurous slopes of Namaskard and Krafla volcanic area.

A little further away, we visit an impressive waterfall, which is Dettifoss, the most powerful waterfall in Europe. But wherever you go, take time to enjoy the lake itself. With gnarled lava fields on the one side, and lush pastures on the other, itâs a beautiful area to spend time, with a wide range of places to explore.

Recommended.",Jul 2019
Iceland,DorothyCheong,Godafoss,5.0,"Despite the rain and coldness in summer season, nothing could stop us from walking a short distance from the car park to this awesome and gorgeous waterfall. This is another wonder for us.
Nicely done up boardwalk with railings.
This waterfall is very near to Akureyri, around 35 km away.",Jun 2019
Iceland,jan c,Godafoss,5.0,Went to visit as part of an excursion from a cruise docked in Akureyri. Arrived at about 9pm and only our bus tour there so plenty of photo opportunities and could spend time just taking in the magnificence of the waterfall. Amazing sight and with the bright evening sun and stunning scenery around made it even more magical. Would recommend on a trip to Iceland.,Jul 2019
Iceland,Wecke,Godafoss,5.0,"This is very impressive waterfall and absolutely one you should check while in Iceland. This is not the tallest fall, but this is wide and the amount of water in this stream is amazing, also the sound of it. This waterfall is also easy and quick to access, so no reason not to go here.",Jul 2019
Iceland,dgjohansson,Godafoss,5.0,"An absolutely stunning waterfall that, in my opinion, outdid some of the more famous ones. You will see it from a far distance if you come from the east of Iceland. Once there you can access it from both sides. There are parking lots on both sides and good paths to walk on. On the left side (facing it) of the fall, you can also walk down to the river and walk all the way up to the fall. This last part has no track so you will be climbing around on a flat, rocky beach to get there. From the right side, you can't come close unless you jump the protective barriers which a surprising amount of people do! For photography, this place faces the sun most parts of the day. An early morning should provide the best light. Since it is directed towards NE, the afternoon/evening it will be in shadows. Surprisingly, there are no drone restrictions put to place here - just the common drone rules. Petrolstation with a cafe, a souvenir shop and the usual expensive toilets in Iceland (200 ISK).

Iceland,P1996BTjax,Godafoss,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful and easy walking distance from the car park. Huge tourist attraction and lots of people feeling the need to do yoga poses in front of it pushing their way to the âright spotâ which was sad and embarrassing. Most wonderful place on earth, shame about some of the cretins that visit it though.",Jul 2019
Iceland,Bill L,Godafoss,5.0,Everyone says you have to go to Godafoss. They are not wrong. We were lucky enough that it was a beautiful sunny day. So we got some wonderful pictures. Don't miss this sight.,Jun 2019
Iceland,Molly N,Godafoss,5.0,"As you know, Iceland is filled with waterfalls in any direction you turn. This one is pretty good, with a lovely split waterfall (falls in three large chunks split by land masses). It makes for some pretty pictures! You can also walk right next to the top of the falls.",Jul 2019
Iceland,Junius T,Godafoss,5.0,"Another huge, beautiful waterfall in Iceland. This is one I could stare at for a long time. Not as many tourists as the falls in western and southern Iceland as this isn't one of the heavier tourist areas. There is a walkover bridge and you can walk either side of the falls and river. Gasoline here. Cafe with food, coffee and drinks. We didn't eat however the coffee and cappucinos are good although expensive like other Iceland cafes. The cafe also has a souvenir shop with different levels of souvenirs from nice to junky. Bathrooms here for a fee/donation. This is a great stop If doing the Ring Road. Right off Hwy 1.

There are two sides of view spots of fall. We did not cross bridge to other side, but we walked down to bottom of fall. Beautiful!",May 2019
Iceland,CleopatraBunny,Godafoss,5.0,"We've seen nearly every major waterfall in Iceland and this one, by far, was everyone's favorite. There are two sides for viewing, both with dirt paths (no hiking poles needed) and viewing spots. Park at one and use the foot bridge to cross over the raging river that flows from Godafoss down to Geitafoss (you'll see both) for different perspectives. The walk from the parking lot takes about 5-10 minutes out to the path's end but you'll see the falls right as you pull in the lot.
Easy to get to after visiting Husavik for whale watching, there is plenty of parking and a picnic table. There's also an N1 gas station here, and a gift shop. The WC requires 200kr to use.",Jun 2019
Iceland,Chris L,Godafoss,5.0,"These waterfalls are located right off the highway with ample parking. No facilities here although there is small cafe & store nearby.

Iceland,skyisblu,Godafoss,4.0,"Located right on the Ring Road, this big, beautiful waterfall is very accessible, and so very popular. We opted to hike up to the back of the falls, along newly constructed pathways - leading to gravel - leading to corded-off areas - leading to a simple ""BEWARE"" sign. Once we reached the falls, it was free exploration around the rock pools, trying not to get our feet wet, staying clear of the edge of the water. Down below, at the lower viewpoint, we watched crowds of people unload from buses in the main parking lot, and fill the pathways. We had clearly chosen the path less traveled, and thankfully so. Godafoss was beautiful and worth the stop regardless of the people, but for those searching for all the services and ease of access, you'll find that too, in the main parking lot. This is the waterfall for everyone.

The water of the river SkjÃ¡lfandafljÃ³t falls from a height of 12 meters over a width of 30 meters wide of 30 meter and a huge amount of water that is falling, it is one of the most spectacular waterfalls. It's means fall of the gods. Is situated in the North of Iceland, near Myvatn. Views are stunning!
When the cruise ship arrived at the port it was snowing a bit and so it went all the way to the fallls.
It was incredible cold that day, eventhough we have a heavy parka and gloves.

But it is a bit of a honey trap, and in winter, the path down to the lower ledges, close to the falls is steep, slippery and with little to hold onto other than a rope, staked at intervals but not that easy to manipulate. Certainly a challenge for small children, the elderly or those with poor mobility.

The short trek up, battling the cross wind a snow was worth it. Taking gloves off hands to use cellphone quickly numbs from the frosty winds.

Iceland,dr_j_now,Godafoss,5.0,"This grouping of falls is very beautiful. With two main falls and a third little one as well it was very beautiful from numerous angles. You can also easily visit from both sides, so definitely take the little bit of extra time to do so. The paths are well maintained and there was plenty of parking when we visited. There were plenty of people as well, but it wasn't too difficult to get some decent pictures of just us either; just required a little patience. There were some ongoing renovations/improvements being worked on when we visited, but it really didn't hamper us at all. The views all around were gorgeous; don't forget to turn around and see the beautiful river scene from the water flowing away from the falls as well. The souvenir shop/cafe nearby was nice and had restrooms (pay). There is a foot bridge across the river as well which makes it easy to access both sides while parked on either.

Iceland,michiberli,Godafoss,5.0,We saw a lot of waterfalls on our Golden Circle trip but this one was the most beautiful in my opinion.

Extensive well-maintained paths make it easy to see the falls from a variety of angles. They face east, so morning is the best time to photograph them in full light. You can get atmospheric photos in the evening as the sun sinks behind the falls (depends on the time of year obviously). Restaurant, cafe and souvenir shop with a good selection of Icelandic pullovers.",Sep 2018
Iceland,Shofsan,Godafoss,5.0,"This place is so serene. The waterfall is beautiful, but so is the view in the opposite direction of the water flowing down. There is a little bridge that goes over the water on the other side, which has almost as beautiful of a view as the actual waterfall :)",Oct 2018
Iceland,Travis C,Godafoss,4.0,"The pathways are easily accessible, wide, and full of people. This is a pretty big tourist area. I would recommend small crampons because even in early October, ice was already forming everywhere.

Unlike most falls in Iceland that are up in the mountains, this set of waterfalls is actually on the plateau floor, so when approaching from a car, the mist off the waterfall almost looks like many of the other geothermal pools in Iceland.

There was construction being performed on one side of the falls, so they had areas closed off, and while we saw signs for a restroom, we never found one. There were some shops nearby, but thy were closed when we visited.

Plan on an hour to visit this waterfall, as you'll want to see it from both sides which will involve moving the car from one side to another and taking a walk. The walk is similar to that at Gulfoss, nothing major, but a small hike none-the-less.

I would also recommend visiting early or late to be there when not as many people are there, as there were many when we visited, and it was fairly difficult to take pictures without people in them.

Overall, we loved the beauty, size, and power of this waterfall. It produced rainbows, and was a great stop on our adventure.

Iceland,alohatripper,Godafoss,4.0,"This waterfall is very far from the parking lot. The icy conditions of the pathway forced us to walk instead on the snow-laden shoulder which was not slippery.
The waterfall itself is not that spectacular compared to some of the others. At this point in the Iceland tour, seeing a major waterfall is becoming commonplace. Little did I realize that Iceland is the place to view the beauties of nature. In Norway we saw a few minor ones and in Denmark we saw none.
One of the prime reasons to visit Iceland is to see the waterfalls.",Oct 2018

They are just off the main ""ring road"" that encircles the country. Easy access to either side of the falls, since it's only 100 meters from the road.

Lots of people go there but on our visit the number wasn't too bad. Beautiful pictures. There is a large gift shop and coffee/sandwich shop. You could easily rent a car and drive there. Smaller bus made the trip much nicer.,Aug 2018
Iceland,Susan C,Godafoss,5.0,My husband and I saw these falls as part of a 6 day bus trip of Iceland in September.

Iceland,EDian831,Godafoss,5.0,For me this is a top 5 waterfall. Itâs huge. Itâs horseshoe shaped. It has a side fall. Work on the walkway gave up close exposure to those brave enough to walk the uneven surface to the top of the falls. There are 2 points on each side of the river to view the falls. See it from both sides. Also we were staying in the area so in the evening it was raining but by the next morning the side rain had stopped. Itâs better without the sideway rain. Plan time to walk and see.,Aug 2018
Iceland,Isaiah P,Godafoss,5.0,"This had to be the most breathtaking waterfall in all of Iceland. We saw many waterfalls but this was the one we spent the most around of time at. There is a parking area on each side of the falls but this one actually has a small walking bridge slightly downstream that will allow you to access both sides of the falls without moving your vehicle. We explored the entire area including the top of the falls and even going down to the rocks and touching the water at the base of the falls. There are so many good picture opportunities here. Definitely plan to spend at least 1 hour at this location. Some walking will be necessary to have a full unobstructed view of the falls.

There is a paved walkway on either side of the river and the falls are close to a gas station where snacks may be purchased. The waterfall, from afar, reminded me of Niagara Falls in New York but you could get closer. A major plus is that I got to photograph the ptarmigans.

We were able to get lots of photos without anyone in them. We parked on one side, checked out the waterfall and then walked over the bridge to view from the other side as well. We like to hike, so it was nice to incorporate a bit of a walk while enjoying the stunning view. We thought Godafoss was one of the prettiest waterfalls. But there are so many great ones!",Sep 2018

There is not much to the town of Akureyri and it is hard to imagine how desolate this place must be in midwinter!",Jun 2018
Iceland,Judy H,Godafoss,5.0,One very nice advantage about Godafoss is that it is close to the access road. You can see it as you approach on the roadand it is within easy walking distance if walking happens to be difficult for you. It is a beautiful wide falls. With some short walks you can see this falls from both sides and top and bottom. It also has a lovely view from a bridge. There is a pay restroom there and a small fast food place with gift shop. There is also a restaurant. Donât miss Godafoss.,Sep 2018
Iceland,chemie71,Godafoss,5.0,"We really enjoyed these falls! You can view both sides of the falls and walk to the bottom on the one side. As others have said, there is construction for what looks like viewing platforms. People are able to get to the edge of the falls now.
The falls are gorgeous from both sides. As you walk downstream to get to the other side, you pass a smaller fall called Geitafoss. From the bridge, you can see Geitafoss and the mist from Godafoss upstream. The blue water from this view is just lovely!
Definitely see both sides. If you are physically able, go down to the bottom to see that view. This was one of our favorite waterfalls.

Iceland,ItchyFeet,Godafoss,5.0,"One of THE falls you come to see in Iceland.
We went with a tour van like almost everyone else because everything in Iceland is 2 hours from anything else.

The positive is that itâs an amazing sight and you should be on your own schedule to spend as much time as you want here.

The negative is that with any of the tour groups you are given about an hour which seems like a while but you have to walk to the falls and then there are several areas (at any of the falls in Iceland) that you will want to walking to and there is no time to do anything but a pretty fast look which takes away the fun. We felt very rushed and frustrated that we couldnât spend more time.

We were here mid September (after the June-August summer madness) but there were still an unbelievable amount of people. Literally thousands - crazy busy. Not peaceful at all with so many people. If you could drive yourself and get there really early in the day or late in the day when all the busses were gone that would be much better!

When you park you can walk to the falls on either side. One side is where the parking is at but then you can cross over a bridge to walk to the other side. If you are with a tour you will barely have enough time to see one side. We didnât have the time to cross the bridge and see the falls from the other angle. This was frustrating to us!

There is a gift shop and food available but we didnât have enough time to see the falls let alone look inside the building.

Many viewing places to stand and can approach to very sides of the falls which tumble in two main sections. We saw fall jumpers preparing and also kayaking.

You are free to wander pretty much as far as you wanted in the time available, or you can just stand mesmerised looking at the falls. It only took a few minute to walk a bit upstream and take loads of pics without people in the shot.

Iceland,P4lin,Godafoss,5.0,"You see so many waterfalls in Iceland that there is a danger you will become rather blase. Thankfully each of them is unique and therefore offers a different experience. There is good free parking here on both sides of the river and good paths lead to the falls. When we visited they were building a new viewing platform which I am sure will further enhance the experience. The building work did not negatively impact on our visit as it is low key and small scale. Walking down river from the spectacular falls leads to a further fall and a lovely pedestrian bridge over the river which provides good views of the river and lower falls - you also get a glimpse of Godafoss. At this end there is also a petrol station and cafe where there are pay for toilets. If you go upstream from the falls there are beautiful views of the river and its tributaries. Despite other people being there, it felt very peaceful. We would recommend stopping here.

We went to the Hof at Akureyri the lovely young lady there said that there was possibly the chance of a tour to the waterfall the next morning and she was waiting to hear from the tour company, Midnight Sun Tours.
We waited for word until she got sick of us asking and called the tour company, yes the tour would go ahead we paid $75.00 USD and the next morning at ten oâclock we arrived at the bus, a reasonably new and well appointed bus not a huge coach nice and easy to hear the excellent commentary in English by Akri the Icelander tour guide and driver.
The trip to the falls was as informative, scenic and interesting as the falls itself, about a one hour trip through farmland, snow capped mountains and lakes.
On arrival we were dropped off at the path to the falls, what a fantastic spectacle the glacier melt water is always so clean and looks blue, the water coming from the falls, was beautiful, the path meanders along the river until you see the spectacular falls, much the same shape but a bit smaller than Niagara, the rainbows thrown up on the sunny day were spectacular and the falls mesmerising.
A great day, interesting and informative, so glad we did it, if itâs a short tour of about 2.5 hours you want? Do this you will love it.

Iceland,Robert A,Godafoss,5.0,"Less ""powerful"" and magnanimous than Dettifoss, Godafoss has, to me, more character and personality than its area sister plunge. It is certainly easier to get to and see. Plus, it has a ""1000 year"" history as an idol dump site (Do not throw ""trash"" into any waterway!) brought on by my overzealous converted-to-Catholicism Viking cousins A) King Olav(f) Tryggvason (968-1000) and even more so B) King (later St.) Olav(f) (1015) who really ticked off a lot of Scandinavians before he was killed in the 1030 Battle of Stiklestad in the Icelandic mother country of Norway. The resultant mandatory law-of-faith-conversion from Nordic to Latin that took place at The Thing one summer in that era in Thingvellir, Iceland (""Golden Circle Tour) in southeastern Iceland resulted in the reported destruction of heathen idols in the waters below Godafoss. Think about all this/these thing(s)"" while you observe and appreciate Godafoss.
To really appreciate Godafoss: Read Njal's Saga, visit ""The Thing"" site at the famous tectonic plate shifting park in Thingvellir while in Iceland and visit the Nidaros Cathedral in beautiful Trondheim, Norway. Hope you find this helpful!

Iceland,Allison W,Godafoss,5.0,"We stopped here on our way to Myvatn Lake and are glad we stopped. It is a popular stop with large bus groups and individuals, but you can still get nice views and photos even when there are a lot of people visiting. The water is incredibly blue. It would be an amazing sight on a clear day with a blue sky. Our kids [11 and 8] had no trouble walking to the falls and the trails were not scary or anything. Very young kids could easily handle this walk as well.",Jul 2018
Iceland,Calin S,Godafoss,5.0,"The greatness of the waterfall of the gods cannot be explained in words. You have to make an effort to visit this. Can be admired from both sides, passing a bridge.

Iceland,CutshallTeachers,Godafoss,5.0,"Saw both Detifoss and Godafoss. Detifoss has more pure power as the amount of water flowing over the falls is incredible. The water in Detifoss is brown since the amount of sand in the falls is fairly high. The water disappears into a mist, so you can't see the bottom. Godafoss, on the other hand is a wider falls, with much cleaner looking (bluish green} water and you can see the bottom from all sides. Godafoss is right off of route 1, with the hike to the falls being very short and easy. Godafoss can be accessed from both sides. The trails lead to both to the bottom and top of the falls. With easy access, and the layout of the falls, I thought this was one of the prettiest falls in Iceland.

Iceland,Peter A,Godafoss,4.0,"For me, a good waterfall is when you can get close to it. Godafoss was that kind of waterfall. The circular shape is also very pleasing to look at!

Iceland,Mariellen S,Godafoss,5.0,The Waterfall of the Gods is easily accessible from the Ring Road. There are viewing areas on each side and paved pathways to the viewing areas. There is a bridge to cross over so you can access each side no matter where you park. On one side you can descend stone steps to the base and feel the spray. This makes the rocks damp and slippery so take care. There is a great viewing area at the top as well. The powerful water is mesmerizing and the view of the basalt cliff wall is spectacular.

This is a splendid church with a stunning pipe organ at the west end, but it is let down by a less than welcoming warden/verger and not allowing access to its many toilets.

Warden/verger: no 'hello', 'welcome', 'nice to see you', just 'if you come inside do not wheel your suitcase over the tiles'. No 'please' or 'thank you', not a hint of a smile.

Toilets: I am fairly sure there are 4 or 5 toilets at the west end but they are always locked and the red lights on. Not much of a welcome for visitors, where are they supposed to go to find facilities?

The organ inside is cool, but the church is not elaborately made or decorated inside. We did not ride to the top in the lift, but we decided that paying ~Â£8 to see a grey and rainy Reykjavik from above wasn't worth it; we'd also read reviews that the view from Perlan was much better (which I can say was quite a good view).",Sep 2021

Iceland,Brian T,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Is it a thing of beauty, or a monstrosity? You decide, though youâll have to visit to make that decision. Love it or hate it, HallgrÃ­mskirkja is certainly an intriguing structure, unlike any other in the country, and it is Reykjavikâs iconic landmark. I think it's a fabulous spot to visit, though it does help to understand its construction and the ideas behind it.

Towering to around 74.5 meters, Hallgrimskirkja is the tallest building in Reykjavik. And perched atop the gentle SkÃ³lavÃ¶rÃ°uholt hill in downtown Reykjavik, it literally looms over the historic centre of the city. You can see the church steeple reaching into the sky from wherever you are in the city. It stands guard over the city and is impossible to miss. And it is an absolute âmust seeâ if you are in Reykjavik.

The church was designed by GuÃ°jÃ³n SamÃºelsson, the state architect of Iceland at the time. Construction didnât begin until 1945 and wasnât completed until the mid-1980s. Its stepped concrete facade is certainly an ode to modernism. His vision was, apparently, to create a building that took its inspiration from the mountains and glaciers that provide the picturesque backdrop to the city. He was particularly inspired by the countryâs volcanos, and the sides of the building were designed to resemble columns of volcanic basalt rock. I personally think it most resembles the basalt columns around Svartifoss waterfall. If youâve had the opportunity to visit this waterfall youâll know what I mean.

Itâs a Lutheran church, and not a cathedral. Itâs free to visit, and open from 10:00 each day. As you step inside, youâll probably be taken aback by the extremely plain yet striking interior, with its high ceilings, simple windows and the lack of adornment with religious icons and paraphernalia. And that simplicity creates its sublime beauty. Your eyes will also be drawn to the huge 15 metre-tall pipe organ, built with an amazing 5,275 pipes and installed in 1992. Its sound is hauntingly beautiful.

For a modest fee you can take the lift up to the tower, to the level of the clock face. It provided the best panoramic views of the city from the observation deck at around 73 metres high. Visit on a sunny day, as we did, and the colours of the city, sea, mountains and sky will take your breath away.The tower costs 1,000 ISK. You can stay as long as you want.

It's a wonderful and intriguing landmark to visit.

Iceland,8-drank-was-merry ð§³ ð«ðð»ð¸ð¨,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"There are great views of Reykjavik that can be seen from the tower for a small fee and a short elevator ride. I recommend taking the time.
The Lutheran church has a gray stone exterior meant to resemble the trap rocks, mountains and glaciers of Iceland.
The interior of the church is beautiful, yet simple, with a gorgeous pipe organ.
Out in front of the church there is a statue of the explorer - Leif Erikson.
This statue predates the church. It was a gift from the USA in honor of the 1930 Althing Millenial Festival, commemorating the 1000th anniversary of the convening of Iceland's parliament at Pingvellir in 930 AD. (Another great place to visit).

Warning, when you take the elevator to the bell tower you will here the bells ring every 15 minutes. The view is stunning. You must buy a ticket in the church gift shop. As a bonus there are many blades/scooters to rent before or after your visit. The church is next to a free outdoor sculpture garden, the local swimming pool, and Cafe Loki.
There are summer concerts. Church service is held in English once a month. A long tube near the tube asks for donations for maintenance of the grand pipe organ.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Julie P,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,I have visted the church but not taken the elevator to the top before-the view is amazing. Right across the street is a local place to grab a beer when you are done! (Cafe Loki).,Sep 2021

Iceland,Jasmine D,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,You can't miss Hallgrimskirkja as you'll see it from anywhere in Reykjavik. It's in the town center and easy to get to. Pay the ticket (~$8) to take the elevator up the tower for 360 degree views of Reykjavik. Be sure to walk all around the outside of the building to admire the architecture as well. There are several restaurants within stone's throw of the church and a few benches in the tiny park outside so feel free to grab a snack/lunch and sit down to take in the view.,Aug 2021
Iceland,Footprints811562,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"What a beautiful landmark Lutheran Church! Like many things in Iceland, itâs unusual . The structure is very unique in its height, structure, and style. Itâs a perfect landmark to pick out throughout Reykjavik.",Jul 2021
Iceland,reise-tanta-di,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"The church is a massive landmark and its impressive concrete size can be seen from afar. The exterior resembles basaltic columns seen in its natural state elsewhere on Iceland. The interior is simplistic and comforting. Nothing but an large 5275-pipe organ can divert your mind if you like to meditate. We did not take the elevator up to 74.5m top floor as we had seen Reykjavik in every direction from Perlan. I was impressed by the church benches that could be turned around to face the altar or the other way if a concert was to take place.
The well known Icelandic architect, Guthjon Samuelsson (1887-1950) died before the completion of the church in 1986.
In front of the church is a statue of the Viking Leif Eiriksson, the first European to discover America. Apparently this statue was a gift from North America.
Being in Reykjavik one cannot miss the church. It is definitely worth a visit.

Iceland,Maggie_NHam,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Took 40 years to build. Impressive concrete design. Feels quite serene inside, uncluttered and minimalist, Lutheran style I guess. There is one stained glass window on left hand side of the altar and another near the entrance. However, the tall, plain glass windows absolutely add to the serenity of the place.

There's a lovely font in front of the altar area. It looks so Icelandic, so fitting. I like to think it's made of crystalline, but I don't suppose it is. But it is a lovely font.

There's 2 organs, maybe one for every day use and an enormous one at the entrance, for special occasions. It'd be interesting to attend a recital or be lucky enough to hear someone practising!

You can light a candle, more like a nightlight, for a small donation, on left hand side as you leave.

It's worth a visit even if you're not into cathedrals and churches.

The church was closed, but was still worth a visit just to see the architecture on the outside. In front of the church is the Leifur Eiriksson Statue. Some great pictures can be taken around this church and statue. Don't miss the fun metal sculpture located right across the street by the Einar Jonsson garden.

Just something that is practical. From a distance it looks like squirrel wingsuit base jumper and it's location makes it even more prominent but other than that, it's not a very complex piece of architecture so don't know why it took them more than 40 years to build it.

Also design vise it's supposed to have all main elements of nature found in Iceland. The volcano, lava, glacier, waterfall and mountains. Maybe yes but sadly to my unartistic eyes, it looks more like a music instrument.

It does remind me of Shard in London though.

Luckly if you get inside the atmosphere changes. The interior is bright thanks to the glass windows and people feel at ease on the modern benches which can change direction by moving the backrest: one way looking at the altar, the other looking up at the organ when concerts are held in the church.

What a treat. The choir were wonderful and the setting of the beautiful cathedral with the low sun streaming in was incredible.

The next day we returned to see the cathedral in more detail and it truly is beautiful. We took a trip up the tower for wonderful views of snowy Reykjavik. It was quite busy, so some queues for the lift. But well worth the queue and the small fee.

Would absolutely recommend a visit here!

Iceland,Vadim,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"74-meter high Hallgrimskirkja is the tallest building in Reykjavik. Given the location on a hill and the small size of the city, you can see it almost everywhere. It is the second tallest building in Iceland, behind 3 meters of the SmÃ¡ratorg tower in the suburbs of the capital. It was named after HallgrÃ­mur PÃ©tursson, one of the best known poets of Iceland. Most tourists believe that the Church is the Cathedral of Iceland, but this is not the case. It is located below the lake. Almost like in Rome, where everyone is sure that the Cathedral is San Pietro, but not San Giovanni in Laterano. HallgrÃ­mskirkja was designed by the Architect GuÃ°jÃ³n Samuelsson in 1937, after years of discussion. But the construction lasted even longer than the discussions. It began only after the end of world war II in 1945 and ended by the end of the Cold war in 1986. Samuelson, a fan of Scandinavian modernism and an active protagonist of urban planning, made the Church in harmony with the Icelandic landscape. Inside, minimalism triumphs in absolute victory. Nothing distracts you from thinking about God. Absolutely nothing. Martin Luther and Jean Calvin would have been happy. Not everyone likes it, though. The Church ranks high both in the ranking of the most beautiful places of worship in the world and in the ranking of the ugliest ones. If You belong to the second group, you need to take the Elevator to the top of the Church for 1000 crowns. Following the logic of Guy de Maupassant in relation to the Eiffel tower, this will be the only place where Hallgrimskirkja will not be visible. I didn't go upstairs because the views of Reykjavik are available for free from Perlan.

Iceland,Malgorzata,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"Hallgrimskirkja church is one of Reykjavikâs best-known landmarks. Towering over the city, itâs visible from all corners of Reykjavik. It is the most characteristic object on the map of ReykjavÃ­k, which is absolutely not to be missed. The architect, Gudjon Samuelsson, based his design of the church on elements found in Icelandic nature, like basalt columns, mountains, and glaciers. However, inside you find total simplicity, space and no unnecessary decorations. Beautiful stained glass window of the Mother of God . High class organ on which organ concerts are performed. It took 41 years to build Hallgrimskirkja. Construction then started in 1945 and was completed in 1986, just in time for the 200-year anniversary of ReykjavÃ­k. The statue of Leif Eriksson in front of the church stood there first. The church is named after Icelandic poet and clergyman Hallgrimur Petursson. The view from the tower is amazing. Beautiful panorama of the entire Reykjavik and the surrounding area. HallgrÃ­mskirkja is the largest church in Iceland. Definitely an interesting place, worth visiting.

Iceland,Stelutza23,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Visiting the church is very quick and easy - 10-15 min an you're done. However we are giving this attraction an excellent rating because of 2 things:
--- (1) the tower tour, where you can enjoy gorgeous breathtaking 360 degrees panoramas of the city and the surrounding mountains (1,200 KR per person gets you up there);
--- (2) the Thursday afternoon meditation accompanied by the organ music. It's only 30 min from 12 â 12:30 pm and visits are not allowed in the church during this time and it is amazing! Very peaceful, relaxing, and a rare opportunity to listen to the impressive organ LIVE. And all this is FREE! If you have the time, don't miss out on this, it's an amazing experience :-)

Iceland,Susie B,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"We purchased tickets tickets to go up the tower.We were served by a gentleman who snatched the money with no please or thank you.Then we sat in the church for a few minutes.When we were about to go up the tower, the same rude gentleman who had served us,closed the tower entrance by putting a barrier across.He then rudely just pointed and said 'theres the line'.After seeing the lovely views we came down in the lift only to find it all in darkness with the front door locked.We were so worried that we had been locked in.We went into the church and the rude gentleman then just pointed to the side door.No apology for our distress.He lied and said that he had told us the tower was closing at 5pm-he definatly didnt or we wouldnt have hung around in the church before we went up the tower.
Everyone in Iceland has been so friendly and gracious apart from this obnoxious man.What a shame as the church and views were lovely.

Iceland,Bernadette M,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"Situated in the centre of Reykjavik walked to see this. Very unusual and got some lovely shots of it with the snow covered ground.
A bit disappointing inside very plain but put some candles on.
Think there is a tower for viewing you can go up but there were queues so we didn't bother.
Just down from the church there is a little fish and chip stand which looked nice but regrettably we didnt try it as my daughter hates fish. Maybe worth a fish finger butty though!

Iceland,11Alicat,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Entrance is free. Beautiful modern church not sure if it was built to look like organ pipes, but that's what it looked like to me, very clever if so.
Talking of which there was someone beautifully playing the organ as we arrived and so it gave me an emotional entrance to a stunning building.
The organ pipes inside were incredible.
For Â£6 you can go up the clock tower and see amazing 360 views of Reykjavik. It was a lovely clear day and we took some fab photos of the city. The clock struck 11:45 while we were up there, we all jumped out of our skin, then burst out laughing at ourselves for being so daft. Queue of about 25 people in front of us, but as the lift takes 6 at a time it was only a few minutes wait and worth it.
I'm not religious but I would recommend a visit.

Iceland,Peter M,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,The Church itself dominates the skies of ReykjavÃ­k. Its simple interior has a beauty of its own and it is well worth the trip up the tower for views of the city and mountains beyond.,Feb 2020
Iceland,Toni A,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,It is really wonderful to watch the sunrise over the church during the blue hour. There are bells that ring every hour. They are very short so listen well!,Feb 2020

The whole place is stunning",Feb 2020
Iceland,Lee W,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"This church is well worth a visit when you visit Reyjavic. I am a pagan or heathen in the eyes of the Christian Church but I really like the architecture of church buildings. The pipes of the pipe organ are amazing and when we visited the organist turned up and played. It was really good. The church still has quarterly bongs on the bells and hourly ones as you would expect, very musical though not like ones in the uk. Real shame the stained glass you see from the outside isn't viewable from the inside.",Feb 2020

Iceland,annando36,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"What an unusual looking building! Lovely stroll up the hill to get there. Inside, the church is beautiful in its simplicity.

Iceland,NikiTennant,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"We visited this church as a part of a city tour with Gray Line. It is stunning from the exterior, but the interior is really beautiful. There was someone playing Bach on the immense pipe organ and it was sensational.

Iceland,Richard W,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,Inexpensive way to spend an hour or so. The cathedral inside is worth looking at as a contrast to the older ones Iâm used to looking at. Take the lift to the top of the tower for the view.,Feb 2020
Iceland,Kathryn,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,We paid a visit as tourists to see this iconic building. Well worth paying the 1000ISK fee per person to go in the lift for the views over Reykjavik too.,Feb 2020

Architecture is simple yet stunning
If you can go when the main organ is being played this is a real treat!",Feb 2020
Iceland,Simon,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"The church is fairly central in Reykjavik, up a gentle hill through some colourful streets. It is very imposing and I'm fairly certain like no other church you'll have seen before! It is really appropriate to it's place... very Icelandic! The strong rock feel continues inside, where everything is beautifully modern and minimalistic, but still very impressive and free to enter.

There's a large organ, a nice simple altar with sweeping views out to snow capped mountains, and a tower with stunning panoramas in every direction. It was only 1000isk per adult when we visited in February 2020 which is about Â£6, so don't be tempted to pay in GBP because then it's Â£7! The only way up is by lift to floor 8 (via floor 20!) from where you get decent views from glazed windows, but for the best views carry on up the stairs from there and you can see out of tall thin slits with no glass so uninterrupted. There are boxes to stand on up there for shorter people!

There are no toilets in the church so go before or after.

Highly recommended.

Iceland,Andrew S,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"This church is in a very prominent location, and can be seen against the skyline from most places in central Reykjavik. The starkness of the modern design is followed in the simplicity and plainess of the internal decoration, almost echoing reformation iclonoclasm, or modern minimalism; nothing to distract the worshipers from their devotion. Definitely worth visiting to see the very different design, both internal and external.",Feb 2020

The area has a lot of shops, restaurants, and things to do. The best part of the church is the viewing deck at the top. It was only about $9 to go up and the views are priceless.

I actually walked here from my hotel, which was on the outskirts of the touristy part of the city. Because the street directions change in this area, it took me longer than I thought it would, given the sheer size of the building, to actually find this place.
Be aware this is an actual, functioning church, so please respect people who are worshiping. Also, the lift to the viewing area does cost a little, but it is well worth the price.",Jan 2020

Iceland,Rob G,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"I only spent 10 minutes here as it was about to shut for a funeral, but that was 10 minutes well spent. The view from the top is outstanding and well worth the 1000isk fee to go up. Make sure you visit before you leave Reykjavik.",Feb 2020

The architecture is rather neat, and the views if you take the elevator up are absolutely amazing, overlooking all of Reykjavik.

It's an easy walk if you're anywhere downtown, and is a nice site to see if you want something that isn't terribly fussy, especially if you've just flown in that day and are trying to adjust to the new time zone and reset.

It is just so unique compared to other churches and at night when it is lit up, it's truly a focal point on the landscape. The interior of the church is very modern, and so i was surprised to learn that construction on this started in 1945. The organ is a piece of art in its own, with over 5000 pipes. I absolutely loved the doors inside the main entrance. They were stunning. The church is located at the top of Reykjavik's high street and is most definitely the most picturesque and colourful place in a city what consists mostly of grey, square Eastern block type buildings.

Inside the church, its has very great architectural design similar to the other churches in Europe. They have a large organ which nicely placed at the other end of the church.

To got to the top of tower, there is an entrance fee of about $10. When your on top, you will have a 360 view of the city. Just make sure you are bundled up as it is very cold and windy up there.

Iceland,geotech522,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,The HallgrÃ­mskirkja church is ReykjavÃ­k's main landmark and the tower can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. Architect GuÃ°jÃ³n SamÃºelsson designed the Lutheran church building and was often inspired by the forms created when lava cools into basalt rock. Construction of the church began in 1945 and ended in 1986. It is the tallest building in Iceland and provides a commanding view of Reykjavik from the observation deck in the top of the tower. A speedy elevator will get you up to the top for a modest fee (well worth it). The interior of the church is also impressive and massive. A very unique design for a church but very Icelandic.,Nov 2019

Iceland,Steviefull,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"We arrived here without booking a tour and in hindsight a guided tour would have given us a much better insight into the displays. Saying that we still had a good couple of hours here exploring the exhibits, with each area showing different modern ages of Iceland from 800's up to the 2000's.

With a low entry fee for Iceland of around Â£12.00 for an adult, it is well worth a visit if you are spending more than a couple of days here and a good way to spend two hours. I still preferred the more interactive displays of Perlan, but if you can do both it is worth it.

Iceland,Maggie_NHam,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"What an excellent museum. It covers from the Settlement period and through the many changes of religion and government. Very interesting, learnt a lot.

There's an audio guide for some of the numbered plaques, but not all. So you do need to read plaques aswell. Spread over 2 floors, There's loads to see and read. The lighting on some exhibits did make it difficult to see some. And the numbering is somewhat idiosyncratic as you criss cross the room or back track slightly. No ear phones are supplied, sensibly for Covid reasons. Some folk played their audio rather too loud, without any thought of others, which was disconcerting if you're trying to read or listen to a different one.
Tip: take your own earphones.

Usefully, you can leave your coat and bag in a locker at no extra charge. Photography without flash is allowed. A brilliant visit.

Iceland,Brian D,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"An amazing collection of historic artifacts from Iceland are on exhibit at this museum. The museum is in pristine condition and is laid out in a very friendly and easy-to-follow path. The museum starts at the oldest history known to Iceland and then moves in chronological order throughout the exhibits. There are two floors in the museum. Of course everything on exhibit is explained in detail so you know what you are seeing. From this museum you can see the importance of texts and books in the history of Iceland and many, many old manuscripts, books and documents are on display. If you take the time to enjoy the exhibits, you will need 2-3 hours or more. The reward at the end of the museum is the airport luggage turnstile that has artifacts from the past century - a pop-culture of collectibles from each decade. Very fun to look at those items and see how many you had and how many things were not just popular in Iceland, but around the world as well. One of the most fun and interesting historical museums that you will visit. Don't miss it!

The exhibitions were good and informative. I already knew a bit about the settlement period, but I found the sections which followed on from that to be very interesting as well. The museum has some really lovely artifacts, and nobody made a fuss that I took my sketchbook in with me, which is something I do like to see in a museum. I felt that I understood a lot more about Iceland's history over the last 3 centuries than I did when I went in, so it had obviously done a very good job.

Iceland,Simon,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"My wife and I are not generally people who would spend hours wandering around a museum but thought it would be good to find out a little bit more about Iceland while we were there.

It was around 2000isk (about Â£12) each in February 2020 which is on the steep side for a museum in my opinion. There are however two floors packed with interesting relics and display boards telling you in detail the history of Iceland and its people.

Highlights for me included the boat and bathhouse pictured below. There are also lots of pieces dating up to 800 years old, including weapons, farming implements, jewellery, cloth, books and so on.

Access is relatively easy with lifts to all floors, there are loos and free lockers downstairs. The cafe is excellent and reasonably priced.

It probably only took an hour for us to stroll around but that probably says more about us than the museum itself. If you took everything in it would probably take a good couple of hours.

In summary interesting and well presented and we're glad we did it but pretty expensive.

Then it is upstairs to a chronological exploration of how Iceland came into being. Did you know Iceland was under Danish rule for over 300 years or that Iceland only got full independance in 1944? Amazing! I am sure you will have interesting facts that stick in your head too. There are headphones at various points which play people talking about their lives- a great way to bring history alive. The artefacts were interesting and I was able to draw comparisons with Shetland way of life- turf houses and knitting etc. Later artefacts were very European so it was fascinating.

Iceland,cheshire3131,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"An interesting way of seeing how Iceland came to be over the years.
It is on 2 levels and has a lift.
They have lockers to put your coats and belongings in free of charge which was handy when it's cold outside and warm in.

Lovely friendly and helpful staff. Worth a visit to pass an hour and a half and you also get free entry into The Culture House when buying your ticket.",Nov 2019

Iceland,TravelbugSusssex,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,A short walk to the other side of the Pond and you can spend the morning or afternoon browsing the many many displays to learn about the full history of Iceland or Snowland as it was originally named (thanks to Darren of Gray Line for that particular fact!).

Iceland,cheesenpickle96,National Museum of Iceland,3.0,"With so many great interactive things to do in Reykavik such as Perlan, Harpa, etc the museum is rather traditional.
If you enjoy in depth exploration of the history of the country in mainly display cases then you will enjoy this. The staff were all lovely and the shop was good 2000kr per adult(Â£12.50 ) a good Rainbow Section to for the history of diversity in Iceland.",Nov 2019
Iceland,Ellen S,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"Allow 1 - 2 hours to explore the 3 floors of artifacts and information. Care has been taken to depict fact and too make clear what is hypothesis vs. established fact. For the most part its tone is serious and scientific, with a particularly strong collection of items representing Catholicism and established religion. Displays meet the highest quality of museum curation & display, and most all of the audio and light-activated displays work (a surprisingly rare attribute and even some of the most world class museums!) There are relatively few interactive displays, but the children I observed touring at the Museum seemed captivated nonetheless.
The coat room and lockers are free; the cafe is clean and more than adequate; and the restrooms are private and immaculate.

Iceland,kingrd1966,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"One of the highlights of my visit to Reykjavik! Great overview of the history of Iceland, right up to modern day. Could have spent hours here, as the exhibits were full of description and context that helped educate me on the struggles of the Icelandic people over the 1200 years of their time here, and which also fueled their fierce spirit of independence. Highly recommend to everyone, especially if itâs a grey or blustery day outside.",Oct 2019
Iceland,Kristen B,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,I definitely recommend this if you have time because you will learn a TON about Icelandic history. Itâs very interesting. The place is clean and there are many languages on the signs to read. I found it so interesting that they had so many important and historic artifacts out in the open (ie not behind glass). Just simply signs that ask you not to touch. That tells you something about their great culture right there!,Oct 2019

Iceland,DukeF,National Museum of Iceland,2.0,"Going to a museum in a country steeped in Viking history you would expect some of that to be captured in the ""National Museum"", but if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed here. The museum is roughly organised over two floors, such that the earlier periods begin at the entrance and run to the end of the floor, whereupon the next floor details more modern periods of history. There are some brief examples of the ways the early settlers lived, but little actual history of the nation until after Christianity has been adopted, after which it's fairly standard exampes of churchyness common across much of western Europe. We had hoped for more focus on the unique history of Iceland, but whilst various seemingly-major historical events are referenced in passing there is no kind of timeline or explanation of these - it was incredibly difficult to discern the chronological order or work out what was going on. We left after the first floor, without even bothering to waste more time on the second.

Iceland,SaltyDogMahalo85,National Museum of Iceland,3.0,"I love history museums and always drag my better half along. We both felt this was unorganized and very very heavy on religious items. 80% of the museum was various post 1700 religious artifacts. There is so much history in Iceland, Iâm not sure why it wasnât represented better. A perfect example of how to set up a history museum, specifically in reference to taking the guest through chronological order is the Churchill war rooms in London. I would not recommend it, and I love museums!",Sep 2019

The displays are in both Icelandic and English and very informative. Would recommend starting on the 2nd floor and working your way forward in history to modern day on the 3rd floor. There were too many precious exhibits with the ""do not touch"" symbol so we had to bring the stroller along.

There is also a nice cafe and gift shop on the main floor. The Photo gallery on the main floor was pretty interesting.

It can be viewed between 1-2 hours depending on how much you read. The exhibits are done in a modern fashion that strives for more of an impression than imparting loads of detailed knowledge.

Iceland,Natalie,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,Interesting museum. Had trouble finding the right way to go around the museum so had to ask one of the staff (apparently you have to zigzag your way through which was confusing).

There are activities for children in multiple languages that help keep them engaged in the material and plenty for adults to busy themselves with. We spent a very enjoyable afternoon here.

Iceland,Bartonbears,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,This is an outstanding museum with a broad array of fascinating exhibits chronicling the history of Iceland. Many of the artifacts give insight into the lives of Icelanders over the ages. Signs in Icelandic and in English explain the nature and significance of the exhibits. A guided tour was available and we chose to take it. The start was delayed and the large number of people and slightly ponderous guide encouraged us to leave the tour and look ourselves. Unless you have ample time to fill in we would suggest you look around on your own.,Sep 2018
Iceland,treva123,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"This is an interactive museum for children and adults alike. It is spacious and never feels like you are being conveyor belted along - you can take your time to peruse the fascinating exhibits from Iceland's past. The information is in dual language - Icelandic and English and goes through the ages from Iceland's humble beginnings to today and the growing nation that it is.
Of special interest was the axe used to execute Agnes Magnusdottir, for those who have read the book 'Burial Rites', fascinating video display of photographs of Iceland and its people from the past to present and a full recreation of a traditional Icelandic house. There is a dressing up area for the children and some Icelandic artifacts for them to touch and play with.
Your ticket also gives you access to the Culture Museum in town - so well worth a look.

The artefacts are interesting and well-presented with some really ancient bits on display. The museum is modern and well laid out with really good facilities. Iâd recommend a visit.

A few reviews criticise the amount of religion-related artefacts and displays but itâs clear religion played a big part in Icelandâs history so itâs only right that it features.

- central location/ easy to walk to

Beautiful building and well laid out exhibits. Lots of different types of exhibits that cover early settler times through the present. The first floor is a bit dark though-- hard to see some items in cases. One of the museums that takes the CityCard, so definitely wort visiting if you have one.
The cafe is a bit disappointing. They didn't have a lot of things advertised on the menu, the prices were high and the selections were not very diverse. Worth walking the 10 minutes back into the heart of the city to find somewhere else for a snack.

This year they had a Rainbow thread that drew direct and indirect inferences from about 25 exhibits. It was a cool way to engage with a sub-set of exhibits. Different from trying to look at everything or creating your own highlights. It lends a lot of opportunity for weaving different threads, or looking through a specific lens, through museum collections. Well done.
The collection looks at Iceland through the ages although it throws the last 50 years at you in a rapid way.

There was a nice cafe where some delicious hot chocolate did the trick on this wet December day.
I found the museum pieces very interesting and, coming from the states, very old. I was fascinated by the plentiful religious artifacts. I probably spend t 2 hours there. Only complaint is the writing describing the artifacts is small and not well lit, so its difficult to read. I enjoyed my time learning more about Icelandic history. I think its worth a visit.

Iceland,PaulR,National Museum of Iceland,3.0,"3 stars is arguably a little harsh. The exhibits were interesting and the overall quality of the place deserves more. However, we were frustrated at the lighting of the exhibits. It was poor for many of the smaller artefacts in particular, making it very hard to see them as we'd have liked and expected. I assume this is something to do with preservation, but seems unnecessarily sensitive. Things were well labelled in Icelandic and English, with descriptions in backlit sidepanels. However, the lighting on these actually made it more difficult to see the actual items, as you went from a bright panel to badly lit artifact. Seems like it should be simple enough to improve.

Iceland,Tom P,National Museum of Iceland,3.0,"There's a lot to learn about Iceland's history at the National Musuem and it may offer as an educational alternative for those many, many rainy days here in Iceland. The audio book/ audio guides are helpful and offer additional information on everything on show...

However, the audio guidebooks can become very confusing, very quickly. Some of the numbers on show next to each of the items do not match up with the audio accompaniment. In addition, a lot of the numbers are mixed around and prove difficult to follow in a logical order.

We mentioned it to the staff as we left and they told us that the exhibits had recently been reorganised and that some of the artefacts were yet to be given the correct numbers etc. Happily, we left assuming this would be fixed for future visits but I'm not sure how quickly this will actually happen.

Overall, a nice afternoon (at best 45 - 60 minutes) and a relatively cheap alternative to a lot of the other ""things to do"" in Reykjavik.

Just 15 minutes walking from Harpa in Reykjavik. Next door of this museum is Iceland University. Good walking! The must collection is The ValÃ¾jÃ³fsstaÃ°ur door. It depicts a version of the Lion-Knight legend in which a knight slays a dragon, freeing a lion that becomes his loyal companion; this story is similar to the tale of Yvain, the Knight of the Lion and of several Icelandic chivalric sagas. The door is in the Romanesque style. This museum doesnât have many collections, but I recommend tourists to visit here!!",Oct 2018

While we only intended to stay a short while, we were so fascinated with the history and artifacts of the country, that we stayed for hours. We found ourselves reading every explanation of every exhibit and realized we knew nothing about Iceland or its history. By the time we left, we felt we at least had a superficial knowledge of this very special country.

Iceland,Sven L,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed the museum and its look at Icelandic History. Though I must say I left with as many questions as answers. The pre-Christian exhibits are phenomenal. And there is a lot of good information. The museum is very heavy on the post-Christian period between 1000 and the 19th century. It got to be a bit... much. And the 18th-to-21st Centuries were sort of a blur. And in my opinion, there is so much that happened here in the 20th Century (as a pivot point in the Cold War) that the museum sort of tapers off... ending with a whimper when it could go out with a bang. That said, I loved it. The emphasis on the art and craftsmanship of the Icelanders, especially in the early periods, was amazing. We all get taught that Vikings are rough-and-tumble Horn-Helmeted pillagers. The museum shows that there were deeply-rooted artistic traditions, beautiful craftsmanship, science, art, exploration and discovery. A museum that could easily triple in size... and not tell the whole story, I suppose. If you are in Iceland, you must come here.

Inside is a comprehensive account of the history, achievements, and lifestyle of the locals. It tells of the revolutionary introduction of the steam engine that allowed the local fish industry to achieve progress and greatness as the catches were larger and the boats able to stay out longer.
Finally a room of daily items of the 50s and 60s has the appearance of a flea market -- early home computers, phonographs, and televisions.

You see Iceland from the first settlers to a modern version of the traditional Icelandic dress that calls to mind Elsa and Cinderella.

I would buy the guide BEFORE you enter since it gives you the highlights - a must if you are pressed for time.

Iceland,YEriksson,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"We only had about three hours in Reykjavik, so decided to go to this museum hoping to get a comprehensive information on Icelandic history. The museumâs collection of artifacts and information did not disappoint us. We spent about two hours touring two floors. The audio guide was a bit hard to follow despite the fact that the displays were in a mostly chorological order. My advice is to look at the floor map first, view the displays in each eras, and when you come across something that interests you, find it on the audio guide if one was available. They have audio guide that you can rent for a fee, but they also have a free audio guide accessible on your mobile phone via Wi-Fi. The only issue we had at the museum was one of the front desk persons. The gentleman must have seen one too many tourist, because he simply handed us their web link without any explanation when we asked for audio guide rental. After being talked to in a very condescending way by the same gentleman, and finally figured out the audio guide set up, we set out to explore the museum. While we were almost done with the first section of the second floor exhibition, we discovered that everyone else in the museum had headsets on while we were holding our phones to our ears to listen. The museum provides headsets rental for free if you do not have your own, but we felt that this information was intentionally omitted by the very unhelpful front desk person. We eventually rented headsets and another audio guide for our daughter who did not have a mobile phone from another very helpful front desk lady. Other than this hiccup, we felt that a visit to the museum provided us with a good summary of Icelandic history.

Iceland,DoktoRob,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"This is an excellent museum with treasures from 1000 years of Icelandic history, in an impressive building, and with clear signage in English and Icelandic throughout. However, the museum goes out of its way to deny the existence of any Irish inhabitants prior to the arrival of the first Norse explorers - this despite the naming of a variety of place names after (Irish) priests by the earliest Scandinavian visitors (and circumstantial evidence of exploratory journeys by Irish priests commencing in the sixth century AD). Perhaps Iceland's patriotic self-history has no room for journeying Irish hermits?

The rest of the exhibit does a good job of continuing through the history of Iceland with a strong emphasis on religion. If I were to offer any constructive criticism it is a thought that the 20th century portion becomes a little more compact. I would hoave liked to have seen a little more pertaining to the independence movement of Iceland. It seems like such a significant role should receive more attention. Gift shop is excellent. If you are in the city center fairly easy to walk to, about a 4-6 block walk from the Althing. You need at least two hours to do this justice, in fact if I had timed it right I would probably have taken a break and gotten lunch at the cafe and then resumed with the second floor afterwards instead of doing it straight through. .

The main attraction is a very comprehensive, two-floor exploration of Icelandic history and culture from initial settlement to modern times. It was chock-a-block full of interesting â many âone of a kindââ artefacts. We especially liked the area devoted to Icelandâs early settlement, including the Viking burials and the wide range of displays about everyday life and how it changed over the years (e.g., tools/implements for cooking, farming, fishing, making fabric and other purposes, jewelry, pins/brooches/strings of beads used to adorn/fasten clothing, early books/manuscripts). Check out the tiny bronze Thor statue and the rare Viking game pieces. We also liked the special exhibit on saddlery and the interactive study area. This museum is a bit far afield from other city/harbor area attractions, but it only took us about 20 minutes to walk there from the Settlement Museum area, 30 minutes from Hallgrimskyrkja, and the walk is through attractive neighborhoods and lovely parkland. Itâs accessible via several city bus routes. Your ticket may also be used for entrance to The Culture House; sadly, it was our last day in Reykjavik so we didnât have time to go there, as well.

Labels are in Icelandic and English, and there are audio tours in other languages. The second floor skips rather quickly through Icelandic history since Protestantism, but, letâs be honest, most people come wanting more about Vikings.

There are a lot of really excellent textiles on display. There are some good texts too, but you probably wonât really get to see them because the lighting in the cases is very dim. Itâs one of the darkest exhibitions Iâve ever seen. While I understand the very real danger of light to old artifacts, especially textiles and paper, Iâve been to plenty of places like the British Library that have exhibited even older, more famous works more visibly. At the very least, the museum could include well-lit photos alongside the actual artifacts if people want to try to read them.

Iceland,Grant M,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"Most National Museums give you insights into the country youâre visiting, such as the excellent Museum on the Isle of Man I wrote about elsewhere.
A good deal of money has been spent on this Museum, although I suspect the building was not purpose built, but a converted (government) office block.
The exhibits start with the volcanic formation of Iceland itself, moving quickly to the arrival of exploring humans in the form of Vikings in the tenth century.
Apart from the volcanic activity one thing most people know about Iceland is that it was the site of the first representative Parliament, often rendered as the âAlltingâ.
There is little in the National Museum about this momentous innovation where all (free) men and some women were represented in an annual gathering where they could discuss their differences and, with any luck, solve their problems.
The bloody consequences of the failure of this mechanism are all too clear in the Sagas, those rough hewn accounts of battles small and large, with axes splitting heads and violent vengeance taken by both men and women against persons they felt had wronged them.
Some of this finds a way into the National Museum, with stern portraits of worthies of various eras.
Perhaps it is just not of interest, but another feature of Iceland is that men and women for centuries have enjoyed greater equality than in any other European places.
If a National Museum should expect to promote its country, such achievements should be highlighted.
Finally, the Museum shop offers a variety of good quality items at various price points: they also sell stamps.
I found the staff very helpful in my quest for a copy of a Medieval map of Iceland.
The city buses make access easy from wherever you are in Reykjavik.

It was a GREAT way to learn more about this beautiful country weâd been touring for three days. The exhibits were beautiful and some were interactive. We learned so much. Parking is free as well and the museum has nice clean restrooms and a good coffee shop. I highly recommend you stop here first before you head to the rest of Iceland! A 60 minute history lesson well worth the time.,Jun 2018

Iceland,Carol M,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one or two museums while Inn Reykjavik, this should be one of them! I was so impressed with this museum - the design and layout was well thought out and the displays were excellent.

While it is a little dark in some places, I realize it was for the protection of the artifacts.

An extremely thoughtful placement of foldable, portable seating was something I had never seen before - brilliant!

I was so glad we decided on visiting as we learned so much about this incredible country. While, yes, you can learn a lot by reading through articles on the internet, you can get a much better idea about what you are reading while looking at the actual object.

Iceland,D F,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"You need 2-3 hours to fully enjoy this remarkable museum. We were tight on time and only saw fraction of the exhibits. Lots of ""hands on"" experiences along the way. I did a ""rubbing"" in the horse saddle area (a great reminder of our brilliant vacation). Very educational; all exhibits are labelled in Icelandic and English; so take your time and enjoy.",Jun 2018

Iceland,Addaandi,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"The presentation of IcelandÂ´s history is very informative even if it is sparse.
Well thought and well constructed. you get a good insight in a small space.
The history is presented in chronological order with many artifacts.
The presentation shows the way of life and the many aspects of the day to day routine.
It is worth ones while to spend half a day there.",May 2018
Iceland,thbonnefond,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"I had a little difficulty finding the museum, because signage wasn't apparent. However, once I did find it I thoroughly enjoyed the museum. It is well laid out in chronological history and each exhibit was well marked and there are are several interactive displays. It is an easy walk from the heart of Reykjavik and you should allow a few hours for your visit.",Jun 2018

Iceland,Paul F,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed going through this museum. A great chronological history of human settlement of the island. We spent about 90 minutes here, read almost all the displays. I suppose you could spend another hour to soak it all in, or a bit less time and you would still come away with much more knowledge of the people of Iceland than when you started.",Jun 2018
Iceland,Jocelyne R,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"Such an interesting museum - a must for those who are interested in the history of Iceland, or for most visitors, for that matter. Yet, not too overwhelming. Avoid the cafeteria: they gave me a burnt bagel and a coldish soup.",May 2018
Iceland,jefftanner2002,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"I would have liked a bit more on the early history and relation to the sagas. The dress up booth was a lot of fun, but more costumes, and larger sizes are needed.
Nice layout. I appreciated that it offered a way to quickly identify the highlights as well as go into more depth.
The upper floor was nice, too. Would be good to balance the costumes and textiles with other types of artifacts and photos. And perhaps I missed it, but a bit of the history of Iceland during WWII would be interesting--like why so many buildings are made of corrugated aluminum siding.

But a great place to start our visit.

There is multimedia in several languages and nearly all signage is in English. Not just English labels, but full signage is available everywhere. On first look it seems expensive, but Iceland is really expensive, so compared with other entry fees I did not feel the entrance fee was prohibitive.",May 2018

The exhibits were good and there was enough for the boys to look at, even if I was surprised they were not more phased by the skeletons. There is an interactive kids room too which is good and we could have stayed longer.",May 2018

Iceland,CKT808,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"We chose to visit this museum when we could join a free guided tour. The tour group was small, and the guide was very informative. The exhibits are well organized, and the signs are all in English.

Iceland,smith1265,National Museum of Iceland,3.0,"I like museums on the whole but to be honest, I was looking forward to going here and I was disappointed. I liked the way it was set out in the various periods of time but I just found it a bit staid. It wasnât interactive to me and while I think that Icelandâs history is fascinating, the museum didnât bring that history alive to me.

There were plenty of exhibits to take in and lots of information too, almost too much for the brain! There is so much more of Icelandic history than Vikings (no pointy helmets).

It houses a large collection of artifacts and is well worth the few hours it takes to go through the building. Everything is carefully contextualized and brings you through the history of Iceland, from settlement to modern day, as you pass along from room to room.

Check the website because the museum offers *free* guided tours! Ours started at 11AM and lasts about an hour. Our tour guide was phenomenal! She was witty and funny and gave great insight into the history of the people. Itâs the best way to see the museum!

On another note the museum also offers *free* lockers to store your coat and purse and *free* wifi! You just need to ask the front for the password. Highly recommend!

The museum is not very big- two floors- but it has some really cool artifacts that trace the development of the Icelandic nation. The tour made it so much more entertaining as the guide was very knowledgable and crafted a narrative including specific artifacts on display. Admission is a bit steep- 2000- but if you walk in not knowing much (like me!) itâs worth it.
