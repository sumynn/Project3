Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"My husband and I visited the Perlan Museum - Wonders of Iceland and Aurora Northern Lights Planetarium Show and thought it was an interesting and educational way to experience a little bit of many aspects of Iceland's geology!

There are several floors of exhibits that showcase the nature and geology of Iceland. We really enjoyed the replica of the cliffs with the wildlife replicas such as the birds and the arctic fox. There was a taxidermy polar bear as well. We also enjoyed the volcanology videos and exhibits.

The ice caves were a lot of fun to explore, especially since we were visiting too early in the season to appreciate them ""in the wild.""

The planetarium show was very enjoyable and explained the science and mythology behind the auroras.

Masks were required when we visited. Because I wear glasses, it made it difficult to appreciate the exhibits because they kept fogging, especially in the chilly ice caves. It would definitely be a better experience post-pandemic.

The ticket prices were high-ish but not unexpected for this kind of museum. It's definitely worth a visit!

Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"This was our 5th trip to Iceland and we had always wondered what that structure was. This last trip we found out it was now an interactive museum with informative, interesting exhibits about Iceland and an ice cave to explore. There was also a zip line but we had not booked it. The people who were on it seemed to really be enjoying it! While it was just my husband and I this would be a great place to visit with children.",Oct 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,We spent several hours at Perlan on a downpour rainy day. All of the exhibits are very wonderful in nicely contrasting ways. I especially enjoyed the historic timeline exhibit after the planetarium show. Read every description and it really helped me learn the history of Iceland in a meaningful way. The Ice Cave lightens the mood and is very much fun! Memorable way to spend a dreary Icelandic day. Even the observatory deck was with it!,Oct 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Loved this place! Great basic information on volcanoes, northern lights, an ice cave, - all presented in a very entertaining and safe manner. Highly recommend",Oct 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,While in Reykjavik you have to visit the Perlan. On top of the information regarding Northern Lights it provides a very good and interesting overview of how Iceland was formed/created over the 10.000's of years. And do not forget to visit the ice cave while there!,Oct 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"This museum was fascinating - the planetarium was super. So was the ice tunnel. Displays were in English as well as Icelandic, which I appreciated. The view from the top floor was wonderful.",Sep 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"We really enjoyed the geological history of Iceland. This is a museum focused on how Iceland came into existence many many years ago, so be ready for some ready and thinking about the aspects on display. This might not be to everyone's tastes, but if it isn't your think, then go somewhere else. However, what is here is very good in my opinion.

The displays were clear, clean/new and very accessible in both Icelandic and English. The movie content was well shot, clear and enphasised the points it was supposed to.

The Aurora Northern Lights Planetarium show, which is just under 25 mins long is worth the extra money. Our only negative was some pushy Americans going in without paying. But the show itself was a joy to behold.

Like the rest of iceland, need to wrap up warm in this museum as after the first section you visit an artificial ice cave set in one of the water tanks, which we found to be a fun experience. The museum them moves into the forming of life around iceland, focussing on sea creatures and mammals.

This entire journey spirals you up a number of floors which leads you to the top of the museum where the restaurant is located. As we were there early it was lunch time at this point, but unfortunately the restaurant was closed for a funeral wake/gathering which was a shame, so instead of coffee we went to the ice cream shop instead... Ice cream in iceland .... I had a scoop of Turkish Black Pepper (sounds crazy, but imaging light liquorice and mint) and a scoop of raspberry, which was a delicious combination, and not as expensive as one might have expected when compared to countries like Italy. Finally if you want to get a amazing view of the Reykjavik skyline this is the place to do it, as you can walk a complete circle around restaurant on a terrace.

Arguably a little expensive, but what in Iceland isn't? but thoroughly enjoyable and a great way to spend 3-4 hours.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Ice cave is -10°C but short enough that you won't get too cold. Can be quite small in places. Aurora show is good, it will give you the urge to see the real thing. The wonders of Iceland exhibition provides educational displays on history, geology, natural history",Oct 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Ice cave Great experience,you got the feeling of being in an actual cave.Very well done plus the movie of the Northern Lights.You got to see them even if you could not see them in person.Also the view of the city awesome.This museum is a must do.",Oct 2021
Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"I walked to Perlan. It's a bit of a walk, but entirely possible. First, I enjoyed the planetarium show, which was quite impressive and focused on the aurora. Then I enjoyed the Wonders of Iceland exhibit. Finally, I went to the observatory to enjoy the views, but unfortunately, I could not see much in the mist.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"we visited the exhibition on our last day in Iceland. actually we did it because the weather was quite bad and we had to spend the time somehow. But we were really pleasantly surprised!
We did the complete tour with the northern-lights show (nicely done, absolutely great pictures and film-snippets ) and ice cave visit (careful - it's -10 degrees, but an unique experience).
Over the different floors we learned a lot about several topics like volcanos, ice, water, glaciers, global warming and animal life. Very fascinating and interesting. Highly recommended!
Also it is possible to do a zipline tour from the top, we didnt because of the weather.",Sep 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Miro made check today, Thursday, September 30th super easy and the Northern Lights show itself was extremely fascinating and informative. Miro handled sooo many customer requests while we were there and was courteous and kind to all. He juggled many requests and encouraged us to view the other exhibits including the volcano, ice cave, and glaciers. All added immensely to our experience at Perlan we send virtually a bouquet of flowers for Miro!!!

Iceland,Perlan,3.0,"It starts out by visiting the planetarian which emphasizes the Northern Lights. then you make your way into the museum itself which showcases the fauna of Iceland and the surrounding ocean. There taxonomy birds but the cliff birds are fake. The ice tunnel only allows visitors at timed intervals. The ice tunnel is a short walk. The ice cream shop upstairs had no available employee even though there was quite a few interested potential customers . It's major claim is the few of the city from the rooftop but you can get that from the Lutheran Church steeple. It's best feature is it's volcanic exhibit, really nicely done.
Take a cab or purchase a shuttle ticket that leaves hourly because it's really out of the way.
Really overblown with hype.

Iceland,Perlan,3.0,"Came here on a rainy day so visibility from viewing platform was poor. No option to exclude this from entry price.
Exhibitions on glaciers, volcanos etc were ok but expected more specialist insight given Iceland has more examples & able to do more research than other places. Didn't feel I got much new information.
Expected more interactive elements in the displays.
Aurora show was ok but spent a lot of time on background, auroras on other planets etc rather than showing actual displays from Iceland, which most people were probably more interested in.
Overall filled some time & kept me dry for a while on a rainy day but didn't feel it was worth the entry price & wouldn't recommend.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"I was worried this would be too focused on kids, but there was a ton of useful information. We spent almost 3 hours in the displays, and we enjoyed the Aurora show.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Four of us spent an afternoon going through the four floors of the museum. We learned a lot from the multiple exhibits. We had fun when going through the mock ""ice cave"". It's a nice place to start your visit to Iceland. And they have ice cream on the top floor !",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"The exploratorium is overwhelming in size and the various exhibitions. We did not have much time so we wandered around just peaking in here and there. It would have been worthwhile to explore the northern lights display for example. But we enjoyed the view of Reykjavik from the top floor and examined the various volcanic rocks on display there.
I loved the form of Perlan and the sculptures at the entrance.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,3.0,"OK show and the auditorium ""experience"" needs updating and a bit more. The ice cave walk hokey......",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"After moving around our schedule we managed to fit this in our first day. Not really knowing the layout of Reykjavik and time being of the essence we got a taxi from our hotel (Hotel Island) which as expected wasn't cheap (just under £20.00).

We paid entry which was around £26.00 per adult, so again not cheap, I'm sure you're noticing a pattern here.

The museum has a wide range of exhibits from how the country was formed and continues to change, an area about the wildlife of the country and the two highlights of the Ice Cave and the Planetarium video of the Northern Lights. Add in the view from the roof over Reykjavik and you have a good way to spend a few hours.

We didn't take in the zip wire, Ice Cream parlour or restaurant as we were off for a meal straight after.

This is a great place for all of the family with informative exhibits and interactive parts for those easily distracted. All in all another highlight in a city full of them.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"From films, to the ice cave, to Puffin birds, and volcano education this museum was just terrific and nicely done. We had a 360 view of the city from the observation deck with rainbows off in the distance over the harbor. The price may be higher than expected, but when you are done (including the Arora show) it is worth paying for it.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,We paid for the full Perlan museum and Arora show. The show was so good we watched it at the beginning and the end of our time at Perlan. The rest of the museum is really worth the price and seeing all that you enjoy in Iceland. We went here in the first couple of days and were glad we did as it gave insights of many places and geography that we were planning to see. This show is terrific and gives great insights to the Arora on other planets.,Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"The architecture is unique and inspiring. It feels grand there and seems like a concert/opera hall for a much larger city than Reikjavik. Go inside to look at the grand design and creativity. There are tours, but you'll need to plan ahead to join one. Only offered at limited times.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"It is a very interesting museum, more than expected. There is a geology section and a planetary. It also has a 360º view of city very nice to see if the day is clear",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"This was a great place to be on a rainy afternoon. My 6-year-old loves our local science museum and this was it x 100! The planetarium show, the interactive setups, the ice cave, the observatory deck, the rotating cafe where he enjoyed a cookie break... The technology involved in some of the exhibits was really slick. I don't think the usual family would spend more than three hours there, but it felt like we could have stayed longer because, once we reached the top, the little one wanted to revisit parts of the museum.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Amazing space. You can see the glass dome from far off even if you quite can't see how to get to it! There's several huge tanks that house the exhibition space, with the dome on top. Covers early geology and geological forces from millions to thousands to a thousand years ago as it relates to the formation of Iceland. Lots of screens, large and small, interspersed with sitting places. Lots of info on fauna and flora with life sized stuffed ones, including a polar bear who meandered off an ice floe onto the North of the island.

There's a brilliant Ice Cave you can go into and experience, doors are opened to that every 15 minutes or so.

There's a Planetarium that explains the formation of the Aurora. Very interesting, 25 minutes long (its under half an hour) in a good sized auditorium.

Top floor, 5th, lovely open space under the glass dome for refreshments, there's a café and a restaurant, bistro style rather than 'cheffy'. Spacious surroundings with fab views to linger in. There's Ice Cream Parlour on 4th floor, go all out and have 3 flavours for 990 isk, about £6 and try the black Turkish Pepper, very slightly liquorice-ish. The outside balcony is also on 4th floor, amazing 360° views over Reykjavik and the waterfront. And ...if you're so inclined you can jump a zip line from the 4 th too. From 2 pm in the afternoon, weekdays, suspect its earlier at the weekends.

The cost is 4490 isk, £26 for an adult, but you could spend the whole day there. Be aware, there are no lockers to store your things, but you can hang your coat up and hope for the best. You don't need to go to a tour company to book tickets, I stood in line for 2 minutes, mid-week.

Its been open 20 years, but it seems no thought has been given to arriving by foot and bus. Nearest bus stop is No.18 on main road, Bustaovegur, which is very difficult to cross (Aug '21). No bus actually calls in at Perlan! Unless you're on a tour. And, there's no straightforward way to Perlan from the bus stop, sort of meander in general direction thro bushes to find windy paths. Hmm.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Made a stop here on our way to the Sky Lagoon and we really enjoyed it. We went through the ice cave which was pretty fun and looked at all the different exhibits that they had on display. It was a nice overview on how Iceland came about and their history.

The observation deck was nice to get some pictures of Reykjavik and the surrounding area.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"The Perlan used to house the Saga Museum (now elsewhere) but has been transformed into an amazing educational venue that will keep you occupied. The ice cave was the highlight - several below freezing tunnels beneath the building. The different exhibits covered the glaciers, the water systems, the nesting cliffs amongst others. Looks expensive but is value for money. The aurora planetarium show (35mins) is excellent and allows all to see the impact of the Northern Lights even if it is the wrong time of the year!
Only thing missing - a gift shop!",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"We came here because one of our scheduled tours turned out to be not scheduled. Frustrated and unhappy, we came to the Perlan. It turned out we enjoyed the museum very much. It was big but not overwhelming. The exhibits were interesting, the ice cave was a lot of fun, and the photos of the vocanos were really beautiful. And the cafe at the top of the museuam had a 350 degree view of Reykjavik and was even rotating! It was a saved and enjoyable day.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"We went here on a day that was cold, windy and rainy. Nice escape. Best part was the ice cave. Other parts were interesting too and the top floor would have given a great view of the city if it wasn't raining and cloudy. Great ice-cream at their restaurant.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"It’s always worth a free visit to Perlan if you’re unfortunate enough to be in Reykjavik. Unfortunately the savoury buffet has been replaced by an extreme zip wire area, as it brings in more money (does look fun tho). We went to the top floor for drinks which is still nice, especially as it rotates slowly!

Nice toilets, disabled access throughout, free parking, great views",Aug 2021
Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"There is a planetarium, a walk-through ice cave, some interactive things to look at, and an outdoor zipline and bounce 'house' area. (these last 2 things were closed when we were there because it was raining) We ate upstairs--the food was good, but there was a long wait for it. (I did see others taking out food from their backpacks, though) I'm sure on a good weather day the views are amazing and the bounce house is fun for kids, but unfortunately we had neither. Otherwise, everything else was fine.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Did not visit inside the Perlan, but the surrounding forest was excellent for a fun hike and evening walk. Best of all, the forest surrounding the Perlan has some ""wild"" bunnies that inhabit the forest and they are HUGE! They are difficult to spot at first, but once you find them, you will be hooked on trying to find more of them. Completely free and a fun walk around the forest features birds, bunnies and many trails. A great place to picnic or enjoy the scenery next time you visit the Perlan.",May 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Nice museum. Interesting exhibits with both Islandic and English captions. Planetarium show was impressive with multiple video projectors seamlessly illuminating the dome. Show combined some science and some folklore about the northern lights. Walking through the ice cave was like being in a walk-in freezer. But notice the beautiful ice crystals on the ceiling (probably from exhaled moisture). Balcony provided a nice 360 degree view of the city. We had planned to eat lunch there, but the café was reserved for cruise passengers. We walked there from city center, but it was a little tricky because there were no signs. We saw everything we wanted to see in about 90 minutes.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"we spent a few good hours there. expensive but that's Iceland for you. the ice cave was a bit of a disappointment, it wasn't like a real ice cave, it was more like a little passageway with an ice throne. we were not well prepared for the cold so that;s probably why we didn't enjoy it that much. the exhibits are very well done and so packed with information. the restaurant upstairs had very comfy couches to rest on while eating your $6 croissant or $9 ice cream. lastly, the planetarium show was beautiful. I would have prefered to be immersed in Northern Lights or learned more about them then the silly narrative they gave instead.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"Like a gigantic 3D webpage you can dive in, click and find information in more depth on Iceland's geology, glaciers, fauna and flora. Planetarium (aurora borealis show), ice cave with -15° C and 360 view of the Reykjavik from the roof.",Jul 2021

Iceland,Perlan,4.0,"Exhibits were well done, covering glaciers, volcanoes, flora, and fauna. Signage wasn’t great so it was hard to tell in what order things should be viewed. Northern Lights planetarium show was good. Ice cave was meh. Museum seemed to be staffed by young people who weren’t very professional. We had a snack at the fourth floor cafe of delicious French fries and very salty mushroom soup (found out it was the last of the batch when we overheard it was sold out right after we ordered it) and the staff left our food siting on the pickup counter without buzzing the buzzer to let us know it was ready. The staff was too busy socializing with each other to pay attention. Some of the young staff were friendly though, especially the young lady with the black pug.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"I took the public bus to Perlan and did all three activities- the arora, the wonders of Iceland and the ice cave. They were all very well done and enjoyable. The arora was projected overhead, so it was like seeing the best of the real thing. The Wonders of Iceland includes a bird cliff and a volcanic crater; the seats shudder and shake like you’re in an earthquake. The ice cave is kind of small but it is cold and you can take pictures giving the impression to friends back home that you are hiking an ice cave. My friends back home could not tell from the photos that i didn’t get to see the real Arora, or stand near a real puffin bird cliff or hike an ice cave. Just the fake adventure photo ops were worth the price of admission.
Tip: don’t miss the ice cream bar on the top floor. Ice cream is free if you do all three activities.
Tip 2: it is a short uphill walk from the public bus stop to the museum. Maybe hard if you are a senior. Consider taking the free bus from Harpa Concert Hall instead which will drop you off right at the door. But check first to see if Harpa busses have resumed service.

Iceland,Perlan,5.0,"At first look before visiting, I did think the entry price a little high, even for Iceland... Nevertheless there was a sensibly reduced entry fee for ""Seniors"" that I had not seen on the Perlan booking website, or any of the booking sites that offer a reduced entry fee. (Buy the day ticket)
The Museum contains an array of High quality exhibits, with wraparound widescreen video content, interactive elements, and visual information, with supporting text in both Icelandic and English.
The Ice cave which the Kids will enjoy, is a must, as is the Planetarium showing, about the Northern Lights, which has supporting audio in both Icelandic on the hour, and in English on the half hour.
The higher levels at Perlan,allow access out onto the external viewing area, with great views of the surrounding area. At this level you will also fine tasty Ice Cream, don't miss it.
The highest level in the domed area has a nice restaurant and cafe, serving a nice array of food and drinks. Its an air conditioned area, and not too hot to say that you are under glass.
There is lift access to all floors, and there are various restrooms within the building.

But we ditched our Sat nav less than a 1 mile after we started and used Google Maps all the way around Iceland on and well off Route 1. It worked flawlessly and had we known we could have saved £80 on the Sat Nav rental.

The driving is easy, since there's little traffic, especially away from the south coast. It's perfect if you enjoy nature and crave quiet.

It was Interesting dealing with the hotel and restaurant staff, a mix of Icelanders and other young Europeans. We were fortunate to have made the acquaintance and friendship with a local who began his career at age seven in the herring trade and rose to become a member of parliament.

Our concerns were with safety and convenience. Masking was required, though a number of patrons didn't wear them, and we saw no signs in the public areas to remind them. Also, attendance was not limited to the 500 people that their email the day before said would be the maximum because of Covid. We estimated at least 700 in the orchestra section alone, and many were in the balconies.

In addition, we were mystified that no coat check was visible. We only found one very small rolling coat rack in the lobby areas.

Iceland,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,3.0,"This angular, geometric, box-like piece of modernism dominates the foreshore of Reykjavik.

Opened in 2011, its design was a collaboration between Danish-Icelandic artist Ólafur Elíasson, and the Danish firm Henning Larsen Architects.

The structure consists of a steel framework clad with geometric shaped glass panels of different colours, particularly shades of green, grey and blue. The design apparently was influenced by Iceland‘s exceptional and dramatic nature, particularly the greens and greys of the moss covered lava that covers a lot of the country. Situated on the boundary between land and sea, the building is a gleaming sculpture reflecting both sky and harbor, as well as the vibrant life of the city.

Inspired by basalt crystals, the faceted glass scatters reflections of the surrounding harbour and sky, and presents a glittering wall of light after dark.

I didn’t find the structure particularly beautiful, nor do I think it’s going to occupy a place in the world’s list of iconic cultural buildings in the same way that the likes of the Sydney Opera House does. But it is worth a peek inside. Whilst we didn’t visit the concert theatre, the vast foyer with light streaming in was quite lovely to see; the light streaming through the glass panels creates an interesting kaleidoscope of colour on the floor of this space. It’s even better from the balconies at higher levels. We didn’t take the cinema experience; it’s just too expensive for a short film about what’s on in Iceland, and seemed a bit gimmicky.

Great opportunity for some fantastic photographs of the center and the surrounding harbor.

But when we arrived there is a label on the door, saying that its closed for renovation for three weeks, until the 3rd of August. There is not a whole lot to actually see in the City, and this is one of the major attractants. So i'm just really surprised that they choose to close it during the season for a lot of turists.

Iceland,Black Sand Beach,4.0,"These comments relate to the the beautiful black beach right in Vík í Mýrdal, rather than the popular black sand beach of Reynisfjara Beach, which is a little further afield and not as easily as accessible.

Vik’s black beach is a beautiful spot. The sand is volcanic, pulverised lava. From the car park behind the small shopping mall, you’ll see a path which leads you down to stretch of black beach. It’s clearly signed. You can walk quite a distance along the black sand to the east. The silver-lined waves of the Atlantic Ocean wash across the volcanic black sand with tremendous power, so take care as you are walking. From this beach you will also spot the basalt sea stacks called Reynisdrangar just off the eastern shore. Legend has it that the sea stacks used to be trolls. They were pulling their ships to shore when they accidentally got caught in the light of dawn and turned into stone.

I don’t think you can walk to f Reynisfjara Beach directly from the beach at Vik. It’s accessible by Road 215 off Route 1 to the west of Vik.

It’s an extraordinary sight and a stop you should make time for if you are in, or passing through, Vik.

This is an amazing beach that is easily accessed from the town with car parking right at the edge of the beach.

Iceland,Black Sand Beach,5.0,"We stayed right up the very road (The Barn--cheapest place around) to get to this black beach which was very convenient. This is a popular tourist attraction and FREE! It also has a nice restaurant located there to take a break from exploring. Make sure to take a closer look within the arch to see the various type of rock formations to include shale on one side and columnar basalt on the other. The tourists visiting also seemed quite polite and made sure to get out of the way so folks could take a pic of the rock arch. Please be careful with the incoming waves--they can be quite deadly. If staying in the area, I recommend visiting off-peak hours since this is a bus tour stop. Also, there is light all night long in the summer so avoid the crowds!

Iceland,Kerid Crater,5.0,"Very beautiful crater that is easily accessible from the parking lot. There is a fee of 400ISK per person.

Almost no walking from the ticket booth before you get to an incredible view of the crater from the top. It was formed 6500 years ago so something special to see. The water is a lovely blue green colour with lovely tones of green and red around the inside of the crater walls.

You can walk down to the water's edge but the view from up top is fantastic as well. This is a quick and easy stop along the Golden Circle.

It was cool to see a volcanic crater in person. This is on a smaller scale than a place like Crater Lake but a lot easier to visualize because of it. It was incredibly windy so we didn't stay too long or drone.

I noticed some reviews mention drones are prohibited but that's incorrect. Drones are permitted at Kerid Crater, though I'm surprised when any can because it tends to be quite windy!

Iceland,Kerid Crater,4.0,"Another stop on our Golden Circle with Nice Travel. Unfortunately the weather at this stop was absolutely shocking so we sprinted from the car park the 50 or so metres to have a brief look and a photo before returning to the minibus absolutely drenched.

We only stayed at the top but apparently you can go down further towards the water, there is an entrance fee which is only a couple of pounds.

Iceland,Kerid Crater,5.0,"The best thing about this crater is it has steps down to the lake from the top (parking lot is located at the top of the crater). Along the top rim of the crater, the path is mostly wide and for those with a fear of heights, this is one of the few craters that can be navigated all the way around without turning back. There are one or two very short narrow sections, but overall, it is one of the widest rims you will find on a crater. There is a small entrance fee that is paid at a kiosk in the parking lot. Once you pay, you have the option of navigating around the rim of the crater or heading down the stairs to the lake at the bottom of the crater. If you do opt for the rim walk, and you aren't afraid of heights, you can get right up to the edge for some great pictures and breathtaking views. Otherwise, you can stay a safe distance from the edge and still enjoy the views. Extremely rare to find a create with a lake at the bottom. You can walk all the way around the lake at the bottom of the crater. The hike takes about 1/2 an hour. Well worth it for some great memories and some excellent pictures and outstanding views of Iceland.

Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,"Godafoss - small but perfectly formed and absolutely stunning.

Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,The Godafoss falls were very impressive. They reminded me of a mini Niagara Falls without the glitz.

Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,Beautiful and powerful waterfalls with lots of viewpoints and opportunities for great pictures! You can see the waterfalls from both sides. A must-do!,Aug 2021
Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,We visited twice in early July and found the Godafoss Waterfall to be the best one we saw during our 30-day trip around Iceland in a rental vehicle. Absolutely beautiful and easy to get to right off the Ring Road. I also love the lore that the pagan symbols and paperwork were thrown over the edge of the waterfalls around the year 1000 AD when the country decided to accept Christianity. You can view the waterfall from both sides. The trails from the parking area to the waterfall and paved and easy to maneuver for folks with mobility issues.,Jul 2021

Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,"Godafoss is an easily accessed waterfall if you are in the Akureyri area.

Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,"Yet another great waterfall in Iceland. This one is really easy to get to from a parking lot which makes it even better in my book. I think there were two sides that you could approach from, we parked on the east side. Just off the 1 so you can't miss, and shouldn't.",May 2021
Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,"Another one that is worth seeing. The walk has a few different paths which are all good to take. Also walk down to the pedestrian bridge and explore. One path allows you to go right to the bottom of this powerful waterfall.
Highly recommended.",Jun 2021

Iceland,Godafoss,4.0,"Conveniently located just off Hwy 1 between Akureyri and Myvatn, this spectacular waterfall shows the true power of the Iceland river system. Well worth the 1/2 hour stop. You can visit the falls from either side of the river--both give the same great impression. The gift shop located nearby is nice, too.",Jun 2021
Iceland,Godafoss,5.0,It’s not the most impressive waterfall I have seen in Iceland at all. But I love it because it’s so accessible and you can visit both sides and get really close to it from bottom too. Since it’s on the ring road no detour is needed. We used around 45 min in total but even with 15 min you can manage to see one side and get a picture if you are in a hurry. For people who had a hard time walking this is probably one of the easiest waterfalls to see.,May 2021

Church itself is also stunning inside.,Oct 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"This cathedral is visible from all over Reykjavik. Up close its quite an austere building and inside its very plain and unlike most of the cathedrals in continental Europe. The organ however is beautiful. there is very little stained glass in the cathedral.

We didn't go up the tower but I understand the views over Reykjavik are great.

An easy walk up from the centre of town and worth a visit.",Oct 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,As if the exterior architecture is not awe-inspiring enough... then experienced the awe of the interior of the cathedral. OMG! We arrived a bit before noon.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Hallgrimskirkja Cathedral is a beautiful building designed to resemble the nature of Iceland (waterfalls and basalt columns).

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"Impressive building and great views. Certainly worth a visit to take pictures from the outside, as well as taking a quick walk through to experience the organ inside as well as the architecture.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Imposing and architecturally beautiful church with a magnificent organ which was being played while we visited. Internal architecture is simple but elegant with one piece of stunning stained glass.
What was Most impressive was the fact that the seating can be rotated back for an organ concert as the organ is at the back of the church!",Sep 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"A very unique exterior design. Inside was nice but not particularly interesting as far as churches go, although the pipe organ was huge and half the pews were facing one direction, the other half faced the opposite. We did not climb the tower, which requires a fee. If you like seeing churches or architecture definite give this one a look. It doesn’t have to take long.",Sep 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,When we arrived it was Sunday so we weren’t allowed in because of church services which I totally understand. Was able to get back a few days later to view the interior. Simple church.,Sep 2021

Will certainly pay it a proper visit should we be back in Reykjavik again.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"It would be difficult to visit Reykjavik and NOT see this spectular building. Both inside and out, the architecture is really interesting!",Sep 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,2.0,"A more friendly welcome would be nice.

This is a splendid church with a stunning pipe organ at the west end, but it is let down by a less than welcoming warden/verger and not allowing access to its many toilets.

Warden/verger: no 'hello', 'welcome', 'nice to see you', just 'if you come inside do not wheel your suitcase over the tiles'. No 'please' or 'thank you', not a hint of a smile.

Toilets: I am fairly sure there are 4 or 5 toilets at the west end but they are always locked and the red lights on. Not much of a welcome for visitors, where are they supposed to go to find facilities?

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"Nice clean relatively new church. Not fancy nor highly decorated but is the tallest building in old town/downtown Reykjavik. I recommend paying to take the lift unto the top for the lookout views of the city.
Loved Lief Erickson statue in front of the church.
The street leading uphill to the church is permanently paved with the gay pride rainbow symbolizing Icelands history of love and tolerance. The street is lined with plenty of shops and eateries for the tourist.
Eat at Lokki's across the street from the church.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"Beautiful spot if you like modern architecture.

It is an emblematic point of the city and can be seen from the sea.
Facilities: lockers and shop",Sep 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"Honestly it was underwhelming. It is the most architecturally interesting thing in Reykjavik, but really it was not overly impressive otherwise. The organ inside is cool, but the church is not elaborately made or decorated inside. We did not ride to the top in the lift, but we decided that paying ~£8 to see a grey and rainy Reykjavik from above wasn't worth it; we'd also read reviews that the view from Perlan was much better (which I can say was quite a good view).",Sep 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"For me, the best thing about this church is the outside as well as the view if you go to the top. The inside is a little plain.",Sep 2021

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Is it a thing of beauty, or a monstrosity? You decide, though you’ll have to visit to make that decision. Love it or hate it, Hallgrímskirkja is certainly an intriguing structure, unlike any other in the country, and it is Reykjavik’s iconic landmark. I think it's a fabulous spot to visit, though it does help to understand its construction and the ideas behind it.

Towering to around 74.5 meters, Hallgrimskirkja is the tallest building in Reykjavik. And perched atop the gentle Skólavörðuholt hill in downtown Reykjavik, it literally looms over the historic centre of the city. You can see the church steeple reaching into the sky from wherever you are in the city. It stands guard over the city and is impossible to miss. And it is an absolute ‘must see’ if you are in Reykjavik.

The church was designed by Guðjón Samúelsson, the state architect of Iceland at the time. Construction didn’t begin until 1945 and wasn’t completed until the mid-1980s. Its stepped concrete facade is certainly an ode to modernism. His vision was, apparently, to create a building that took its inspiration from the mountains and glaciers that provide the picturesque backdrop to the city. He was particularly inspired by the country’s volcanos, and the sides of the building were designed to resemble columns of volcanic basalt rock. I personally think it most resembles the basalt columns around Svartifoss waterfall. If you’ve had the opportunity to visit this waterfall you’ll know what I mean.

It’s a Lutheran church, and not a cathedral. It’s free to visit, and open from 10:00 each day. As you step inside, you’ll probably be taken aback by the extremely plain yet striking interior, with its high ceilings, simple windows and the lack of adornment with religious icons and paraphernalia. And that simplicity creates its sublime beauty. Your eyes will also be drawn to the huge 15 metre-tall pipe organ, built with an amazing 5,275 pipes and installed in 1992. Its sound is hauntingly beautiful.

For a modest fee you can take the lift up to the tower, to the level of the clock face. It provided the best panoramic views of the city from the observation deck at around 73 metres high. Visit on a sunny day, as we did, and the colours of the city, sea, mountains and sky will take your breath away.The tower costs 1,000 ISK. You can stay as long as you want.

It's a wonderful and intriguing landmark to visit.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"There are great views of Reykjavik that can be seen from the tower for a small fee and a short elevator ride. I recommend taking the time.
The Lutheran church has a gray stone exterior meant to resemble the trap rocks, mountains and glaciers of Iceland.
The interior of the church is beautiful, yet simple, with a gorgeous pipe organ.
Out in front of the church there is a statue of the explorer - Leif Erikson.
This statue predates the church. It was a gift from the USA in honor of the 1930 Althing Millenial Festival, commemorating the 1000th anniversary of the convening of Iceland's parliament at Pingvellir in 930 AD. (Another great place to visit).

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"This is not the Reykjavik Cathedral, but just a large Luthern church on the hill. The outside was as intriguing as the pipe organ inside. Warning, when you take the elevator to the bell tower you will here the bells ring every 15 minutes. The view is stunning. You must buy a ticket in the church gift shop. As a bonus there are many blades/scooters to rent before or after your visit. The church is next to a free outdoor sculpture garden, the local swimming pool, and Cafe Loki.
There are summer concerts. Church service is held in English once a month. A long tube near the tube asks for donations for maintenance of the grand pipe organ.",Aug 2021

Pay the ticket (~$8) to take the elevator up the tower for 360 degree views of Reykjavik. Be sure to walk all around the outside of the building to admire the architecture as well. There are several restaurants within stone's throw of the church and a few benches in the tiny park outside so feel free to grab a snack/lunch and sit down to take in the view.,Aug 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"What a beautiful landmark Lutheran Church! Like many things in Iceland, it’s unusual . The structure is very unique in its height, structure, and style. It’s a perfect landmark to pick out throughout Reykjavik.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"The church is a massive landmark and its impressive concrete size can be seen from afar. The exterior resembles basaltic columns seen in its natural state elsewhere on Iceland. The interior is simplistic and comforting. Nothing but an large 5275-pipe organ can divert your mind if you like to meditate. We did not take the elevator up to 74.5m top floor as we had seen Reykjavik in every direction from Perlan. I was impressed by the church benches that could be turned around to face the altar or the other way if a concert was to take place.
The well known Icelandic architect, Guthjon Samuelsson (1887-1950) died before the completion of the church in 1986.
In front of the church is a statue of the Viking Leif Eiriksson, the first European to discover America. Apparently this statue was a gift from North America.
Being in Reykjavik one cannot miss the church. It is definitely worth a visit.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Perched on the top of the city's high point, this massive concrete structure invites several puzzling questions. Why so many stories? Why so massive?",Aug 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Took 40 years to build. Impressive concrete design. Feels quite serene inside, uncluttered and minimalist, Lutheran style I guess. There is one stained glass window on left hand side of the altar and another near the entrance. However, the tall, plain glass windows absolutely add to the serenity of the place.

There's a lovely font in front of the altar area. It looks so Icelandic, so fitting. I like to think it's made of crystalline, but I don't suppose it is. But it is a lovely font.

There's 2 organs, maybe one for every day use and an enormous one at the entrance, for special occasions. It'd be interesting to attend a recital or be lucky enough to hear someone practising!

You can light a candle, more like a nightlight, for a small donation, on left hand side as you leave.

It's worth a visit even if you're not into cathedrals and churches.

We were lucky that the sun had peeked out just as we arrived at the church making for some much better photos from the tower. The church itself is impressive from the outside obviously, but nothing special on the inside.",Aug 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"This beautiful church offers amazing views of Reykjavik from the tower. It is worth the price to go up. We spent much more time here than we had planned, as there was an organ player and we sat for quite a while.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"The church has two things to offer: A high level 360degree view of Reykjavik and a lovely, simple, elegant church interior. Cost us $8 apiece to take the elevator to the top level; it was worth it. On a day with good visibility a large area can be seen.

There are many shops and restaurants in the church area.",Jul 2021

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,This church is so beautiful! I've been to a lot of churches in Europe and this one is so unique! It wasn't very busy. There's a gift shop where you can buy souvenirs and tickets to go to the top of the church. The top has such a great view. You take an elevator up and then there are about two flights of stairs to get to the top where the viewing area is. I loved it and definitely recommend if your downtown.,Jul 2021

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,obviously this is a do not miss attraction. stunning architecture with a fantastic pipe organ inside. we were treated to a few minutes of music and it was wonderful. the view from the top is skippable. ($8 not worth it),Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,1.0,"Like all things in Iceland, overrated. Save your money. Skip this, totally useless. Avoid like the plague.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Pro tip - it's usually crawling with tourists outside, so if you want to get a photo with it, go early in the morning (we were there at 7:30am on a Saturday and there was no one around). We didn't have the chance to go inside but it was definitely worth a stop for some cool photos, particularly if you can walk to the nearby rainbow road and get a photo of the church at the top of the street.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"If it is a sunny day and you wish to see the beauty of Reykjavik at a high distance, this is the attraction for you!

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"Quite austere compared to many other European churches.. Was a short walk from our hotel, so we headed over. But, was a quick visit for us. Too cloudy and rainy to go up to the top of the bell tower (wasn't worth the time or $).

It is impressive in size and design, so worth a visit (even if it's short)",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"This church is one of the more popular attractions in Reykjavík for a reason. You can read about its history online or in a guidebook, so I’ll just add to make sure to go up into the clocktower. It’s worth the money (I don’t recall how much, maybe around $8-10 USD per adult?) to catch what I understand to be the only 360 degree, birdseye view of the entire city. Accessible by elevator to a couple of stories below the tip top, but you do have to climb a couple of flights to get to the very top. Not too onerous.",Jul 2021

There is a striking Viking statue at the front and a vibrant cafe and shop filled road which leads down to the center of the city.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,"The interior of the church is quite something (and free!).

As for the observation tower... not worth the 1000 ISK per person in our opinion. You don't get quite as much of a panoramic view, but just peer out of five or so small windows on each side. Pay a bit extra for the Perlan museum and its panoramic deck.",Jul 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Far better in real life than on the pictures, this church dominates Reykjavik and can literally be seen from many kms away.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"I was left a bit disappointed at the church. The view from the top is beautiful, but, if you are on a time crunch, the Perlan would probably be a better view. Downstairs, the organ is absolutely stunning, but that is about the only thing that I found extraordinary.",Jun 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,3.0,"This was neat to see, but we would have been okay if we didn't see it either.

Can see a windy, chilly view of the area after a brief elevator ride. Gift store was nice with magnets, stamps, ornaments, books, postcards with stamps, and more.

Quick trip as part of our stroll down town, but not at the top of list for best things to see and do in Iceland.",Jun 2021
Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"This stunning landmark not only helped me navigate around the city, but the views from the tower are stunning!

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,5.0,"Beautiful church that also functions as a great marker of your location in Reykjavik. Visible from just about anywhere around Reykjavik, you can always find your location in relation to this church. Outside, the design of the church is excellent and it is much larger in person than you would expect from photos. The church was closed, but was still worth a visit just to see the architecture on the outside. In front of the church is the Leifur Eiriksson Statue. Some great pictures can be taken around this church and statue. Don't miss the fun metal sculpture located right across the street by the Einar Jonsson garden. You can line up your camera with the sculpture and the church and see how close you get! Best of all, viewing this incredible landmark from the outside is completely free.

Iceland,Hallgrimskirkja,4.0,You can’t miss this tall imposing landmark that dominates the city and will certainly find yourself taking photos of it as a way to remember your visit. While the inside isn’t anything to write home about-empty and austere-it’s definitely worth paying the small fee to go up into the bell tower. The fast elevator takes you up 8 stories for great views of the city-especially if you are lucky enough to catch a break in the un predictable weather. We were visiting in early June shortly after vaccinated travelers were once again able to visit Iceland and had the tower all to ourselves on a blustery Friday afternoon. The wind was something else up too so come prepared.,Jun 2021

So impressive that Reykjavik has procured this extraordinary collection and presented all in such a meaningful manner.,Oct 2021

Iceland,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"We arrived here without booking a tour and in hindsight a guided tour would have given us a much better insight into the displays. Saying that we still had a good couple of hours here exploring the exhibits, with each area showing different modern ages of Iceland from 800's up to the 2000's.

With a low entry fee for Iceland of around £12.00 for an adult, it is well worth a visit if you are spending more than a couple of days here and a good way to spend two hours. I still preferred the more interactive displays of Perlan, but if you can do both it is worth it.",Jul 2021

Iceland,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"What an excellent museum. It covers from the Settlement period and through the many changes of religion and government. Very interesting, learnt a lot.

There's an audio guide for some of the numbered plaques, but not all. So you do need to read plaques aswell. Spread over 2 floors, There's loads to see and read. The lighting on some exhibits did make it difficult to see some. And the numbering is somewhat idiosyncratic as you criss cross the room or back track slightly. No ear phones are supplied, sensibly for Covid reasons. Some folk played their audio rather too loud, without any thought of others, which was disconcerting if you're trying to read or listen to a different one.
Tip: take your own earphones.

Usefully, you can leave your coat and bag in a locker at no extra charge. Photography without flash is allowed. A brilliant visit.

Iceland,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,A worthwhile 2 hour visit. the museum is broken down by years starting with the 800s when Iceland was first populated. Most interesting was reading about how many people died by the plagues and volcanic eruptions. Iceland population would be at least triple if these did no occur. They had a convincing argument that Leif Ericksen rather than Columbus discovered North America.,Jul 2021

I would highly recommend a visit,",Jul 2021
Iceland,National Museum of Iceland,4.0,"Quite reasonably priced, about $20 per head, esp compared to other museums, and a fantastic collection of artefacts and explanations. Could easily take 3 hours to go through very interesting history. Cafe was limited (not fine dining).",Jul 2021

Great overview of Iceland's history, from the first history to today. Easy logical layout, chronological in two floors. You could spend hours or 30 minutes, depending on how in depth you want to go. Would advise going to this museum before going to the Settlement Museum, so you have a better understanding what you are seeing (lesson learned!).",Jul 2021

Iceland,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"The chronological arrangement gives you an understanding of how the interplay of migration, the brutal terrain and climate, and religion led to the Iceland you experience as a visitor. There isn’t any “prehistory” but there are artifacts, and the country’s colonists were colonized by Norwegian and Danish kings. Life and the economy were poor.",Jun 2021
Iceland,National Museum of Iceland,5.0,"An amazing collection of historic artifacts from Iceland are on exhibit at this museum. The museum is in pristine condition and is laid out in a very friendly and easy-to-follow path. The museum starts at the oldest history known to Iceland and then moves in chronological order throughout the exhibits. There are two floors in the museum. Of course everything on exhibit is explained in detail so you know what you are seeing. From this museum you can see the importance of texts and books in the history of Iceland and many, many old manuscripts, books and documents are on display. If you take the time to enjoy the exhibits, you will need 2-3 hours or more. The reward at the end of the museum is the airport luggage turnstile that has artifacts from the past century - a pop-culture of collectibles from each decade. Very fun to look at those items and see how many you had and how many things were not just popular in Iceland, but around the world as well. One of the most fun and interesting historical museums that you will visit. Don't miss it!
