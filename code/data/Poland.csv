Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"The journey is nearly over and as I sit here outside with a beer I am reflecting on a fantastic week that totally took me by surprise.
From karaoke on Monday night, a first, to Zakapone Alpine resort, a first to Michelin restaurants.
Krakow is truly amazing and spectacular, from its historic building to its beautiful parks, its Cobble stone Street, its food , its night life, the list could go on.
For the last three nights I have been paddling solo and what stricks me the most is just how safe I feel walking at night albeit my accommodation is 2mins from the main square. No matter what time be it early evening or the wee hrs I have felt so safe and relaxed one of the few cities which affords that.
Krakow is just simply amazing, I have totally fallen in love with it and am planning my next visit already.
I would really really encourage everyone to visit here , guaranteed you will not be disappointed and with easy access from Shannon & easy access from the airport here to the city it would be fool hardy , I believe not to get excited, get booking & get traveling.
Krakow awaits to embrace you , her gems wait to embrace you & her heart waits to embrace you.
It's yours for the taking.

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,5.0,"Big, majestic, beautiful, lots of restaurants, pubs, cafes, churches, little boutiques; perfect for a summer weekend od Christmas Market adventure",Aug 2021
Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,5.0,"The Market Square of Wrocław is definitely worth a visit. It's in fact my favourite place to go to when I'm in the city. Most buildings in this area are picturesque and have some sort of an interesting background story. There are plenty of good restaurants and stores selling memorabilias. You can sightsee the Market Square by strolling along, riding a bike or an electric scooter, or going on a horse ride. There are many ways to explore this gorgeous piece of the city.
However, I have to agree with the comments I've seen about the beggars - they make for one of the biggest downsides of the experience. Over the years the amount has awfully increased. Just as at the beginning you could ignore and walk past them, they've recently become more pushy than ever before. From time to time they even approach people while they're having dinner outdoors at a restaurant, so beware of this. Keep your belongings close and steer clear of sketchy individuals as much as possible - as soon as you spot one walking around with a rose in their hand, go the opposite way or any other that might have you avoid a possibly unfortunate situation.
While a lot gave the attraction 4⭐️ for the issue previously mentioned, I don't have the heart to give it less than 5⭐️. It's just such a pretty place.

Poland,Giewont Mountain,5.0,"Beautiful mountain with great views.

There are four routes to the area just below the summit and some are considered easier than others.

You will have to queue up the the summit however the wait is not too long and the queue moves along at a decent pace.

The queue down took longer and was made worse by people who clearly were too important to wait. But maybe that's just me being English :-)
We do love good queue etiquette!

A great day overall, and well worth the effort.
