Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"Definetly worth a visit, but note that you do need to book the underground museum. The square is lovely and surrounded by cafes and bars. We were so lucky to sit in the sun enjoying a beer and vino. Also great to hear the trumpeter every hour, find out the legend about him on a free walking tour. Just a great place to chill and people watch and drink alcohol or coffee or soft drinks.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"The square itself is surrounded by beautiful buildings and architecture, as well as great restaurants and bars. A concern is the welfare of the horses who are made to pull carriages full of tourists, some of them obviously looked in pain and unwell. Please do avoid the lady in traditional red Polish dress on the square, who will demand you take a picture with her, and will swear at you and demand money. Incredibly rude.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"This is one of the most gorgeous places to visit in Europe. The massive square has some impressive buildings and a lot of history and the outer edge is surrounded with cafes and bars. Being Europe, this doesn't mean noisy, drunken morons but people out for food, coffee and a social time. There are families out together and the whole area is very safe, especially as there is a tourist police station there. Horse drawn carriages will take you on a tour of the old city and the area is incredibly clean. In the early morning the square is almost empty other than cleaners so it is a lovely time for photos.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"The journey is nearly over and as I sit here outside with a beer I am reflecting on a fantastic week that totally took me by surprise.
From karaoke on Monday night, a first, to Zakapone Alpine resort, a first to Michelin restaurants.
Krakow is truly amazing and spectacular, from its historic building to its beautiful parks, its Cobble stone Street, its food , its night life, the list could go on.
For the last three nights I have been paddling solo and what stricks me the most is just how safe I feel walking at night albeit my accommodation is 2mins from the main square. No matter what time be it early evening or the wee hrs I have felt so safe and relaxed one of the few cities which affords that.
Krakow is just simply amazing, I have totally fallen in love with it and am planning my next visit already.
I would really really encourage everyone to visit here , guaranteed you will not be disappointed and with easy access from Shannon & easy access from the airport here to the city it would be fool hardy , I believe not to get excited, get booking & get traveling.
Krakow awaits to embrace you , her gems wait to embrace you & her heart waits to embrace you.
It's yours for the taking.

There is lots of stuff to do on the square - the old town hall clock tower, St. Mary's Basilica, and other museums. There are also lots of restaurants.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,4.0,"An impressive huge rectangular shaped square in the center of Krakow's old town, is not be missed. It is larger than market places in older Polish cities such as Warsaw, Poznan or even Wroclaw. The square is dominated by the historic market building in the middle flanked by the old town hall tower (city hall itself was never rebuilt), while the church of Saint Mary with its two colossal towers is another eye catcher.

Most buildings surrounding the square have facades in neoclassical style and date from the late 19th century. They are less exquisite than the ones in Gdansk or especially Wroclaw, another old city center that escaped WOII destruction. Probably because Krakow's heydays in the 1500s are further away in history. Remnants of medieval Krakow are underground and can be seen under the market hall (section of central museum).

The dynamics of the square have been significantly affected by mass tourism, as most businesses are geared to tourists, a trend also visible in cities like Venice, Prague or Amsterdam. When I visited in October 2020 most tourists were Polish and there were demonstrations by LGBT activists. All contributing to an authentic Polish experience.

A lot of the restaurants sold the same food, breakfast specials, lunch specials which were a really reasonable price, great value for money as was the alcohol, alcohol being cheaper than some soft drinks and juices. In the square there are horse and carriages that take you around the square and round abit of the town, we paid 250 zloty (£50) for a 30 minute ride around, it was a beautiful day so didn’t barter with the kind lady.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"Rynek Glowny is the central square in Old Krakow and is a fascinating place to visit. Restaurants and shops are plentiful and the Cloth Hall in the centre of the square is a 'must do' - Another nice feature is the underground museum. Entry is by timed ticket only; these can be obtained from the tourist information office in the middle* of the Cloth Hall (*it's on the outside on the face furthest from the big church - St Mary's Basilica). The tickets are free too, which is a bonus.
You can also look for and listen to the bugle call from the largest tower of the basilica, just after the hour has been struck on the church bells. The bugler can be seen in one of the windows at the very top of the tower. He uses the windows on the angle, rather than the face, of the tower, and always gives a wave to the people on the square.
From 09:00 to about 23:00 the top of the square is thronged with horse drawn landaus, or Cinderella coaches if you prefer a more romantic description.
Rynek Glowny is an unavoidable 'must see' - you'll enjoy it too.

Shops are open until 8pm, some until 1000. It’s almost magical. The trumpeter plays from the tower every hour, horse drawn carriages are everywhere. It’s a must if you are in Kraków.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"This is a fantastic square, one of the best I have ever seen in a city. It is beautifully lit up in the evening and the amount of restaurants there mean there is something for everyones tastes. The horse drawn carriages are elaborately decorated and parade around the square and off into the nearby streets before returning to the square again. A nice way to travel. The mall in the middle is a wonderful building and if you look up at the church there you will see and hear a trumpeter out of one of the very top windows who plays on the hour, every hour. Even though it was cold there, all the restaurants have covered outside seating with large gas flames to keep you warm. Would highly recommend visiting here.

Saw amon goeths house which has been spoilt as bought and modernised should have been restored as it was what an insult. At plazow saw the grey house and walked around the camp with michael our guide who was passionate about the place. It is amazing that auschwitz is publicised but plazow has been left to detoriate and people walk there with there dogs and young students drink there as though nothing ever happened. Poland you should be ashamed and remind your young people what happened in that place. Michael has great respect for what happened and i hope he gets his wish to get plazow recognised for what it is and not just a place like a park. Keep trying michael and the man who keeps the jews graves tidy xx

The architecture of the buildings is quite stunning and there are lots of good photo opportunities to take.

There are also horse and carriage rides in the main square that go to some local landmarks and back to the square again. A 25 minute there and back ride costs about 200PLN or around £39 in GBP. Worth it for the experience.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,5.0,"When I was younger thinking about Eastern Europe was impossible. Everything related to the ""eastern block"" made me think about those dark ages of Stalin's Russia.

Past few years I traveled to Moscow, St. Petersburg.....and now Krakow. These visits made me change my mind completely.

I found out that east Europe countries are more friendly and cosier than western. Also, people are warm.

Krakow was my destination in December 2019. I was there for business for 6 days but managed to find some free time to explore the city in the late afternoon and night.

It's a modern city with old town in center and fortress that rises in the core of it. Whole city is pretty flat so this old fortress allow you to se panorama of the city. Besides that there's old cathedral with relics od Pope John Paul II and his bist in front of it.

Lots of nice and cozy restaurants and pubs with cheap drinks and local food allows you to enjoy it even more.

As for the public transport, you can use trams, busses or Uber.

I didn't have time to visit Aushwits and salt mine Wieliczka (wintwe working hours are shorter and I didn't have time to get there)so I'll definitely have to come back.

Poland,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,1.0,"Unfortunately these Christmas markets were a disappointment. Krakow is a beautiful city and the setting is nice however for me the fact that all the food stalls weigh your food in order to price it based on per 100g is a real shame. It seems that all Christmas markets across Europe are becoming the same. Charging ridiculously expensive prices for food and Christmassy activities, leaves one feeling extremely disappointed in humanity, taking away the true nature of Christmas and what it is supposed to represent. Nice to walk through but you’ll find good food for a fraction of the cost in the restaurants surrounding the square.

Sit around the Rynek, sip a drink, listen to the hejnal and soak in the atmosphere, as the world passes by. After nearly 50 trips to Krakow I was able to go to the top of the taller tower of St. Mary ‘s Church to see and visit the trumpeter.

Poland was divided, invided somany times and last time secodn wold war when was invaded by Nazi and on those occupied territories NAzi build concentration camps for exterminating Jewish and Polish population.

The architecture has similarities to other central squares around Europe, but with it's own individual quirks- such as the Basilika with mismatched towers, and the hourly sounding, abruptly finishing trumpeter!
Just strolling around the square is a delight, as is wandering through the Cloth Hall gallery of stalls and, of course, sitting on a cafe terrace watching the spectacle. I loved the beautiful horses and carriages and the unusual flower arrangements used by stallholders.
The pigeons are,of course, very well fed and well tolerated residents!

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,5.0,"This is the most popular site-seeing spot in Warsaw, a real must! Fantastically located on two levels of terrain and on the slope between them. It is actually an English garden with several-hundert years old trees, artificial lakes and cannals, picturesque “Palace on the water” (the residence of the last Polish king) and all the historical buildings beautifully composed into the terrain and park, delivering many spots of an unusual beauty (for example: a magnificient view from the bridge on the channel on the lake and a slope crowned with classical Belweder building). All this makes Łazienki a natural destination for all the first-time visitors to Warsaw and a perfect leasure place for the people living here. In my opinion, its perfect for a nice one-hour-stroll or if you have more time, just take a seat on one of the benches and imagine yourself the 18th century king playing cards or just having a walk. You may also consider entering Palace on the Water - a museum. If you are interested in the Polish history there is a lot to learn here if not just enjoy!

The park is massive and you could easily spend a few hours just walking the trails, but I recommend at least heading up the hill (it's a little bit of a climb) to the Chopin statue.

And that is the problem #1: there is not a single drinking fountain in park. The remedy: bring big bottle of water.

However, the second problem is much worse: there is a couple of porta-potty in the park, in a condition that makes me sick just remembering them. They were just horrible. We had no choice but to hold our physiological urges until we returned to hotel.

The challenge to city top management: personally inspect and use the portable toilets. I am sure they will realize how embarrassing to the city the situation is, and will do something about that.

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,4.0,"We went on a clear blue, sunny Sunday to see the free Chopin concert. This is well worth seeing, and the park itself is beautiful. It's big enough for you to find secluded spots, whether in the shade or the open, and lots of busy spots as well if you prefer that. The palaces on sight are also well worth seeing given they are so cheap to get into. Just don't expect a lot of information on display.

The one thing which put a dampener on our day was the utterly bizarre situation with the toilets. We found the first lot, and after queueing for around 10 mins, finally got sorted. Nature called again several hours later, when we were at another part of the park. This should be easy...right? We went to where the toilets were located on the park map, only to arrive in what appeared to be an empty kindergarten, staffed by one person who told us that these toilets were for children only. When we enquired if we could use them on account of there being no children actually in the facility, we were again turned away.

This time we were sent in the direction of toilets near the central palace on the lake. I say toilets, but I really shouldn't use the plural. It was a single toilet, and a disabled one at that. The queue stretched out the door. Not to be discouraged, we noted on the park map there was another set of toilets around a 5 minute walk away. Bladders calling out to us, we eagerly marched there. The female toilets were working fine and the queue was acceptable...the male toilets were closed. Fortunately, the women were happy to share the facilities, understanding that the idea of there being only four cubicles in the entire park for men to use was utterly ridiculous.

Unfortunately, like Warsaw in general, there's work to be done to make this park more tourist friendly. But it's still well worth a visit.

It's lost none of its lustre in the past 17 years, if anything the place is even more beautiful than I remember.
It's just wonderful for a stroll. Obviously the Palace and lake are centerpieces as is the Belvedere but the real joy of Lazienki is just to stroll around and enjoy it.

Beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean my visit to the park was a highlight of my trip. Wide paths, which just invited you to follow and discover the next area.

The palace and large ponds a focal point and therefore a bit busy with people taking full advantage of the photo opportunities.

We were lucky enough to see a lot of squirrels which just added to the charm.

If your going to stay a while then bring something to drink and eat as there are limited places to grab a snack or drink.

You can get public transport from the city but uber was so cheap I would suggest getting one.

A word of warning about the bus network, you need to buy a ticket before entering the bus or buy with credit card. I did not know this and tried to buy a ticket on board with cash. I couldn't and within minutes the bus stopped (between stops) and two 'ticket inspectors' boarded

I went to them to buy a ticket and they not only made me get off the bus but fined us 300plź! I explained that there was no ticket machine at the stop, nor any instructions.

They didn't care and said it was my responsibility to know the system. I asked them to show me either online an explanation (as I had checked) they couldn't. On checking later it seems that honest tourists making a mistake are treated the same as people knowingly cheating.

I've been to so many countries and normally try and use public transport and I have never had this happen in such a harsh manner. They refused to show me how to use the machine with my credit card. This was 2minutes travel and less than one stop in distance.

I've decided to uber for the rest of my visit.

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,5.0,"Located a few kilometres south of the old town and easily accessed by either bus or tram is this enormous park. It contains kilometres of well maintained paths that will take you between formal gardens and more informal lawns and trees. There are also numerous stately buildings set through out the grounds such as the Palace on the Water and the Old Orangery. There is also a formal water feature that runs like a canal through the park.
When all of the palaces and museums are open you can get a combination ticket to access them all. This was not available when we visited because the White House was under repair and the Palace on the Water was closed for a function.
The park is resident to numerous squirrels who will readily eat nuts straight out of your hand. Much to our surprise so did blue tits.
Overall an excellent park that takes you away from the crowds of the city. You could easily spend a half day or more exploring.

We used the metro to get so far then we walked the rest of the way, as the sun was shinning we enjoyed the walk.
On the web site it talked about there being free Chopin concerts in May - fortunately we arrived in time to catch the last few performances - the atmosphere was absolutely wonderful.
Having done that we walked around the park looking at the sights - beautifully kept with lovely borders, trees and wildlife.
We didn’t have the opportunity to go in any of the building as the ticket office was closed, but this didn’t spoil our day.

We had a private guide for whole day and this was the last place we went. Our guide Gosia was fantastic and told of course the basics of history but also lot of local stories. And she said that if you have time only for two places in Warsaw makes sure you visit the old town as well as Lazienki Park.
Because we wanted to see so much, we absolutely had too little time here in the park so we just saw a little peak. But I am happy for that little peak. Remember to have good walking shoes.... I will definitely go again if I'll go again to Warsaw.

Peacocks warmed themselves in the sun at the Palace on the Isle which is said to be built on water. There's an open air theater that was made for the entertainment of the noblemen. Also a Chinese garden was donated to the park by China and a huge Easter egg by Croatia.

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,5.0,"One of my favourite places in Warsaw, partly because I love peacocks, and there are some of them present here.

It is a park centered around the Palace on the Water, originally built by S.H. Lubomirski in 17th century, but owing its present form to the last independent king of Poland, S.A. Poniatowski (1764-95). It is mostly classicist in form, with some baroque elements.

The rest of the buildings in the park, apart from a baroque statue of John III Sobieski trumpling a Turk, are classicist. These include an orangery, a hermitage, and, on the hill, a Belvedere, which served the Polish president for some time. Also, there's a famous statue of Chopin with the Chopin concertos played next to it.

There is obviously a lot of trees around, and a lovely little lake with the main palace. You can enter a small boat on it.

It is a bit distant from the town centre, but you can access it easily by buses like 180 and 195.
There is a bit old, but not very expensive, hotel named Hera next to the most distant entrance.

Perfect place for sitting with a book or to calm down own thoughts when necessary ( if the tourists allow you...many of them, especially - some Japaneses, are very noisy, am afraid to recall it from my own experience). Many places to visit - old greek- style amphitheatre, galleries of sculptures, paintings and many other like cafes or restaurant.
Great little spot with a sale of waffers with amazing variety of fruits, whipping cream and sauces for topping.
Sweet and very ""royal"" detail at Łazienki!

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,3.0,"We went on a lovely warm Saturday in October thinking it would be great to get away from people. How disappointed were we . I have never been to a park so full of people. It was heaving with people completely blocking most of the walk ways. Whilst it was beautiful there was very little areas where you could sit in the sun as it is very dense with trees which was a shame on a sunny day as most of the time we were in thick shade. We may have been unlucky but it was the only thing I was disappointed in during my lovely stay in Warsaw.

I thought it would be a quick stop to look at the Chopin fountain and we ended up walking from one end to the other learning about all the important buildings along the way which were beautiful. Our tour guide mentioned that all the animals come out in the morning because the locals come by to feed them; peacocks, squirrels, and deer. If I'd had more time in Warsaw I would have come back through here for a job. It was nice to see so many people, locals and tourists, strolling through the park and enjoying a beautiful Fall day.There are free concerts twice a day on Sundays at the Chopin fountain. Arrive early for a bench seat otherwise there was plenty of lawn seating.

Lovely little cafe restaurant by the bus stop serving delicious coffee and cake also ice cream outside.
Continuing down the road the entrance to the Botanical gardens is on the left (charge) then about 500m is the entrance to the park(free). The park is huge we were lucky to catch the last Chopin concert of the season ( every Sunday May -September, 12 and 4pm) held by the Chopin statue and very popular with visitors and locals alike.
Lots of interesting buildings and statues in a beautiful setting and quite peaceful despite being really busy. Definately worth a visit away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,4.0,"Although this is not a big park, it is beautiful and you can always get away from the crowds in some quiet corner. Lots of benches too so there is no need to sit on the lawns. There is lots to do in the park including the excellent Palace on the Lake (not to be missed), Chopin monument, orangeries, theatre by the lake etc. Allow half a day if time permits. There are Chopin concerts at 12 noon and 4 pm in summer.

The one downside is the lack of good dining options for those looking for a good restaurant. The Belvedere restaurant next to the Belvedere Palace is no good, turning away paying customers like me on the excuse that they were fully booked despite many unoccupied tables. I believe there is a reasonably good restaurant up a hill but I was not feeling up to a climb before lunch.

I would strongly suggest that the park authorities put in an additional couple of restaurants to offer visitors more dining options and to give the arrogant Belvedere a run for its money.

Their royal place for visiting, even it seems quite good, however not too interesting. And you will have to get a ticket for it.
Besides that, they have a coffee place in there, and it's nice. The hot red wine is very tasty, the pancakes are also really good. Nice place for stopping awhile before keep moving to another.

Poland,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,5.0,"Cannot fault this park - it was clean, well lit (we visited at around sunset) and generally just a very lovely place to be. The lake where the Palace on the Isle sits was completely frozen when we visited (this made for some wonderful pictures!) which somehow made the place more beautiful. These gorgeous figures (see second image) lit the main path through the park which just brought the whole place alive. I wish I’d had more time to spend there and explore the buildings a bit more - as a keen theatre person & classical music fan, the Chopin Monument & the Amphitheater were a particular highlight for me.

The pathways are wide enough for prams / wheelchair users etc and are level enough to make easy access for all. There are one or two steep paths as you head towards the Chopin monument but once you’re there it’s worth the little climb. This park is clearly well kept and well worth the visit. There are bus stops just outside the Chopin monument side of the park as well as at the other entrances. From the West side of the park there is a tram line approx. 5 min walk.

The old town and the newly renovated office area around the harbours are absolutely stunning, the way the modern architecture seamlessly flows into the old style houses and back again is a well planned piece of architecture that deserves a mentioning.

Bit of a shame that if you wander of into the more residential areas that the glory of the old town is not pulled into those parts. As soon as you step out of the tourist area you see heaps of garbage, run down places and houses that feel jealous of their cousins only a few streets away.

The Old Town (known as ""Stare Miasto"") was meticulously rebuilt in similar past styles agreed by the local government officials. Various buildings include a picturesque 14th Century Millhouse, the Ratusz, or town hall, and the Church of the Virgin Mary, a 14th Century Gothic Cathedral. The main square or focal point of the Old Town is the Diugi Targ which is the main square of the restored area which is an extremely long and narrow plaza, fronted by tall narrow buildings reminiscent of Amsterdam. A leisurely walk through this square and adjacent streets gives one a good sense of the rebuilt city and former glory.

There is not many things to do in Gdansk but the cute sights are picturesque. As we went in October the sky was grey and it was cold therefore I don't recommend going a later time of the year. It would be beautiful in the summer.
If you're a fan of Italian food then this is the city for you. There's an Italian restaurant on every corner.
Gdansk is also extremely cheap, would highly recommend visiting.

The restaurant is located in the train complex in Gdansk.
Aside from the restaurant, there's also a hotel - and, of course, a brewery!

The restaurant has a upper-middle class , with cosy decor, comfortable chairs, and a view on beer tanks.

The menu is varied with a strong focus on local dishes, with reasonable prices for beautiful restaurant.

We have tried rib eye however - which, while not really local, was amazing - and beef rib, which was great: tender and juicy. Sides and sauces kept the high level as well.

The staff is just like they should be: polite, helpful, and not overwhelming.

All in all a great place to visit when in Gdansk or even as a part of an excursion from Tricity, as there are quite frequent rail connections via a picturesque railway line from both Gdynia and Gdansk.

The exquisite buildings and their facades combined with the pedestrian streets and ease of getting around makes the town perfect for at least two or more days of exploration.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"So we decided to embark on a 48 hour trip to Gdansk in the last weekend in November, not really knowing what to expect, having visited Krakow and many other European cities. We arrived first thing in the morning after a very early flight and decided to get the public bus (208 or 210 if I remember correctly) into the centre of the city.

Immediately after getting off the bus, 2 things occurred to me...the first thing was that we were in for a great weekend. There was Christmas markets directly in front of us (something we didn't think there would be) with the old town as a backdrop. The second thing was that it was going to be really quite cold!!! About 5 feet off of the bus I realised where the phrase ""absolutely Baltic!"" for being cold come from.....Gdansk!

None the less we started walking through the Christmas markets, along the cobbled streets and into Dlugi Targ. Wherever we looked there was colourful architecture lining the streets, from the Golden Gate all the way to the Green Gate it is absolutely stunning! Be sure to get off the main streets and check out Mariacka Street and the other smaller streets as there are some real hidden gems along the way.

Whilst in the city be sure to check out the old pirate ship located next to the old crane! We visited this after a vodka tasting and to be honest I wasn't 100% sure if it was real at first glance or if the vodka was playing tricks on me.....but when in Poland!

The old town is quite small in the sense that everything is easily walkable including the Amber Sky ferris wheel. We found the 48hrs to be sufficient amount of time to do what we wanted to, however we didn't go into every museum nor try every restaurant, so we could have stayed longer for sure!

It is a cheap weekend and definitely a nice easy one for people to do as a 1st weekend away, the locals are an absolute delight and always up for a chat and a laugh when possible as well!

Very quiet and the street we looked onto was beautiful with its Gdansk architecture. There were a nunber of wheelchair users in the hotel at the same time as us and they appeared to be able to manoever easily around the dining area and sitting areas. Floor 1 [ our floor] was ramped very well for access. Very spacious hallways and landings. We would highly reccommend this hotel. Night bus from the airport was very easy to use [ we landed after midnight] only a 7-8 min walk from the but to the hotel. Uber and regular Taxi services available.

Gdansk is lovely, quite compact and easy to find your way around we recently went to Kiev for 4 days and used around 20 Ubers, in Gdansk we used 4 and 2 of those were to and from the airport.
The Christmas market was good, quite small and with a few really nice bits, quite expensive for what they are really but you tend to get a bit caught up in the moment.
The food stalls were wonderful, we tried Polish sausage with potatoes, deep fried dough bread which was like a yorkshire pudding the churro's and the unicorn bubble waffle was amazing, there was lots more we never got to try due to needing to fit into a Ryanair seat
Gdansk really is lovely, there are also lots of shopping malls, though these now shut on a Sunday apart from the last Sunday in the month, we were unaware of this when we booked and would have altered our dates had we known, this is now consistent all over Poland I believe
The Christmas market is not on par with the ones in Germany, we visited Cologne last year, but has its own charm and I actually bought more here as Germany was incredibly expensive.
It is not somewhere I would return to, personally I prefer Wroclaw, but I really enjoyed it for a long weekend

The people were lovely and especially when you try speaking their language. Loads of quaint cobbled streets with stalls /shops selling Amber. There are a few streets that stick out that look like they are from film sets especially with lovely the architecture some of the drainage pipes lead down from the roof tops to the walls and the water runs out of the mouths of stone dragons. The pubs are all fine, they got busy and restaurants double up as bars, we found that all food and beers are very cheap, you can also get alcohol free beers in nearly all the pubs and different varieties.
I wouldn't bother with the hop on hop off buses as you can walk everywhere the bus goes, we did go on it and wished we hadn't as there was Some type of march on and we couldn't go a certain route so it was cut short. I must say that the guide we got was great very knowledgeable. Great little town.

There are a lot of pubs and restaurants for the area so you have a good choice of food and beverages. The prices are very reasonable aswell which is always a bonus.

So Gdańsk Old Town is a nice place there’s not a great deal to do except walk up several viewing points and go on a ferris wheel but me personally once you have been I doubt that you would return.

All in all I am happy I went because it is a nice place to see reasonably price for food and drink and it was very clean but I would not return.

My favorite part was exploring its streets. Dluga is the longest one and filled with tourists. It has 2 gates: Golden gate and green gate. Mariacka Street is the most charming with the amber shops, the incredibly beautiful staircases and the excellent coffee shops.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"We spent a few days exploring old town and loved it. The buildings have been painstakingly recreated from the ruins left at the end of the second world war. I believe most were rebuilt during the 1950´s and 1960´s but all look amazing. Some have dates from that period and others show dates which acknowledge the city´s much older history. It certainly gives you a feel of how the city may have been before the war. Fortunately they did not try and build a modern concrete city like so many others. The decision to replicate the old architecture has given it a timeless appeal.

One surprising thing we did notice is that Gdansk seems to have bit of a graffiti problem. It´s most noticable all around the railways but even some areas of old town. The UK went through the same thing back in the late 1980´s and 1990´s with lots of tagging. I thought that was well out of fashion these days. Not a big deal though.

There are endless tasteful restaurants and cafes, most of which have tables and chairs outside. The food and drink prices are cheap compared to many European destinations. Seems the Poles have a sweet tooth as you don´t have to walk far to the next waffle/ice cream seller!

We managed fine using just our payment cards and not taking any cash. However, there were some small sellers/market traders who only took cash. If you plan to buy any amber then the cheapest price is with cash. If your home currency is Euros then always pay in Polish currency if asked when using a payment card.

The old town had a nice atmosphere with many families strolling around well into the evening. We were lucky to see the summer market just before it finished. The market stalls seemed endless in many of the side streets.

We were pleasantly surprised with the old town and would certainly recommend it for couples and families.

We had no idea what to expect as we hadn't done much research on Gdansk but we were completely captivated by the old town area. We decided to ditch the formal tour as we did not want to spend our time following a regimented tour and made arrangements to meet back up with the tour group at an appointed time. This allowed us the freedom to just wander around and soak in the charm and quaintness of old Gdansk. Once we walked in the main gate, it was like stepping back hundreds of years in terms of the beautiful buildings and churches in the pedestrian zone. The early part of the day was overcast and windy but by the afternoon, the skies cleared and the sun came out and it was quite lovely. We eventually found our way back to the main canal and walked along both sides of it imagining the boats that once came in and unloaded their cargo to the buildings along the canal. There was an old grainery chute, a replica sailing ship that you could ride on, lots of restaurants, a double-decker carousel (never saw one like it before) and a giant ferris wheel -- all along the canal. It was a beautiful and leisurely way to see the old part of Gdansk. Highly recommend just seeing historic Gdansk on your own.

A row of facades blending Dutch gables with Venetian presence and Polish precision! Walk through the arched colonnades and the main, cobbled avenue has wall to wall architecture. Each example carefully reconstructed post WW2. Delicate pastels, frescoes, carvings and the Daniel Fahrenheit thermometer! Avoiding crowds is tricky around midday. Take refuge in St Mary’s church. Look out for the statue of Polish Pope John Paul II - left of the altar. He visited and quietly suggested some restoration work! It continues. Our guide was a student when Solidarity was rising from the shipyards. Her past has scars. Soviet ones. Rationing in the 1980’s. A turbulent history, a friendly nation. Less is more.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"Old Town Gdańsk was reconstructed during the 1950’s to 1960’s after it was destroyed during WWII. It has been beautifully reconstructed with gorgeous facades. Most of the buildings are of Dutch design resembling architecture found in Amsterdam. There are also French and Italian influences. The town has multiple gates (originally built to protect the city), and they make great frames for photos. If you enter through the Golden Gate, you’ll walk down Ulica Dluga (long lane), past beautiful townhouses on both sides, the Town Hall, the Neptune Fountain and Artus Court (former meeting place of merchants) to the Green Gate which leads to the riverfront promenade. Be sure to look back at the gate from the riverfront. There are more gates, but I thought these two were the prettiest. One of the interesting sights along the riverfront promenade is the tread wheel crane built in the 14th century. This was a human-powered device used to load and unload cargo. You’ll want to spend 2-3 hours exploring Old Town, more if you visit museums.

Despite the occasional downpour, Izabella worked hard to ensure we had a wonderful experience, sharing a lot of info about the history of Gdansk and her personal experiences growing up under Soviet rule, Our Old Town walking tour kept revealing one beautiful street after another as Izabella shared info of life in Gdansk past and present. She was able to answer all our questions.

The Solidarity Center is amazing — both architecturally and in the beautifully displayed and recounted history of the Solidarity movement.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"The coach picked us up at the port and our guide told us that on the way to Gdansk our clever driver would take us first to Falowiec in Pryzymorze - a block of flats which is the longest building in Poland and the largest residential building in Europe.

The word Falowiec comes from the Polish word fala, meaning ‘wave’ - singular - and Falowiec = waves, plural. Built between 1970-73, the Falowiec in Pryzmore, Gdansk, is one huge, long (2,788 feet/850 metres) building with 11 floors, separated into 4 segments. In each segment are 110 apartments and 4 main staircases. The flats are called Falowiec because they ‘wave’ in and out from block to block - a huge 1,792 apartments occupied by an estimated 6000 people. 3 separate bus stops along the length are needed for transport!!

The Fallowiec were vast, but they looked very clean and well maintained and were painted in tasteful pastel shades. I wondered about privacy, since kitchen windows looked out on open balconies used as a corridors constantly by other tenants on that level. But when homes are desperately needed, imaginative and original solutions like this are brave experiments.

Our next stop was at the Oliwa Cathedral, an enchanting, beautifully maintained religious centre, filled with beautiful paintings and artefacts, gleaming wood and glowing stained-glass windows. There was also an organ recital to appreciate, it was simply a cultural delight.

We finally finished our tour in charming Gdansk Old Town and walked round admiring the beautiful buildings which had all needed complete restoration after WWII. By now, after such a packed morning, coffee was the answer, whatever the question! So we took a table in a cafe next to the fine clock, which chimed musically as we drank our cappuccinos. The cafes were filling up, mainly with bright young people and families with babies. It was good to see so much youth and energy.

A Polish friend had told us we’d enjoy our first ever visit to her country, and so we did! It was a first step towards discovering life in this strong, hard-working country, and we’d certainly like to return for a future visit to discover more.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"GDAŃSK (via WARSAW)

I cheated a little bit when it came to visiting Gdańsk. Rather than switching hotels and staying outside of Warsaw, I opted to take the two-and-half hour train ride from Warszawa Centralna (see Where to Stay in Warsaw to understand why) to Gdańsk.

Gdańsk is a hidden treasure and once you step off of the train you immediately why this town in a must see. Start at St. Mary’s Basilica and the 46-foot tall Astronomical Clock that is both a work of art and highly-functioning information source. Its complex dials show the time and date, phases of the moon, the position of the moon and sun in relation to the zodiac signs, and the calendar of saints. Adam and Eve ring the bell on the hour, and at noon the Three Kings, the Apostles, and Death join them in a historic precession.

Visit the Amber Museum to see hundreds of interesting ways the most rare amber on Earth’s is used in everyday life. Without a visit, you might never know that as much as 90% of the world's deposits can be found near Poland, with some of it extremely valuable. Exiting the museum there is a huge street where you can buy an amber treat of your own (I opted for the petite lamps with the fashionable amber shades).

Lots of museums and art galleries, would recommend the crane and amber museums in particular.
If you like a challenge try St Mary’s Basilica, only £2 admittance to the tower and you can climb the 405 steps up to the top (and then back down again!)
The River is lovely to walk around, there’s an observation wheel for nice views and a pirate ship (amongst other vessels) which you can pay to board for a short cruise.
Great for a couple of days tourism.

Can’t do this city in just a day. You’ll need at least 3-4 days to see things and even then you won’t see it all. There are hidden gems everywhere.

And for dinner I recommend Pod Zielonym Smokiem on Ulica Szeroka. Try a traditional kotlet schabowy.

Also, I recommend visiting Park Oliwa. You’ll need lots and lots of time for this one. It’s huge! There are monuments, botanical gardens, streams, etc. On the way to the park, stop at Kawiarnia Coffee Perk (where friends meet).

Everything we needed was only a short walk from the hotel. There are numerous restaurants and bistros catering for every need. We wanted to sample Polish food so we used the smaller traditional restaurants and avoided the fine dining experience as this is not to our liking.
The war museum is a must and was free on the day we went but still only 12pl for adults. We found it very interesting, informative, and very moving.
The mock up streets were fantastic and put you right in the bombed ruins.
The photos and videos and exhibits are all fantastic. Everything is on one level as you move from room to room. Allow at least 2 hours for this as it is quite extensive.
The Amber museum is housed in the old prison so has a mixture of exhibits from how it was originally used and the story of local mined Amber. This is on several floors so you will need good mobility to climb the winding steps.
The local town history museum is in the Town hall and also worth a visit. Be aware that this is on several floors.
The old town has been rebuilt in keeping with the pre war style using as much of the original materials as could be saved as possible some of the original buildings and city walls are still standing and date back to the 14th century.

However I have noticed an increasingly diverse selection of international tourists arriving in recent years. When I first came it seemed to be just Germans and me! I hope Gdansk can keep its charisma despite the international hordes but fear it may eventually go the way of the more mainstream destinations. I sincerely hope not as I love it there!

The war museum is amazing and is absolutely worth a visit albeit do not expect to walk away feeling positive about human nature!

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,5.0,"The Market Square of Wrocław is definitely worth a visit. It's in fact my favourite place to go to when I'm in the city. Most buildings in this area are picturesque and have some sort of an interesting background story. There are plenty of good restaurants and stores selling memorabilias. You can sightsee the Market Square by strolling along, riding a bike or an electric scooter, or going on a horse ride. There are many ways to explore this gorgeous piece of the city.
However, I have to agree with the comments I've seen about the beggars - they make for one of the biggest downsides of the experience. Over the years the amount has awfully increased. Just as at the beginning you could ignore and walk past them, they've recently become more pushy than ever before. From time to time they even approach people while they're having dinner outdoors at a restaurant, so beware of this. Keep your belongings close and steer clear of sketchy individuals as much as possible - as soon as you spot one walking around with a rose in their hand, go the opposite way or any other that might have you avoid a possibly unfortunate situation.
While a lot gave the attraction 4⭐️ for the issue previously mentioned, I don't have the heart to give it less than 5⭐️. It's just such a pretty place.

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,5.0,"A tourist attraction for both day and night time. During the day, one can appreciate the streets, lined with unique buildings, etched with intricate details if you look at them closely from top to bottom. Don't forget to bring your camera! Noticeable among the wonderful cobblestone-covered ground is the more wheel-friendly path for strollers (hurray!) and heels. Our kids love splashing around the fountain, chasing pigeons, hunting dwarfs, making huge bubbles (usually in exchange for a small donation you'll have unlimited use), and watching street performers (human statues, musicians, acrobats, sketch artists, singers, and what not). There are tons of benches, restaurants and fast food chains around besides museums and some churches to see. When dusk comes, pubs begin to light up the streets and start the busy night life. They also hold exciting fairs, concerts, and Christmas markets in the square. It is not the size but the life it offers to both young and old... that's what makes Rynek special.

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,5.0,"Picturesque, colorful, magnificent, transporting. These words try to, but cannot, capture the sheer delight you feel as you stroll around Wroclaw’s Market Square. Krakow’s and Prague’s market squares come closest in my experience and are indeed grand, must-sees for travelers in Europe, but Wroclaw, while still large feels a bit more intimate, a bit more colorful, and a bit more joyful somehow.

Like those two and other beautiful squares, you will find plenty of bars and restaurants (not the best in town), food and craft stalls, museums, striking architecture, and lots of tourists, but Wroclaw’s feels somehow a little different. Maybe it was the fire breather illuminating the night sky one evening on our after-dinner stroll. Maybe it was the colorful buildings chockablock along the borders (not so different from other main squares, but somehow cuter with the way their roofs are cut out to reveal the bright blue sky). You’ll also find some of Wroclaw’s famous gnomes playing along the sidewalks.

I can’t be certain of why I feel this way, but I am certain that when you are in Wroclaw you must visit the Rynek twice. Once by day for the sheer bounty of visual delights, fairy tale architecture, and town bustle and once at night for the shadow and light interplay and the evening street performers at their most dramatic.

I agree with those who say that this is the most beautiful market square they have ever seen. The pastel colored buildings are stunning and are all different in style and look. The square dates back to the middle of the 14th century and while the square was damaged many houses survived WWII almost unscathed. The square is huge and it's easy to see that a variety of markets were once held here. One can easily spend a few hours here just walking and admiring. At the center of the square sits the old City Hall as well other buildings and houses. Nowadays many contain little stores and restaurants. It's an awesome place to visit and take pictures.

The perimeter also has a collection of wonderful restaurants and watering holes. Just at the northwest corner of the Rynek, St Elizabeth's church rises grandly and offers the ambitious ones a invitation to climb to the top of the tower.

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,4.0,"Almost miraculously the 'Ring' as Germans used to call it, escaped total destruction during the siege by the Soviet army in 1945. Though many of the historic buildings were damaged, they could be restored pretty easily. Compared to for instance the old town of Warsaw.

This huge market place has been in existence since the early 1200s, but most of the presentday buildings are from the early 1900s when Breslau's economy was booming and its population reached over a half a million. Not just German business people erected tenements and offices here, but also Jewish Germans like the Barasch brothers who opened a huge department store at the eastside of the square now called Feniks.

Classicism and Baroque are the main architectural styles of the structures on and lining the square, but Art Nouveau and Jugendstil can also be observed. You could easily spend a day or two to identfy the variety of artistic expression here.

During the last decade the square has become more and more touristy. Street performers, beggars, touts who want to lure you to erotic shows, vendors are all part of the Rynek cocktail today.

There were court chambers and a court office, and in one huge ballroom style room they had held fencing tournaments. Some rooms had old timber ceilings and others were vaulted like the cathedral. Some of this vaulting had small dwarf like figures at the base. There was some lovely stained glass windows and an immense tiled stove. Worth a visit.

The Tourist Infomation office is also based there for maps, help and souvenirs. One thing that did disappoint us is that the restaurants and cafes are not yet allowed to put out their tables and chairs (till April apparently?). Given it was so beautifully warm and sunny (yes, in February!) that was a real shame.

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,4.0,"There seemed to be a joy of life amidst the historical buildings on Wroclaw's old town square. Even though Wroclaw's town square had similar elements found in other Polish old town squares - a town hall, a church, a pedestrianized cobbled square, multistoried pastel burgher houses with patio cafes out front, a statue or two plus a fountain - there were differences in the details and that made a visit here worthwhile.

Although the whole square, from the cobble stones to the buildings, was reconstructed from WWII damage, the old town square still retained the architectural style of an old town square from centuries ago. While further out on the ring roads, the medieval defensive walls and a moat were visible, the old town square had none of that. Red bricks showed up on the facades of the old Town Hall and St. Elizabeth Church, but the multistoried burgher houses that surrounded the square had plastered pastel shades of gold, mint green, rose, taupe, etc. Their roof lines all differed, some with Flemish gables. Only a few had notable facades like the House of Seven Electors with the frescoed depictions of the 7 electors of the Holy Roman Empire and a gabled house with various animals on each step, both on the same side of the square. Many of these residences that surrounded the square had ground floor restaurants that had been extended onto the square as umbrellaed patio cafes or had shops.

Probably the most notable building on the square was the old Town Hall on one corner of the square. Each side of this red bricked building had a different architectural style. The 2 sides I preferred were the side with projecting bay windows, ornately decorated with carvings and corbels, while many small statues of citizens stood on the wall between Gothic windows. Another interesting side of the Town Hall had a gabled roof line with pinnacles. The wall with the square tower and clocks on every side was plain.

Since the Town Hall had also been a courthouse, not just a meeting place for the town leaders, there was a pillory out front. The pillory had a most unusual appearance in that it resembled a pinnacled church spire. At its top was a pedestal with the statue of the executor holding a flail and a long sword. Underneath on the dais children were merrily playing, spilling out from the beachy area on either side - sandboxes, beach chairs, grassed area with plants. I found the sculpture of a pair of jeans filled with soil and plants to be an unusual, but amusing flower container. BBQ stalls were grouped around that area for quick meals of grilled foods to be eaten on the many nearby benches. This area looked like fun.

Also fun, was watching out for the many bronze elf like statues placed around the square. These were only 1 foot high and were found at the front doors, up lamp posts, beside the church, beside monuments - each with a different pose and holding different objects indicating some sort of ordinary human activity. These elf like bronze statues produced smiles from tourists.

The Square also had the expected and the unexpected monuments. The traditional monument on Wroclaw's town square was a bronze statue turned turquoise on a high pink stone pedestal. It commemorated the Pole's famous literary figure Alexander Fredro who wrote comedies about Polish nobles in the 1800's. He was posed sitting casually in a chair with a quill in his hand even though he came from an aristocratic background. Contrast that statue with the modern statue in the corner of St. Elizabeth's church courtyard. It was a memorial for the local pastor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was hanged in a Nazi concentration camp for his outspoken views against the Nazi extermination of Jews. This statue was headless, armless, and in a kneeling pose. Then, there was the sculpture of farmyard animals in a butcher's lane to commemorate the slaughtered animals over time. How unique! It too brought a smile to my face.

The much talked about Hansel and Gretel House or John and Margaret House was a disappointment as it really just had a connecting arch going for it. There was no inscription on the arch now which once read - ""Death is the way to life"" - because through its arch people entered St. Elizabeth Church's cemetery. Today, that arch led into the church's cobbled courtyard - the graves removed along with their German congregation. This archway now is used to symbolize lovers holding hands - see the gnome at the front door of the pink house with a gold heart in its hand. Through the archway, red bricked St. Elizabeth Church could be seen all encased, in mid-June, in scaffolding.

Also fun to watch was the town square's water fountain called Zdroj/Spa Fountain. It didn't have a hint of grungy old stone with water spurting from a mythological themed statue set in the middle of a classical shaped fountain. The Zdroj fountain, built in 1996, was very modern looking and had a commanding spot on the square. It had a rectangular shape with many low jets of water spurting water into its middle where glass panels deflected the water back into the pool while other jets in the middle of the fountain spurted vertical sprays of water.

All of these small details enhanced our visit to Wroclaw's old town square and showed us that in the midst of this historical site today's citizens were making it their own place.

It is a very clean and food/drink prices are very cheap. For example, Ice cream here costs about 1$ where as in other European cities it is 3 to 4 times as much. The food joints are very inexpensive for foreign tourists and most service folks speak English. I do recommend to stay near the city square and do not rent a car, walking is going to get you to most historic attractions. Driving is horrible because of the many one way old streets which get clogged up. Walking is best of use local transportation which is easy if you use google to find the tram line to use to get to locations that are beyond reasonable walking distance.

To me, this was what Christmas Markets are all about and what I enjoy most visiting them. It was teeming with people of all ages and felt like a true community event. It was full of the energy of the people, aromas of the food cooking in the booths, the sounds of music filling the air, little kids excitedly walking with their parents. There were many vendors selling local delicacies as well as the usual market fare. Having it in the historic city center was a bonus. The people we met were all friendly and helpful, as neither of us spoke Polish. There were several places set up for photos: with sleighs and sculptures of the city's famous dwarfs.

Poland,Rynek of Wroclaw,5.0,"We specifically visited the square for 4 days this week for the Christmas Market, an average display of Christmas stalls and décor but still well worth a visit, we visit a Christmas Market every year and still think Alexander Platz in Berlin is the best so far but this one is on a par with all the others, all the usual eating stalls, Christmas item stalls, Gluhwein bars and some lovely décor, but the square is full of things to see besides the Christmas theme and we will return in the hotter months to see the other attractions it has to offer.

There are tour buses located there and of course lot's of ""dwarfs"" to spot, better than pokemon searching :) as they are cuter with many of the 350 plus located in Wroclaw dotted around the area.

Some lovely restaurants all at reasonable prices with traditional Polish menus, Greek, Italian, Indian, Chinese and American options too.

The church/cathedral and standard buildings around the square are lovely, many painted in different pastel colours to add to the picturesque look of the area, lot's of little back streets off the main square though turning into one and seeing more than 20 rats scuttling around the bins at 10pm in the evening was a little off putting.

There are a few fairground attractions for the young children but not really any for adults except perhaps the ""hall of mirrors maze"" but the Fairy Tale kiosks are numerous and interesting.

Security was reasonable though we saw very few Police Officers (only 2 in fact) but lot's of private security employed by the Christmas Market itself, at other such venues we have seen much tighter security and the young teenagers begging are a pain but all in all we enjoyed our four days there and stayed in an apartment with a front door opening right into the market.

We soon discovered there's so much more than just the market, there is a modern shopping centre in the town as well as numerous bars , cafes and restaurants.
We wanted to do something different and I found a gun range only 15 mins walk from the main square called Progun Tac, i contacted them via facebook and arranged a booking, the range is run by 2 ex Polish Army gents who were very friendly as well as professional, we paid 150 zloty each and got to fire a couple of pistols an AK47 , Uzi and M4 - not something you will ever get to do in England.

There are four routes to the area just below the summit and some are considered easier than others.

The queue down took longer and was made worse by people who clearly were too important to wait. But maybe that's just me being English :-)

Poland,Giewont Mountain,4.0,"An altitude of 1894m. in the Tatras is high enough to earn the title of a real mountain. Moreover Giewont has a rocky summit and the last part (some 20m) you have to scramble over rocks adding to the experience of climbing a genuine peak. Still the overall hike to Giewont is very much doable for most people who are in good health and have a reasonable physical condition. Perhaps for this reason the hike up to Giewont is very popular.

The sign for the blue marked route to Giewont at Kuznice reads 3.15 (three hours and fifteen minutes). According to Google the distance of the trail is 5.7 km. Elevation difference just under 900m. I did the hike twice during bad weather when there were hardly any people. Both times I was alone on the summit, but the view was limited. To go down I would recommend the red marked trail through the beautiful Strazyska valley.

Poland,Giewont Mountain,5.0,"We started out our hike from Kuznice along the blue trail that leads to Giewont. The hike is not too hard, its appropriate for all ages. The hike to the top took us about 3 hours, you can make it to the top sooner but we were not rushing, we were enjoying the views. Along the way you will encounter water that is flowing out of a log, natural spring water, you can fill up your water bottle. The final 50 meters at the top are the most difficult part of the hike, ""the area of the chains"". The chains were placed to help hikers climb to the top, the granite rock at the top is very slippery, hold on to the chain at all times. I would not attempt if the rocks are wet or its raining. Once you climb to the top you will be directly under the Giewont cross, which is a 15-meter steel cross built in 1901. At the peak, you will be at 1,895 m (6,217 ft). Be very cautious at the top, there aren't any guard railings or fencing, one misstep or a shove from someone when the area is crowded and you can plunge to your death. If you get to the peak early you will not have to put up with the crowds and you can enjoy the views of Zakopane. Coming down from the peak, always hold on to the chains, it makes coming down a lot easier.

Luckily we were staying at Willa Lesna, which was around a 2.5k walk to the gondola station at Kuznice. There isn't any onsite parking, the only parking we saw in the area was on Mieczyslawa Karlowicza street and it is limited, there was one parking lot and the rest is street parking. Best option is to get here by bus.

Tips:
Make sure to wear hiking boots with all the rocks along the trail it is easy to twist an ankle.
Hiking poles are very helpful, when using them you put less stress on your knees.
Bring gloves, they save your hands while you're pulling yourself up on the chains near the top.
Keep an eye out on the weather while you are hiking it changes very quickly in the mountains.
If there is rain or thunderstorms in the forecast do not head to Giewont, the cross at the top frequently gets hit by lightning.

Poland,Giewont Mountain,5.0,"Apparently, Giewont can gery VERY busy... I went off-season (October) on a weekday, and it was not busy. There was a school group just ahead of me on the last steep section of the summit, but otherwise I did not see many other people. I would agree with other comments - go very early or choose a different walk during busy periods.

Rather than just going up Giemont and back the same way, I woud recommend doing a circuit from Kuźnice to the Giemont summit, then continuing up the ridge to Kopa Kondracka and across to Kasprowsky Wierch. From here, you can walk back down to Kuźnice. Or you can take the cable-car down. (You could, of course, do the hike in reverse and catch the cable car up, which would make it an easier walk.)

This circular walk also means if there is a queue to the Giemont summit you can skip the peak, and you'll get equally good views from the high elevations as you ascend from the saddle below Giemont to Kopa Kondracka.

Just bear in mind that the cross on top that’s the symbol for zacopane isn’t that of religious significance, it was up there as a symbol of respect to the people who lost there lives climbing it.

On Great Giewont, there is a 15 m steel cross which was erected in 1901. It is the site of religious pilgrimages.

Part of the strech is very steep with only a chain to hold on to, many parts are very rocky and it may also be very crowded in high season so start your hike early in the day is recommended. Also since the sun can get very hot, no shade in sight. On the actual top it's very small so can also get very crowded actually. Like in most sites like this in Polish mountains there are no safety fences or such, so it's not for anyone fearing heights! You can either go back the same way or continue various streches, make sure to bring snacks, food and drinks as it's far between the stops to buy things (then only cash). Amazing view and so worth the hike! Highly recommended.

Poland,Giewont Mountain,4.0,"Although I've been to the Tatra Mountains many times, during my last visit I climbed Giewont for the first time. Perhaps it's because I visit mountains to find tranquility and I often look for places that are not popular. Giewont is extremely popular and in a way iconic. The mighty silhouette of Giewont stands out in the landscape of the Tatra Mountains that can be seen from Zakopane.

As Giewont is pretty close to Zakopane the hike takes about 6-7 hours and it is not much. Many hikes in the High Tatras take 10 hours or more and are far more strenuous.

I started my hike near the train station in Zakopane at 8 am. It really makes sense to start earlier (even at 6am) to avoid crowds. It took me about half an hour to get on foot to the National Park's entrance gate where the red trail starts. I chose the red trail that leads through the Strazyska Valley to ascend the mountain, then the blue trail to climb the peak of the mountain and finally the yellow trail that leads through ""Dolina Malej Laki"" valley to descend. Hiking through the valleys is very relaxing. Spruce forest provides shadow and has an intense and fresh scent. I enjoyed the sight and sound of mountain creeks. Above the forest were meadows blooming with purple flowers and green grass.

The peak of Giewont is rocky and steep. There are iron chains to help people to climb. Because of the queues the climb to the rocky peak and descent took me over one hour. If there had been no queues, it would have taken about 30 minutes.

Unfortunately, one woman got injured by a falling rock. She was evacuated by a mountain rescue helicopter. The difficulty of the trail near the peak is three stars in five star scale (Five stars have few of the most difficult hiking trails in Tatra mountains ), so climbing Giewont isn't a walk in the park. At the peak of Giewont you will see a huge iron cross and stunning view reaching far beyond Zakopane.

This hike was very interesting and varied in spite of short duration.

There are two ways of getting there. From Kuźnice or from Dolina Strążyska. If your knees are weak you might need some support (bandage or knee sleeve).
Very busy in the season!

Poland,Giewont Mountain,5.0,"The walk up the blue track to Giewont mountain is beautiful and steep. You can stop at the saddle or take on the last bit which involves as steeper climb to the cross, involving chains at the very end.

You need a reasonable level of fitness to take on this climb which takes a few hours (to ascend).

Once there the views are outstanding and the views on the way aregood too.

The return journey by the red and black tracks were steep and slippery most of the way. I found descending more challenging than ascending.

My walking poles were my friend that day for the ascent and more so for the slippery descent.

Apparently storms with lightning are common July and August which often occur around midday and the early afternoon. It's not a good idea to be at the cross or ascending or descending the cross at that time as people have died from lightning strike. I wouldn't be wanting to be descending to Zakopane either during a storm. It was slippery enough.

Take care on the top. There are no guard rails. You don't want to accidentally bump someone with your pack and send them toppling and you don't want it to happen to you.

They are the warnings but I thoroughly enjoyed the stunning views and walk.

Watch out for the black quartz which I believe is named after Giewont. Boulders of this rock are very slippy, especially those near the summit where they have been polished to a shine. Since Giewont is quite precipitous at the summit, care is needed. Fabulous views in all directions (Zakopane to north, Tatras on other 3 sides).

In saying that, there were children doing it and people double my age, so .... Maybe it's just me.
There's a handy shuttle that will take you from the front of the main bus station to the base of the mountain to begin the joke.
The summit was definitely worth the hike. Views for days!! I was lucky to hike on a good day. The clouds came over later on and it was freezing up there. Take a jacket.
I caught the gondola down as I was too tired to walk back down. (Cost 48kp) and it was good seeing the mountain from an appreciative spot and not hoping the track would end.

My advice for a winter ascent is: full crampons, hiking poles, at least two layers plus wind proof, waterproof shell, timing ( do not start from Kurnice any later than 10 am), waterproof and ankle height boots. Plus if you are unfamiliar with the Tatras; a local guide: try Tatra Adventure (+48) 501 616 039.

Poland,Old Market Square,5.0,"I've been in Poznan countless times before, and any time I'm there, I just have to look around Old Market Square. When I was a kid, I was fascinated with stories and legends, and the one of Poznan's two goats is probably the best known, although, after all these years that has passed I can hardly remember its details. During my time at university I liked going there on weekends for pint or two, and, believe me or not, bud despite of numerous bars, pubs, inns and restaurants that can be find there, sometimes it was not easy to find a free chair. Later on, I started appreciating its architecture, museums, galleries and overall atmosphere. This place was always full of life. Bustling, busy, sometimes overcrowded, other times nearly empty. Sometimes friendly, sometimes dangerous, and like many market squares to the east of Odra River, is distinctly different; I think; compare to those one beyond its western banks. Characteristic for most of the old Polish markets is that the very centre of it is, usually, occupied by town hall and other buildings. Initially wooden one, that in later centuries were replaced by brick ones, with open space running around them allowing movement of goods and people. Poznan's Market Square, set up in 1253, is third biggest market square in Poland, and one of the biggest in Europe. Initially, first buildings erected around the market square were made of wood or were of half-timbered construction, but with fast burgeoning of the citizens, and due to the fires (as in Medieval cities sidewalks were often paved with wood, therefore, conflagrations were common thing in that times) they were replaced in 15th century, with more representative edifices made of bricks. These Gothic houses were in turn, rebuilt in the following centuries, accordingly to the fashion of the day, in Renaissance, Baroque or Classicist styles. All this plethora of styles is still visible there, and vigilant eye can easily differentiate between them, or find traces of earlier styles hidden under subsequent layers left by the hundreds years of development, rebuilding, re-working and changes in tastes. Being in Greater Poland and not seeing this gem is like being in Moscow and not seeing Kremlin, or something between these lines. But seriously, Poznan's Old Market Square it is really nice place to visit. One can just run around it within few minutes, or just lazily wander around it for hours. It's entirely up to you of how much time you wanna spent there, but I'm nearly hundred percent sure that you won't regret it.

Pretty empty especially when compared to big towns like Krakow and Warsaw. But a nice spot to kill some time looking at the buildings. Also has some good cafes and restaurants in the nearby streets.

Poland,Old Market Square,5.0,"We had a 4 hour layover at Poznan (Ryan Air, flying from London Gatwick to Tel Aviv). I found the town square to be just 15 min away, so we took a taxi (about 10 Euro) there, walked around the beautiful square, and enjoyed a wonderful Poznan meal recommended by friendly tourist info ctr girls. We had goose (a local Poznan specialty) and pork knuckle (similar to Haxen in Munich, but even better in my opinion). With appetizers and dessert, it came to about $30 USD for two. On the way back to the airport, we didn’t see taxis around, so we asked a young family for help - the English speaking husband ordered a taxi on cell phone and we got there with plenty of time to spare (its a very small airport).

Two things to note. My research was confirmed that there is no luggage storage at the airport or near town square. So it’s recommended that you check in your luggage to the final destination, or you pack light enough in a backpack. Also, there’s no need to change money (Polish Zloty) - around town square they all take credit cards. The taxi back to the airport took cash only but he was happy to take 20 USD which meant a tip above the meter rate.

Many buildings had been destroyed in world war II but have been faithfully rebuilt, the net says.
However, we couldn't find any places to sit in the Old Town Square unless you happen to eat at a restaurant.

Poland,Old Market Square,5.0,"Went to Poland for a day trip whilst in Berlin. Chose Poznań this time. Old market square is a bit of a walk from the railway station but it’s glorious. It wasn’t as fancy as Brussels’ Grande Place, this was much more Holy Roman Empire/Germanic looking but is a lot more colourful and combines several different architectural styles.

I stumbled into one of the local celebrations which marked 100 years of Polish independence so there were loads of market stalls out selling traditional Polish food, drink, arts and crafts etc. The Pirogi was tasty and I snatched a few trinkets to take home. Sadly I didn’t see the clock chiming at midday so didn’t watch the two goats butting heads.

Poland,Old Market Square,3.0,"The old Market Square is a famous place where all tourists in Poznan (and lots of Polish people as well) can be found. It's plenty of restaurants and bars there, and it all looks nice - until you take a closer look.
The houses is in desperate need of repair (more than half of them!), which is a pity. Because the place itself is really nice.
In the many restaurants there, take a look at the toilets before you order. If they look bad - the owners know you can see that. Just think what it looks like where you can't see - like the kitchen, for example. That said, most places are good, some even extremely good, with all a mother would need to change diapers on their child, for example.
Just beside you can find a pub that serves 150 different Polish craft beers - absolutely a place to visit.

Poland,Old Market Square,4.0,"Many have reviewed the attraction so I will not take too much time other than to say it is very nice and well worth the visit. Many photo ops in this Market area both during the day and night. Good free walking tour through the area, try the croissants. Many beautiful churches in the surrounding area. It is an old world gem in my opinion and I am happy I took two days out of my self guided tour of Poland to visit. Definitely a recommend. BTW one very positive point I want to make about this market and Poland in general. I am sixty eight years old and sadly I need to use the bathroom/toilet/water closed OFTEN. There are clean public wc in the area (usually about $.50 fee )but if you need a wc just go into any restaurant surrounding the market and ask for, or look for, the wc. The staff are very accommodating and civil. I just want to stress that you should not be shy about needing a wc or asking for a wc nor should you walk around uncomfortable because you are feeling shy about asking to use the toilet. Poland is a very civil country and give them high marks for this attitude. (In some countries I have visited in Europe they can act like you are asking them to donate a kidney when you ask to use the wc.) One final point concerning the goats. At 12 noon (check the actual time but I think it is noon) there is a big deal about the two goats on the clock tower coming out. (There is a whole tradition about these goats.) Just be advised that the attraction is wooden goats not live goats. Personally I was not that impressed but my wife was and thought the whole thing was pretty cool.

The old town is medium size not as big as Krakow of Warsaw but just big enough not to get bored and small enough to walk it through in a couple of hours.

I found it clean, well maintained, building are in good shape and feel less commercial than other old towns. It has a different feeling, and this is coming from a guy that saw them all from Gdansk down to Krakow and across from Wroclaw to Zamosc. A must see if you travel between Warclaw and Gdansk.

Poland,Old Market Square,4.0,"On a city walking tour of the old town square, or Stary Rynek, we saw the Town Hall, the facades of the rowhouses, the main church, 4 fountains, and 2 monuments. Unfortunately the museums and art galleries on the square were not visited on our group tour.

The two more important structures not to miss are the historic Town Hall and the Parish Church of St. Stanislaw. The Town Hall, once thought to be the most beautiful one north of the Alps, was located on one corner of the square while the main church, St. Stanislaw, with its pink facade and baroque interior, was about 2 blocks away.

The outstanding features on the facade of the town hall were the 3 rows of loggias and the many portraits of the Polish kings. Delicate pastel paint colors were used as a background color ensuring that the the kings, dressed in suits of armor and red royal robes, stood out. The last king of Poland had his initials engraved on a golden medallion just under the clock. The goats, butting heads 12 times at noon, along with trumpet music and bells ringing would have been nice to see. On top of the bell tower was the crowned white eagle, the emblem of Poland. The Town Hall certainly was eyecatching, a nice change from other red brick town halls.

I also enjoyed looking at the facades of all the rowhouses surrounding the square. At first glance, these multistoried rowhouses seemed like others I had seen - 3 stories high with shops on the ground floor, built with varying widths and rooflines, and painted in many pastel colors. However, these townhouses had quite a bit of decoration on their facades, usually painted motifs in a color different from the background color of the house. For example, the Gallery of Polish Artists, had medallions filled with busts of famous Polish people like Copernicus and Marie Curie, and between them groups of wealthy medieval citizens dressed in period clothes. By the Mars fountain, the facade of the Literary Museum of H. Sienkiewicza was also notable. By the Neptune fountain, the dancing brown Africans on the facade of a green building was photo worthy. The arcaded rowhouses, in the middle of the square which once had been houses for herring merchants, all had contrasting painted designs on the front of the buildings. Unfortunately, the exterior plaster on some of the townhouses on the square did need repair.

The houses with stepped gables usually had more architectural detail on them like pilasters, white heavily plastered medallions, sculptured decor over windows, and even statues or coat or arms on the rooflines. These homes had been owned by wealthy merchants and nobles; some even had been palaces in their time. For example, one cream colored house, Palace Działyńskich, close to ul. Franciszkańska, had a statue of a pelican on its roof and 2 gates through which carriages could enter the courtyard. Pałac Mielżyńskich by ul. Wroniecka had a coat of arms on its roofline and a plaque indicating that some important people had once stayed there.

This square also had 4 classic fountains in each corner of the square and 2 monuments. The fountains all looked the same except for the central statue on the pedestal in the midst of the fountain. Each statue represented one of the Greek mythological gods - Mars, Neptune, Apollo, Persephone - so the fountains are named after that god. The Bamber Girl monument, named after a peasant girl carrying pots for winemaking, looked like a fountain too, but, actually, was a water trough used by horses. There was a monument to St. John of Nepomuk shown with his halo of stars. He is remembered for not sharing the Queen's secrets told in confession despite being tortured and then finally drowned in the river. The other monument stood in front of the Town Hall. This dark, pencil slim monument had a statue of the executioner on top. He held a sword which he used to cut off wrongdoers ears or fingers; he also whipped people. The court of justice presided in the Town Hall and he carried out the court's sentences.

The town square also had many patio cafes for meals or just drinks. We were directed to a bakery on Paderewskiego 11, at one of the square's corners, to taste the famous St. Martin Croissants that were available only in Poznan. Be aware that this bakery prices its special croissants by 100g. Since it's a heavy pastry, we ended up paying way more for it than other pastries in the shop.

The other important building not to miss - the main church - is about 2 blocks away from the old town square. The Parish Church of St. Stanislaw had a gorgeous pink exterior trimmed with white pilasters, a gilt starburst close to the roofline, niches for sculptures of religious figures, and an impressively decorated portal that included the Polish white crowned eagle. Inside, the baroque decor was breathtaking because of all of the gilt trimmings, heavy white stucco decor, cherub angels, and fluted burgundy columns along the nave. The ornate altars in the apse and in the side aisles were surrounded by more marble columns with huge paintings as their focal points and statues overlooking them.

Next door to this church was the present city hall with a lovely courtyard and the sculpture of 2 goats, the city's emblem.

Our local guide allowed about 30 minutes for a walk around the square. After we had visited the church and taken our photos of the new city hall, and had some free time, we spent about 2 hours in the old town square area.

Poland,Old Market Square,4.0,"I was in a group which decided to wander down to the old market square for a casual bite to eat and evening stroll afterwards. This was a Friday night, so I am assuming the area was busier than earlier in the week. Noting that, the market square was not overly busy and offered good choices for eating - particularly outdoors.
The market square does present many old style buildings which are interesting from an architecture point of view. Worth a stroll if that is your desire to pass away some time in the evening.

One word of advice though, if you want to see the two billy goats butt heads (local attraction), this is a noon activity and does not take place in the evening. Shame really, as it would add some interest and ambience to the evening atmosphere if it were to operate in the evening.

I would go as far as saying remarkable for a not so known city in Poland unlike of course Krakow etc. Old Market square was bustling and full of life,colour, religious traditions being Catholic Poland, music, Eastern European Architecture, food and shopping.

Like so many Polish town, there is a nice-looking city hall in the centre and it is all a tourist can wish for - some restaurants around, some souvenir shops, etc. etc. However, if you walk around the city hall, your eye will be attracted by some most terrible 70's structures. As if someone was trying to ruin a perfectly looking cake with decorations made out of stone and glass. These buildings house some rather unimpressive museums which could easily be located anywhere else - in order to 'tear this wall down'. Behind the city hall there is a public toilet which one can use for 1.50 zloty.

Can't recall closing times but seems to be pretty late
Might be cold in the winter but the vodka soon warms you up

Enjoy

Poland,Old Market Square,5.0,"The Old Market Place or Square ( Rynek ) in Poznan in definitely a must.

I can with 100%% honesty that the Poznan Rynek is today one of the few medieval squares in a large city that you can actually walk peacefully. There are numerous other Old Market Squares ( Rynek in Polish ) like those Kalisz, Wroclaw, Warsaw and even Krakow, the largest medieval square in Poland.

But most of them already have was too many tourist in my opinion....except Kalisz and Kepno

During the night there are more than 40 cafes, restaurants and even nightclubs, since it it a university city per say. The cobblestones were renovated and are not a problem even for elderly. They are really flat!. Many musicians also play songs from classic to modern, usually with chamber orchestra instruments.

I would recommend the following stops:

1) the ""merchants buildings"", which are all different, historic and colorful,

2) stopping by at noon at the old town hall, where two goats show up ( a small crowd gathers to watch)

3) take photos of the 3 impressive copper Fountains of Apollo, Mars and Neptune

4) Like mentioned before, have dinner or cafe at the Restaurants on the ring of the Square

5) Finally, there are many souvenir shops on the footsteps of the Merchants buildings...

Again, it is a must, because you can do all of this without ""zillions"" of people passing by! Go for it!

There is also a museum of Armaments, and an art gallery (Arsenał). Have a drink at Dragon, pizza at Frontiera, or traditional Polish food at Ratuszowa. Plenty of places offer coffee, cake, and ice cream. During warm weather, several places set up terraces on the perimeter of the square, offering food, drink, and people watching.

Also - primary place for restaurants, gift shops, bars, etc. The main attraction is the Ratusz Poznanski (Town Hall) with the animatronic goats that come out from the tower every day at 1200pm to butt heads. It's really the heart and spirit of Poznan so you'll probably spend most of your time here. Even after you walk around and have seen everything, it's a great place to just sit at one of the shops, drink coffee, and enjoy the sights.

The other man doing the practical demonstration of making the cheese was, as other reviewers have noted, very funny and quite a character. Afterwards there was the opportunity to press and take home your own little cheese. We enjoyed the history and demonstration and would recommend this attraction to anyone. They do tours in English so check before booking. My only suggestion would be for them to have some soft drinks on sale, as having walked to get there we were very thirsty by the end of the presentation.

The owner was very friendly and spoke very good English. After a short wait we started the show and were led through to the cheese making area.
It was very clear that authenticity is incredibly important and we had a genuine baca (traditional cheese maker and guru) go through the entire process of making the cheese the way it should be done.
He was over 70 years old and has been making cheese his entire life so was a clear expert with a big personality.
The show was really engaging despite being in Polish which we do not speak. The owner sat with us and translated all of the information so we did not miss out on anything.
We ended the show by forming some cheese into a mould.

The cheese that we tried was delicious, the hospitality was fantastic, the show was incredibly informative and the dedication to making sure that this important Polish tradition does not die out or become diluted by pale imitations was inspiring.

Get educated, get a quality product. Real Ozcypek must be made from at least 60% sheep's milk. You are guaranteed to get real Ozcypek here within season. Not some diluted cows milk version.

This is a hands on experience, where the cheese is made right before your eyes, and the guest is encouraged to be a part, stirring the milk and squeezing the water from the curds. Great for kids as the last bit gets you to make your own little cheese form. Well thought through and thoroughly enjoyable.

Whole presentation takes around 2h (little bit to long for kids), after that 0,5h workshops (forming a cheese). Chief is involved and speaks with passion. Mountaineer is well known local from Bańska Wyżna. Funny and friendly guy. Windy a little bit - still professional enough to tell you everything about OSCYPEK. I dont know how it looks like when translated in english. Some words are uniqu as well as mountaineers dialect so your impressions could be worse If You are not Polish born and bread.

Poland,Waly Chrobrego Promenade (Hakenterrasse),4.0,"Waly Chrobrego (Ramparts of the Brave), named after Polish King Boleslaw I Chrobry (11th c.) it's a beautiful promenade located on the bank of western branch of the Odra River. Place is also known as Hakenterrasse ""Terrace of Haken"" named after mayor of Szczecin in years 1878-1907, whose initiative it owes its creation. Designed by Wilhelm Meyer-Schwartau, the complex made of promenade planted with trees, terraces, fountain, pair of symmetrical stairs and viewing pavilions was build in place of old, 18th century, city's fortifications demolished in second half of 19th century. Construction of this one of the most monumental and interesting urban and architectural complexes in this part of Europe took 19 years. In the meantime, the original idea has been extended by erecting to the north of the original complex, buildings of the municipal museum and regency, which together form characteristic silhouette visible from the main access routes running from the east. To the south of the Ramparts one can find Zamek Ksiazat Pomorskich (Dukes of Pomerania Castle), Gothic Archcathedral Basilica, Old Hay Market Square and the other attractions. To the northwest of the promenade there's Park Zeromskiego (Zheromsky Park). Ramparts of the Brave are completed by two restaurants located on its opposite ends. In the summer time one can find there small carts of ice cream sellers. Really nice place for walk with many attractions located in walking distance. Too bad that museum was closed down due to the restrictions.

Could not find any Tourist information office anywhere even though we googled things. Not much to see that was of interest because of the lack of English in museum brochures. No tourist brochures were found anywhere so you may drive around or wander aimlessly.
Szczecin is not set up for tourists and in general aside from Krakow two days away, which is beautiful and full of tourists, the local Polish people were not as friendly or courteous as we had hoped.
We will certainly be more inclined to spend our tourist dollars elsewhere and omit Poland from a return visit.

Poland,Waly Chrobrego Promenade (Hakenterrasse),5.0,"This was one of the highlights of our trip, with scenic views over the river and its collection of tall sailing ships, river boats and activity. Whichever level of the promenade you choose, there is plenty to see and be part of, but the water level and museum level are separated by 128 steps and no lifts, so access for people with mobility difficulties is a problem. At the higher level there is the wonderful Maritime Museum with National Museum above containing busts of famous people, lots of ancient Roman art and, when we were there, an exhibition of African Art and Living. Beside the museum is the Naval Academy, and opposite that a lovely restaurant serving everything from tea to steak, with alternatives for the children (toys too). Well worth the time to see this part of town.

The address is correct-this is in the city of Szczecin.We visited Aug 9,2013 and coincidentally they were hosting the Szczecin Firefighter Challenge ( kind of like a strongman competition for firefighters). The streets were blocked off and it was set up like a carnival. Great atmosphere and plenty to see, eat and drink. The location itself is very pretty(beautiful architecture and the waterfront with ships.) All in all a great spot to walk around. I would recommend it even if there were no event going on.

Poland,Old Town,3.0,"Like much of Warsaw, the Old Town is a soulless place. Old Town is a reconstruction of what previously stood before World War II, albeit a fraction of the original surface area. Only the main central area of the Old Town was rebuilt, and it lacks energy. It's just a tourist attraction essentially in the middle of a city which greatly lacks energy to begin with. I've never actually seen a city of so many millions feel so downtrodden and bland. Contrasted to Gdansk or Krakow, Warsaw barely has a pulse. Compared to the not so distant Baroque Vilnius, it fails miserably. It is what it is. The Old Town can be visited in a short period of time, and hour or less by foot to see most of it. It's important to rebuild which was lost, and it must be praised as good policy.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"Rebuilt from the ruins and ashes of World War II, they've done an excellent job restoring Old Town. A must see when visiting Warsaw. Great place to walk and enjoy the sights. It's very popular with eateries, ice cream, shops, etc. available throughout. A great place to take your time and enjoy walking the old ramparts, streets and alleys without the bother of traffic. Strollers would be ok here, but backpack carriers for kids makes it easier when it's crowded.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"Just visited the square. Very nice buildings on it. Most were recreated after the war as the nazis had flattened most of the town . Many eateries, shops selling a variety of goods and buskers musicians everywhere in the evenings. There are churches which are still functioning today and also a fortified type of castle complete with a moat and all. Very easy to access as the bus 175 comes to the old town square from the airport. As do many other buses. Things reasonably priced and in the evening the town is lit with a multitude of sparkly fairy lights around the mermaid monument and people go skating at the rink. The small stalls which remind me of Christmas market stalls sell mulled wine, hot chocolate and snack. Very impressive and a must visit

It's a historical fact that most of the buildings in Warsaw, they say more than 80 percent, were destroyed by the Germans and then the Russians during World War Two.
Todays rebuild is extensive, visually seeming complete, impressive.
The historical karma of the city is hard for the historically knowledgeable to overlook. Visiting in the winter Warsaw still feels as though it suffers from the fact that a terrible genocide occurred here less than one hundred years ago. Its sad and hard to overlook, hard to seperate from Polish politics of today.

The heart of the area is the Old Town Market Place with many restaurants, cafes, and shops. The surrounding streets feature medieval architecture such as the city walls.

The Old Town was established already in the 13th century. During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, the area was badly damaged by the German Luftwaffe. Parts of the Old Town were rebuilt, but immediately after the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, nearly everything was again blown up by the German Army.

After World War II, the Old Town was rebuilt. So the Old Town is not as old as it looks, although as many as possible of the original bricks were reused.

Rather than just redevelop the site of the old town, the people and government undertook the incredible task of rebuilding the old city, a project that took a quarter of a century. Today visitors can walk down the cobbled streets through the historic city scape thanks to the commitment of many historians, architects, workers and volunteers. The crowning glory was the restoration of the Royal Castle in Warsaw. The story of the Old City and Royal Castle is very well interpreted in a number of the city museums in the old city. More than an historic attraction, the Old City is a grand statement of the city's resiliance in the face of disaster. I was very impressed.

Poland,Old Town,3.0,"This is ""must-see"" when you are in Warsaw, but as well as... I'm convinced it's not worth seeing. Sound strange, doesn't it?

The old town is the main tourist area in this capital, it's obvious and typical. When you are visiting some historic city, you should go to its old part. Here there is no problem with access - you have many city trains (because of the traffic jams it's recommended transport type) or buses from any Warsaw district. You have plenty of things to do here: you can visit the castle or one of many museums, eat some tasty (but expensive) meals, drink with your friends or go to a concert.

On the one hand, everything is all right. On the other... I'm inside the old town, but I can't feel historic spirit here. Warsaw was rebuilt after the II World War, maybe it's the reason why I don't like buildings here. I know they aren't so old. Moreover, this area should look different.

Poland,Old Town,4.0,"In all honesty, I find the Old Town sections of Prague, Krakow and Wroclaw more beautiful and engaging than Warsaw’s. That said, this lively and charming city within a city offers many pleasures for strolling, biking, eating, and looking. Not the least of which is the miracle that it is here at all. Flattened by the Nazis during World War II, the area has been painstakingly rebuilt to its original configuration – streets, alleys, palaces, churches, and homes; all back to the way they were, or as close as possible, whether Gothic, Baroque, or later in design. The broad market square, regal Castle and Castle Square, and architectural and artistic details, such as the “Warrior” Little Mermaid statue, along with the shops and restaurants make your visit a visual feast.

Nearby, you’ll find the picturesque “New Town” with its lovely main square (founded to celebrate the Viennese victory over the Turks in 1683 in which the Poles played a decisive role). Less congested than Old Town, it contains some remarkable Renaissance and Baroque architecture. New Town pretty much flows right out of Old Town and the distinction between the two (other than the lower key atmosphere) is pretty arbitrary. The walk there also offers a splendid river view from high above the Vistula.

Beautifully cobblestoned streets and alleys, including one of the shortest streets in Poland (probably the world too), palaces, churches and restaurants to recreate the destroyed magic of another era.

It is an excellent location for a walking tour or strolls with numerous cafes and restaurants. Or one can simply buy a ´Lody´ (swirled up local icecream in cones) and keep walking. It is easy to access Public transportation as well.

The legendary Mermaid´s statue is also found in the big old town square. There is the New Town square as well. There is another square right in front of the completely rebuilt Royal Palace.

So beautiful, full of catholic churches. Lovely to visit the city and country which has so much history with mine (Lithuania).

A word of warning though. We took a taxi from Warsaw Centralna to Old Town on the way there. Cost was 20 zloty but the first taxi we went to asked for 40 zloty.
Beware ripoff taxi drivers as 20 zloty is the norm.

Served with salad and on a Brioche bun in half. My wife had the English breakfast and struggled to finish it. The portions were more than enough and we never really got hungry until the evening and as you dine you can watch the activity in the square.

The waiters were great and the service was excellent. When the food arrived it was well presented and very flavorsome Cost was Pln 32 approx each plus drinks were also reasonable at 8-10Pln (Pln) Polish Zloty. They take all credit cards and cash.

Although members of the EU they have not chosen yet to adopt the Euro as they are trying to build up their economy and in some places, this is at the expense of the tourist with silly prices. This restaurant was not cheap but mid-range. They also have a good dinner menu. well worth a visit.

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"While the Warsaw Old Town is a reconstruction of the original Old Town destroyed in WWII, it is a really cool place to visit, as is the New Town, which is adjacent to Old Town. A few tips:

1. Beware of taxis that don't use meters. After numerous successful taxi rides, we caught one from New Town to the Uprising Museum. Upon arriving, the driver extorted us for 40 Euros, claiming that he was a ""private"" taxi. Upon returning to our hotel, which was actually further than the museum, the official metered fare was about 3 Euros.

2. Old Town at night is a blast. Lots of outdoor eating, drinking, and street artists. A lot of fun.

3. On Friday and Saturday nights there is a hologram light water show near Old Town. Ask your concierge for information. The show is free and begins about 9:30 pm. The following is plagiarized from another TripAdvisor site:

""Opened in May 2011. Located in the Podzamcze district a short walk to the north of the old town, the Multimedia Fountain Park as it is known is a visual delight combining music, light and, as the name suggests, fountains.""

Poland,Old Town,5.0,"The old town of Warsaw is majestic, it really is. It's almost completely pedestrian only so it's lovely to walk around. Plac Zamkowy makes for a great place to start with the red bricked Warsaw Castle, colourful old houses and huge column.
The highlight is undoubtedly the old market square or Rynek. It's a stunner and it's a lovely place to sit and have a beer or some food.
Most of the old town is a maze of colourful cobbled streets, with charming restaurants and souvenir shops. The trick is to just wander without a plan and you'll discover delightful little shops, hidden squares, elegant buildings and old restored houses and churches.
Definitely the highlight of a trip to Warsaw in my opinion.

It can get very touristy in mid-summer but if you wander off the principal streets with shops for tourists, you can have small and narrow alleys practically for yourself.

The mother and daughter cleary could not see what we were seeing (SEE PHOTO),but it was the most hysterical thing I have seen in a long time. The artist clearly had a sense of humour. My wife and I could barely contain ourselves from seeing this caricature unfold,and were eagerly waiting for the young girls reaction on completion. It was just so funny!

Sopot is a beautiful town on the Baltic coast of Poland with large sandy beaches that seem to stretch for miles.

We visited the town and beach on a chilly rainy day so no beach time for us. We did get to walk the wooden pier and view the beaches. Beautiful coastline.

Worth the trip to such a sweet small town.

The sandy beach with well-developed gastronomy network and beautiful views . A bit crowded in the season. In some places on the beach there are changing rooms. Paid toilets. Sunbeds for rent. There is a water scooter rental in the season. The beach is guarded by lifeguards. The beach, stretching for many kilometers, is also a great place for walking. I recommend.

You must pay to use the portaloo style restrooms on the beach near Starbucks, there’s someone there to take your cash and I noted one toilet with a Starbucks motiv. I don’t know if buying an over-priced coffee allowed you free use of the restroom- I bought the coffee but didn’t need to use the facilities.

This beach is like far too many I see these days - littered with cigarette ends. I’ll never understand the mentality of those who care so little for our world that they discard the remnants of this filthy habit at their derrières for others to clean.

The trip took one hour and it was a good chance to see the views of shore and massive docks of Gdansk.
Sopot Pier is long, there is at least one restaurant offering food and drinks. There is an entrace fee to the pier, so when you leave off to the beach & town and want to come back to fetch the ferry again, you have to pay for it. It's not much though.
The beach is ok. Water was not very tempting (green and muddy - algae?), but we took a dip, because it was so hot! Luckily they have showers on the beach. No rooms to change your bathing suit though except for toilets (fee, only cash).
Right next to the beach are restaurants and shops, parks etc. easy to reach. And not too crowdy (June). They also seem to have nice bicycle roads.

What’s so special is that long green area parallel to the beach. When you’ve had enough of sun bathing you can find a bench in this lovely park and chill there. Or hire a bike or an electric scooter and explore the area along the cycling path. There’s a separate pavement for pedestrians too.

Unfortunately we couldn't find anywhere to rent sunloungers, it must be too early in the season. We walked back into town and managed to find a beach mat and cushion which was fine.
We had a paddle in the sea expecting it to be very cold, but it felt quite pleasant. Sopot is a very nice resort with lots of old villas, many which are being renovated into modern seaside apartments.

Poland,Sopot Beach,3.0,"Sopot was a big disappointment to me. I thought it would be like Jurmala in Latvia and similar places with old wooden houses. Nothing like it, not that I saw anyway? The beach is nice ok but most of it is private pay beach. And in the public part there are many drunks sleeping it off or getting drunk. ( In July ) Not that I really mind, I like a drink myself ( not on the beach but who am I to judge? ) So if all of the beach was free I'd give it a higher rating. But now it didn't give me good vibes.

Poland,Sopot Beach,1.0,"First of all the water is so dirty and there are too much algues. They are also really stinky. The toilet is really expensive and the beach is unkempt. There is nowhere to change to swimwear or back, so you have to go into shrubs. When I went there it was gross, because people had peed and pooped all over the shrubs and on the sand. GROSS! Do not recommend.

Poland,Sopot Beach,3.0,"The beach is many kilometers long and is beautiful with nice sand, pretty buildings alongside the way and the wide ocean to look at. The water, however, is quite dirty with floating seaweed and dead bugs... The bottom is good to walk on but it's quite shallow. So it's a perfectly fine beach to spend some time but I got bored due to the fact that the bathing isn't so nice. The beach walk is pretty nice though, well maintained but at times far to many trees to see the sea.

Very few on beach cafes or shops as these are mostly set back from the beach. Access is from a parallel path and cycleway separated from the beach by 225m of trees making the beach feel very private and cut off from the campsites and hotels lining the walkway.

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"We’ve been coming to Sopot and Gdansk in the summer for almost 10 years.

The beach here has lovely soft sand and not surprisingly gets crowded at the weekends. Although the Baltic Sea is cooler than the Mediterranean, on a hot day, it really doesn’t matter. It’s perfect for young children as you can walk out 50m and be waist deep.

Along the beach are numerous restaurants which sell beer, soft drinks and food. Usually they are pretty busy but the quality is decent enough. You pay more here than away from the beach but it’s still reasonable. A Tyskie beer (0.5l) will set you back around 8-9zl (about £2).

Just off the beach is a Promenade that stretches from Gdansk to Sopot and beyond. If you have bikes it’s a great way to get around.

We love coming here. It’s safe for the kids, cheaper than most of Europe and you don’t get too many tourists.

Afew trains can be caught they run about every 15 mins, Sopot is not the final destination of theses trains they go further on so check the route map on platform.

The sand is soft and pleasant to walk on, even on the chilliest day, and if you're lucky, you'll be joined by the practically tame swans who paddle in the shallows. There is a delightful path (half pedestrian/half cycle) that extends all the way to the little museum in the south and a wonderful forest walk loop in the north. These paths, beaches, parks and forested areas are so immaculately maintained, I actually saw a workman using a snow shovel to gather the sand that had blown onto the paths to then replace this on the sand dunes. I wish all seaside areas were so well cherished and maintained.

I have spent a lot of time in Northern Poland so chose this time to base myself around Sopot. Sopot itself is wonderful with every shop, bar and restaurant to cater for everyone, but close to the sea for those after business evening walks. Great place to rest after a hard day whether to run along the sea promenade or rent a bike to cycle beyond....however I must say I was incredibly angered at being stopped by the 'ladies with umbrellas enticing me to spend my time watching their colleagues dancing semi naked on the stage' Not for me as very happily married but rather painful at being stopped 5 times within a walk of 200 yards. These entices really are the utmost pain when all you want to do is see this beautiful city. At times I could feel myself pushing beyond politeness to anger....to the point of saying I was gay! But a beautiful city with immense activities for everyone and very very cheap....a must visit for anymore. A wonderful place to impress your other half for a romantic weekend as has all you could need and more. Wonderful restaurants, hotels but above all some idyllic places to walk and spend time together....whether it's 'hand in hand' or sweeping her or him off their feet in one of the many dance spots. Great cafés to sit and just people watch even on the chillier evenings as most places provide the trusted I keating blanket and outside gas burners....idyllic but best of all 'cheap as chips' in all areas, dining,accommodation,drinking and transport.......

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"Just spent 3 days at sopot where we dropped lucky with mid september red hot weather which meant 3 days of sunbathing,walked down towards the pier then went to the left and at beach bar we rented lovely new sunbeds for about £4 each for the day and found the sand very clean and a pleasure to stroll around,2 beach bars very close and nobody bothers about everyone taking glasses onto the sands with beer around £2 for a large glass,we had planned a bit of sightseeing but it was great and unexpected to lie in the sun with a good book and beers ,the sea on the otherhand was not very pleasant with about a 5 yard strip of weed and litter at the edge to walk through to get to the clean water but the baltic even with the sun was definitely not at mediteranean temperatures yet lots of the locals were taking a dip,would i go back here a definite yes if we can be as lucky again with the weather as locals told me we had the best of the whole summer.

Poland,Sopot Beach,2.0,"We went to visit Gdansk, lake Ilawa, Torun and spent last day in Sopot, very disappointed as highly recommended by Polish friends. Most hotels here are over priced and could spend same amount of money in five star hotel in Gdansk. Few bars and restaurants even weren't bother to give the change back. Couldn't see much Polish culture even traditional food which could easily find from street to posh restaurants everywhere else. Suggestion, stay in Gdansk and take a day trip to Sopot from by boat.

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"Catch the tram from Gdansk to Jelitkowa and you are at the start of a gentle walk either through woodland or along the beach to Sopot. The beach is clean and has fine sand. There are many places along the woodland walk where you can access the beach and watch the wind and kite surfers. The walk to Sopot is about 40 minutes and you arrive in the bustling spa town. A Sunday visit found a vintage car rally, many food stalls, open air entertainment and lots of local people! The pier is wide and long but unlike Gydnia pier is not free to walk along. Sopot is an attractive town with some interesting buildings. You can rerun to Gdansk by local train. A good way to spend a Sunday!

We arrived at the train station and walked to the taxi rank, we gave the driver the details of our hotel who made out he did not know where it was, he asked another driver who gave him instructions with all this commotion going off ,we did not notice he had not activated the meter .he drove down several streets and said he could not get to the hotel and then stopped a person on the street who then gave him directions. Anyway when we finally got to the hotel he asked for 17zt which we gave him 20zt note which he put in his pocket and went. The hotel said we were robbed as the hotel was only two streets away from the train station and the cost should have been about 10zt max.so if you see an old driver with a large white moustache don't use is taxi. The hotel had been open 10 years .sopot is a lovely place and thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights we stayed.

The beach is wide so it provides a lot of space for a lot of people. There are bars and attractions for children so it's ideal place to spend day by a sea. The only downside might be cold water but it's Baltic sea after all, what do you expect? :) At the time of our visit there were jellyfishes on the shore but they were not pricky ones so there was no risk. Being in Gdansk bay the beach is not facing open sea so the water is mostly calm with small or no waves and the wind is not so strong as on north coast of Poland.

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"We stayed for a week as a family; 2 adults (50+) and two 15 Yr. old girls in July/August 2016. The journey from the airport is no more than half an hour and was quite simple in the hire car. The temperature each day was in the 70+ F (20+ C). Although we did have rain/thunderstorms for a couple of days. The area was very nice and we found plenty of things to do. There is a cycle path that runs from Sopot along the coast towards Gdansk.
We hired four bikes for five days at a total cost of £125 and rode to and from Sopot almost every day. There is also a footpath that follows the same route as the bike path. We were about a 20 minute walk from the centre of Sopot. (3 Km) along the beach towards Gdansk. The area we stayed in was called Jelitkowo and was very nice with its own access to the beach.
While we were there the sea was suffering with flowering blue green algae and so while the beach was open, swimming was not allowed. However after three days the algae disappeared and swimming began again. Paragliding for two was less than £50 and 15 Mins on a jet ski was less than £25. The beach was clean and fully covered by life guards along it entire length.
The beach at the front of the Sopot Grand Hotel is divided off into different areas with high quality sunbed and lounging areas, which are charged for. This location seemed to be a major attraction for the ‘Beautiful People’. There is a one pound charge to access the Sopot Pier; however there is another smaller Pier at Molo Brzeźno back along the cycle path towards Gdansk, which is free.
We have been to Poland on a number of previous occasions, however this was our first summer holiday and we were pleasantly surprised. There are numerous beach bars and also restaurants of varying cost. We ate out as a family and including drinks we paid between £30 and £125 for three courses. The choice of food was also very good. There is a beach bar called KILPER if you get the chance try the KILIPER fish soup it is really nice. They also have live music here on Friday & Saturday but it gets very busy and people end up sitting on the sand as all the table s get taken. The White Marlin is another very nice place to eat, although this was at the top of the budget from a cost perspective.
The centre of Sopot was busy in the evening and Monte Casino Street was very popular with visitors, there are lots of bars that give a great view of the main square and the main street if you are into people watching.
We also travelled to the local shopping Mall called the Review at Gdynia, the choice of shops was excellent and the prices were much less than the UK.

Poland,Sopot Beach,2.0,"From what I had read and heard about Sopot, I believed I would come to a charming little beach town. Instead, what greeted me a few days ago (July 2016) was a swarm of people in a scene one could describe as Disney meets the Baltic.

Upon arrival it seemed as though there were 15,000 people between the top of the promenade and the beach. Families and holiday makers stroll aimlessy by countless restaurants, pubs, street artists and vendors all seemingly trying to figure out what to do with themselves other than eat another ice cream. Once one gets to the beach, one finds oneself at the entrance to a large pier, which if one had ready access, an overview of the situation could be beneficial. Instead, you have to queue up in a long line to buy a ticket just to access this advantage. A ticket to a pier with nothing on it? C'mon!
The beach itself is long and sandy, but on the two days I was there, sandflies were so aggressively abundant that it was impossible to relax. They were everywhere and in constant attack mode. Even the ocean surface was totally blanketed by them, making swimming hardly appealing. It was actually pretty gross. Even for someone who loves to swim, regardless of the conditions, I couldn't bring myself to venture out into the muck.

In all fairness, seeing as I have yet to find anyone else writing about these insects, perhaps they only exist a few days during the summer and then die out. I hope so. Two more negatives exist, however. The water is pretty cold and shallow for a long long way out. As stated before, I am a swimmer and the temperature is what it is, but I prefer beaches with a little bit of depth. For kids, however, it's probably excellent. The second downer is Sundays. Loud disco booming «music» and a dj in the middle of the beach is set up in order to entice kids onto trampolines and into playing with «Nivea» beach balls as an advertising gimmick. It really kills any serenity, but hey, some people like a carnival.
The positive sides? If the sandflies disappear one can walk a long way from the promenade and find some kind of peace in the clean white sand. The other, is the food. In Poland almost any restaurant on any level has it down and can offer reasonable prices and cold beer.

Poland,Sopot Beach,5.0,"OK, I am partial to Baltic beaches. I think they are the best in the world. They are wide, the sand is soft, nearly white, the grains are small, they are ideal to sit on and relax in good weather or to take a stroll when it is chilly. They seem endless in Sopot stretching from the port of Gdynia at one end to the city of Gdansk at the other. You can either use a paved promenade to walk, cycle or skate on or the beach itself. There are some restaurants and bars along it and WCs are being built for your convenience. I am always curious what there is round the corner so it is a place for me. The scenery is stunning and Sopot is the best known seaside resort in Poland. There are numerous hotels, restaurants, pubs, clubs, art galleries, shopping malls, old, pre-war handsome houses, the pier and the sea with the beach. And everybody speaks English! What a wonderful time we had!

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"I had never been to any parts of poland before, but I grew up on the Barrier Reef, and the Gold Coast and it takes a lot for me to like a beach. I have even complained about Mauritius.

However, I went in February, so obviously it was freezing, and I cannot imagine for one moment that during the summer it is going to be warm in the water, but the beach in Sopot is just beautiful.

There is a wide beach, that stretches over a very long distance, and the sand is white and small grains. I have to be honest, come the summer, if I am able to find cheap enough flights and accomodation, this WILL be my summer vacation spot. After all, I am a family of 6, I cannot afford Antigua and Australia every year!

I highly recommend this for everyone. And if you are on a budget, Poland seems to be so cheap anyway (especially if you are able to find the restaurants off of the main tourist streets).

Absolutely beautiful.

On one hand, it's long, sandy, clean, with good facilities like bars, toilettes, watersports etc., not extremely crowded even in high season, large access to the sea without having to face rocks or stones, water is very shallow and mostly clean.
On the other hand, it doesn't have the features that would make it great for beach lovers: water is generally very cold, there are many algaes, a few jellyfishes, they have occasionally problems with bacterias in the sea and have to forbid access to it, there are no umbrellas to rent and way too many people going there to party, clothed, instead than sunbathing. It feels more like a party/sport spot than a beach. Perhaps it has to do to the climate or to the proximity to the main club strip in Sopot but if you go there to swim or suntan you'd be sorely disappointed.
It can be beautiful, if you come for the right reasons.

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"Beautiful place to relax on the warm sand or take a dip in the Baltic Sea. It is surely difficult to find a comfortable place to sit down on the beach after 1 pm as it is quite a popular location.

Finding a good place to swim is not difficult as long as you avoid the heavy amounts of algae, which is only seen in certain areas along the shore.

I suggest anyone interested would go a bit earlier than the afternoon to settle properly and more comfortably.

There is also a chance to find amber along the shore. This beach is also known for it's amber findings however, it is mainly found very early.

It may be better to purchase drinks or liquids outside of the beach area. It is very expensive. Unless you do not mind that of course.. we sure didn't.

My personal pros and cons:
Pros | Very great spot, a must.
Cons | Expensive food and liquid
Very crowded
Shore can be covered in algae.

Poland,Sopot Beach,5.0,"The sales rep for Baxter Italian Furniture at Vitkac, Bracka, 9, Warsaw, and I were lolling around on the buttery leather showroom sofas and chairs...Trieste, Hard&Soft Slim, & Chassis, to be specific pretending to be Goldilocks, chatting about life when she said I must see Sopot, her favorite spot in Poland, her home town. The only thing we were missing at that point was an icy dry martini, straight up.

Now, if you could experience these sofas and chair you would not doubt this young woman's word. Off I went on an ideal day trip from Gdansk.

Sopot is about an 18 minute train ride from Gdansk. I think as a senior with ID you're eligible for a half fare ticket. That's what I did for less than 2 zloty. To be sure check with the tourist center.

The walk into town passes a small Asian shop on the left filled with household accessories, snacks, & tchotchkies. Then, if you're lucky like I was, there'll be a photo op, on the park bench...a young man sleeping off the night before his leftover fifth faithfully waiting. A local man just rolled his eyes and said they were plentiful. So far I'd seen no drunks or homeless anywhere in Poland so I considered myself lucky. Perhaps, you'll be too.

Next, on the right in front of a little grassy garden patch is the 5 star, 1920's, Hotel Rezydent, Plac Konstytucji 3 Maja 3. Pop in here and you may find some free magazines (In Your Pocket) that will help you on your way through Sopot., longtime mecca for the international set.

Out front you can meander the pedestrian promenade of Bohaterow Monte Cassino as it's known, down to the sea. I'm learning all these names after the fact. I just wandered hither and yon to the most compellingly obvious and so should you. It's more fun that way.

On the left of this pedestrian walk I found an antique/auction house gallery with lovely Russian icons. On the right, a clothing shop with cashmere for ladies and men, upscale accessories. Next, a ticket office for the local theaters? which had some interesting Stalinesque poster graphics, photo op. Outside on the left you'll find a shopping mall complex , the architecture of which looks like its been anthropomorphized and shown Munch's ""The Scream"". Laugh or cry if you must depending on your aesthetics. On the right there's an interesting sculpture high up. I'll say no more in lieu of a spoiler alert. Finally, you're at Europe's longest wooden pier, 511.5 meters, as it looms straight ahead.

Ambling out there you see beautiful beaches to the left and right, yachts, sail boats, and a clown, a musician? Following the shore to the right there is a path running the length of the beach. There are shops all along the way, some interesting, some not. One of them recommended their favorite restaurant. Overwhelming mistake and I'm not alone in that opinion. Egregious trap; can't cook worth sour apples.

So much for hindsight. Those of you who are hooked up to the latest technology google away beforehand for reviews on your phone or watch. Technology does have some strong points.

The real draw for me was the fish shanties along the right where I (starving for want of finding any Polish cuisine with strong flavors) bought a half pound each of smolked salmon and eel. Bring cash. If you're a foodie don't wait for the duty free where it'll be 5 times as expensive. Now, I was looking forward to the evening's repast, smoked fish and icy vodka shots.

As I returned to the pier I spied Flaming & Co. which to my surprise sported attractive beach décor touting US Montauk graphics. Inside the restaurant was raucous with happy diners, usually a good sign. This is where I would have chosen to dine but the latest reviews say it's closed.

It's become the ""White Marlin"" not yet open but supposedly now part of the Chinski Zhong Hua Hotel next door. Don't you love that word, Chinski? It sounds slightly politically incorrect. Never mind. To some reviewers this hotel built in 1996 seems incongruous but I found it had a quirky charm (the Chinese idea of the Adirondacks?) and bathrooms if in need.

To the left of the pier the obvious choice is Sopot's Grande Dame, the Grand Hotel, part of today's Accor Hotel group. Its construction begun in 1924 was completed in 1927 at the cost 14 million Reichsmarks. What is that equal to today?...plenty. Its formal gardens facing the sea beckon you forward around to the front.

Through the lobby l found a lush neo art deco bar and expected to find Hercule Poirot seated nearby completing the fantasy. Surprise, I got an overdressed aging Adolphe Menjou canoodling a sweet? young thing, a third his age...the bar's only customers.

This sight propelled me out of the room. Had I just encountered a portent or a plant? for the walls of the next room were covered with 20th century B&W photo portraits of the famous and infamous. You decide. How many can you recognize; what country are they from? This will reveal your age.

The third wall sported a B&W noirish '40's film, ""Casablanca"" caliber, with sous-titres. There I ended a perfect day, solo, in what felt like my own private screening room. Just me and a pound of smoked fish and some lovely memories.

Waiter, I'll have that martini now, iced birdbath glass, extra dry, straight up, anchovy olives, vermouth as a concept...sounds like a plan.

GO SOPOT!

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"keep in mind - Baltic Sea is a cold sea - once you expect that, you won't be disappointed. Area is beautiful & if you're staying near by - visit the beach at night with a black light to look for amber pebbles - they glow in the dark - so they're easy to distinguish from sand & other little rocks. That was our favorite part. Me & the kids found 5 pieces. Not valuable, but we FOUND them, not purchased them :))))

Poland,Sopot Beach,4.0,"Crowded in summer, yes, but still worth going to as you can always find a spot somewhere that suits. In early August the water was not cold, not warm, and did take a bit of time to get used to, but it was well worth a dip to cool off from the warm air temperatures. Kids making sand castles, lifeguards actively alert, lovers strolling hand in hand; I even saw a professional photographer taking photos of a bride and groom while they sprawled on the sand in their wedding attire! alongside the beach is a lovely park full of shade trees and numerous restaurants should one have the desire to have a meal.

It's a simple, straightforward walk from the train station to the beach. The train itself only takes about 40 minutes from Gdansk. Worth going for the day even if you aren't staying in Sopot.
