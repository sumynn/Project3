Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The Jameson Experience started as soon as we were entering the Distillery. We loved the interior how they managed old with new elements. Because we came a little earlier we enjoyed the included drinks before the tour and were even allowed to bring them with out on the tour - so no rush and need to finish them quickly!
The tour itself is very informativ; the history and making of Jamesons is presented in a multimedial way. Due to our highly entertaining guide Cilian it really was an experience. The tasting at the end felt as a little game/quiz show - we liked it a lot!
What a pity, we could not tip him by card!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,"Venue and bar options were great. Bar man on arrival was friendly and made 2 banging cocktails. We weren't directed where to go for the tour on arrival , meaning we were made to run downstairs to check in when the tour was about to start. The tour itself was very insightful but Erin the tour guide was very impatient and frequently said it was her last tour of the day , meaning she rushed through it and didn't allow people to enjoy or ask questions. Felt like being at school being told off by a teacher. Delivery very robotic and not engaging as it could have been. After the tour ended we went to get our free jamesons drink at the grog bar and when we engaged in conversation with the bar man he replied with 'I should have been home 30 minutes ago' , again making us feel unwelcome. I wanted to buy quite alot of merchandise from the shop , when I returned from the toilet after the tour the shop was closed and the bar too. We were not informed of this on arrival or by the tour guide. Pretty disappointing .

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The cocktail making class was fantastic. We made a couple drinks and had a great time learning a little about Jameson. This place is 1,000 better than Guinness. After your tour or class you can enjoy some Jameson at the bar. I highly recommend doing this and skipping Guinness.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,We chose the cocktail making class at Jameson Distillery and absolutely loved the small group experience. We made three different cocktails and were able to stay in the bar for an extra 1.5 hours after the one hour formal class. Our teacher was so knowledgeable and fun to be around! We also enjoyed getting to know the other couples in class with us. This was a unique and fun way to learn about whiskey and Jameson!,Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"We had the best time in Jameson's Distillery. It was a perfect present for my hubby's birthday. Kayleigh who was a guide for our tour was excellent, fun and told the story perfectly. Very knowledgeable and interesting.
Later on we did the cocktail masterclass with Ciaran who is absolutely nuts and we had an absolute blast! And we loved every second of it. All the staff members were friendly and made our tour very enjoyable. Definitely coming back to bring more friends to enjoy this fun expirience. Thank you",Oct 2021

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,the tour guide does it only in english with irish accent not always obvious for foreigners. but it was interesting and very well done,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"The tour was interesting, quite short, but each of the 3 rooms offered something interesting. Liked the fact that you get to taste 3 types of whiskey, would have liked 2-3 extra minutes though to sip them. You get a free drink at the end, but they also have cocktails should you wish to spend some more time there, as it's a nice bar.

Overall we enjoyed it and would recommend it, but if you can choose only one tour for alcoholic beverages in Dublin, I'd go for the Guinness one.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,Even though we knew the original distillery was closed and moved to Cork we thought that the location would be more representative of an old distillery and offer more insight into the workings of a distillery. It was mostly a bar with a store. The tour was below average in my opinion and rather costly (I've been to others). I will say the staff was quite helpful and courteous.,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Jameson's whisky is smoother because it's triple distilled. Scotch whisky has a peaty taste, whereas Jameson's is very smooth and pure. Scotch, if you do a compatative tasting, tastes a bit like cardboard compared to Irish whiskey. The Bow St Distillery is a good place for a tasting, but the whiskey is distilled in County Cork.",Jul 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This was a fun tour. Naill was our tour guide. He was funny, educational, knowledgeable and helpful. I'm not a Whiskey drinker, but I now love Jameson. The staff in the pub, were very helpful and friendly. They also showed us how to make cocktails with Jameson.",Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"You can't go to Dublin and not visit the Jameson distillery. We had no reservations or plans to explore the distillery itself so just went straight to the bar (through the gift shop and after buying a nice warm jacket of couse). My wife had one of their cocktails while I tried the ""family tasting"" menu. You can't go wrong with ordering pretty much anything on their menu.

We both enjoyed our drinks, walked around the place to take a few pics and left with his smiles on our face. Would absolutely recommend to visit if you're in the area.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,You will learn the history of Jameson and hear how whiskey is made but only by viewing videos. Skip the tourand go straight to the bar for a drink. That's why you came anyway.,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Learned a lot about John Jameson and the process of making the whiskey. Aiofe was our guide and she was lots of fun and very knowledgeable. Added the cask draw, was well worth it to see the cask room and taste a draw directly from the barrel. Would recommend to anyone who has not seen it. The complimentary drinks weren't bad either.",Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Great tour and great place.

The decor and the layout of the distiliery is brilliant. Modern, clean, warm and inviting. Bow st and Jamesons certainly got everything right here.

Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and the latest tech used to help with the tour is very interesting.

It's a whiskey lovers dream. Even if youre not a whiskey person the tour and building is a good way to spend an hour.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,The tour was very well run and the employees were knowledgeable and professional. Erin the tour guide was excellent in her presentation to the tour.,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I had a phenomenal experience with the guided tour. The whiskey is made in Cork so it's not the type of whiskey tour where you see it being distilled, but it tells the story of Jameson and Irish whiskey in general, and gives you a chance to compare it to whiskey from other places. The experience is very well managed and the tour guide was very knowledgeable, engaging and passionate. I honestly enjoyed it more than the Guinness storehouse.",Dec 2020
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"A lot of fun and an excellent experience. My partner doesn't normally enjoy whiskey, but she was right on board and found one she liked!",Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,Erin our tour guide was the bomb.com. she was so knowledgeable on Jameson whiskey put my Irish whiskey knowledge to shame and I know alot.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,A great look into the History of not just Jamesons whiskey but Irish Whiskey and Ireland itself and how that had an effect on them.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"We visited on Tuesday 24th August for the whiskey cocktail class. It was absolutely brilliant!
From start to finish whole visit ran smoothly didn't want it to end.
We made two cocktails and tried a whiskey summer punch. Our host Paul was fantastic, very informative!

Awesome staff, tasty whiskey and wonderful atmosphere",Jul 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Irish whiskey was once the most popular whiskey in the world; now it is undergoing a revival. It's not hard to understand the appeal of Irish whiskey -- it's silky smooth. Scotch, on the otherhand, has a peaty, burned taste that some people find unpleasant. By the way, Jameson's whiskey is now distilled in County Cork, in the south-east on the island.",Jun 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Excellent experience, staff very friendly and certainly knew their stuff Erica was the perfect host with good chats, home mixing tips and the best whiskey sours and old fashioned we've had. 100% would reccomend to a friend.",May 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Growing in Western North Carolina, in the mountains outside Asheville, where our neighbors still produced their own mountain dew, I developed a taste for whisky (whiskey!) that I still indulge in. Jameson is my go-to choice for Irish coffee and a finger or two neat, and I suspect that the Irish might've taken over the world if it hadn't been for Guinness. I signed up for the ""basic"" tour with my daughter and really enjoyed the tour and presentation. Our guide enlivened his presentation with humor, a charming accent and decent acting chops. The tasting element of the tour was especially well-done, doing a far better job educating us about the differences between whisky and bourbon, single-malts and triple-distilled. than we might have, just bellying up to a bar with a chatty barkeep. Every tour includes a stop for the merch, and the Jameson's was no different, with some unusual goodies to tempt even the most jaded shopper. No spoilers here. Spring for the ticket and take a photo by the chandelier on your way out. Note - I travelled here in June 2019, pre-Covid, but I guess I waited too long to submit the review, and I could only choose March 2020 as the date of travel.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I have tasted whiskey in some out-of- the-way places, including Japan, Taiwan and Tasmania, which were very good. The Irish claim that they invented distilling, and say that their whiskey is best. Compared to Scotch, which has a smoky taste from the peat, I'd have to say Jameson's is smoother. Since the tasting, I've bought a few bottles of Irish whiskey, which I enjoyed. By the way, the Jameson's distillery is now in County Cork, in the south of the island.",Dec 2020
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"After visiting my first whiskey-related place in Dublin, I was full of doubts before visiting another attraction of this type. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded. The tour was terrific. The guide was very energetic, and he taught us a lot about the history and process of whiskey making. Everything was well prepared for each visitor. You get three small samples of whiskey (see my picture) - Scotch whiskey, American whiskey, and Jameson (Irish whiskey) in the tasting room. They explain why each one smells different, and they teach you to taste the subtle differences in each one. After that, we went to the bar and got some delicious cocktails. I’m not a whiskey fan, but it doesn’t stop me from recommending this tour. Enjoyable experience!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"Jameson distillery is a really cool, open plan building, with a large bar area in the wooden craft style. Obviously, with ongoing covid restrictions, it can't be enjoyed in the same way, but it is a great space.

We visited last autumn to do a cocktail making class, which at the time was half price. That was incredible value for what we got for it. We learned to make whiskey sours, old fashioneds and a punch in a small and safe group.

Our instructor Kieran was a good sport and really knowledgeable, and just made the whole thing great fun. I'd love to go back in the future and try a different tour experience, or just enjoy the bar.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I recently attended the Blending class experience this was my second trip to Bow street. My first was the normal tour. The Blending class experience was excellent. I have visited many distilleries but have never experienced a tour like this. The tour guide was very entertaining and knowledgable. She really engaged us in the blending class. It was very intimate with only 6 other guest on the tour. I bottled my own whiskey too as it was my birthday. I cant wait to back two more experiences to
Try the cocktail making class and the tour of john Jamesons office. Hopefully I get to do it before my next birthday.

If your from Ireland support local and give this excellent experience a try. You wont regret it

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,Well to say impressed doesnt put into words how good the cocktail mixing class was. We were brought into a slickly styled room with everything ready to go. What made it was the instructor Ciaran who from start to finish showed us how to make the cocktails and was a brilliant addition to the craic the lads and Myself were already having.

When you visit the distilery, you will do a comparison tasting with whiskey from othe countries, see what you prefer. Irish whiskey is going through a boom, but it is still good value. You can visit the site of the old distilery in Dublin, but the actual distilery iss now in County Cork.",May 2020

We couldn't believe the level of careful planning that had gone into every last detail to make our visit safe and enjoyable during these difficult circumstances. The staff were really entusiastic and knowledgable, answering all our questions. The visuals during the Bow Street Experience were incredible. The most memorable part of the day was drinking straight from the cask in the maturation warehouse.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"When I booked this tour, I expected it to be very ordinary. Like what you would expect from any distillery tour. The usual walk around and gawk at the equipment and learn the process, get your free drink and be done. But this was way more than that. The entire experience had a sense of elegance and sophistication to it. We got our tickets and waited in the wonderful lobby and bar area until our tour was ready. The lobby/bar was quite and it seemed like a slow day or time for the tour. We met with our tour guide and he walked us upstairs to a little museum looking room where you could wonder around and explore the tools and history of Jameson. We then entered a round room where our tour guide took us through a lovely history of Jameson with amazing projected illustrations to provide a visual. He told us how to properly pronounce the brand, to which I had no doubt that I was pronouncing it correctly until he pronounced it for us. We then went into another room where we immersed our senses in the distillation process. We smelled different smells and saw another wonderful projection of how the distillation process works. After a few minutes of activating our senses, we went into the tasting room. Our guide took us step by step on how to properly taste 3 types of whisky (one of which being Jameson obviously) and helped us describe what we were tasting. After drinking all 3 samples, we finished our tour and headed to the gift shop where you can purchase the usual t-shirt, mug or magnet or, you can purchase some of their exclusive bottles available only at this distillery. We then headed over to get our certificate saying we completed a whisky tasting at Jameson and then headed to the bar for our free drink. This tour was extremely educational and turned me into a Jameson fan. One insider tip: don't take this tour on an empty stomach.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"The Jameson family has been making whiskey since 1780 and we were invited to touch, smell, and taste the whiskey during our tour. The adults do a comparison taste of Johnny Walker black label, vs Jameson, vs Jack Daniels and that was amazing. My 11 year old watched everyone
like a hawk during the tasting, but she enjoyed the science lab part where you rub barley in between your hands really fast and smell the difference between processed and unprocessed barley. My favorite part of the tour was the free drink at the end where the adults enjoyed a Jameson Ginger & Lime, and the 11 year old went for the apple juice. Tip: book online so you have tour time that you want. I think we did the 3:30 and it wasn’t that crowded.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"Absolutely fascinating! The distillery has been converted in to an amazing experience if walking through the history of the factory. I can’t remember exactly what the tour was called, but it was the Bow St experience, where it runs through the history of Jameson and how the recipe and process of different to other distilleries, with a very interesting taste-test comparison at the end. My tour was run by Erin, who I think she said it was only one of her first few tours (3rd, 4th or 5th or something like that), but based on her confidence and enthusiasm, she was a seasoned professional! Erin was accommodating, funny and just a lovely, bubbly personality to be around.

Big fan of the ceiling decorations on the ground floor! Made entirely out of old Jameson bottles 👌🏻

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I've always heard and seen Jameson in pub and restaurant but never really tasted. This experience was great, learning about the history and all the meanings behind the brand was great. And realising I do actually like the taste and will now order Jameson occasionally.",Jul 2019
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Ok, where to start. We took the tasting which had a single, double and of course the Jameson triple distilled comparison. The history of the Jameson family and the factory are discussed in detail and does not disappoint. Taste the distillery version that can only be experienced at the distillery. Become an ambassador and get your name on your very own bottle. After your tour, stay in the main floor bar, be social and have a few glasses and enjoy!",Feb 2020

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The tour the with the tasting is really great! I did it twice and was super impressed how both of the guides absolutely nailed the presentation about the history right at the beginning! The whole experience is absolutely great and I felt like the guides really know what they are talking about.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"Erin our guide was excellent. The tour was interesting and very modern in regards to the visuals during the tour.

Erin made all the information very clear as well as allowing questions.(Never of guessed it was her first tour when she revealed at the end!)

Only critism was we thought there was more history to see but having a drink at the bar after was a good oppurtuniy to take in the classic look inside.

Definately worth a visit.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"I am an Irish whiskey lover and i don't love touristic traps.
as i arrived in Dublin I asked around, to locals which was the best distillery to visit, and most of the people directed me to Jameson.
I decided to go for the tour by myself, but in the end, I found myself there with an amazing man, who wanted to share this experience with me.
The Jameson atmosphere worth the whole tour, money and whatever it takes you to get there, is fully in line with the whole Irish mood, magical and crazy.
The tour was great, full of information and very dynamic, our guide was lovely, full of energy and inspired. The explanations on the distillation process together with the tasting was great, it really gives you a bit of knowledge on whiskey and it's very interesting.
Once the tour ended, we spent some great time at the bar, an amazing place, structured between the ancient distillery style and the modern drinking bar, a cuddling atmosphere nobody can resist to. I went out and i couldn't avoid to look at my man in a different way, was it Jameson or something else?

You learn about the history of Jameson and the way they make their whiskey. It was about 45 minutes for the whole tour and it had 3 different stages to the tour. The first stage was the talking about how it all got started and when they expanded and all the history behind it. The second stage was talking us all through the brewery process and what goes into it all. The third and final stage was the tasting which we got to taste the famous Jameson along side other whiskeys and compared them. Overall a great tour which I enjoyed a lot

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,I.m in heaven after visiting the Jameson Distillery. Although the whiskey is no longer brewed in Dublin it is a great experience to learn how Jameson is brewed. The guide was brilliant and funny showing us around the distillery. Smelling and tasting other whisky producers really highlighted the superior Jameson. At the end of the visit the complimentary Jameson tops off the visit.,Mar 2020
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"We had a good time here. Open spaces (lots of people), something to catch your attention in all directions, pretty well labeled as to where to go for tours, etc. We booked the whisky makers class and it was GREAT. It happened that there just one other couple besides ourselves - complete happenstance, but I'll bet that this is an overlooked opportunity and under subscribed - so the experience was more personal, not rushed. Learned a lot, VERY good presentation, hands on experience, Better tasting opportunity, I think, than the regular tasting tour.",Jun 2019
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Thanks to Brian (you should pronounce it ""bree + an”, NOT ""bry+an"" (that's important!) and Bow St. Distillery now i know about Jameson family history and about whiskey itself much more. It was January 6th, monday, very first scheduled tour. There was only 6 of us, one girl from Germany, three american guys (if I do recall - Ryan, Paul and Kenneth), one guy from Slovakia and me - ""Russia"".
We had very interesting tour with Brian and afterwards - really pleasant time in bar.

In gift shop you can purchase special treats for yourself or your dear ones.

From Russia with love and promise to come back someday,

I only started to drink whiskey more but it was awesome to be educated on the different hints and notes of flavor. I love that they provide you with a free drink before or after the tour.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"So the weather may have played a part in our enjoyment.

Picture the scene:
We have prebooked a valentines weekend away in Dublin and we end up in the middle of storm Dennis. We didn't prebookany tours as we just wanted to see where the weekend would lead.

After being battered by stormes we decided to find the jameson Distillery on foot, we arrived to a small court yard that had a family of 4 having some photos taken outside of the doors, it's eemed very dark, very wet and very quiet. The family snappers a picture of us and left. At this point of the weekend I was pretty down beat, the weather was ruining out child free Weekend.

As we opened the doors it was like stepping into an advert, the place was busy, happy, cheerful, the decor was beautiful, enormous jameson bottle chandilliers hung from the ceiling with golden wood bars and large tables of people enjoying a whisky, chatting and just getting to know each other.

We went on a tasting tour that we has to wait 15mins to attend (very reasonable for not pre booking) but that's was OK as we enjoyed a little drink with the rest of the people enjoying what was on offer at the Distillery.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This was by far our favourite experience in Dublin! We didn’t know what to expect, and having been to the Guinness Storehouse we thought we may get something similar. We were so wrong.

Dervla was so informative and engaging, and from learning all about the history of the distillery, through to how each batch is made, the ingredients used and the science behind that, and how these things ultimately create the taste of the whiskey, we were enthralled. A really fun experience, fo whiskey drinkers and haters (like me!!”) alike! We were just gutted not to be able to buy a big bottle to take back in our hand luggage!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"A part of the Dublin Pass, where sadly they don't make whiskey here anymore, it's made down south. However, the tour wasn't really a tour but an interactive experience, with lights and moving animation of the history and making of Jameson. However, if you are photo sensitive epileptic then the first room could trigger that when there's the discussion on war, due to the lights.

However, I like that we can smell and touch the barley and yes there's a free drink at the end. I did buy some miniatures to go home with. Overall I would recommend.",Feb 2020

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"I visited with my sister on our weekend away to Dublin. I had already been to the Teeling Distillery on a previous visit and as my sister had never been (and also not a huge whiskey fan) we decided to try the Jameson tour.

We arrived early and got on an earlier tour. Our guide (Lauren) was really great; friendly, informative and made the tour really enjoyable. The tour itself has a good range of talking/information and interactive parts.

We did the comparative tasting as part of our tour. I had previously just tasted different varieties within one brand and so to compare one brand to others from around the world it was really interesting.

We really enjoyed the drink afterwards in the bar and the bar/entrance area is just really cool looking and had a nice buzz/atmosphere with people coming and going for visits.

I think I preferred the Teeling tour as they actually distill the whiskey in Dublin so there is more to see that isn't just pictures/diagrams BUT at Jameson you also get a different story, a really interesting history and it is still well worth a visit! It takes a different approach and different options and we really enjoyed our visit!

The only thing I would suggest is that unlike other tours they do not have a clockroom so you have to carry your bags round with you - this is not a big deal but might be something to consider as people often come to Dublin for weekends and have backpacks etc.

The tour itself was about 40 minutes. It gives you a history of Jameson's, Irish Whiskey, and was differentiates both from other whiskeys such as Scotch and Bourbon. There was also a good overview of how it is produced. The tour ended with a tasting, but unlike other distilleries, one did not taste two or three Jameson products. Jameson's was tasted and compared with a Scotch and an American Whiskey. This definitely showed to the visitor what makes this whiskey special and different.

A beautiful facility and a wonderful sensory and tasting experience. Thanks Niall, I’ll be stealing some of your jokes..",Feb 2020
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"We arrived by taxi, as our Hotel suggested due to Dublin's busy streets. We arrived with pre purchased tickets as well, that we bought online before we left for the trip. The Distillery is breathtaking as soon as you enter! There are so many features to look at, the Jameson chandelier, artwork, the barrels on the wall. We were taken to an area to wait for our tour guide. The tour guide was friendly, knowledgeable and funny! It was a great tour, my husband was one to sit at the table for the testing and he was very excited and happy as he loves Jameson. Our group size was good probably about 12-15. After we received a ticket for our free Jameson, we shopped at the gift shop and bought more than enough of Jameson, Clothing items and gifts. Would definitely go back again when we visit!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"Everything about this was just a fantastic presentation. Kinda like an adult Disney show - lights, music, interactive presentation. It lasts about 40 minutes and at the end you go into a room and taste some different whiskeys and learn how to pick out the different flavors as well as where they come from. Honestly very nice. At the end you passerby your ticket for a drink - neat, on the rocks, or as a cocktail.",Feb 2020

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Wow!!! I can’t remember the guys name who gave us the tour of the distillery but he had a silver water bottle and made banter with the Brazilian/ American I hope that’s enough to tell him how amazing he was!

I enjoyed the history behind the family and the making of the great whiskey it’s self!

Going to the Jameson distillery wasn’t on our too do list but we couldn’t resist and found cheaper tickets online while sat on a bench down the road.

You need to try it!

Amazing place! Would go again

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,We did the whiskey taster tour for €25. The tour was good and was the right length of time. We got to sample 3 different whiskeys to compare the differences and also got some background of the distillery. After the tour we got a free drink of Jameson included in the ticket price.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"We done this tour as the first of three in the city and it was the best. The most interactive even although there is no distilling done in Dublin the wealth of knowledge Kayleigh had was great. You go on the tour and then get 3 tastings, a scotch, Jameson and bourbon to see the difference. I’m no whisky/whiskey drinker but Jameson was the best. You also get the choice of a daily grog (name is explained on the tour) of either a Jameson straight up, on the rocks or ginger and lime. The bar is very relaxed and we stayed and tried a few cocktails. The best I had in Dublin. Def recommend the pear and blackberry sour!",Feb 2020

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"As someone who's lived in Dublin all my life, I was showing a friend around and decided to try out the Jameson tour. We had Aoife as our incredibly vibrant, entertaining, slick, engaging guide. I loved every moment of the tour. It's incredibly well done, lots of audiovisual impressive effects to keep us entertained, a lovely human element to keep us laughing, plenty of interactive scents and tastes to learn from, and overall just really educational.

Wish to purchase there.",Jan 2020

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Enjoyed every moment of this experience. Even if you’re not a whiskey aficionado (or aren’t even that much of a fan) - there really is something for everyone.

So much thought, effort and attention to detail has gone into the tour from the brilliant tour-guides to the beautiful presentations that are amazing examples of using artistry and technology to make history so entertaining.

But the best part for me was that it was not remotely snobby (as some whiskey experiences often are). There is plenty of expertise, tasting and shopping available for the seasoned whiskey-drinker but also wonderful and tasty whiskey options (cocktails, teas and coffees) for those who are not.

Best tasting tour I went on in Dublin. Highly recommend.

Only comment: implement a way to tip the hardworking and talented mixologists using card machines. I didn’t have any Euros on me and tips were very much deserved!

That's such a perk. Tasting that whiskey immediately and keeps the energy flowing. Then we followed up the tour with the cocktail making class. That was fun and educational.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"We just did the tasting, but thought it was well done, fun, and well worth it. It was a small group and we did the tasting in Jameson's original office - pretty cool.

We tasted four very different whiskeys and overall enjoyed the experience a lot.",Jan 2020
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"Having done the tour on a previous visit to the fair city of Dublin we decided we just had to return for one of their amazing irish coffees which we tried last time and they were, as before, absolutely fantastic and most welcoming on a January afternoon after walking round the zoo.
The place itself is a bit difficult to find but is clearly very popular and busy with people on the tours and visiting the bar for a drink.
Will be back for another one next time too.",Jan 2020

I typically don’t like whiskey but came with friends that did....and let me tell you I absolutely loved the tour and the drinks! The tour is very interactive, interesting and delicious! I did the basic tour (ps. Get the Dublin pass as this tour is included in it 😉). Connor was our tour guide and he was very friendly, funny and knowledgeable. Kiron was our bartender, allllllll the drinks he made were amazing!!!! For someone that doesn’t like whiskey, I loved every drink he made. I definitely recommend this tour!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,2.0,"First of all, the most important thing (at least to me) with this kind of visit is to actually see the distillery! You absolutely don't get to do that. You get a short high school level lecture about some Jameson family history, the distilling process, and a short sampling of whiskey at the end. The guide was very good, and it's not his fault that the tour concept is crap, he did his best. My disappointment comes from the fact that the Bow St distillery is non-operational and has been that way for 40 years now. They could open up the place and let people actually see the distillery floor, show them the equipment and explain the process in situ. That's why Guinness opened up the Storehouse, because you can't take 10 000 people a day through a working brewery. Jameson doesn't have that excuse. It's definitely overpriced for what they offer.

Darren, our guide, was brilliant and well informed, making the tour his own. I don’t like whiskey but still enjoyed the tour, including trying the 3 whiskeys. Your €20 includes a drink at the end, whiskey neat or mixed as a cocktail, which on the menu itself is priced at €8, so we’ll worth the money and good value also.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Went to the cocktail making class with my daughter, who bought this for me for Christmas, from start to finish it was a blast. The distillery is worth a visit on it's own merit. all the staff we dealt with were great and knew their stuff. There's a whiskey bar and a great buzz.
The cocktail making course was just great fun. Our teacher and host Ciarán was brilliant, he knows not just how to make a great cocktail but also how to make a disparate group of strangers gel and have fun together. Jameson, cocktails and new friends, what can possibly go wrong? A great fun experience.

Everyone very friendly and helpful. My husband and I did this with our 30 something son and daughter and it was all great fun. Michael did our cocktail class and we learned a lot about how cocktails should be made (either by us or in a bar). He was also very entertaining. The rest of our trip we watched the bartenders to see if they were doing the cocktails correctly LOL. We did the Bow St Experience with Liam and it was very informative both about Jameson and Irish whiskey vs Scots. Hands-on with materials to smell and see. Ended with tasting of Irish, Scots and American whiskeys. Finished with a whiskey cocktail. Definitely worth doing.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Ive been Bow St a few times but since my last visit the bar area has been massively expanded. Its fantastic and you can visit for drinks without having to do a tour if you dont want to, its a great space, really vibrant.
We did the cocktail class at around 50E pp. It was great, everyone has their own station to work at and you start with a tasting and then make 3 drinks, you get a cute lanyard which you get to keep along with a journal to take home.
Id definitely recommend the class.
The only thing I can say is I really wish they sold the kit in their shop - Id happily have parted with my money for an ice scoop, some spirit pourers and an Jameson apron!

All the important things you need to know about the history of Jameson, how's it made and how to taste whiskey. And all this information in only about 30 minutes!
Thanks to Kayleigh we had a blast. Although we were a group mixed with lots of not English speakers, she actually did speak very fast. But her jokes were the best, picked individuell for our group. She made ourselves feeling comfortable by letting us introduce ourselves at the beginning of the tour. That made it easier for all of us to get a hang off how well known the Jameson whiskey actually is.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This was a far better tour than I thought it would be. You start out with your choice of a Jameson drink (rocks,Jameson and Ginger,one other I don't remember). Then you meet your tour guide. After some ground rules you move on to see/hear a history of the Jameson company and how the whiskey is made. Then, if you like as NO ONE is required to drink, you move on to the taste testing and compare different brands of whiskey and how they compare to Jameson.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The Jameson Distillery is a MUST for anyone with some time in Dublin. Its a favorite of mine because you can either take the tour, or just come in for a drink at their (super cool) bar! The drinks are big, strong & not outrageously priced. The tour itself wasn't your typical distillery tour which was refreshing! We both felt like we came away with a better knowledge of Jameson and whiskey all together. It was neat to compare Jameson to other whiskeys we drink all the time and see how they are alike and different. We felt we were getting good value for our money for both the tour, gift shop and drinks. We spent hours in the booth there drinking with friends and never once felt rushed by staff. 10/10 recommend - 100% worth it!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I was proud to be able to see this museum.For me what made it even more interesting that I had visited the Teeling whiskey factory before and there we could actually see the factory working.We had a sample of their whiskey and could compare it with Jameson's.So when our guide at Jameson was talking about the historical background,then seeing the process of production on a video, I understood the steps much better.I loved the part where we could taste the difference between American,Scottish and Irish whiskey.Jameson was the best out of all.",Jan 2020

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The tour itself is fantastic, and based on reviews it sounds like everyone was happy with their tour guide. This to me, is a tour done right, it is not too long, or too technical, and you get whiskey at the end! A win-win! You will enjoy this, even if you're not big into Whiskey. Included is also a free drink ticket at the end, for a drink of your choice.",Feb 2019

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,"This was one of 4 drink related tours that we had booked during our 5 day trip and was probably our least favourite.
The tastings were described as comparible, and I suppose we expected to be comparing different Jameson products, instead you are given 3 tastings, the Jameson standard product plus 2 other non-Jameson designed to highlight its superior quality. In my opinion, Jameson missed a trick here, as had they been offering a comparison of the Jameson suite of whiskeys, then I may have been tempted to purchase one of their superior products - alas no tasting meant no purchase.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I did the Bow St tour with Kayleigh as well as the Tasters Experience with Cillian, both were extremely knowledgable and the tours were very personable, which is much different than Guinness.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Make your tour reservations first, as we did. And we were hungry, so we took advantage of a nice restaurant in the Jameson complex (Christophe’s, which I reviewed separately). Original distillery is now a visitor center, no longer make spirits here. Original building with trusses showing age and in some cases, fire exposure. We took two tours, Bow Street Experience provided an overview with tasting. Secret Tasting Experience was a more in depth tasting experience. Overall, spent 3-4 hours here – well worth the time.

First part of Bow Street Experience shows history of Jameson (pronounced Gem-eh-son), a family business with long-term employees (job were often passed from father to son). Symbol of a man carrying a barrel pays tribute to the workers that built the business. Tour highlights sights and smells of the fermentation process. We got to look at and smell the grains, malt during each stage. Darker liquid aligns with longer fermentation times. And historical artifacts, including bottles hidden during prohibition. Saw ""Sine Metu"" in multiple places - Latin for ""without fear"" and is the motto of Jameson Whiskey. More history - bottles, original factory. Brian was a very informative and funny tour guide. Tasting at end of tour #1 - three different types of whiskeys: Scotch, traditional Jameson, and Jack Daniels (American). We learned about whiskey tears (aka legs - higher alcohol and higher wood tannin legs take longer to descend), body, how to smell it, etc.

Secret Tasting Experience featured a variety of Jameson whiskeys - regular, crested, distillery edition, and black barrel cask strength. Took place in original office for John Jameson - his original desk was there.

His passion, knowledge and his being a third generation Jameson employee (his great grandfather worked there) is what makes him an exceptional tour guide. The taste testing and learning the history was fun, knowledgeable, and interactive!! The only thing missing was a physical tour of the actual factory that is no longer in production.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,1.0,"Spending 22€ for the advertisement of their own distillery, and a commercial whisky tasting, didn't worth the price.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Man, this tour was epic.
We went for the classic St. Bow experience and had a blast.

The distillery itself is already a great place to have a drink and enjoy the surroundings and the vibe, but take the tour and you'll be in for a treat.

The tour takes about 45min to 1h (I think) and gives you the perfect amount of information.
Some history, some nice stories, information about the process and a tasting of course.
The way everything is described and shown is really cool unique!
It's in a very modern yet authentic way.

Our guide was Niall, shout out to him, what a great, passionate guide!

After the information and tasting you get a complimentary drink in the Jameson bar.

Overall I can be quite short about the Jameson Distillery: if you even have the slightiest interest in whiskey, you should go and visit the distillery!
The Bow St. Expercience is a great first encouter, if you want more in depth information, there's many more options to choose from.

Thanks for the experience guys!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This place is a must-see. Every part of the property is immaculate and very well done. But, the real star of the experience was Liam. Captivating, passionate, and energetic, Liam was very engaging and clearly loves what he does. Of all the tour guides we’ve had in the past, he sure stands out. His story about his great grandfather working at the factory was really interesting, as were the stories about jobs being handed down from father to son, and John Jameson making sure all of his employees were paid during the 3 week “Troubles” when the factory was ordered to remain vacant. Prior to the visit, I would only drink bourbons and single malt scotch. That changed after our tour here. After hearing about the history and pride, and of course doing some sampling (the blind taste test vs. a “leading” blended malt scotch brand was particularly convincing), I was converted to a Jameson drinker. After hearing about the history and passion, how could you not support this brand? Liam exemplified the brand and history, and hopefully he remains there for a long time to continue to tell the story of Jameson. We also did the private tasting with Susy. She was quite knowledgeable and really taught us a lot about properly sampling whiskies. The bit about open mouth inhaling was a really neat tidbit. I also learned a lot about identifying the various aromas, which was a great learning experience. Overall, for such a large company, the whole experience had a nice humble feel to it. Definitely check out the Jameson Distillery if you’re in Dublin!

Our tour quite was very knowledgeable and I’d give her rating of five out of five...especially when it came to dealing with a group of men on our tour that appeared to have been sampling a lot before the tour.
Moving from dark room to dark room where there was little seating was a little boring. It would have been nice to see where the whiskey was actually made.
The sample tasting was interesting, but overall I don’t think I’d recommend this tour. Walking around inside would have been sufficient enough.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Perhaps the most enjoyable visit I've had to any major brewery/distillery. Absolutely spick and span from top to bottom. Fantastic decor, incredibly friendly staff, great drinks and affordable prices.

The tour was exceptional and so well worth it. It was insightful, engaging and rife with information and experience. We got to see the different ingredients for the whiskey, the different stills in their different stages and the tour guide was humorous, charming and insightful.

The merchandise shop was loaded for bear with goodies, however I would say i found the merch remarkably higher priced than other products throughout Dublin tourist sectors. Not a complain, but a budgeting activity to be considered there if you wish to buy people gifts.

Loads of selections of beautiful and delicious whiskeys and people having fun left right and center. It truly was a fantastic experience.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"I was recommended to visit the Jameson Distillery by a friend and was a little sceptical as I’m not really a whiskey fan - however my friend told me this was an excellent place to visit even if you are not that keen on whiskey and he was spot on.

We bought tickets for the tour and our guide Hannah gave us a warm welcome then led us into the multimedia room where she gave an extremely impressive overview of the Jameson story.

Next we went into another room where we stood around tables for six people and were able to smell the barley and the learn about the various other ingredients used to make Jameson whiskey. Again, there was another excellent presentation by Hannah.

Finally we went into an amazing tasting room where we had three glasses of whiskey to try - the Jameson and also a Scottish whiskey and an American whiskey. This was fun and also really helped understand how Jameson is different from other whiskeys.

Finally we claimed our “daily grog” which is the free drink you get as part of the tour. I don’t like straight whiskey so had a delicious Jameson, ginger ale and lime drink which I really enjoyed. My wife enjoyed a Jameson on the rocks.

The venue is really fun with some excellent touches like the Jameson bottle chandeliers. I would not hesitate to recommend this venue to others visiting Dublin.

The tour was good. Learned a lot about the whiskey and how it differs from others but I thought I would see more of the what was left of the distillery that was used in the past. The tour is not an actual tour but rather a walk through the history of the whiskey. Still fun and you get a coupon for a Jameson drink at the end.

if you are not interested in the tour it is still a great place to stop and have a drink at the Jameson bar. You can buy and label our very own bottle as well

Next trip out I will be sure to see the actual distillery in Cork

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Even though this distillery on Bow isn't operating anymore, it didn't take away from the experience. Our guide was great, the history of Jameson is awesome and great to hear from the guide. It was nicely complimented with a great graphic story display. The guide did a fantastic job keeping the full tour on track. She had to remind a group in the tour multiple times to quiet down while she was talking and they were talking over her (they were rude). You could tell she was fed up but it was actually good to see her standing up and owning the tour.....you go girl! She was able to answer all my questions at the end. It felt like she personally felt an ownership with Jameson and loves and believes in what they do. Just one of the many benefits to having a guided tour!

The storehouse is nice and flows easily. The cocktail at the end was delicious! The staff in the store house were very attentive and offered assistance.

The only very slight negative was the bartender at the end. He was intensely engaged in his conversation with another employee. When we wondered what was in the cocktail, he quickly snapped ""Jameson, ginger and lime"" and immediately went back to his conversation. I'm sure he gets asked all day long what's in the cocktail and it was probably is 100th time answering that question that shift alone, but it was our first time asking and I didn't appreciate that snarkiness. I don't even care about employees having personal conversations, I'm never bothered by those things. It wasn't a big enough deal to take away from the experience, still gets 5 stars and we got a good laugh at how upset he was at our audacity to enquire about the cocktail!

The bar is beautiful and feels warm and relaxing. Would love to just go hang out and have drinks before heading out to dinner. Keep up the good work. Cheers!

First, learn about the Jameson story, then about how Jameson is actually made and finally, a little comparative tasting. A perfect 40 minutes. Informative and interactive!

However, I found that our guide, Kevin, spoke too fast. This was a shame. He is a fantastic story teller, but sometimes rushed parts which, over the music, made it hard to hear what he was saying so I felt I missed parts of the story. I came away with the key point (triple distilled), but some of the other important parts were hard to understand.

Staff on site were attentive and always helpful!

Definitely a good way to spend a few hours during a visit to Dublin.

The building is beautiful and the displays with the history were particularly nice. At the end comes the free tasting and you can have it straight or with ginger/lime.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.0,"We visited the museum in May 2019 pre-COVID; sorry for the delay in review.

We decided to visit the museum instead of going to one of the distilleries because we thought we'd get to taste more varieties of whisky. That is certainly the case but I'm not sure if you are provided more information about the methods? At any rate, it is an interesting tour, part serious and part funny, and you do get to taste several whiskies that give you an idea of the results of different types of distilling and storage. You end up in the bar and can order flights which help you decide which whisky is your favourite. And of course you can buy bottles of whisky of various sizes. Friends bought small bottles for relatives back home.

If you want more information, I suggest a tour of Jamison's but for a broad explanation of the industry and some diversity in tasting, try the Irish Whisky Museum.

Don’t get me wrong, the people who work there try really hard to entertain visitors but there’s not much to see and do. Even the best tour guide could not save this place.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"The whiskeys were fantastic and the employees were swell! Chaniece (our tour guide) was knowledgeable and well-rehearsed but personable.

The venue is also very aesthetically pleasing, and the gift shop had a swell selection of cute little whiskey bottles.

I stand by all of this so much that this is actually more than a year after my visit, and I still felt I should finally write a positive review when I found the business card just now while cleaning :)

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"My husband and I got to the museum about an hour earlier than our scheduled time. While we waited, we wandered around their cool souvenir shop and had a cocktail at the bar. There was a tour guide available and we were offered to move our tour to the earlier time. A chance for just the two of us to have a personal tour rather than being with a large group of people? Why not! Yes please!

Our tour guide was Fionn. He was very knowledgeable of whiskey history, and he was patient with us and our few stupid jokes. He was kind and led us through the museum at the perfect pace. At the end, during the tasting (we did the Premium one, 4 whiskeys instead of 3 with a souvenir Glencairn whiskey glass), he was very helpful in aiding us identifying our palate preferences and gave us brand recommendations. This museum does not get extra $$ for recommending or offering specific whiskeys, unlike some other tastings/museums, so we feel we got an honest recommendation.

I'm not a huge straight-alcohol fan, and I'm new to whiskeys, so we originally booked this tour for my husband and the history, but we left with a smile on our faces, a warm belly from the whiskey, a new understanding of whiskey and Irish history, and a new perspective of the buildings in the city. We HIGHLY recommend this museum and their tours, and Fionn in specific (although every employee we interacted with, both at the souvenir shop and the bar were wonderful.) If and when we go back to Dublin, we will be making a stop here again.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"We had a lovely half-afternoon at the Whiskey Museum with Maria. Thanks to her charm and expertise, we learned a lot about the long history of the making and export of Irish whiskey as well as the origin of several associated Irish phrases (e.g., ""dead ringer"", ""gouger""). The visit concluded with delightful guided tasting on how to serve and best appreciate Irish whiskey - the ""water of life"". A truly memorable experience - thanks again Maria!",Oct 2019
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"Loved it. Would recommend for any whiskey drinker. We bought tickets online and saved a little bit of cash. We arrived late unfortunately but they still accommodated us. Our guide, Eoin (pronounced Owen) really set the tone for the tour. He gave us so much information about whiskey, including why some are spelled without the E! He gave us whiskey history, Irish history, Irish language lessons (Uisce Beatha), and finished it off with a tasting. Some of the decor is a little wonky but again, Eoin made up for it. We had a blast even though there were only 3 of us on his tour LOL. We tasted 4 different whiskey's and then we received the souvenir glass to boot. It's on the Dublin Hop on/ Hop off stop. Go see it! P.S. If you're from Tennessee like we are, don't mention it HAHA!!

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"We had just gotten into Dublin as all of the tourist attractions and museums were closing down, and had settled on the Irish Whiskey Museum as our number one, ""must do"" experience that we weren't willing to miss - and I'm so glad we did!
Laura was an excellent host; she is an incredible storyteller, incredibly informative, and just downright hilarious. Not only did she make it easy for us to really learn how to appreciate the differences in whiskey, she armed us with knowledge of distilling styles, what to look for and even some recommendations for us to keep an eye out for! I absolutely loved the whole experience and I couldn't recommend Laura more highly!

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"It was indeed a good start to the day. I’m Scottish and so I know a wee bit about Scottish whisky but I don’t know too much about Irish whiskey.
So Laura H took us through a bit of history - fascinating! Who knew that a guy in a coma after inadvertently drinking methanol was thought to be dead and was thus buried alive?! And that once folk realised this, they had a wee bit of string running up from the coffin to a bell up on the surface to attract attention and say ‘hey, I’m still alive!’ Amazing. It’s where the expression ’dead ringer’ comes from. Who knows that?
Then the excellent Laura H guided us through a tasting and persuaded me to buy a bottle of Irish whiskey.
Well done - you convinced a Scotsman to buy Irish whiskey!

Being an independent definitely helped as we got to sample and understand the different varieties of Irish Whiskey - but I was pleasantly surprised at the detailed and entertaining history of the tour.

Top it off with a great bar staff for an additional sample after the tour and I'd recommend this to anyone with even a mild appreciation for Whiskey.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,3.0,"Tony our guide was excellent with his information and guide round and we learnt a lot but whole experience felt rushed to ensure there was no back log for next group.

Our guide had to throw at us a lot of information in quite a short space of time and didn't feel like we had a chance to take it all in before moving on to the next bit.

We also felt there was more to see when booking the experience such as equipment, memorabilia etc but there wasn't much to see.

Just felt the museum were trying to get as many people in as possible in a day which in turn rushed the experience.

We had paid a few euros extra for the premium tour so we had four whiskeys to try and a glass to take away with us.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,1.0,"This is not at all a museum. It's three small rooms with elementary decoration and a guide reciting a monologue. There's almost nothing to show - a drawing on a child's blackboard ""explaining"" triple distillation, a few dated animations. So you sit there while the guy rambles.. with frequent veiled negative references to Scotch whisky.

Although the group included folks from Europe and South America, the guide spoke with the strongest Irish accent and deliberate 1.5x speed, making it indecipherable for many. And when a couple gave up and began whispering in each other's ears, they were rudely admonished by The Professor.

If you're not Irish, think thrice. Read the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews.

It’s only €3 more and includes an extra tasting and a souvenir glass so if you can, I recommend doing the upgrade. There is also a full bar downstairs serving all sorts of drinks. If you’re like me and forget to pack your phone charger to use with your battery pack, there’s a SPAR around the corner that sells them pretty cheap.",Feb 2020

The tour guide, Paddy, was energetic and engaging despite only having myself and another young lass on the tour and was interesting and easy to understand. I actually came away having learnt a lot about the history of Whiskey!
The tasters at the end are well worth the extra price and Paddy was well knowledged and able to elaborate on all the different kinds of whiskey we were sampling.
All in all a throughly enjoyable morning and would definitely do it again when I return to Dublin with friends.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"Absolutely amazing experience.
On my holiday to Dublin, I went to every whiskey attraction avaliable. this had to be the best one in my opinion.
It's a guided tour where you're in a small group and lead into various rooms, to be told about whiskey and all its history. It goes into a lot of depth on information such as how various different types of whiskey is made, why the methods are named that way and why certain brands or whiskey done better than others. Then at the end, you get to taste and compare some whiskey. I went for the premium ticket, which for a whole €3 extra, I got 4 whiskey tasters, rather than the standard 3, plus a really cool little glass to take home, in a box. Definitely worth it.
My tour guide was Mark, who was the best tour guide I had thoughout all the attractions I visited during my 5 days in Dublin. Had a great personality. perfect mix of humour and being able to professionally carry accros the information clearly, for everyone to hear. He was also more than happy to answer any question thrown at him and delivered everything he said with great passion in his voice.
Would seriously recommend a visit here, whether you like the taste of whiskey or not.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"Looking for an experience that's different from the typical Brewery/Distillery tour? This is a great spot to check out.

Our group guide, Eoin, made the history of whiskey interesting and fun. The museum experience took us through three rooms designed to immerse us in three different periods in the history of whiskey: from its origins, through the early politics of its manufacturing, and into the modern era.

A whiskey flight awaited us in a final tasting room. There, Eoin helped highlight some of the differences in their tasting notes and recommended other whiskeys based on our preferences. (There's ticket options for 3 tasting whiskeys, another for 4 tasting whiskeys, and a cheaper, non-drinking ticket for those who can't/do not wish to taste.)

Overall, it was a great time. In addition to a bar area where you can pass the time waiting for your group to head upstairs, they also have a wonderful gift shop full of tasting packs, full bottles of whiskey, glassware, apparel, and more. The Irish Whiskey Museum is well worth a visit- educational and fun for everyone!

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,1.0,"We took a tour without tasting at the Irish Museum of Whiskey in Dublin. This is NOT a tour. An overcrowded group (no seats for all) strolls trough three rooms but we could rather be sitting in a lecture theater or whatever: only a few naive pictures are shown, you don’t get to see any distillery or what so ever. A prepotent guide speaks quickly with a terrible Irish accent although he already knows this is a frequent complaint (I am perfectly fluent in English, please don’t reply there are tours in other languages!) and was rude with a couple who “dared” make a parallel comment between themselves in a perfectly reasonable whisper tone. After a 45 uninteresting monologue, the ”tour” is finished. Don’t waste your money or time!

You’ll learn as much (or more) on the Jameson or Teeling tours, but this really was a fun stop, and probably more interesting for people who aren’t that in to whiskey. The best part was the sampling (pay extra for the premium tour...you get to sample something really special), and listening to the extremely knowledgeable guide describe the different aromas and tastes to look for. We followed up with a loooong visit to the bar, where equally knowledgeable staff guided us to some great choices from the very large selection.",Feb 2020

As a tip go for the €24 experience you get an extra nip for just €3 rather than the basic tour package.

There's also a good bar where the staff are really knowledgable and happy to guide you to a nip that will appeal to your taste.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,Laura was an amazing teacher. She took us through the history of how Ireland invented whiskey from the Monks who taught the Irish how to distill to the present day where around 50 more distilleries are due to gain their licence soon. We all enjoyed learning about triple v continuous distilling and how the creative genius of the Irish forced the government to make distilling legal because it made money through taxation. We bought the whiskeys we loved in their gift shop. A delight to add to your itinerary in Dublin. Thank you ☘️,Feb 2020

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.0,"Our guide Fionn was perfect, he spoke with a passion, I loved it, he has a real talent to spoke in front of the people,
I found the museum small, not enough attractions, instead of explaining how to do whiskey I would like to do some animations, be a part of making whiskey,
but in general it is worth to see
thanks Fionn!",Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"The guide, Ross, was very sociable and friendly. He's a great storyteller, made everything he said sound incredibly interesting. The whole tour was fascinating and passed in a flash. What I like the most is the fact that, since it wasn't a particular distillery but rather a general museum, the history and all the information about distilling didn't seem biased, there was no ""better/worse whiskey"" but rather just an informative and absorbing lecture.
The blending and tasting experience was amazing, Ross really guided you through everything and explained how theory applies to actual tasting and how the distillation process influences the flavor, so if you pay attention it can really change your night-out experience.
If you come to Ireland, learning a bit about Irish whiskey is a must and if you're wondering if it's better to take a distillery tour or the Irish Whiskey Museum one, I can wholeheartedly recommend the latter.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.0,"Our tour of the Irish Whiskey Museum was pretty good. It started off a bit hokey, and our guide was somewhat detached, as we watched a couple cartoony presentations about the history of Irish whiskey. The best part of our evening was when we went up to the tasting room and our guide livened up and became more engaging. What we liked about this tour is that it is not affiliated with any distillery and therefore you get a more balanced overview of the different whiskeys in Ireland. The tastings were nice and we appreciated getting a feel for the flavors coming from the different brands. We ended up getting our tickets discounted through a walking tour we took earlier in the day so we felt we got a better value from our experience. I suppose our tour would have been even better if our guide was as lively in the beginning as he was toward the end.

I think he did a nice job of describing the whiskeys during the tasting as well! I would definitely suggest a visit to the Museum - whiskey drinker or not.",Jan 2020

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"As someone who rarely drinks, and doesn't enjoy the taste of whiskey at all, i was unsure about this experience, especially being alone, but it turned out to be a highlight of my visit to Dublin! The gentleman i spoke to when enquiring about the different experiences available was so honest, enthusiastic and knowledgeable i was convinced the standard tour was for me.
Laura who was the guide for our group was amazing, keeping our interest throughout the rooms as she taught us about the history of whiskey in Ireland.
I was impressed with the layout of the museum and how it added to the whole experience.
Without giving too much away, i recommend booking a tour, and if you love whiskey go of the blending experience, it would be well worth it!

We definitely recommend this as a must do in Dublin!",Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,We came across this museum while walking around Dublin and took a walk in ticket to a classic tour of whiskey making in Ireland. The trip took an hour and the tour guide told insightful stories of the history and making of Irish whiskey topped off by a tasting session. Mark the tour guide was excellent and his story telling technique was spot on.,Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"If you love whiskey and you love history, this place is for you. They take you through several sceneries, tell you about events and history of whiskey, and finally serve 3 or 4 samples to taste. Real experience for your palate!",Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,We booked the premium tour which gave us a fourth whiskey to taste and a small whiskey glass. While we waited for the tour to start we took a peak in the gift shop. The lady that checked us in gave us info on the different whiskey available in the gift shop to purchase. Our tour guide was Janet. She was fun informative and friendly. I’m 51 years old and have never tried whiskey so I really enjoyed hearing the history of whiskey. She made it very interesting. She also educated me on the proper way to taste whiskey. She’s a great resource for all things Irish whiskey. Thanks Janet for a great tour!,Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,We booked the blending experience since we wanted to get to know more about Irish Whiskey and the differences between the varieties. During the tour we had a rather comprehensive overview of the history of the Irish whiskey presented in a very professional and humorous way by Fiona (special thanks) and learned about whiskey varieties. At the end we could construct our own blended whiskey according to our taste. Very recommended!,Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"Fabulous overview of whiskey in general but way more on Irish whiskey as it is unique, and its unique history. The tasting was fun too- it was nice being able to taste from a myriad of distillers and styles (while if you go tour a specific distillery you'll get similar basic information but only taste their product). It's lots of stairs, there is an elevator but just be prepared to trek up and down a few flights. And there's a bar for anyone who wants a full drink before or after or wants to keep trying more. Definitely worth the stop!",Jan 2020
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"There is one word that could describe the experience: Amazing!
The visit itself is really fun, and there is a lot you will learn in this museum.
You don’t have to be a whisky expert when visiting the Irish Whisky Museum, in fact you don’t even have to know anything about whisky at all!
Our guide, Fionn, was very friendly and entertaining. He taught us more about the history of whisky, how it is being brewed, and got us more familiar with the different kinds of whisky. After this visit, I still wouldn’t call myself a real whisky expert, but I definitely know way more about whisky than the average person does.

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"My wife and I just got back from a three day trip to Dublin. Since Irish whiskey is my drink of choice, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to book a tasting at the Irish Whiskey Museum. The whole experience was great and Mark was the highlight. He was just such a wealth of knowledge. Also very funny and personable, too. I learned so much about the whole whiskey-making process from fermentation to distillation to aging. Moreover, his ability to to break down the different styles of Irish whiskey (malted, pot still, grain, blends, etc.) gave me a much greater appreciation of all that went into whiskey. It also put a lot of things in perspective as far as why I like what I like. Another benefit of this trip is that it’s unbranded, by which I mean you’re not doing a tasting at a specific distillery so Mark was able to speak freely about some of the different brands without feeling compelled to “sell you” on a given spirit.

All in all a great experience and definitely worth the time and money if you find yourself in Dublin and you have an affinity for “uisce beatha” (the water of life)!

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"Got to go here as hubby whiskey drinker so wasn’t sure it was going to be my thing to be honest.
However we got there with half hour to spare so stopped I the bar for an Irish Coffee. Then a lovely chap called Fionn collected us & began the tour.
He had a brilliant sense of humour & great presentation style which brought the business of whiskey production to life for me. It was informative as well as enjoyable and by the time we got to the tasting I actually found myself wanting to try the beverages out!
We were on the premium option which meant 4 samples as apposed to 3. Hubby signed us both up thinking he would get to finish any I didn’t. He dipped out as I found to my surprise that for the first time I actually found a 2 whiskeys that I liked. I now know what to look for & am currently in a local pub putting my new knowledge to the test. Great way to pass a couple of hours on a winter afternoon. Many thanks👌🏻

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.0,Nice to hear some of the history of Irish Whiskey while in Ireland and get to taste different brands without a bias. I liked that they allow you to grab a drink ahead of time while waiting to be called and to take the drink with you on the 45 min tour. It is short and just a couple of rooms where you get more of a history lesson then you get to taste 3 to 4 samples depending on which ticket you buy. It is worth it and a nice stop on the list of things to see. It has a nice bar and serves a traditional Irish Coffee.,Jan 2020

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,Really enjoyed the Whiskey Blending Experience. I have done distillery tours before and they tend to focus on the process of making whisky and their brand story. This tour provides a more general overview on the history of whiskey distilling in Ireland. The story was told in a very engaging and fun way and some of the more technical aspects of whiskey distilling (i.e. what makes Irish Whiskey distinct from other types of whiskey in the world) was made very comprehensible.,Jan 2020

Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,5.0,"I was visiting Dublin again with friends and we went to the museum where we met Ross, our tour guide, who made the 1 hour tour extremely entertaining and informative.
I don’t even drink whiskey or alcohol in general and still found it a worthwhile activity! You get to taste 3 Irish whiskeys (or a generic soda) and learn a lot about the different kinds and characteristics.
Would highly recommend the tour and especially Ross who made it a highlight!",Jan 2020

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Extremely well prepared for CoVid travelers. One way trails are in place. There are also many, really good, porto-sans (outside toilets) that use a flush valve and have tissue and sanitizer in them. Thank you for that.

We visited twice. Once, when arriving in the area later in the day, for the short yellow loop, and then again the next morning for the combined red and blue Diamond loop. Very impressed with the maintenance of the trails, especially after a tremendous downpour two days earlier. The views along the trail change constantly as one reaches higher level. We found it very enjoyable.

Back at the bottom the visitor center was closed but the cafe open (outdoor seating but undercover). As I finished my coffee, the rain stopped and I set off for a second time . This time, the midges were out but they disappeared higher up. The views were beautiful and the hill really isn't as tough as it looks. The path has been made superbly. A great day out.",Aug 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,Three different walks to choose from and we went 2 days in a row to try another path. Excellent car park facilities. Lovely cafe in the courtyard. Well worth a visit.,Jul 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Connemara National Park is amazing, just stunning scenery. It's free to enter and has a big car park with toilets. Maps show you 4 coloured walks. The green is a forest walk, the yellow is an easy one around the animal paddocks and lower meadows. The blue walk goes up the lower slopes of Diamond Hill and the red one ascends to the top.
I cannot understate the beauty of the views all along the coast.
The surface is a mixture of gravel paths, wooden boardwalks and stone slabs. It is a tough ascent but really well worth it. If you have good runners and reasonable fitness you'll do it no problem, but you'll be tired! Well worth it though. Bring plenty of water though!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Something we've been planning forever. Finally, ticked it off the list today. The one way Covid system is easy to follow and helps that everyone is going in the one direction particularly on the narrow bits. Despite the constant moaning and complaining from teenage daughters most of the way up, they were delighted with the views and accomplishment when we got to the top. They're even talking about doing this again, can't get a better recommendation than that.",Jul 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,My friends and I visited the park on a day trip to Connemara and went early in the morning to avoid the midday sun which was a good call as climbing Diamond Hill was pretty tough for us inexperienced hikers.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"I would recommend this for anyone in the area. With three looped trails, the longest of which brings you to the top of Diamond Hill and some excellant views, the park is ideal for individuals, families and dogs!! I didn't need the centres facilities on this visit. The only comment I have is that there are no bins in the car park (only at the visitor centre) as I found out on my departure.",Jul 2021

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,Beautiful walk and congratulations to the staff for all the work they have done. Sadly the one way system lacks signage as many people just ignore what signage is remaining. Sadly the paths are too narrow to accommodate two way traffic in the Corvid day and age.,Jan 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Wow, just wow, the views from Diamond Hill are exquisite! was even treated to a rainbow while hiking up the mountain. My wife and I liked how the park set up the trail to be one-way. We went mid-week in mid-October and hardly anyone was there. Great place to explore.",Oct 2020
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"When visiting Galway this was one of the top places to visit on our list. The day we visited the weather was overcast but was still nice and enjoyable to walk in. I really liked that there is various levels of difficulty for the Park so you can pick which trail is best suited to you, they even have shorter, less difficult trails that would be perfect for children. The views from the trails are breathtaking, pictures can’t do it justice! Also at the beginning of the trails there were fields with beautiful horses that were very friendly! I fell in love with the one pictured below. There is also a lovely little coffee shop at the end of the trails where you can grab a small snack and coffee and sit at picnic tables to rest for a bit! Would definitely recommend taking a trip here, great exercise with rewarding views!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We stumbled on Diamond Hill only because nearby Kylemore Abbey was closed.
We are both in upper 60s but fit and healthy, so we decided to give climbing this Hill (mountain) a go.
I won’t say it wasn’t challenging at times, especially nearing the top, but it was so so worth the effort.
The lower walk is easier with a beautiful board walk on some of it, and stunning views.
There is a lovely cafe at the base with friendly and knowledgeable staff. And more importantly plenty clean And modern toilets.
Do attempt the top walk if you are in this area and have suitable clothes and footwear it is well worth the effort. We can’t wait to go back again in 2021 (Hopefully)

The climb was relatively easy as it is paved most of the way up and down it took approx 2.5 hours and was really enjoyable. The views on the way up were breathtaking, you can see one of the beaches on Inishbofin (another recommendation to come on that). Diamond Hill is a must to do if your are down that way.",Aug 2020
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"The one top tip from us is to stop somewhere before you arrive and get yourself ready to leave car park as soon as you park up. We parked up then got 3 kids ready for the walk and by that time all 5 of us had been eaten alive. That said its a lovely walk and can suit all levels of fitness we have 3 kids (6,4&2) and we did the blue loop just under an hour. Scenery is stunning and its a lovely easy to follow path. After the walk we got straight in and drove off. Found a lay by up the road and took off all our coats and wellies.",Aug 2020

If you’re anywhere near here at all, make sure to drive out and do it. Even the drive into the park from Spiddal was probably the most beautiful drive I’ve ever done.",Aug 2020
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,This is a great amenity for a family with different lengths of marked walks for all levels.

Also a small play ground and coffee shop.,Aug 2020

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"This is a great choice for a day trip if you're in the area. There are a number of loop walks you can do here, including simple ones for those who aren't in shape, and up to the one that goes up to the top of Diamond Hill. That's the one we did, with 3 children -- not too big a deal, as long as you're not completely out of shape. Get there early in the morning though if you don't want to be walking together with a horde of tourists. By the time we were walking back down, it was already pretty full and sometimes even difficult to make your way down because of all the people... Also, bring bug spray. There are these tiny flies that bite, VERY unpleasant! But the view from the top of Diamond Hill makes it all worthwhile. At the bottom, there are cows and a little playground for the kids, and a cafeteria if you want something to eat/drink after your walk.

The diamond hill walk is fab, the lower walk took us about 1 hour and it has lovely views. I'm sure the upper diamond hill walk is amazing but my little pomeranian couldn't walk that far!",Aug 2020
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,An amazing location with breathtaking views. There are three loop walks to choose from with three different levels of difficulty. We had a three year old with us and we did the middle one without any difficulties. Our three kids really enjoyed the walk. On a sunny day the Park gets very busy. It is the best to arrive early (before 11 am) to get a good parking spot.,Aug 2020

Did the blue trail and had a lovely picnic after the hike. Will definitely go back next time we’re in the area,Jul 2020
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We loved this walk. Because of covid it is all a one way system which was we personally found great. We decided to take the red route right to the top. Great steps in place, we went slow enough as it was our first time doing it. We reached a section where the steps aren't great and we had to climb a tiny bit. That needs to be flagged as we were unsure if we were going the right way When we got to the top we couldn't see much because we were in the middle of a cloud. Ha. We didn't mind though. Coming down the mountain it rained the whole way. Good footwear is a must. The scenery we did see was amazing. Great to have a change of clothes in the car. Also bring midge spray as the nasty little things did their best to eat us alive when we got to the carpark. The tearooms were closed as it was after 6pm when we got down. There were portaloos which were fine, I bought my own dettol wipes for them because of covid. We had a dog who we kept on the lead. There are picnic benches at the bottom and you will defintely be ready for a ham sandwich at that stage

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Great visit to Connemara National Park - day was grey but clear so good walking weather. Travelled there with two young teens and we decided to tackle the Upper Diamond Loop for the views. This felt a bit hairy as it was steep uphill and increasingly windy once you got higher. However the views were all worth it - just spectacular. Paths are all marked in one direction only due to C19 so a bit tricky if you change your mind halfway up (as one of our party did!).
Tea rooms were open and we got a table outside for a tasty lunch after we returned from our long walk.
Beautiful park, and the wild Connemara scenery is just breathtaking.
Parking was fine and plenty of toilet facilities (including Portaloos). Visitor centre not open due to Covid19.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We went for a quick visit, due to the availability of different tracks we thought it was a good idea to take a look.

First, we went to the visitors centre, I must say the people there were lovely. Since it was St. Bridget's day, they were teaching how to do the St. Bridget's crosses. They were very nice and helpful, we really enjoyed learning such a cultural thing.

Then we went for the hike, we finally went for the long one. The tracks were very well maintained and the views were spectacular. Even though the morning was rainy, there were a bunch of visitors and people doing the hike. The longest one is not that hard, and there are spots in which you can rest if needed, remember to take a light jacket because once you start climbing up the mountain, it gets quite cold (even a hat may be helpful).

It is definitely worth going and taking the time to enjoy a day in nature, there are also places nearby to visit.

The staff in the visitors centre were very friendly and helpful advising us to do the lower loop of Diamond Hill as it was late in the day and was going to be dark soon. We were advised that going up maybe a bit hard as we were taking the route uphill with the stone steps It was difficult but doable and we had a great sense of achievement when we got to the top.

The park has a variety of hikes for visitors to choose from, ranging from easier paths to longer, more challenging routes. All have spectacular views and interesting vegetation and wildlife to admire. There are pastures with some of the famous Connemara ponies grazing at the beginning of the hikes.

Whether you're an experienced or novice hiker, this park has something for you to enjoy.

Streets are quite narrow but there is not much traffic.

However, check the weather beforehand. If it's any way warm or no breeze I'd avoid if you are anyway sensitive to getting bitten by midges or come prepared with repellent and cover up. Any part of my body that was exposed got destroyed with bites and I had to buy an antihistamine two days later as they were still very bad.

Enjoy the hike and wrap up well! :)

In Letterfrack you can enter the park (follow signs to the parking place and visitor centre) to hike up diamond hill. The longest trail is well worth it with great views and not too strenuous. Be prepared for a few steps up but we saw whole families go up there so you can do it!

The landscape is harsh in places with bogs, marshes, bare rocks, etc. but even here you have the colour of the yellow blossom gorse, the pink and red rhododendrons, and other native flora unknown to me. Mustn't forget the lakes dotted across the landscape, some pond size to the larger Loughs Garroman, Derryclare and Ballynahinc, to name a few. The beauty of Killary Harbour where, if time permits, you can enjoy a leisurely cruise. The sheep cast a lazy look at you as you drive past.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We came to the National Park Visitor Centre to find out more about the geology and geography of the area and to do the walk up Diamond Hill. The Visitor Centre displays are informative and interesting and the staff were very helpful.

The walk up Diamond Hill is well-signed and the path very well constructed, with good steps up the steep part. Boots recommended, particularly for the descent, where there is some rougher rocky ground, although nothing too challenging. The view from the summit ridge are tremendous and the ridge itself is very interesting and fun to walk along. A great spot. Unfortunately we shared the summit with a large school party, who ascended just behind us - it can get rather busy, so perhaps choose a quieter time of day if you want it to yourself!

We visited the cafe for tea/cake. It was a pity that the standard of the cafe was not what we would have expected from a National Park Centre - it was rather disorganised and the food uninspiring. It could have been so much better, to do justice to this wonderful location!

There were a couple of two-week old foals there. We were lucky to spot them in the distance, and as we walked up the hill by their enclosure, they came across the field to within a few yards of us.

The only drawback is that the park is a bit on the small side (though longer backcountry hiking is possible) and the scenery, lovely as it is, lacks variety.

More of interest, I felt, to archeology people because a big isn't really something to see.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,We visited the Park recently to walk up Diamond Hill. We visited the Visitor Center first and got excellent information there including a map describing all you can see from the Peak - the staff were extremely helpful. The walk itself took about 2.5 hours. Getting to the Peak is a bit strenuous but not too difficult as there is a well laid out path all the way up (and down) - but be prepared for a good workout! The views along the way and from the Peak are well worth the effort - try and choose a clear day. On returning we has a snack at the Visitor Center restaurant - very reasonable prices and great service.,Apr 2019

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,We walked the Lower Diamond Hill walkway which wasn't too steep and long and offered a great view. You can extend your hike to the upper walkway (but we were too hungry...). The drive through the park was amazing. Mountains and clear blue lakes surround the street. Every next corner offered a new fabulous perspective. Great experience. The Twelve Bens can be seen from the street and are a great photo stop. Kylemore Abbey next to the park is also worth visiting.,May 2019
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We were here on a pretty typical day (mix of sun, cloud and rain) so we really happy to be able to get out and walk into the exquisite countryside on well-marked paths that really give great views and a good feel for what Connemara is about. On a drier day we would have extended on a longer loop so pretty much a bit of everything for everyone.",Sep 2018
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We hiked Diamond hill. It was a little tough for me but so worth the effort. The views were so pretty. If you are used to the Rockies, this is not huge. But it’s a beautiful small park that is well cared for and easy to navigate. You can’t get lost. There are only three options for hiking-the longest is Diamond hill with a 1200 ft climb and a total of 4 miles. You can turn back at any point or do a loop. The path is very well laid out and pretty easy footing. We spent most of our vacation in the flatter country so it was great to see this aspect. We went to Joyce’s sheep farm on the way up from Galway and did kayaking just outside of Clifden afterwards which made for a spectacular day.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,Connemara National Park is beautiful! I went with my friends and we decided to climb til the top of the mountain. It was something beyond my expectations! The connection with the nature and the landscape took my breath away. I could stay in there for hours just looking the view. How spectacular is the feeling to get to the top! It is not an easy climbing but not hard too. It is totally worth! Just make sure the weather is good and clear enough to enjoy the view.,May 2018
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Excellent hike to the top of Diamond Hill - where if you are fortunate to have a clear day provides a wonderful panorama of the environs. Predominately walking paths with boardwalk over the bog, rock steps and some very small amount of rock scramble near the top. Three loops provide walks in the park for different fitness levels. The climb to the top gives some minor challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. Allow about 2.5 hours for the summit loop. Visitor center provides information on the formation and benefits of the bogs.",Apr 2019

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"This park is a wonderful preservation of the natural land in the Connemara region. The visitor center and surrounding town have the amenities you need (bathrooms, food stops) and the park is left to be a park, which I love! It's not hyper-commercialized which is so hard to find these days. Absolutely loved it here.

We only spent about 2 hours here, which was not enough time to summit Diamond Hill as the path does get difficult in the last third of the climb. We'll be back when we're more fit and/or have more time! The views from any point on the hill were beautiful and the paths were maintained well without being disruptive of the nature around them. If you're a nature lover and want to get out into it, I highly recommend this park!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"A friend and myself visited the park on a sunny Thursday afternoon. As we entered the visitor centre we were greeted by a very friendly lady who welcomed us warmly and informed us on the 3 popuular walking routes and the visitor information centre. We found the information centre very interesting and educational on local history, life and the formation of the bog, as well as the wildlife which thrives in the environment.
We chose to walk the medium length blue walk, which took about an hour, it was not too difficult, the route is very well maintained and it was not too busy. Outstanding beauty and views to savour and a must see if visiting the west coast.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"For nature lovers, I cannot recommend Connemara National Park enough. We sort of went on a whim (hoping to see Connemara ponies -- Ireland's only indigenous horse) and were completely amazed by its rugged beauty. The park staff itself deserves real commendations for the state of the trails; we had hardly any prep at all for our hike (we did the complete 7 km loop) and it was SO easy to stay on the well-maintained path and to follow the maps. No stress, no prep --- it allowed us to just get out and enjoy the scenery. As someone who hasn't spent much time around peat bogs, I can say they are more interesting and beautiful than you might think! A very unique and austere beauty --- what started as sort of a random side trip ended up being one of our very favorite memories from Ireland. And try for the whole loop -- the view from the top is worth it!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"We had visited here many years ago when we had young children. This time, it was just us and our energetic English Springer Spaniel! Entry is free and there is ample car parking space. There are three substantive walking routes (aside from the Ellis Wood Nature Trail) and we decided to do the Upper Diamond Hill Walk which is marked at 3.7K, but felt longer because of the relatively steep ascent towards the top. Appropriate footwear is a must and a reasonable level of fitness and agility would be required for the ascent. The route is very well marked and it would be difficult to take a wrong turn at any point. The scenery is really magnificent on a clear day and we were delighted with the sea and mountain views we had at the top. This trip is definitely worth doing if you should find yourself anywhere near Letterfrack. And yes, our dog loved it too!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"All of Connemara is beautiful but this is surely the most beautiful place in Connemara. I have visited the park on both sunny and rainy days, and in all weathers this a fabulous place to experience the wild nature of Connemara.
Entry to the park and visitors center is from Letterfrack village. Try to get there early if you are driving as the car-park fills up quickly. The visitor center has a small museum with interesting information on the plants and animals to be seen as well as folklore related to bogs, the history of Connemara and peat harvesting. There is also a tea room in the visitors center which I have never visited.
There are three marked trails of different lengths and difficulty, across the heath-land and mountain all of which offer terrific views out to sea. The longest trail, the Upper Diamond Hill Walk, which takes in the summit of the Diamond Hill, is nearly 7km long. The path is quite rocky and steep for 100 to 150m below the summit on the western side. It can be tricky here especially in wet weather. But, if you are reasonably fit, have the appropriate footwear and are determined enough, the trek to the top is well worth the effort. The views of the mountains to the east, which can only be seen from the peak, are just as magnificent as the sea views to the west.
Don't miss a chance to pet the Connemara ponies in the enclosure near the visitor center or the waterfall in the Ellis wood nature trail.
Entry to the park, visitors center and car-park are free. There is something here for all ages and fitness levels. There is no excuse for not visiting.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"How is it possible that a gem like the Connemara National Park can not be the headline attraction in Co. Galway.
So much of the once beautiful Connemara countryside has been blighted with negligent local planning and what should be beautiful striking coastline along the Wild Atlantic Way now makes trailer parks in middle America look organised and attractive- such a waste.
But they have started to make amends and redeem themselves with Connemara National Park.
It offers different walks for various levels of fitness and competence. It has a visitor center, cafe and shop in the most idyllic setting of what might once have been an old mill.
Throughout the walks there are well maintained pathways and boardwalks allowing access to views and landscapes that would otherwise be completely inaccessible.
And once you find yourself deep into a walk you will be immersed in the outstanding beauty and rawness of this extraordinary landscape. This is the homeland of many Irish artists who could hardly resist putting paint to paper on viewing these moving vistas.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"Located about an hour's drive up from Galway, it's well worth the time to get up there.
Not only is there good hiking trails out of the National Park's centre at Letterfrack, but there is the stunning Abbey at nearby Kylemore which is aBout 3km before arriving at Letterfrack.

The three hikes up and around Diamond Hill are not that technical nor steep. The surrounding area is quite bleak and desolate and in poor windy weather is very exposed! The trails themselves are well made Nd maintained with elevated walkways over the peat bogs on the lower slopes.
Allow aBout an hour up and the same down to summit Dismond Hill
The views of the surrounding area and gays with islands dotted amongst them is worth the effort.
The national parks office is quite substantial with some good story boards and information.

One tip...if you punch Diamond Hill into google maps it drops you at a private driveway ( near the Kylemore Abby entrance) which is the northern side of the hill. You need to go a further 3-4km into Letterfrack and look for the well signposted national parks information centre which is where the walks commence

We took the middle one which was expected to take 60 minutes and even though we walked at a casual pace, we completed it in less than 45 minutes - I suppose we should have stopped and took more photos. The trails are well marked and you wont get lost. I would have liked to have gone on the longest route, but there was a threat of rain so didn't want to get soaked (and it looked to be clouded in). Our views were tremendous so i can only imagine what they would be like without the clouds. I found it amusing that most people on the trail that day walked in reverse order which means they would have by-passed the visitors center. Definitely worth a visit.

The walks seemed limited and to cap it off there was a hideous, high boundary fence that reminded me of a prison camp. I couldn't help but wonder if this limited route had been sectioned off quite deliberately in order to placate the tourists and the 'ordinary' people. In fairness I did not have time to climb the route to Diamond Hill, but I saw enough to make my heart sink. The area is very beautiful but much of it seems off limits.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Connemara National Park is incredibly beautiful, with views of islands off the coast, farmland all around, bogs and the characteristic limestone rocks of the region.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"Connemara NP – hard to discern – you drive into/along it, never quite sure where it actually might be – no doubt, there are beautiful vistas and lakes everywhere, and plenty of places to pull-off and enjoy the view up close. In fact, driving in Ireland practically means any spot is a potential parking pull-off. I got a laugh out of a hotel clerk later in the trip when I mentioned illegal parking -- I suppose that concept doesn't really occur here. Anyhow, back to the NP, -- there are Lots of sheep. Not lots of cars. Quiet. Beautiful countryside in Ireland. We had sunny weather making it especially spectacular. Mountains and meadows. Lakes. Ocean. We came across the famous abbey that everyone will know, who has ever been there – it looks like a medieval castle in the foothills of a huge mountainside. Worth a short or a long visit, depending on your time. After lunch in an oceanside park, we found an official Connemara visitor center complete with a choice of three walking trails up the hillside. Being american, we chose the shortest route, because, of course, we didn't have much time to spend here. Our short 30-minute walk along the hillside was well worth it. We took lots of pictures of the mountains and ocean views. It was free. It was worth the stop. Was it as spectacular as US National Parks. Yes and No. Was it nice and worth a visit? Yes. Yes, it was.

The visitor center was unremarkable but this national park was fabulous. They had a live demonstration of shearing sheep. The lower walk passed by Shetland ponies before climbing up Diamond Hill. We visited in August so we were ready for the predictably dramatic changes in the weather!! It was sunny one moment and pouring rain just one half hour later. This was an advanced hike because of the difficulty of climbing up wet rocks during gale strength winds. This walk was not for the faint of heart as we only saw one other hiker going up with us (plenty going down). The top was serenely peaceful, almost other-worldly. Absolutely beautiful!! And a good way to burn off vacation calories!!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"The drive to Connemara National Park from Galway was incredibly scenic, and even though we arrived at the park in the middle of a storm, we still made it to the top of Diamond Hill (trail starts at the very nice Visitor's Center) and enjoyed miles of breath-taking views in all directions. It was raining off and on, and the wind was so harsh that we had most of the hike to ourselves. Luckily, the fog cleared off at the top of the trail, and it seemed as if we were looking miles into all the surrounding counties. Be prepared for any kind of weather, and carry some water with you (there is more of a climb that you might expect). There is a cafe at the Visitor's Center for when you get back down (you will be hungry!). This is a wonderful way to spend most of a day in the west of Ireland.

Even though the scenery might look simple, it is stunningly beautiful with the mountains, lakes and bog land. It has a very specific atmosphere and feels like 'real Ireland'. The roads along the coast are narrow, but those were the most interesting part of the trip.
There are good hiking possibilities as well. I hope to return and hike Diamond Hill one day. This time we opted for Kylemore Abbey, which was truly stunning.
You could easily drive around for days... Such a wonderful landscape and many beautiful spots to discover.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,3.0,"The Connemara National Park is a lovely place - great scenery, history and wheelchair-accessible in most parts. I’ve been twice, once with my school for a hike on Diamond Hill in 2017 and once a few years before that with my family. The school hike was a great day. However, as nice as the day was with my family, it ended badly as our car got broken into. One of the back windows had been smashed and they stole a few valuables. While the staff at reception were apologetic, they told us that the car park was a regular haunt for thieves and that there wasn’t much they could do. If you plan to come here, I would advise to come via bus and make sure you keep all valuables safe!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"We recently toured Connemara National Park. The park and surrounding environs were enjoyable to view. If you're doing a driving tour, there are limits to what you can see and if the weather is overcast or raining, the area is not as compelling as I'm sure it would otherwise be. I think to really get the full Connemara experience, one would need to hike into some of the more interesting parts of the park.

Overall, we're glad that we took the time to visit Connemara, but we realize that we didn't have the chance to see it at it's best.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,3.0,"On the drive to Connemara national park we saw couple of great sights like Kylemore Abbey and small lake with sheeps wandering on the road. Parking was free but a lot was quite small and might be full. Visitor center has small exhibition and cafe.

It was disappointment that there was only few trails and not much more to offer. Shortest trail was futile, only few ponies were on the field and not so great views around. We continued to longer route up towards Diamond Hill. Rock stairs and wooden pavement over peat turf was nice to walk. That was far better route and up on the hill views were much better. Longest trail continued up to Diamond Hill and I'm guessing that was the real attraction for hill climbers. But we returned back to gravel path through the fields which lead us back to visitor center. That was boring scenery and not much to offer except some flowers. Route was about 4 km and took about an hour with small kids.

Round the visitor center there was short nice nature trail in the Ellis Wood grove and kids playground, but not much more activities. Overall this national park was disappointment. We didn't find much option to hike and scenery was also bit boring. Diamond Hill would be worth trying. We didn't see much Connemara ponies which was disappointment. Other animals weren't around either. Also peat and cutting it would have been nice to see in practice but that wasn't visible anywhere. I'm not sure what is the clue of this park but if you are a nature friend, you can spend here a day or half without expectations.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"It was highly recommend that we visit the park when we planned to be in the Galway area, and are we glad we did.

Even the drive to the park is stunning with beautiful lakes and bucolic farms along the road.

We did have “typical” Irish weather - misty with low cloud covering the higher mountain peaks. This proved to be an issue for our hike to the top of diamond hill as the top was completely covered in cloud, obliterating what we hear is a beautiful 360 degree view (see our photo of the summit attached)

We found lots of parking, room for picnicking, kids play area and an informative interpretive centre.

The Centrepiece is the hiking. Two smaller “kiddy trails” available but the prize is the vigorous upper trail requiring a loop of 6.7 km and an uphill climb of 300 m (1,000 ft).

The trail is very well marked and much work has gone into to stone steps on the trail that are required to make your way up. I would rate this moderate to difficult; not for young children or those who are not reasonably fit. No payoff for us, but highly recommend.

We did reward ourselves with a hot pot of tea at the very busy and capable tea shop. They were knocking out some nice looking food from the tiny space if you don’t bring your own food as many do.

Overall a lovely spot to visit and admission to the park is free.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"There is something so stirring about Connemara National Park - the views go for miles and no photo can truly capture the scope of the place.

There are trails for every level of hiker, so no one in the family will be excluded, and the isolated nature of the park means that it is quiet and peaceful throughout.

The only downside is the lack of tree cover in the further reaches of the trails. If the weather is overcast but not raining, this doesn't matter, but if it starts to rain or the sun is out in full-force you'll soon find yourself a victim of the elements with no respite. I've been both in baking heat and pouring rain, and while I still thoroughly enjoyed the trip, the lack of shelter was aggravating at the time.

All in all, a lovely experience, but definitely worth coming prepared by bringing clothes and equipment that can accommodate the changing weather!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Visited Connemara National Park on a wet, overcast day. Entry is free. There are three walks you can do, we chose the longest one which takes you to the top where you can look down on Kylemore Abbey. The walk was fabulous and the views spectacular, however, a word of caution, dress appropriately. We started off with light rain. The path near the top is very steep, more like a mountain goat trail. In my opinion, those walking sticks are a hindrance on this walk, especially at the top, leave them at home. On reaching the top we encountered gale force winds and rain that bit into your skin. We were totally drenched below our raincoats by the time we got down (going down did not seem to have a mountain goat section ) and we are really glad we did the climb. Well worth it, just try to pick a day that is not wet.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"We had visited the park on a previous holiday and enjoyed its natural wonders but decided to ‘do’ the Poetry Trail on our most recent visit. It starts in the Park and involves a circuit of the neighbouring village of Letterfrack, which has had a varied and frequently tragic history. The poems and their sites are often thought provoking and there was a book and CD available locally for further contemplation. The trail is highly recommended if time permits and is an interesting adjunct to the excellent nature walks.",May 2018

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"This is the loneliest stretch of scenery we encountered on our trip. It is a vast and rugged landscape, but is colorful and beautiful. It was a nice change from the green fields and walls, although Connemara has a few of them as well. But what I will always have in my mind are the mountains and the rich color of the landscape. Clouds produced purple shades in the distance, and occasional breaks shot streaks of sun on the green hillsides. Unbelievable light. I intend to paint this someday. Saw no ponies, however. Bummer.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"we took a stroll on an old long walk through the Connemara national park on bank holiday Monday just gone. We started out about 10.20am and while there was plenty of mist and fog on the lower parts of the walk the sun soon came out and made it a glorious mid morning and early afternoon. The walk is well sign posted, you cannot get lost, some people complain that this had some gravel/loose stone paths, but i think that is all ok, we cannot trample through the protected bog areas. The hike up is tough enough if you are not at all fit, theres plenty of steps and a 445m elevation, but once you get to the top the views are stunning. There is plenty of space to stop on the way up and take photos and if you had a good day like we had this is a most enjoyable experience and it is free to do. Get there early to park before the madness and set off at your own pace for what will be 2-3 hours of open air enjoyment

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Put the sturdy hiking boots on and be overjoyed and overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of this Oasis in the wild west of Ireland. Friendly, knowledgeable staff explain the trail options - yellow (leisurely loop stroll), blue (intermediate climbing) and red (about loop including summiting Diamond Hill). I suppose you can do the yellow sans the boots, but if it's the blue and certainly the red trails you are advised by this recent climber to tie those boots extra tightly. The trail is often narrow and your ascent angle approaches 45 degrees. In good weather the red is a tough climb; in inclement weather the park has the prerogative to cancel ascents. We thought we would be able to make it all the way but alas, we had to bail out at a wisely-designed spur. The planners of the red trail must have thought this through...basically a last chance to call it a day...and yet not be disappointed because the view at this level is magnificent. All the way up you are treated to a 360-degree panorama of Connemara. If it's the red trail for you be advised...a strenuous ramble. Afterwards treat yourself at the care located in the Visitor Centre or take in the lovely atmosphere of Letterfrack. Do not bypass Connemara National Park.

These short walks also pass a number of enclosures that will give you an up close look at the Connemarra pony, so worth it for that alone.

If you have more time, take on one of the more challenging walks into the higher parts of the park for some spectacular vistas.

Allow anything from 2-3 hours to a full day depending on what you choose to do.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Arrived there at around midday in a cloudy Sunday. Since we wanted to visit the Kilemore Abbey, we were unsure if the Diamond Hill Trail would give us enough time to make both visits. Totally possible. We made the whole trail in about 2.5 hours. Views at any point in any of the three trails are lovely. We caught some rain when we were on our way down but nothing too bad. It is an nforgettable experience. My recommendations would be: use comfortable trail clothing, appropriate shoes since rocks may get slipped, carry enough water and cereal bar/fruits [you will need those once up there].
When you are done with the trail, you can have some soup or coffee in the cafeteria right next to the visitor centre. They offer free Wi-Fi connection!

Diamond Hill -- the last section -- is certainly challenging but I would suggest, looking toward the summit, to begin the hike to the right. To the left, it would suit you better if you were a mountain sheep or goat in the last portion!!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Rain was forecast on and off all day, so we took the chance that it would be “off” when we arrived at the park. Mostly the rain was “on,” so we were limited to the Lower Diamond Hill walk. The Upper Diamond Hill walk being closed due to weather.
With the clouds pressing in, the typical views were obscured. But walking through the heather and looking out over the rolling hills was pleasure enough.
The Visitor Center was worth a quick prowl. My husband thought we needed to buy a map, but the cashier confidently told him we didn’t need to waste our money. She assured us the trails signs were dead easy to follow and that we didn’t need any more than the free map of the mountain. She was right. Nice to meet someone encouraging you not to spend money!
Note to first time visitors: From the main parking lot, the path to the Visitor Center is behind the little Connemara National Park kiosk. Signs clearly point the way around to the back of the kiosk and on to the Visitor Center. But I saw two different groups turn back from the closed kiosk and head back to their cars.

You cross straight through this beautiful place, through pretty little villages and past huge lakes with plenty of viewing points to stop.

Parking is FREE. Access to the park and the walks are FREE. There is a cafe there at the visitor centre to fuel up before you trek or after. Clean toilets are also provided and an educational part of the building for those interested in the historical and environmental side of the park.

There are 3 grades of trek, the furthest being right to the top. It took a little over 2 hours to do the round trip. The views along the way are truly worth the climb. And yes, there are climbs in places, steps kind of disappear and you do follow a route which are like stepping stones.

Unfortunately we were over run by a large group of students who didn't appear very interested in the Irish history but more so in their attempts to damage the stamps provided to log the adventure.
This put a bit of a dampener on our experience for the 15 minutes our so that they were around us.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"We loved the interactive nature of this museum. I was worried with Covid precautions that many things would be off limit. But there was continuous cleaning of surfaces by staff and ample hand sanitizer available. We had rooms that we enjoyed more than others of course, but our favorites were the arts and science rooms showcasing many things that we didn't realize were attributable to Irish citizens or Irish immigrants to many countries.
It was our first full day of a three week trip (long anticipated) and it was the perfect introduction. We were there on a week day right at opening time, and there were several school groups that had been dropped off and were generally acting like the 15 year old ""eejits"" that we remember being at that time of our lives. Luckily they passed by quickly so we could take our time and enjoy ourselves.
I don't know why, but I was surprised to find the place located in a shopping mall, but that also gave us the opportunity to lunch after our three hour visit. We are in our mid 60's, an age group often not comfortable with multiple forms of digital activity going on all around us, but it was very pleasant. I can see that it would agitate folks on the autism spectrum and be a problem for those with seizure disorders as there are many flashing lights.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,3.0,"Was quite an interesting tour, I went with my family, including a 16 and 13 year old. But I felt there should be more for the younger people to do. All there really seemed to be was the passport stampers. It would have been great to see some of the speaking videos done from the perspective of children. It's hard to hold the attention of children when it's only adult things being talked about.",Oct 2021

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"This museum shows all the many experiences and reasons that so many Irish people have emigrated, but it also focuses on particular individuals, showing us their letters and messages, and having good actors portray some of them.It starts with cruelty, but ends with the glorious influence that the Irish have had over other countries. I am not at all Irish, but I was moved and impressed.",Oct 2021
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,2.0,"EPIC IS NOT A MUSEUM. A museum is somewhere where objects and artefacts are displayed. Epic has ONE display case showing a convicts jacket, a brick, and a pair of handcuffs and that's it.

EPIC is a series of rooms showing 3-5 minute video clips on loop. I found the first couple of rooms interesting where it was about 6 particular migrants and their stories but after that it became quite boring and I think younger children would find the whole thing quiet boring.

If you've already been through the Irish education system, you're not going to learn anything new at EPIC.

At €16.50 it is wayyyyy overpriced. For me, it was not worth €6.50, let alone €16.50. There are much better things to see and do in Dublin for less.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.0,"We were not sure of visiting the museum as we thought the cost was a tad high. However, the museum is in a nice building with shops and eats. We did enjoy how the museum offered a brief and somewhat thorough history of the island and the impact its citizens had on the world. They offered you a passport card with the different sections of the museum noted and where you could get a stamp. Quite creative. We took about 2 1/2 hours to see the exhibits and walk through everything (we take our time). They adhered to strict Covid distancing and had plenty of sanitizer stations. Overall, this is a worthwhile museum.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"If you visited Dublin and didn't enjoy a visit to EPIC and the Jeannie Johnston, you really missed the boat. I had been all around town for a week and it was only a cab driver to asked if I'd done this yet. He was startled that I hadn't and dropped me at the museum instead of the hotel. I wish I knew how to find that gentleman and thank him. This museum SPARKLES in cleanliness and liveliness and organization and depth of information. The staff was diligent and courteous and helpful. A lucky conversation with a good cab driver saved me from missing the boat. The Jeannie Johnston was a beauty to behold even though Covid safety prevented boarding that week, this is the kind place you would visit every time you're in town, so I'll have another chance. THANK you for a grand afternoon.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,2.0,"The museum was quite disappointing. It portrayed a very shallow and sanitized view of history. There were mentions of why people emigrated specifically: Famine, conflict, etc, but it was somewhat glossed over and seemingly downplayed the horrors that many emigrants were escaping from. There’s so much interesting things that they completely missed: why not have a section on how Irish people at that time fit into the racial views of the cultures of the regions that they immigrated to. There’s also a discussion to be had on assimilation into other countries and the definition of “Irishness”, for example. Instead, it seemed to just blindly praise the achievements of Irish-descended people in various areas. I get that this is supposed to be an overview, but it’s a rather poor one.
Also, the exhibits themselves were boring. The most interactive exhibits were “Click here to read this,” and that’s about it. Not a ton of artifacts or physical things either (considering the many millions of people that emigrated, it shouldn’t be hard to find at least a few more).

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,1.0,"Very interesting exhibit which missed an opportunity to educate the visitors, in more depth, in the key reasons people emigrated (the wars, the famine, etc). These were touched briefly and then the theme of the exhibit overwhelmingly became about the Irish trying to claim any and every achievement/contribution to the world by attempting ancestral connections to everyone. Got an Irish great-great-grandfather...they'll claim your achievements. If you have coffee with an Irish person a few minutes before achieving a Nobel prize...they'll probably try claim that too. A bit unnecessary and taken too far. So much to celebrate without stretching it...

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.0,"We visited the Emigration Museum in May 2019; sorry for the delayed review.

The EPIC is located in the basement of the old train station near St. George's Dock and immediately opposite the Luas train station of the same name. We took the Luas rather than walk.

The museum takes up a series of vaults. It starts with the somber and sorrowful parts of Irish history including the lost battles for Irish sovereignty, colonization by the British and Scots Protestants, the famines, the dramatic falls in employment in the cities, laundry houses etc., all the causes of emigration. However, then it shoots to the success of the 70 million Irish emigrants and their descendants. They include all sorts of eminent contributors to causes especially freedom, democracy and workers rights. They also have contributed to advancements n science, engineering and entertainment (music and dance).

The whole presentation was very enjoyable and well worth the visit.

How to fill a day for people who had never met in real life was the challenge. The solution was to bring these colleagues to EPIC, a space where they could absorb a taste of Ireland and the impact our country has had around the globe. Afterwards, we walked along the banks of the Liffey and chatted about the various rooms we had visited with our EPIC passports - which ones they liked best, which ones they had already heard of (Riverdance was a favourite) and which ones they would like to learn more about in the future. And so the conversation continued over dinner and the next day. Thanks EPIC for giving us so much material to fill a weekend and a lifetime. They'll be back!

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"I booked Epic for myself,my Dad, niece (9) & nephew (7) ;all four of us had a fantastic time.The museum is divided into 20 rooms spanning from beginning of Irish emigration to modern day and how as a people we have spanned the globe and had an impact on so many other countries and societies.
Belief,Playing the World, Achieving Infamy and Music&Dance were favourite rooms as they were super interactive. Was fun to be in the stands at a sorts match and take a photo, and stand and be measured as one of the Good, the Bad and the Irish. You have to do the front and side profile prisoner photo.
The Riverdance room was great, I recorded my niece, nephew and even my Dad as they repeatedly followed the dance steps.
Everyone gets a souvenir passport that they use to follow the museum tour. My nephew really loved stamping it in each room. It made it even more fun.
From arriving to leaving the staff were super. Greeted with warmth, then as we did the tour, a staff member popped up in some areas to tell small facts and give interesting information. They were all brilliant with the kids.
Staff were friendly and all made the experience even better.
We went on a Saturday afternoon, and parked nearby putting money in a meter. We spent 2 busy hours, but we could easily have stayed longer.
The museum has a kids go free offer when I booked, which made it even more affordable than usual. I would have paid the price of the kids tickets, well worth the money.
All the health and safety measures that Epic has in place gave peace of mind. We all felt safe and as we were there on a really sunny day, we had place almost entirely to ourselves. I have no doubt that with more people it would still have been comfortable. There are lots of machines and screens available throughout the museum which meant everyone could participate and do their own thing, follow
What interested them most.
Overall we had a wonderful day, learned loads and had a good laugh and quality time as a family.
Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone; everyone whether Irish native, resident or tourist should visit. There is something for everyone.
We will definitely be back.
Thanks Epic for a truly memorable experience

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"A lack of time at the present moment will not let me write more than a quick note. In fact my time at EPIC was rather limited too - it was not possible to give full justice to all the reading and lingering as I had a train booking time to keep an eye on. Purely by chance, having wandered along streets from a work meeting in that unfamiliar area near the quays, and thus vaguely towards my return journey that Monday, I happened across the place. It had been a disappointment to remember earlier that museums in the city are usually closed - and that being the only day I could travel from the midlands, after many, many months of travel restrictions. Thirst on that very hot afternoon and need of a rest from carrying my increasingly heavy baggage, I welcomed what looked like something 'café-ish'. When it dawned on me that the location was a MUSEUM which COULD be visited - delight! This museum I had had seen a few adverts for and was in the back of my mind to visit was open, and with just about enough time to get an impression of it all, for a return in the future. There are many layers to the experience within the galleries. Some visually simple but adequate sets, and some media displays and interactive effects which are very clever and amusing, and also, many details to glimpse. So much information unfolded into a fascinating story of Irish emigration. I felt some surprise when I began to realize that it wasn't just 'their story' but in those broader sweeps within the exhibition, were connections with my own family. Those emotional responses crept up on me. As an artist, and former exhibition designer (heavens, not on this scale!) I appreciated the visual, the thorough research and the very balanced historical text. Of old, I know this is always a tough task where Irish history is concerned, which a fellow artist and I have experienced recently with our Famous & Notables of Birr Trail. On some point, someone is always going to express anger about something, no matter how balanced, accurate and also informative we have tried to be. Righto, that's it - must dash but will complete with these final comments: I left with a tear in my eye, a welling in my heart, and there have been warm recommendations on my lips since. Looking forward to seeing it all again and properly, with my husband and perhaps my niece and nephew.

The content is very broad, easily digestible, smartly presented and thoroughly convincing. We have both been to Ellis Island in NY in the past and this really manages to complete the story, to use modern idiom, it is the Origin Story.
However, the real twist in the tail is that this is not just about the Famine, emmigration continues to the present day and that too is captured.
Excellent way to spend an afternoon, I highly recommend it.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"It was my final stop in Dublin, and one of that, I will remember for a long time. The museum tells a wonderful, poignant, melancholy story of the emigration process that took place in Ireland. The design of the museum is fabulous, modern, interactive, exhibitions are loaded with hands-on learning experiences that are entertaining for both adults and children. It is a great mix of info and technology. The journey begins with you being issued a kind of passport. This well-designed booklet contains a map of the museum. As you walk through each room, you can place your passport into a device that stamps the corresponding spot on the map - a clever idea that keeps you on track. I see many things in common between the emigration of Irish and Polish people, so it was a personal experience for me. This museum far exceeded my expectations. It really brought the story of Irish immigrants to life. It was... epic!

Throughout the exhibtion itself I was utterly fascinated by the unique and modern use of technology to tell the stories they were trying to tell. It is an experience that will stay with me for a very long time especially the occasional staff member ensuring we are enjoying our experience.

There was a free photo included, little gift to my girl, voucher for coffee and a muffin for three of us and free entrance to the museum that I thought was fantastic.

- Videos were enjoyable and important aspect to tour for people who have trouble reading/concentrating.
- Passport is fun aspect of tour, especially for children. Very good idea!
- I would appreciate more attention brought to Irish women/lgbt+/people of colour (in particular), especially in relation to the current issues faced by them but also putting a positive light on the diversification of Ireland's cultural landscape since these people are in very similar positions/situations to the Irish people who emigrated due to The Famine, the reason EPIC was created in the first place.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,3.0,"A very modern and visually attractive exhibition that would appeal mostly to the local audience, as the non-Irish might find it bit boring. Regrettably it doesn’t show the role that Ireland have taken for the last 25 years attracting the immigrants in.
Each of the 20-odd rooms show a different aspect of the way that Irish moved around the globe with morsels of information on it- and I would dare to say there might have been even more information offered. Most of the exhibition is composed of custom-made instalments and models, which definitely look cool, but I would wish a bit more authentic memorabilia and everyday objects showcased. How did the travel across the Atlantic looked like? What did the travellers held in their suitcases? Apart from the obvious US/Australia destinations, are the Irish present in some more exotic or surprising places, like Japan, Nepal or Antarctic? The room on St Patric’s Day, with screens on all the walls showing smiling people- all good and well, but why the Irish celebrate that day in the first place and what is the social role bringing the Irish together on that day? The museum should give you answers to your questions, whereas we left a bit confused with even more questions than before.
I would easily find grounds to compare the exhibition with Titanic Belfast, which the latter showcasing a coherent and very attractive story line on the people emigrating across the pond with a well known ship being only an excuse. I think that EPIC misses that spot. It seems to me it’s a museum targeted at the school trips from towns outside Dublin, for the education of the younger generation. I don’t think it’s that attractive for the families as the kids would find it a bit boring, with no that many elements they could touch, push, operate and have fun with.
Also I wish the exhibit have shown a more recent side of the emigration- the fact that for the last 20 years the roles have changed and Ireland serves as a destination for emigration of many foreign nationals looking for a better life. This is an Irish contemporary reality, I think it would be important to showcase that.
All in all, it is a very attractive museum visually but one that mostly the Irish would find amusing. I don’t think it’s a must for a tourist visiting Dublin for couple of days. And especially that prices aren’t that low either.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.0,"Recently booked a visit as my son still on school holidays. Great incentive- kids are free for whole month of August & local restaurant/bar are also offering kids eat free with an adult @ the harbour master.
Check in was prompt as it was Mon morn& was fairly quiet. It was a self guided tour(due to Covid restrictions)
On check in, we were given our passport, map & pen.
My son aged 9 & his pal age 10.
The whole display is so well done(bear in mind the boys were quite interested at the start but they did loose interest half way through)
I’d advise maybe kids from 12yrs that are at least half interested in history.
It’s interactive & very well displayed (from
An adults perspective)
We spent just over 2hrs in there(it flew by for us grown ups)
The history & stories are told very well.
The gift shop at the end was nice to browse in & a lovely lady gave the boys a pen each which was a lovely gesture.
Well done to all the staff who are very visible & available to get some knowledge from also.

The scope is huge and cannot discredit the creators in any manner.

Would love to see a display that could possibly show parallel timelines between the immigration experience and Irish history. Also, would love to know more how Irish immigrants helped Hume and others bring an end to the Troubles.

A great variety of exhibits and all most interesting. We stayed for nearly 2 hrs although you could do it quicker. Make sure you download the app prior to visiting and download the audio tour, as they are not giving out audio sets and headphones at present. (Also bring your own headphones). We thought the audio was excellent and really brought the exhibition to life. All staff that we met were very helpful, interested, and seemed very keen for tourists to return to Dublin.
We ate afterwards at Bakehouse which was very good.

There was something for adults and the children really liked how interactive the museum is. It took us about 2 hours to go through but older children / adults may take more time - the kids skimmed through many of the exhibits that I as an adult would've like to spend more time. There are quizzes, videos, photos, even the chance to do a bit of Irish dancing!",Aug 2020
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"Thank you so much to everyone at EPIC for a wonderful visit last weekend. I live in Dublin’s environs but had been a little apprehensive about going into the City Centre due to Covid19 and all the worry that comes with that but our trip to EPIC was simply wonderful. I’d like to reassure people that from a health and safety point of view, absolutely everything is being done to make the museum a safe and enjoyable experience. Time slots are allocated and limited to small numbers. Hand sanitizer was present in abundance and staff were present at every juncture to make sure everything was as it should be. The bathrooms were immaculately clean. Now on to the museum itself.....it was fascinating! Our two little boys are six and three so I didn’t know how engaged they would be but they loved it. Each section is informative, interesting and stimulating and one can choose to stay as long as they wish. It was a 360 degree tour of everything from history, politics, the arts, religion, culture, music and Irish diaspora all beautifully punctuated by our regular passport stamps. Each entrant is given their own passport and collects a stamp in each section which I thought was an ingenious way of keeping children engaged and interested. It made me sad to see the city of my birth so quiet but any fears I had were unfounded. The wonderful team at EPIC are doing everything they can to ensure a safe, comfortable visit and I can’t recommend EPIC enough. Go and take that day trip with your kids (kids go free in August) and remind and educate yourself on what a wonderful nation of people we are and what a fantastic heritage we have.

I was worried it might be a bit boring or depressing focusing on the famine and emigration but I was thankfully mistaken. The exhibitions and interactive displays are beautifully created and designed. And yes while you do learn about the famine and where all the Irish emigrated to, you also learn about the Irish and how they travelled the world for reasons relating to education, religion, medical aid, peace keeping, sport and entertainment & culture. As you go around the exhibitions get your ""passport"" stamped in each area. We'll worth a visit!",Jul 2020

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.0,"A fantastic display of the history of Irish Emigrants and the lives they led abroad. There was a lot of really interesting informations here. The museum itself is very interactive and the displays are laid out wonderfully. There are some really amazing and inspirational stories in the museum of things Irish emigrants did in their lives, aLong with a few sad ones from the days of the famine. You'd be surprised at some of the famous faces in the museum who were Irish emigrants or of Irish descent.

COVID restrictions are in place around the museum - there are hand sanitisation stations in every section and you get a touch stylus to use so you don't have to actually touch any of the interactive displays.

The EPIC passport was a nice touch, and you got a stamp as you went through each section.

Depending on how much of the displays you interact with, you could spend anywhere from 1 to 3 hours here.

If you're travelling from abroad and have Irish ancestry this museum is a must see. It gives the option to add your Irish ancestors to their displays so they can be a part of the EPIC store. We did not visit the genealogy centre so I can't comment on that.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"It's rated as the best museum visit in the whole of Europe and I can see why. I have never visited a more incredible museum in my life. It was informative but in interesting, unique ways, it captured the attention of all three my children.

Presenting history in such a fascinating, interactive way, we thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. :)

I cannot recommend this one enough.

Going through Post Covid-19, there was only one display that we weren't able to avail ourselves of, but everything else was spotless, we were given a pointer to use on the interactive displays eliminating the need to physically touch anything, there were sanitizing points at every single display. We felt safe at all times.

It is very well-laid out, great interactive exhibits (seems great for kids), and a wide scope of Irish history and stories are presented. Definitely a good place to spend a rainy afternoon.

On the other hand...we didn't find or learn anything particularly ""new"" or surprising. If you are a second or third time visitor to Ireland, or are familiar with Irish history in general, you probably won't find anything really worth your time here.

One random observation - we were slightly surprised to see Margaret Sanger featured in the museum, particularly given the current reassessments of her ""legacy"" in the USA?

But that is nitpicking on what is overall a pleasant experience.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"I really enjoyed the experience - learned so many interesting things about my own country and diaspora that I never knew before (through audio, visuals and reading). The collection is fairly sizeable - we only got through 7 of the 20 galleries in 2 hours 45 minutes or so - but I watched and read EVERYTHING!

The brilliant thing about this museum is that your ticket is valid for a limited period after your first visit so you can go back and visit what you didn't see first time, without having to pay again.

Given the weird times we find ourselves in, the space was excellently laid out to allow for social distancing and there was hand sanitiser in every gallery.

The building itself is beautful and steeped in Dublin history.

The staff were also very pleasant and really seemed to enjoy their jobs.

A really enjoyable and interesting experience. I am looking forward to going back.

The exhibits were immersive and moving. My absolute favorite room was the book room, with light-up books that play audio passages from books written by Irish authors. A beautiful endeavor overall, would highly recommend!

They followed where they settled, and much more detailed information.
It covers education, living conditions , famous Irish people etc .and much more.
I did not know what to expect but was so impressed and realised I needed quite a few more hours to truly absorb what EPIC lays before you. I am going again to recap on what I did not absorb.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"This is a great museum and is one of the hop-on, hop-off bus stops so easy to get too. The museum basically tells you how through poor times the Irish have influenced pretty much everything in the world for 100s of years including American Presidents, notorious criminals and music. This brilliantly laid out museum takes you on a journey where you can hear the story of some of the past Irish emigres.

We spent a good two hours here but because of time restrictions we had to leave with probably not really getting our full value as you could easily spend more hours exploring. Each room you walk through links but also tells a different story and has some great audio, visual and interactive installations.

The Irish dance section was a big hit with our little one and it was hard to get her out to move to the next section as she bopped away.

Very friendly and helpful staff, clean and easy to navigate with great access opportunities and a god send of multiple storage lockers (some free, some needing a 1Euro coin which is returned). Also in the building are multiple eating establishments offering a range of foods and drinks - very popular with business folk who work in the buildings around at lunch time. All in all great value and a great morning spent.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"Had passed this museum a couple of times on previous visits to Dublin and decided to visit when I was there last week. I hadn't bothered checking out the reviews prior to visiting but have read some since my visit I have to agree with all the rave reviews.
This sort of museum is long overdue even if we hadn't realised it. We Irish have been emigrating since whenever, it is definitely a big part of our history and this place acknowledges that and celebrates Irish connections and contributions all over the world.
The place is fantastic. There is so much to take in! even better your entry ticket allows a follow up visit. There are film sequences telling individual stories and experiences that were typical, interactive sections, a sort of challenge thing, photo opportunities ... I could go on!!
There is stuff to interest you if you live in Ireland or if you're a visitor. And if you are a visitor with Irish roots you'll really enjoy this place (and probably the Irish Family History Centre too).
Okay it costs a bit to visit but I think it is well worth it. I spent 2 hours and that was rushing the final part (had to return to ""do it""!!)
The staff were great - informative, friendly and very helpful.
All in all I can understand why it has won awards and I intend to revisit when I'm next in Dublin.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that many of the audio tracks playing are too loud or interfering with other audios in the same small space.

Allow plenty of time, we were there for 3 hours!",Feb 2020
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"I am not usually a big fan of museums for the usual reasons: most are 'old' in terms of their presentations (typically static), design, and access to exhibits. EPIC is none of those. EPIC makes history personal (hence, the name behind the acronym: Every Person Is Connected) through accounts and anecdotes which help to explain the trends and reasons for emigration. We spent the afternoon and felt at the end we had been there five minutes, the information was so compelling. If you're a fan of Jeopardy, you will love this. Beautifully conceived and executed sculptures accompany some of the exhibits which flow into one another. Dublin has a lot to offer. EPIC ranks either at the top or close to it. We plan to visit again.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"The EPIC museum in central Dublin is housed below ground level in a wonderfully preserved warehouse. The exhibition feels alive with sounds, lights and attractive narrative, both spoken and to read. The EPIC was only established a few years ago so it feels as if it uses a lot of modern means of communication to visitors. There were many fascinating moments during my 2.5 hour visit. The extent of Irish emigration is quite staggering - people from many parts of the world today can trace their family routes back to this small island. People left Ireland for many reasons - some departures were self-imposed (eg to find a better life) and some other reasons were imposed by the state or other bodies. A fascinating walk-through type of visit. Highly recommended if you are ever visiting or working in Dublin.

I went with expectations of visiting a museum with photos of people boarding ships in the late 19th century, heading off across the Atlantic to start a new life. But I was mistaken. This museum is actually a wonderful, interactive experience. Rather than being arranged chronologically, the visitor walks through different rooms with special themes. All rooms have something special and Irish heritage and culture around the world is highlighted. What I loved most about this visit is the new understanding I've gained about the Irish. What resilience! Irish people have been able to thrive, despite unfavourable events in history and going through some of the most terrible conditions. I have total respect for Ireland and the Irish!

Our only complaint would be that we started our tour with a few groups , with their guides . So we found it hard to listen to the stories on the screens and had to hold back to watch again when 2-3 groups left the areas . The people in the large guided groups were also talking a lot . Where as small family / friends were much quieter groups sitting and listening .
We will certainly recommend the Epic tour to others .

It's in a wonderful old building that has been sensitively used to portray the best of Ireland and her emigrants. The interactive part is user friendly and so interesting. Obviously a huge amount of thought and imagination has gone into the whole project. It's a credit to those who created it.
The staff are professional friendly and knowledgeable. The gentleman on the desk who took our tickets was charm personified. I wish I had gotten his name. We were there on Saturday the 22nd at about 3.30 and he was in his 50s I'd guess. Another dark haired lady in the last room was a credit to EPIC also.

By the end of the visit I had learned basically nothing. It is not a bad place to go if you want some instagram pics (but also not the best place to go for that), and it has a great segment where you can find out a bit more about your irish ancestry, but if you have none, completely pointless. I do not recommend.",Feb 2020
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,1.0,"The place where the museum is located is great, but I feel like it wasn't properly taken advantage of.
Lots of gimmicks but no substance. Might be interesting for Americans with Irish s basically repeating the ""how awesome are irish -americans"" rethoric but skipping all the actual hardships the Irish had to endure.
There are no artifacts at all, only a jail uniform and acouple more things.
It's lots of reading/listening that can easily be done more thoroughly from home by reading a book or watching a documentary.
My family and I were quite dissapointed... They should learn from a real museum, like the ""Irish Agricultural Museum and Famine Exhibition"" > Go to that instead if you can!

A great museum that's brilliantly presented. Loads of interactive, visual pieces. At no point are you overloaded with TOO much information but just the right amount to inform, educate and not be a chore.

Ireland,Spike Island,3.0,"Given the positive review for Spike Island tours, I was very disappointed by the Spookfest event. We have been to other Halloween events with our 6 and 2 year olds that were so much better, including free events. There were times on Spike Island that I wondered if the Halloween event was even on it was so minimal. Even the presence of staff was minimal apart from the lovely girl who walked us up from the boat. For a charge of €16per head including the same charge for babies, the effort it takes to get there with young kids, and the expectation of having lots of Halloween fun I would have expected more effort on the part of Spike island organisers. My recommendation- Dont waste your time on this one for Halloween '21! There is a fantastic opportunity for it to be great if much more thought and effort was made and IF this happened we might give it a second chance.

Exhibitions excellently displayed and the leaflet given at the kiosk a great help on finding our way around.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Had a fabulous day out to spike we had been wanting to do it for so long, delighted to finally get there!
We met our tour guide as soon as we stepped of the boat, to be honest he was fascinating! Actually quite disappointed he couldn't walk us all around the place! So thank you Peter! Also bought the book on his recommendation and it's a great read!
There is one down side though,in our group we had 2 very mature ladies 🙈 so between our speed of walking and having to have a cup of tea we didn't get to see much after the collection of machinery. Next time we will have to leave the old birds at home 😂. Thank you again to peter

We had a great day out and learned a lot and the kids loved the boat to and from the beautiful Cobh. Highly recommend this.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Well worth a visit.
Short boat journey from Cobh, very well protected inlet so nice and calm journey.
We did the 40 min tour with the guide when we got off the boat, its optional but I think worth doing if its your 1st visit.
This includes so good stories and some recent and less recent Irish history.
We did the walk around the outside of the fort, great view of harbor.
There is also a coffee shop if lots of walking and history isn't your thing.
They do take away so you could enjoy the harbor views (anfd Cobh) from inside the fort with a nice hot drink and some cake.
We didn't get around to doing the walk around the full Island but we are planning a return visit at some point and will make sure to do that but and see more of the old houses.

This place has so much history, and so many strains of history too. If you have an army or military interest this is an amazing day, war of independence and prison and daily life.

Great experience, truly so much to explore, we had 3.5 hours on the island and still ended up pressed for time.

The staff were all great to deal with, and the cafe was excellent also.

Well done Karl and thank you my teenage son actually enjoyed learning about history. Take Karls advice on where to start self exploring as 3 hours is not enough to read everything but his route you get to see all the island, we rushed back for the boat. the island is steeped in history, we will have another trip back as it is impossible to take it all in. Little football pitch to the right of the island we brought a ball and had a kick about. Some of the views are amazing, have recommended to anyone I know going to Cork.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Really good way to explore explore Cobh and enjoy the day. Really helpful tour guides give a breakdown of the history of Cobh and Spike Island.,Sep 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Visited here recently with our family. We took the guided tour at the start which was delivered by Karl. He was very enthusiastic and seemed genuinely interested in what he was doing. He was very knowledgeable and answered every question that was thrown his way… even the ones asked by my 5 year old daughter! I will say that I would have liked the guided tour to have followed on inside the walls. There are plaques and information points around the place but I personally would have preferred to have a guide. I can appreciate with Covid going on how this might not be possible so maybe that’s an idea for the future.

As for the island itself, it’s steeped in history and you can sense it as you go about. It’s got this weird ominous type charm to it. You know some bad stuff has happened around here and yet you can’t help but be intrigued and interested in it. I’m not sure if the older fenced off buildings will be opened up at some point but if they were, I’d go back just to go in to them. I’d also like to see one or two of the houses in the village be made safe so people could enter them and look around. Kind of made “period correct”. With the guided tour aside, I’d also like to see a more interactive experience. Maybe some people in period costumes, Gardai, military etc etc. being in character. Again, that’s just my personal preference.

Overall it was really enjoyable and well worth the money. If you’re down that way, give it a look!

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"What a spectacular Cork attraction. No.1 in my book.
Our day out started with sunshine in colourful Cobh, we couldn't have asked for a better day.
The ferry (all travellers were wearing masks) was smooth sailing all the way, even bringing us past Haulbowline Island. We spotted a seal in the water as we docked. 2 very friendly guides met us and walked us up to the gate,while telling us so many fantastic stories about the people living there years ago. They were hugely knowledgeable and very friendly and funny.
Food in the cafe was perfect. Seating and all areas spotless. Incredible views of Cork Harbour from the surrounding walls. Lots of nooks and crannies for kids and adults to explore. Water around the island was crystal clear. Cork is such a stunning place.
Overall it was one of the best days out we've ever had.
Our only complaint....we didn't stay long enough.
Thank you Spike, we will certainly be back !

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Really enjoyed our time on spike island. There is lots to see and explore. It’s advisable to take the optional 40 tour guide at start to get a real history of the island. The island is full of history and there is lots to take in even though you are there for 3.5 hours. The cells and military room are fantastic as well as seeing all the artefacts and becoming familiar with the inmates that once stayed there and the conditions they were kept in. On the whole a fantastic site and experience and would highly recommend it.
But !!! even though it is a historical site there is lots of unsightly dereliction on about half the site and lots of horrible chain link fence, hoarding and barriers scattered about which does nothing for the kerb appeal. It would be nice to see these buildings tidied up just on the outside and nice barriers erected, basically make a feature out of their derelict state. It’s a terrible shame on how bad the village is and terrible to see some of the old buildings been used to store site rubbish.

On the whole a great experience but lots more potential available.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Went to spike Island in sat 14th August 2021, had a brilliant experience but only one thing that stops me from giving a 5 star. It was lashing rain, we where soaking wet. We decided to go to the cafe there to dry off and get ourselves a hot drink.my daughter came back,she is 13 yrs old, from ordering a hot drink and said the lady behind the counter was so rude to her. We were not even there 30 mins and the staff were telling us it was closing and literally shouting telling everyone we had to leave as they were banging chairs and cleaning around us, they we're not far from lifting the chairs from under us. There was no notice of time of closing displayed anywhere and if it was close to closing time they should not have served us and i definitely would not have spent my money there. Otherwise everything else about the island was brilliant.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We visited this week (4 adults, 1 teen & 2 kids) it was fantastic. John G was our guide and I cannot recommend a tour with him enough! He was beyond informative, engaging and funny. He has a fantastic knowledge of the island beyond the leaflet! We will most certainly be returning and we’ll be tagging along with John G. The boat ride was quick and enjoyable too with great views of Cobh.",Aug 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Visited spike Island today and would highly recommend it. Our tour guide Rob set up our visit with informative and interesting chat and advised what to see. The independence display and the punishment house were highlights along with the walkways to the top of the fort to take in the views. Will be back again to do the walks around the island. Rob our tour guides enthusiasm was infectious and was a great introduction to a great visit.,Aug 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We didn’t have to travel far from Cork City to Cobh and on to Spike Island. We were just looking for an activity for a family Sunday outing and boy were we surprised and so pleased with our experience at Spike Island. It truly was a great day out, there was loads to do and see. One of the best things we have done this summer. Our tour guide Karl was brilliant and listening him give us the inside scoop on a spike was very informative and very amusing, his got the gift of the gab. Will definitely be returning.",Aug 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"If you mentioned spike Island to me 3 weeks ago, I would have responded ""what is that?"" Absolutely Well worth it to come see and hear about this piece of Irish history amd heritage. It's even more worth it for you to stay and take the 40min guided tour that's optional.

Our guide Rob was whitty and very knowledgeable of the history of spike Island and was open to any questions you wanted to ask with a few jokes here and, I would nearly go see it again. Very family friendly and the only cafe doesn't overcharge like everywhere else you would visit in ireland. Highly recommended.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"It was a 3 1/2 hour trip. It started with an optional 50 minute tour, with a very well informed tour guide, and then we had a little over two hours to see the old fortress and the parts that were used as a prison, with a thorough display on the famous prison riot. There was time for a walk around the island, getting in all the views of Cork Harbour. We will definitely go back.",Aug 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"The whole trip was very interesting I would recommend it to everyone. Our tour guide, Marion, made the history come to life.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Our day trip to Spike Island exceeded all expectations. From the moment that we were greeted on the pier by our knowledgeable guide Jessie we knew we were in for a great day!! We learned about Irish history and Cork harbour and the trade routes it offered, and we were enthralled by the stories about the heritage of Spike Island.

Jessie’s tour was brilliant. She is interactive, funny, and extremely well informed. She kept the tour interesting and engaging for all age groups, whilst also providing factual information - and she was more than capable of answering all questions that were asked of her!

The facilities on the island are all very well kept, clean and easy to find. The artefacts are very cool and the staff were all friendly and happy to help! The boat ride to the island was an added bonus and definitely provides some extra excitement for those with young children.

Although it cannot be totally attributed to the island management, we had beautiful blue skies all day and these served as the backdrop for the stunning views of Cobh and the mouth of Cork harbour from Bastion 3.

However, we all agree that the true gem of the day was our tour guide Jessie - she provided us with an insight into what life would have been like on the island and in the prison when it was running, and kept us entertained all day!! Thank you Jessie for the brilliant tour - we will definitely recommend your tour and a visit to Spike Island to our friends and family, and we would definitely hope to return soon!!

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Well worth visiting Spike Islands if you're anywhere near Cork City. Excellent guided tour by John G and the War of Independence museum among the highlights. You can cover a lot in the 3 hrs but probably worth spending longer to see everything,Aug 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Amazing experience, the history and stories of the island was really interesting, our tour guide Jessie was absolutely amazing, told history in great detail and made it really fun for adults and children.
The only thing I would recommend is to bring your own lunch with you, as took us 1hour to que for food, very expensive and not alot of selection and also took an hour off our time that we could have been exploring the island, we missed a few areas because of this which was disappointing as it takes the 3.5 hours to see it all.
You don't have to stay with tour guide but we did as we wanted to hear all the information, tour guide only takes 1hour.

The ferry ride was COVID safe and we were greeted by our guide, Jessie, on the pier who turned out to be the highlight of the trip.
She kept us entertained as she wound our way through the centuries of history on Spike, with her facts and her stories, bringing everything to life as we were entertained and engaged, no matter what the age!
After a break in the cafe we explored on our own and were amazed at the depth of history on our doorstep and the stunning scenery.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,This is a great day out - it was a challenging day weather wise but nothing could take from this fascinating trip. Our guide Peter explained some of the history and related stories very well and gave a great introduction. The only thing that we could complain about is not having enough time to really see everything. A great surprise to see the huge fort that is virtually hidden from view. Amazing views of Cobh and the harbour generally and the glacis walk is well worth the small effort. Thanks for a great visit - highly recommended.,Aug 2021

Would have maby had the option to extend but all tours were booked and there was alot of us. But we'll worth a visit. Kids loved it too.

We didn't get to see everything but will definitely go back to see the rest, kids loved it, wife loved it, i loved it.

There is quite a trek to the fortress at the top so if you've got kids make sure they have walking shoes on and them buggys have good brakes for your stops along the way.

Enjoyable day for all the family of all ages and the knowledge of the staff is absolutely fantastic.

The tour is about 3 to 3.5 hours but we stopped for breaks along the way for food etc so this is why we didnt see everything.

Definitely a must see and well managed by all the team from the mainland in Cobh to the island itself.

Once the guided tour is finished you get to explore the fort and buildings yourself. It really is worth taking a trip over there and to experience it. We’ll definitely be going back again. We could easily have spent another two hours there.

The boat was full. The queue was not managed for covid. A family were in the queue and additional members joined them. As the numbers swelled the gap between them and other people disappeared but the staff ignored the congestion. During the trip all the seats were occupied. People were very close. One of the crew went through the cabin with no mask on and the other wore his mask with his nose out all the time. (see photo) On the island things were different. Good Covid management generally.

My husband, children (14 and 11) really truly enjoyed the time spend on the island - listening to the many many stories and tales, and wandering the beach - not to be missed as it's fully of old bits of crockery (we found part of an old marmalade jar dating back from 1862), to the sole of a childs shoe with the nail holes visible.

He gave a quick introduction and then gave us the option to go alone or stay with him for some history on the area. He was very informative and knowledgeable about the island and any questions thrown his way were very well answered. He ""guided"" us for approx 45 mins until we got to the main courtyard. He then pointed us in the advised direction of the buildings and left us to tour at our own leisure. When he finished with our group (Family of 17) he took time to personally answer my questions about escaping prisoners, which, again, was very informative. We then had approx 150mins of our own time to look around. The island is very well signposted with lots
of signs and TV's telling us how life here used to be. My kids (16 & 12) also enjoyed the time here. We had a total of 3 hours on the island which was a good amount of time to see everything. The boat left the island to take us back exactly on time as instructed when we arrived.

The tour is so well organised from start to finish.

The boat trip over alone is a wonderful experience.

A special mention to our tour guide John G. He guided us up the hill to the fort, stopping along the way to tell us the history of the island. He then told us how to make the best of our 3 hours on the island and highlighted all the must-see areas.

There is a lovely coffee shop and toilet area on the island. There are sandwiches, pizzas and lunches and an impressive array of cakes. Soup, tea and coffee are also available and a freezer of ice creams/ pops for hot days. The toilet are was very clean.

There is so much to see on the island. The views are amazing. In particular from Bastion 2 and 3 and then from the little beach down near the family houses.

A few hours well spent. We were sad to leave the island!

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"It was a very worthwhile experience, well organised boat trip across and we were quickly divided in half and introduced to our tour guides. We spent 45mins being informed and entertained by Jessie, she even sings!! She had such knowledge about the history of the island and history in general. We all learnt a lot. Map was well laid out and we were then left to explore the buildings and island itself. Cafe was nice but €2.50 for a tea bag and hot water a bit steep?!

Donal our tour guide was enthusiastic and really passionate about what he was talking about and extremely informative, his tour lasted 40mins and then we were free to explore the island. My six year old wasn’t too interested but there was a little fairy trail where she had to find fairies which helped and my 12 & 13 year old enjoyed it. The restaurant on site is just average so probably better off bringing a picnic, we’d plenty of time to look around and it was an enjoyable day",Jul 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,2.0,I expected it to be a lot more interesting based on it being in the top few things to see in Cork. Two buildings were burnt down so couldnt see in them and the ones you could see were good but nothing mind blowing. The staff were nice on the boat. 10 minute boat ride. Cafe queue moved really slow. It's good if you are stuck for something to do for a half a day in Cork. Not sure if kids would like it.,Jul 2021

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Went to Spike Island on a very wet Friday in July. But fair play it didn't dampen our spirits. Spike Island is steeped in history. Crossing only takes 10 min each way.

We were lead by Jesse who I have to say is amazing at her job, she was vibrant, personable, and an absolute fountain of knowledge and anecdotes. She made the trip! We left very happy in the knowledge that we'll definitely be returning to take in the parts we missed - the island is simply too full of things to do, a second visit is a must.

Our guide, Donal had a super delivery, enthusiasm and had the group hooked from the start. One whom I would call “ a guides guide”. !
Plenty of time to explore the various exhibitions on your own, as well as enjoy the views of Cork harbour and shipping movements from the gun bastions. Nature lovers can also enjoy the flora. My only quibble. Not enough bins at the cafe, as the breeze blows anything moveable away before you can bin it. Otherwise A1.

Great even with small kids and a 7 month old baby! We all thought it was fantastic! Only downside is parts of the buildings and walkways are difficult to manage in a buggy!

I remember when the Island was a joyrider prison and it was interesting to hear the stories from that time. I would highly recommend the tour.
Our biggest problem was the fact we could have spent the whole day there and still have things to see. 3 1/2 hours is not long enough to see this amazing island",Jun 2021

And we were collected at 4.3pm . There is a coffee shop on the island however with young children trip could be cut by at least an hour . We were lucky the weather was in our favour but would not have enjoyed wandering around the island in bad weather .

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We visited as a family of 5 (7yrs, 5yrs & 18mths). We booked online - we got a family ticket for €53.95 incl. booking fee...the baby was free. I thought it was great value considering what's included. Boat trip over was pleasant & plenty of space on board for the buggy. We opted for the guided tour (FREE) and our tour guide Karl was brilliant, he was energetic & engaging. There is ALOT of history within Spike Island and Karl covered it so well in the tour time of 50mins.
We wandered off through the exhibits afterwards & got some cakes & drinks in the cafe. We left Cobh Harbour @ 11.30am and caught the ferry again from Spike Island at 2.30pm. I think there is an option to extend or shorten the trip by speaking to the guys in the gift shop.
The terrain was fine with the buggy, there wasnt much we couldnt do with it.

Teenagers were really interested in the story of its recent past as a prison for joyriders and others.
Fantastic views and an easy day out. Best review is from the 14-year-old, who said, ""this is the only museum I have actually enjoyed!

Practical stuff - parking behind cathedral is great - 7 mins walk to ferry but longer back up - Cobh is hilly! Also, nice toilets at the cafe. You still have time to explore after tour.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We visited here on Friday as a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids age 8 and 12. We booked the night before last minute and we didn't regret it as we had a fantastic day. I had been wanting to see Spike Island for a few years and it didn't disappoint. We availed of the free parking along the pier which is great. Our guide was Karl and he was brilliant, very knowledgeable and made the experience really engaging even for the kids. The tour lasted about 45 minutes and you have 3 and a half hours on the island but we could have spent longer especially with the beautiful weather. We brought lunch but there is a lovely restaurant on site also. All staff we encountered were so lovely and friendly. Highly recommended.

We thought that with 3 1/2 hours how would will fill the time but we could have stayed most of the day it was so good.
All the staff were very nice and professional.",Jun 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Probably one of the best and most enjoyable tours I have ever done in my life, I have taken the Spike Island tour now about 3 times and not only do I not ever get sick of it, I learn something new each and every time. The location is beautiful, the boat trip over is very comfortable and extremely enjoyable, the guys on the boat and absolute gents and the tour guides are all very friendly and so polite, and I would like to give special mention to one of the tour guides Karl, who was very funny, very knowledgeable, very friendly and a perfect gentleman. The facilities were brilliant and the exhibits around the island were very cool and the views were unbelievable. It’s a shame I can only give it 5 stars because it deserves so much more. There is a spooky and creepy vibe around the modern cell block which I though made the place much more interesting and exciting and the punishment block was very scarily quiet when we were there and made us really feel how bad a place it must have been for prisoners there which also made it very real and exciting. Heard some really funny stories too which broke up the sort of potentially boring history of one should find it boring at all but there’s not a thing to be bored by on this island as everything is so interesting and the tour guides keep you hooked on the tour the whole time. Rarely have I seen your guides that can hold a crowd as well as the spike island guides can do day in day out. Will totally be doing it again in the future and hopefully it will not be too long before I do it again.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Short journey on the boat over. Safe & efficient. Lovely views through out. Lots of room to walk around and great excercise after a night out or a car journey. Lots of couples, families & groups of friends. We had a brilliant guide John G. V.informative but also v. relaxed & fun. Cafe with snacks & coffee etc. Also perfect place to have a picnic. There are hills, & steps to some exhibits etc so for wheel chair users or those with mobility issues there are some challenges depending on fitness.

It's a great day for a family with older children, or a couple like ourselves. We saw some little ones having to be carried back by parents.

Ireland,Spike Island,3.0,"We were really looking forward to this day out but unfortunately we were quite disappointed as the tour isn't actually a tour. I double checked the tickets to be sure and it does say Spike Island tour but we were not guided or given any information beyond the docking point on the Island. There is alot to see, and read but it feels like a lesser experience just wandering around reading alot of boards when a guide would have been much better and was expected.",Aug 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Visited recently and had a great guide in Honor. Her knowledge was amazing and just wanted to bring her as my personal tour guide!! Hard to believe it was a working prison up to a few years ago. Certainly recommend it and even better if the weather is good.,Sep 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,1.0,"We were very dissatisfied with our trip to spike island. When we arrived we did the guided tour which was very good but short. The 3 hours allocated for trip we felt was too long so we decided to make our way back to the earlier ferry. As we got to the boat we could see they were getting ready to pull off so we ran. Literally as we got to the gate a blonde lady working with the company closed the gate turned and walked away. We called after her and she very rudely said ""they're be another one in a while"" while she walked away without even turning around. A simple explanation would have sufficed. It certainly wasnt a social distancing issue as there was seats available and people were sitting as normal without social distancing on the way over. Its such a pity she had to be so rude. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"This was one of the highlights of our trip to Cork. I have no sea legs so was wary about a boat trip but it was only very short and enjoyable. Upon disembarking we were met by John G. His tour brought the island alive. He was entertaining and informative and genuinely seemed to love his job. He had a lovely friendly manner and gave us all of the facts and background to Spike's previous life. We were unaware of the history of the island (embarrassing as we are Irish) and really learned so much about the uses it has had and sadly the destruction which happened during the riot. However there is so much background history and artifacts, you can get the information from your guide and then leisurely stroll around the island and into all the poignant areas, which have information posted around to inform you of the uses and history. The views from the island are beautiful and if you are lucky enough to get a sunny day like we did you can see for miles. Thank you John G... I would highly recommend taking this tour and visiting this piece of history.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Brilliant tour, would highly recommend. Spike island is a short boat trip from Cobh (short enough to avoid sea sickness!). We were met by our fabulous tour guide Honor, an absolute lady, with a great sense of humour. The tour lasted for 3.5hr, could have done with another half hour or so but we got to see the majority of the prison. The views from the island of Cobh are beautiful. The island is exposed and as Irish weather goes, dress for all types of weather!",Sep 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We went to Spike for the second time and was amazed at the difference from the first visit.
I like the way they have done a lot of work but still have kept the true character and the unique look.
I feel some places when updated don't get it right. The tour guide was very good had all the knowledge and was able to mix it up a bit with humour.
The boat trip is short but lovely and its nice to get time on your own to explore the whole island but I do recommend doing the tour first.

Ireland,Spike Island,3.0,"We were unlucky with the weather: it was extremely windy and cold. The guided tour was all outdoors. I was very uncomfortable and cold even though I wore lots of layers, a winter hat and gloves (in September). This trip is best enjoyed on a warm, dry day with no strong winds - the island is very exposed to the elements. Our tour guide Karl was fantastic, he is so good at his job! The self-guided exhibition is spread across a number of buildings. I found it diffucult to follow: the numbers on the map/app didn't match the numbers on site! Very confusing and discouraging. Parts of the exhibition looked a bit dated - would do with a refresher/redesign. The short boat ride there and back was enjoyable.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,It's only a 10-15 min boat out to the island from the picturesque town of Cobh. John the tour guide was brilliant giving us an overall insight into the history of the island. We had about 3 hours to explore the place and didn't manage to see everything as its a 100 acre site. The parts we did see were very interesting indeed. There are so many different sections to visit and a different story in each one. There's a cafe and toilet facilities and our overall experience was thoroughly enjoyable.,Sep 2020

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"The perfect activity in these COVID times. Social distancing not a problem on 120 acres of island in the middle of Cork Harbour. A spectacular location to start with and worth for the sights alone. Then the history of the island and the fort is fascinating, though tragic in many respects.

John G was our guide and it was just a pity he couldn’t take the tour further! He gave us a great account of the island and its uses, with good humour and wit throughout.

You could easily immerse yourself in the history and exhibits for a full day but there are numerous walks too, three of them very well mapped on the brochure given on arrival. We sailed to Spike at 2 and returned at 5.30. Apart from a break for our own packed lunch (there is also a cafe on the island), we spent the full time after the tour inside the fort. Could easily spend more time touring the island ... we shall return! There was a free app with audio guides which I didn’t download due to low battery but would be useful for the areas without a guide

So much potential for more tourist exhibits and restoration of the run down properties around the island. Looking forward to seeing what future phases of the tourism project in Spike bring to life!!

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We visited the Island on not the best of days weather wise but nothing could take from the interesting and entertaining visit we had wonderfully handled by our guide - Karl. While you have a choice of heading off yourself when you get to the island I would strongly recommend you stay with the guide for approximately 30-40 mins before you go exploring on your own. There is plenty to see on the island and getting the history of the island from Karl and the way he made it come alive was superb. After we left him we were free to wander as we pleased and we just about got in all the sights before our return boat - I would suggest not delaying too long in the cafe - nice as it is and has wonderful food on offer if you want to get everything in. Overall I could not say enough about this attraction which would appeal to both young and old.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Absolutely fabulous trip to Spike Island. The boat was well run and felt safe in C-19. You are offered to be guided or walk around yourself. I would defo take the guide (Neil). He opened up the history of the island. It felt like you were in the history. There is a lot of information displayed in each area. Good exhibits. Take your time around you will see it all before your boat leaves. Some of the rooms can get slow in a big group. Some like reading everything some skim. I would defo go again.,Sep 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,The overall tour from the time we left Cobh pier to meeting our guide (Marian) to visiting each of the different buildings and the cafe was top class.

Marian was really passionate and knowledgeable about the history and development of Spike and gave us a great sense of the various phases of its past.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"I loved the Island, and found it very peaceful. Three and a half hours is a good length of time for the visit as it takes time to walk around and see everything.

I was disappointed when on enquiry in the shop, I was told that the audio guide is confusing as the numbers on signs around the Island don't correspond with numbers mentioned on the audio. Therefore the girl didn't recommend it.
I also found that the leaflet from Spike Island Tours didn't correspond with the signage on the island.
I wonder why we can't get these things right!!

I found it difficult to have two different narratives audible in the rooms where the Independence exhibition is on. They were both quite loud and intrusive on each other. It also makes it difficult to concentrate on reading the information boards.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"We really enjoyed this tour. The tour guide Anna was excellent, and there was so much to see and take in. The only downfall for us was that because we had booked the last tour of the day (2.45pm) we did feel as though we were being rushed through seeing parts of the prison, as staff were wanting to lock up to allow them to get on our ferry back to Cobh at 6.15pm. For example, we were told by staff that the tower containg the gun was being locked at 5.40pm, where as we still had half an hour left on our trip. I would advise to book an early time slot for your visit.",Aug 2020

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Really enjoyed out trip to Spike Island. The boat crossing from Cobh is only about 10 mins but enough to get a great view of the harbour. The staff onboard were really great and made sure we boarded safely and maintained physical distancing while on aboard. It was really interesting to get a quick history of the island by our tour guide (30 mins) and then we were allowed discover the island by ourselves. I would have given it five stars but we were not allowed purchase any souvenirs in the Gift Shop when our tour ended even though we deliberately finished early to make it on time to the shop. I had even enquired before we left Cobh as to the opening hours and was assured it would be open to us. The shop assistant, who had also been our guide, I felt was very curt as she cashed up for the day and told us it was closed. My advice if you would love a souvenir of your visit is to shop first. As it is quiet exposed I would recommend good weather to visit to make the most of your experience.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Brilliant day visiting Spike Island - a really fantastic place to visit which is very well run by lovely people. We did a great tour with John G and then made our way around through the island. It was just my husband and I visiting, but the place is very family friendly and accessible. There is lots to see and great exhibits throughout. We would also recommend spending some time in Cobh while in the area - a really beautiful town.

Very knowledgeable, answers all questions enthusiastically, but with a good sense of humour.
Couldn’t recommend visiting Spike island highly enough. The island is steeped in fascinating history and there is so much to see and learn. Outstanding trip and will be back again. 👍👏

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We were meant to visit Spike Island today but it was cancelled due to Storm Ellen. While we can't comment on the tour itself, we were very impressed with the level of customer service. We received a cancellation email & also a follow up phone call to ensure we knew that it would not be running and didn't travel to Cobh needlessly. We were also given the details of our refunds. We received the refund today, the day after cancellation and on the day we were due to go on the tour. We were shocked that we were refunded so quickly. Overall great customer service. Hopefully we will get a chance to take the tour again another time!

He had an autograph book signed by many of his fellow Independence colleagues. We gave Spike a loan of the book to scan in and all the pages were on display there.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"My boyfriend and I wanted to learn about Spike Island’s history after it was recommended by a few friends. Definitely worth it. 06/08/2020
(Included in price of ticket) You get the ferry at Kennedy Pier in Cobh, roughly a 10 minute ride, and have about 3 hours for your trip which is plenty. Once there we met our tour guide Ross, who said it was optional to join him for a guided tour (also included with ticket) or self guide. We joined the guided tour and it was highly informative, very enlightening as well as funny.

Ireland’s incredibly impressive Spike Island - 104 acres large - holds a very dark part with Ireland’s past. Some fun facts I learned today was it held the title once as the world’s largest prison, rivalling Alcatraz prison in San Francisco Bay and it would need at least 5 Alcatraz prison to cover Spike Island.

There’s evidence of defensive structures on Spike Island as early as 1600.
The fort links closely with the needs of Britain, by whom Ireland was occupied at the time. The development of the fortress itself aimed at providing a safe gathering for ships that were heading to America to fight on the British side of the American War of Independence. Incarcerated men, women and children who were sentenced for minor crimes like stealing. Some of these people were sent on these ships to work as labourers to serve out the rest of their sentence. Cobh as the last stopping point of the Titanic before it collided with an iceberg.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Been wanting to visit for years and finally got around to it today. We weren’t disappointed!!

We were a family of 5 with 3 children, 11,8&3. The boat over was short and we were met by Karl, who was an excellent host. His knowledge of the island was fantastic and he kept us all entertained with his enthusiasm, wit and expertise.

We were then let on our own to explore and it was easy enough to find our way around with the map provided. Unfortunately it was a foggy day so we couldn’t get to appreciate the views which I am sure are spectacular on a sunny day.

The choice of cakes in the cafe after a couple of hours was pleasing especially the vanilla sponge cake, delicious!! Staff were extremely friendly.

A really enjoyable few hours and we’d highly recommend, the kids had a ball and learned loads.

The only disappointing part of the trip was the boat back to Cobh. We were told to be there for 1:30 however when we arrived at 1:25 it had already gone and we never actually departed until after 2:10, which was frustrating with the kids and it was wet at this point. Nearly a 5 star review but this did waste things for us.

After the tour you are free to roam this huge fortress and see history you would not think about. From the Garda behind the door to the inmate sleeping in his bunk.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"I would advise any tourist visiting Cork to visit this Island which which was historically a penitentiary, but now a major exhibition.
Some parts are guided. The ferry ride to and from the island is quite enjoyable and the view of Cobh harbor is magnificent!
Great activity for kids as well.
On the island however, there is a small deli that serves snacks - I would advise bringing your own as the selection isn't very great.
I really did enjoy the Breech gun exhibit and talks about the island being a Fort during conflicts.
I heard that at certain times of the year, there are also evening tours which give a ""haunted feel"". Dinner I believe might be included. Would definitely check that out!
There is a lovely coastline with some abandoned houses on the island. Also worth exploring!

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"We had a really lovely family day out. The staff in particular couldn't have been nicer from the ferry staff to our tour guide John G when we arrived on the island - it is absolutely worthwhile taking this short little guided half hour tour. John G was extremely knowledgeable about the island and really made it very interesting and used a lot of humour which kept the kids very much engaged. My 10 year old son said afterwards that was really good and he remembered in particular the story of the riots where the prisoners broke out and then back in and the mother who came to talk her son down from the roof. The prison/fort itself was very interesting and my youngest loved the fairy trail along the way too. All in all a great family day out. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 star was that we didn't have enough time on the island.

The history of the island is amazing and a great day out for the family",Jul 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Great day out. Went with 3 kids. Noel the guide's advice was to manage our time as there was a lot to squeeze into our time in the island. He was right. A lot to see , a lot of history and plenty of walks. Well laid out and organised considering the current Covid restrictions.",Jul 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Done spike Island tour today, would highly recommend. The tour guide John G was excellent. Very interesting history with lots to see and do an overall fantastic experience.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"We spent a fabulous 3.5 hours exploring Spike Island. The tour was very really well organised, a nice short boat ride, we had a great 30 minute talk from tour guide 'John G' and spent the rest of the time exploring the island. It's a safe and easy place to bring young kids, would definitely recommend it as a great family day out.",Jun 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"I did the After Dark Tour with two friends on a stormy Saturday night in March 2020. It was the main purpose of our trip to Cork and it did not disappoint! It rained for most of the night and was really windy which surprisingly added to the atmosphere of Spike Island. There was such an amount of history to learn, definitely more than you could fit into one 3 hour trip, but that just leaves an excuse to go back and visit the fantastic destination in daylight hours. There is a great cafe facility on the island too. Although it was closed during the After Dark Tour, we were still were able to go in and use the coffee machine, get snacks from the vending machine and warm up in the seating area. There were also bathrooms if you needed them. Our tour guide was Rob. He was so engaging and interesting. He had such vast knowledge of the history, great sense of humour and managed to catch the group out with a scare or two along the tour. The whole team was very friendly and professional and the boat trip was very comfortable despite how choppy the sea was that night. I would definitely recommend a trip to Spike Island and highly recommend the After Dark Tour (all the better if you get Rob as your tour guide!).

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"This is a great place to visit. You can sit at the end of the canal watching the swans and other water fowl, there are boats bobbing on the water and very few people about. You can also sit looking over the Mersey sometimes seeing porpoises.
It is my little bit of peace.",Sep 2019
Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"The short trip over to Spike island is well worth taking if you're in the area. The boat trip is short and pleasant with great views of Cobh. The tours of Spike were very well run. The guided tour is relatively short and entertaining, leaving you with plenty of time to explore the many exhibitions, cells and the island itself. There's a cafe on the island too. Boats return about 3 hours after arrival and it's a perfect amount of time.
Make sure you go up onto the highest point where the guns point out to sea, for fantastic views of the harbour.",Mar 2020
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,We took the boat over from Cobh to Spike Island. It used to be a prison. It was a wet and windy day and yet we barely noticed this once we landed. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and entertaining. It is a facinating place to visit and I'd highly recommend it.,Mar 2020

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Spike Island was a fantastic experience. The tour manages to combine both the past and recent past beautifully and concisely; the guided tour lasted for about an hour and then we were free to spend the remaining time as we wished; by visiting the various prison buildings and exhibits or taking a walk around the island. Our tour guide Karl was brilliant and answered any questions that the group had. Facilities were great. Would highly, highly recommend this tour.",Mar 2020

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Visited with friends at the height of Storm Ciara.

Trip out was a little bit choppy, and it was a bit windy on the island, but its Ireland in winter, don't expect to need your sunscreen.

We decided to stay with Kyle, our guide, as did most people (you can simply wander off and not be guided, but our thinking was to take the tour and then explore on our own after it ended). Well, we'd made it into the fortress (which was MUCH larger than I had expected - this place is HUGE!) when Kyle's radio went off and after a short discussion he informed us that due to the deteriorating weather they were worried we wouldn't be able to get off the island, and so we were being ""evacuated"".

He clearly was disappointed for us, so rushed us around the fort trying to show us everything important. This spoke to both his enthusiam for the island and also his knowledge - a guide on a script couldn't have improvised like that. Thanks to this, I think we saw most of the ""sights"".

Eventually we made our way back to the boat, which was definitely bobbing around. While waiting to depart one of the guides/operators announced that they were sorry we'd had to leave early, and that everyone would be refunded in full, either by reversing the transaction (if electronic) or by just getting their cash back if they had paid cash. Given that we were on the island for almost 2 hours and had 90% of the tour, this was more than fair. I'm sure they could easily have claimed ""force majure/act of god"", but they didn't (and my friend, who had booked it on credit card, was indeed promptly refunded)

The place itself is interesting, and I'd recommend it for that anyway, but the superlative customer service in difficult circumstances means I'm only giving them 5 stars because I can't give six!

Once in the island you are surrounded by the stories and history of the place.
The island has good examples of the cells prisoners stayed in and some of the art work they produced whilst on the island.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Spike Island has only been open for public tours for a year or two and there is still much to do in turning this into a large-scale tourist attraction.
But we thought what has been opened so far is fantastic and well worth the money.
We clicked lucky with the weather for the last day of the season it was open - a crisp,sunny day in early December.
After a picturesque boat ride we were met and expertly guided around the island's fortress and prison by Karl who combined knowledge and passion about his subject with humour to make it both interesting and entertaining.
Afterwards we were able to wander around the island unattended and enjoyed spectacular views over Cork Harbour.
At €20 a head for the full four and a half hour experience we thought this phenomenal value for money.
Highly recommended.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Had an enjoyable experience watching shawshank redemption on the island last night. Well worth it and the short tour afterwards was good, must definitely go back for the after dark tour of the island.
Only two small negatives, seats weren’t overly comfortable for the film screening, lots of people commented on it and informed the staff out there.
Secondly the film stalled and we had to locate a staff member to sort it out, which lead to a 5 minute delay, maybe there should be some member of staff in the room at all times just in case it’s a repeat issue with the technology.
Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

We started off on the blue loop thinking we had taken the toughest route. We soon found out it was one of the easiest (Took 1 hour). The end of the blue route brought us to the start of the Red route (two hours). We thought, feck it 2 hour will be alright.
The red route is extremely challenging. “Cardiac hill” is not for the feint hearted. I was a ball of sweat and needed to take several breaks. The view at the top was amazing and very rewarding.
Bring snacks and drinks to refuel cause you will need it.

Extremely rewarding - good luck on the red trail!

There are many areas to hike, kayak, and swim if that's your thing.

The drive itself, although spectacular, is not for the faint of heart once you depart Killarney itself. Take your time and don't allow yourself to be bullied off the road.

Lots of great wildlife to be seen - try not to hit any wandering sheep!

Ireland,Killarney National Park,3.0,"This park was such a disappointment as we had been looking forward to it.

On the plus side it is just outside Killarney, easy to get to, loads of parking and is actually quite large with some great views.

However there are some large negatives. We did a mix of walking and cycling. It is ideally suited to bikes with wide paths and flat terrain around the lake. However I think bikes aren’t that welcome, we found one small bike rack in the park (maybe 12 bikes) so most people chained bikes to railings. For example we cycled to Tork Waterfall to discover nowhere to leave bikes so we chined them to a fence. Loads of people doing that. We did a cycle around the lake and the best bit was that the trail for bikes just ends and you get dumped out onto the main road which has no hard shoulder or bike lane for the last 1-2km. We got a very nasty surprise with our 8yr old and didn’t enjoy that part with traffic so close. No signs or warning notes. In general as I said it felt like bikes aren’t that welcome even though there were loads on bikes the day we were there.

We like our hikes and really like getting to see a park and making the most of the amenity. However this park seems determined not to lay the trails out clearly, the only maps ones we could find were on sighs scattered around the house and left about 80% of the park apparently off limits. There were no maps on the site to buy or otherwise and we were advised to go back into Killarney and ask in the bike rental shops for maps!!!!!! That’s really not helpful when you’re at the park.

As the centre piece of Killarney tourism I must say we left disappointed. The lack of maps meant that we didn’t get the most out of our time or the amenities that we think are there. We found the national parks in Donegal to an equivalent standard in terms of forestry and views while offering a much better visitor experience.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"Killarney National Park is a treasure.
There are a variety of paths for short hops, or for a longer stretch.

Try starting at Deenagh Bridge (Across from the Cathedral) and follow your nose.

You'll find an endless variety of options.

A long stretch can take you to historic Ross Castle, where you might get a chance to feed some ducks.

Shorter trips veer right and pass some fine wood carvings of forest dwellers, a childrens playground, and playing fields for older children. Continue on and you'll have a chance to see some deer, before reaching the Castle Ross Hotel. Maybe a quick pitstop here may yeild benefits. For those more adventurous the path continues on passing a tennis court to your right, and onward through some ancient woodland. You cross an open field and veer into the wood at the crest of the hill. Through this wood you can circle around and find yourself back on the main path in Killarney National Park. Turn left on this path and walk to the Tatched Cottage fir some well-earned refreshment.

Theres a different walk for every day of the year.

The Park is well maintained by Rangers, who put time and effort keeping things as natural and tourist-friendly as possible.

Enjoy your trip!

It contains miles of pathways, two huge lakes, old manor houses, church ruins, and all manner of trees and flowering shrubs. Parking areas are located outside all the entrances. If you begin by the ruins of Muckross Abbey, off Highway N71, you can walk for hours through and around the park, emerging near Muckross House or further south along the highway, or make a look and return to where you began. This is a splendid way to spend a day. We walked it on a day when there was light rain, and the weather actually added to the experience. Don't miss this if you are in the Killarney area.
Note: The pathways in the park all are negotiable by wheelchair or pushing a stroller.

Mountains and lakes make a great combination.. Jarvey cars which are pulled by a horse are expensive but it is probably worth using it if your time is limited.. No cars are allowed except. in the parking lot and it is free as is the park itself..which is about two miles south of Killarney town.Nearby is a working farm which shows how farm work was done about a century ago.. I like a meal in the restaurant and I wander around for several hours. Muckross House is beautiful and historical and in which Queen Victoria spent her last family holiday before her husband died in 1861.at the age of 40.The ruins of an ancient church is fascinating and you can climb up the steps for a good view.. There is a waterfall in the park too..In another part of the park near the town is a large covered boat for a trip around the lake. Nearby is the 500 year old Ross Castle which you can visit.. On another day you might consider a trip to the Gap of Dunloe and a boat across the lakes taking a few hours. I like to end the day in Hotel Europe in the dining room upstairs where you can get a beautiful view of the lake as you enjoy your meal. See much more on www,killarneynationalpark,ie

Possibly a little overrated but worth a stop of two if you are passing through or staying in Killarney.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"We visited Killarney National Park (free entrance), specifically Muckross House, gardens, and Killarney House. The Muckross House tour (fee w/senior discount) was fascinating and educational. We enjoyed the gardens and view of one of the lakes in the park, which is 25,000+ acres, including 3 lakes and a biodiverse landscape. Oak forests used to cover Ireland, but now may only be found in the park. We also visited Killarney House (free to all), and enjoyed 15 rooms of interactive history and beauty. Red deer are protected from hunting at the park and horses for the jaunting car(cart) rides are treated humanely.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"Saw as much as we could in 2 days. Beautiful place—super friendly woman working at the welcome center was very helpful in helping us build an itinerary. The waterfall is nice, but beware there’s nothing great if you continue on that hike up the mountain past the waterfall. My curiously forced me to go all the way up, and I just ended up tired! Nice hike though.

The abbey is well worth the visit, as is the house and the gardens surrounding.

What a special place!

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"Beautiful day hiking in Killarney; we definitely lucked out with gorgeous weather as well with no rain (9/27). There are 2 parking lots that we saw- the first was for taking a horse drawn carriage (there are also other carriages further up at the Muckross House) and the second was by the Muckross House. Park in the 2nd if you are planning on hiking or cycling. It was free to park. There are bathrooms and a café that serves sandwiches as well as some hot dishes if you are looking for a bite to eat. We then stopped into the Muckross house for a map which showed a few different trail options. Unfortunately on the actual hike we did not see any markers so we probably walked a lot further than necessary and the map was not helpful. Some was very hilly and we definitely broke a sweat and were glad we had on hiking boots. Overall though it was a lovely hike with lots to see; and exactly what I was looking for on that day. There is a lake that you can walk around and also take boat trips. Definitely walk up to see the Torc waterfall. This part of the walk was not bad. A lot of people were sketching while sitting on rocks around the waterfall. There are free bathrooms throughout the park; most appeared to close at 6pm.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"This is a national park on a par with several national parks in the US. For anyone who thinks it doesn't measure up because it's close to town, I would invite them to visit Great Smokey Mountains in the US, or Waterton in Canada. There are actually a lot of national parks adjacent to towns. Does Yellowstone have less of a national park feel because it has four sizable towns close by?
Anyway, this was like an overview of the inland Ring of Kerry with the Three Lakes, Ladies View, wildlife, the mountains, and Torc waterfall. If I had to pick one favorite thing in the park, it would probably be the young red deer grazing at Ladies View. I wouldn't call it tame, just tolerant of the people who gathered near it as it grazed. We simply weren't as important as food as we took pictures from only a few feet away.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,3.0,"As avid hikers we have visited numerous ""National Parks"", this however didn't meet our expectations as a National Park. Granted this place was beautiful with paved trails to the big attractions right inside the park, and it had nice paths along, and around the lake that you can either walk or ride a bike, however because this ""park"" is located just minutes from downtown Killarney, didn't give the feel of being in a National Park, maybe more like a National historical monument/site with the Muckross House & Folklife Centre. Granted I'm comparing this to places here in the United States, but we were just a little disappointed, obviously no need to wear your hiking boots. It is still beautiful to visit, and certainly worth stopping, just didn't stack up to what we had envisioned. Another bit of information, didn't cost anything to enter the park.

Our tour guide, Shona, exaggerated all details to make it sound like a meander. Now, in April when writing up our project, we will be giving twisted information risking not achieving our full potential. Paying this money and risk this is a disgrace. Putting our futures in jeopardy and she laughing after making about €500 for a half a days work.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"There are several places along the road where you can park. The one closest to Killarney town is across the road from the entrance (grand gates and a little cottage). Then there are a few up at Muckross House and Torc Waterfalls. We chose the one closest to town, which is also a point to catch the horse drawn carriages (as well as at Muckross House). About 2 kms from this car park to the house, and another 2 kms to the waterfalls. Relatively flat on paved or hard pack gravel with a couple little climbs. People were strolling with baby carriages and non-hiking attire, without problems. No water, garbage bins or washrooms until just below the falls. Signage is good once past Muckross house, but confusing prior to that. The old Muckross Abbey and burial ground is in a pretty setting, not sure if you can walk through the ruin or not.

We also drove the portion of road (Ring of Kerry) in the park between town and the top of the mountain, very tight and twisty roads, and buses traveling in the counter clockwise direction....they have the right of way, and must have nerves of steel to do that route! On a nice day, beautiful views, on a cloudy/misty day, there are some views lower down the mountain.

But I will say that you can see very little of Torc waterfall, only one spot gives you a good view, and it is jam-packed with people. But in the end I didn't mind. A really nice place to visit, plus the deer are stunning and not tame.",Jul 2019
Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"This is an amazing park... lots of hikes for all different levels. The drive there is hairy with lots of spots that only one large car can fit through.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,4.0,"The Killarney national park is truly & magically beautiful with lots of places to stop and admire. It was just a shame about the amount of litter/rubbish/trash we spotted walking along the trials and to the waters edge in the stops and lay-bys. It is a shame people cannot take their trash with them and there was just too much for us to take away with us, but perhaps a litter bin or two dotted around the park or signs, like the ones cautioning people not to leave their valuables visible in their cars as they might be broken into, might encourage people to think more about not leaving it behind and ruining the experience for others who come after them.",Jul 2019

Ireland,Killarney National Park,4.0,"We walked from Killarney town past the racecourse to the Killarney National Park near Ross Castle. On the return we took another route towards the cathedral back to the town. From the town to the park we walked on a footpath and on the return we were on a tarred walkway.
In the park there are tarred and some earthen walkways which are well signposted and take you to the edge of the lake in places and around Ross Island which is really a peninsula jutting out into the lake. These paths are through typical Irish/British forest which is very relaxing and beautiful. There are more paths that we did not venture on but would give more scope for walking.

We also saw red deer which are only found in Ireland. In total we walked about 10 km which includes 2.6 km each way from the town to the park and back. Ross castle (initially built in the 1400’s) is situated in the park and can be visited. There is also a cafe there with nice outdoor, covered and uncovered, eating areas. Clean toilet facilities are available at the castle.

This is a very nice place to visit and meander through the forest. The paths are reasonably flat and it is easy walking.

Killarney NP and especially the Ring of Kerry was one of my finest experiences in the world and I can even liken my tribute to travelling throughout South Island New Zealand in 1996, which I consider the benchmark for all my travelling experiences.
Stunning, a national park viewed in the very best of weather conditions and Valentia Island was so beautiful and tranquil!
Easy to navigate, although there was a road closure near Kenmare when we were visiting.

Ireland,Killarney National Park,4.0,"Killarney National Park is really a stunning – and a very large - national park!
The landscape is stunning and there are also many historical sites in the national park.

I visited Killarney National Park in the middle of June and I really thought the landscape was beautiful and the historical sites were spectacular.
However, there were more tourists and coaches than I anticipated. You will not find the quiet, untouched nature that you can - for example - find on the Beara Peninsula in Killarney National Park since there are tourists almost everywhere.

In the national park there are many nice points with great views, but the jaw-dropping nature, like Kerry Cliffs or Gap of Dunloe is not to be found in Killarney National Park.

I would advise you to take a whole day to explore Killarney National Park, then you will have plenty of time for photo-stops, walks and lunchbreaks.
I stayed in the pretty little town Kenmare when exploring Killarney National Park: so first I drove through the beautiful Molls Gap - and then entered the national park - starting with Ladies’ View which is a viewpoint with nice views over the lakes and the surrounding mountains. Then comes Torc Waterfall - an 18 metre high waterfall surrounded by lush vegetation. However the parking at Torc Waterfall (located 200 metres from the waterfall) is far too small - it got crowded with cars immediately making it almost impossible to find a parking spot.
I also visited Ross Castle and hiked out on Ross Island to Library Point (a five kilometre hike in the green forests of Ross Island). Ross Castle (think Blarney Castle but a quite a bit smaller) itself is a large and well-kept castle which is nice to see from the outside. You can only enter it on a guided tour.
Muckross Abbey is, perhaps, the most interesting historical site in Killarney National Park - Muckross Abbey, built in the 13th century is large, surprisingly well-kept and there is no entrance fee. The parking to Muckross Abbey is located about 500-metres from the actual site.

One thing that is very important to note: even though Gap of Dunloe is not located in Killarney National Park (it is located about 15 minutes from Killarney city centre), it is still worth to drive through it the gap.
And, yes, it is possible to drive though Gap of Dunloe, but you have to do it after the jaunting cars have gone home, which means after 8 p.m.

Kenmare is a lovely point for exploring Killarney National Park - Kenmare is not just a cute little town, it is also a superb starting point for visiting the national park.

Killarney National Park is a lovely place: it is a bit touristic and the nature is not jaw-dropping, but the combination of nice nature and many well-kept historical sites still makes Killarney National Park a place worth visiting.

Our decision was to walk the 10 km around the lake, without any hurry and enjoying the different views and nature that surrounds you. The outstanding scenarious during your visit will be more than enough to make your trip worthy.
If you only want to go for 5 km walk, you will have the chance to take a boat that returns you back to the entrance, where the big house and garden are located. Another possibility is to make this visit by bike and stop for a coffee after 5 km rides.
Any decision that you make will be good enough to have a lovely day!!

It forms part of the Ring of Kerry drive and you get some fantastic scenery through the park section. It is worth doing your homework on places to visit as we found the heritage signage a bit lacking. As there are many different types of attraction you should sort out what you want to actually do and then plan the trip.

We did notice lots of people on bikes (not sure about that with busses and narrow roads) and also a signposted walkers route.

Good day (or days out)

Ireland,Killarney National Park,5.0,"I wish I had read the sign that was at the bottom of the mountain which says don't go up by yourself and be careful coming down. The biggest problem with the mountain was that there are no specific paths and you can go a lot of different ways. There were many people climbing the path and I wish I had followed someone coming down more closely because I got very very lost. Fortunately after many wrong turns and backups and backtracking, I did find my way down and it was a really cool experience climbing a mountain. The devil's Punchbowl is absolutely beautiful. Just be prepared for cold or weather when you get to the top and make sure you have plenty of food and water. I actually refilled my water bottle from a mountain stream really close to the top because I was really thirsty. I didn't get sick and water tasted great!

Many other areas around torc waterfalls and on the muckross peninsulla are infested with rhododendron to point that nothing else grows and views are spoilt. The rhododendron issue extends up as far as ladies view and beyond. This is the result of greyhound racing getting more funding the entire Irish wildlife/ parks service. I tried failte Ireland office and the park HQ and could not get any reliable information on where I had the best chance of seeing the white tailed eagles which is a pity. The nation park seems more about ferrying tourists between hotels and muckross house for photos than the amazing natural landscape the area contains.

We did not have alot of time and this place was perfect for a couple of hour visit.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,1.0,"The man at the door was very friendly and helpful.

There was lots of brick and brack and photos of famous people. Feels like a 2nd hand shop.

One room has history of the irish times.

Another room has u2 pictures.

Another room had the history of the 1916 rising.

Another room was old phone cards, old Irish money and gold covered crisps. Its a bit odd.

The tour guide insulted the Irish efforts in Ww2 , She said "" we are neutral so we did nothing for WW2 and anyways Irish are not good fighters. ""

Actually thosands of men from Ireland travelled to the UK to join the British Armed Forces. The Irish government had tried to keep the war secret by telling the Irish media to call it the emergency.

Plus tens of thousands of Irish people crossed over to work in war industries in the UK.

There are lots of FREE history places to visit in Dublin this place was not worth the money if it was free and had no tour guide then it would have been alright.

I am Irish from Dublin and I went there with friends who are from other countries to show them a bit about the rich history of Dublin,

My friends liked the first room which had drawings of famous Dublin buildings and the Harry Clark glass art work but they were are bit confused at everything else there.

In the museum The staff were more then accommodating with our two very young children. It’s an old house so lots of stairs but the staff were there to help with the pram. There’s lots of old memorabilia and some great story’s to go along with it. I would recommend anyone going to Dublin to visit.

You only get guided around two rooms, one of which is of obscure facts of the 20th Century, if you are not from Ireland.

As we were leaving we wanted to purchase a poster from the gift shop but it wasn’t in stock, so the gentleman at the desk went through the trouble of locating it and had it waiting at the front desk when we stopped by a few hours later! Would definitely recommend this stop for your Dublin trip.",Sep 2021

The museum consisted of three floors dedicated to different time periods in Dublin's history, with plenty of photo opportunities for the whole family.
The museum workers could not have been more accommodating when it came to to our baby. They offered us offices etc to feed and change her and were keen to help out wherever they could!

Due to the Covid-situation they had no guided tours in the museum but the staff was present to answer questions and help you along.
Also we attended a guided walking tour in Stephens Green called the Writers of Dublin.
It was very good and the guide (Cierán) made the tour and really nice experience by knowledge, interaction, and really acting. Don’t miss the walking tours!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I live in Dublin and I love The Little Museum of Dublin!

It hosts artefacts, memorabilia and knick-knacks from everyday life over the past century or so, and it provides a great insight into how modern Ireland has been shaped and how it has changed.

There are treasures in every nook and cranny, and if you like nostalgia (and quirky nostalgia at that - check out the current display of Virgin Mary statues!) it's a fantastic place to visit.

The staff are absolutely brilliant too. I've been coming here - at least once a year - since it opened and I always discover something new or hear a different story! While there was no guided tour when I visited last week (due to Covid - but a good thing to do, when available) there were staff dotted around the museum ready to help visitors or tell a story about some of the items on display.

Also, if you like U2, this is a must-see. There is a dedicated room to genuine U2 memorabilia and has a great amount of posters, tickets, flyers, special editions, accessories, etc., which would interest most music fans.

Altogether, a huge thumbs-up from me!

Inside the park, she led us to the statues of many important writers and poets suck as Joyce and Yeats. She blended humourously facts about their lives with anecdotes and witty gossip - it was very jolly. Sensitive to her audience Ann drew in elements of Irish, American and British history.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Myself and another person wanted to go on a cultural date, a museum or gallery, in Dublin so I suggested this. It seemed easy to access (on St Stephens Green a few doors down from The Shelbourne Hotel) and reviews were favourable.

So I booked tickets online, easy to do, but also easy to pick the wrong dates when one is rushing around booking things on one's mobile on a hot day!
Discovered I accidentally misbooked the date, but someone was very quick to contact me back to correct my booking, easy to do and surprisingly no trouble to them (this given that one usually cannot get anywhere after one has made a booking online to modify it, so this extra touch is much appreciated). Nice customer service....before even arriving, well that is always a great start.

It was on a hot sunny July day in late afternoon. I arrived unsure of what to expect but was happy to go get my map and hear about the hunt and museum, a nice bonus is free entry to MoLi too if one wants to see that museum also. As it was in the middle of the heatwave, I hoped the Treasure Hunt could be a leisurely stroll through the leafy park in the shade from the sun, and maybe get some respite inside the museum from the heat outside. I was a little mistaken on this one!

Unfortunately, the heatwave and plenty of glass windows meant massive indoors heat. The museum was an oven. Very few other guests was a relief at least. There were stairs to climb as it was held on 3 floors but each floor was a delight.

The museum is FULL of memorabilia. One could spend hours just looking at everything, let alone reading captions or interacting with exhibits (personally got a kick from the red curtain reveal!). There was everything laid out in decades which meant it was easy to find info on historical and cultural events. The 70s and 80s brought me back to my Irish childhood.

I enjoyed seeing bits about Collins and Dev first, a nice photo exhibit and then up to the 60s-80s was my personal fav. I found it fun seeing things from my childhood and having recollections of political figures and cultural events from the 80s and 90s, which are still etched in my memory. The millennium milk bottles, phone cards, remembering the Oscar success of My Left Foot etc.

Staff were wonderful - helpful and friendly but not intrusive. And quirky! The certificate and the magnets and pencil were a lovely touch. And the music at the desk.

I found it very enjoyable, if not for the heat, but noone could fix that for us.
The description as ""little"" is apt for the size of the rooms, but not for the collection. It was well worth the visit, 10e is a great price, and we both decided another day to come do the Treasure Hunt in the park, maybe even return.

Final words, anyone who knows even a little about Ireland and Dublin will be interested in this museum, the U2 exhibition was especially vital to visit if one has even a passing interest in the band.

Spotting Bosco, standing beside Bono, seeing young Bertie, a huge Podge and Rodge and so on was all great craic too! And seeing how young U2 once were....like myself, back several decades ago. Little Museum of Dublin, a great find!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,Myself and my girlfriend went on the walking tour of St Stephens Green from the Little Muesem of Dublin. Our tour guide was Luke who was a lovely chap who brought us around the Green and showed us and explained the history of the area to us. He was fantastic and really enjoyed listening to the stories. When the tour was finished we went into the museum which as a Dubliner Myself I found enthralling and learned(or relearned) about my own city. Whether you are a tourist or a local I cannot recommend going highly enough. The staff were friendly and a big thumbs up from us 👍👍,Jul 2021
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,In half hour we learnt so much about the history of Dublin. The museum tour is very well curated and it's a fun way to experience Dublin and its legacy. This is a great way to get to know the city for new comers.,Jul 2021

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Fabulous activity. A really enjoyable afternoon on a very rainy day in Dublin (first one in a long time might I add - to quell that myth of rainy Ireland!!). The option was given for the outdoor treasure hunt in Stephens Green also which is great to have. The museum ticked a very important box for me in that it was particularly suited to younger teenagers and kept my 14 year old very engaged and excited to get all the answers while scouring each room for the information she needed to fill in the questions given to us at the start of the tour. Not many places that tick this box!! It's self guided but there are friendly and helpful guides along the way that come and chat to you about different aspects of the room you are in. We spent 2 hours in a beautiful Georgian house on the green. No better place to hang out of an afternoon.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"My husband and I had been meaning to visit for ages after hearing how great the museum is so it was top of our list when we visited the city centre for the first time in a year.

Self guided while in current restriction level but was still great to wander just ourselves at our own pace through this fabulous building which overlooks stephens green.

Every room filled with memorabilia - sometimes crazy random, sometimes sobering and always nostalgic pieces from irish history and culture.. Never a dull moment in this wonderfully eclectic museum.

Will be back for another visit when guided touring resumes. Advise locals to book now before the crowds return as it was nice having almost whole museum to ourselves.

Non national tourists will for sure love this museum too but I highly recommend it in particular for Dubliners themselves!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"As in the name, the museum is small. If your schedule is tight, I would skip visiting it. Don’t get me wrong; a guide tells interesting stories, but nothing you can’t read on the Internet. 2/3 of exhibits are posters hanging on the walls, which is quite disappointing, but they create a classic vibe of old Dublin. There is a great section dedicated to the U2 band (something for the fans). I found this museum charming, fun, and informative, but it is not an extraordinary tourist attraction that you must see in Dublin.",Feb 2020

We spent about 40 minutes on the tour then spent an hour and a half exploring the rest of the museum and trying to complete an entertaining quiz on the info booklet they give you at the start.

Ann even came afterward to tell us sorry if she seemed nervous because it was her first-ever tour. We couldn't even tell!! She did a truly wonderful job and we were amazed that it was her first time.

Definitely recommend anyone coming to Dublin to check this little gem out :')

The 45-minute tour offers both an excellent introduction to Dublin history for visitors and a witty trip down memory lane for locals. One of the tour's chief merits is the way you end up looking more closely at features of the urban landscape, such as Fusiliers' Arch and the Gardener's Cottage, that you usually take for granted. Brenda is an exceptionally fluent, charming, and erudite tour guide. And the outdoor setting is a perfect way of combining culture with social distancing.

The museum is based over 3 floors and although little is in the name there is nothing small about it. It’s exceptionally well laid out, really interesting and there is an area for everyone. We did the treasure hunt which kept us busy and the prize at the end trilled our 11yr old.

I loved the walk down memory lane - everything from Bosco the puppet, to a Jackie Kennedy Dress designed by Cybil Connolly.

We were allowed read through a telephone book from the 1950s to locate family members entries from that date. The entire phone numbers for the country were held in a small directory!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"This tour is enjoyable for both tourists and locals. There is a very clear layout that did a good job of covering so much history in a way that was not overwhelming to the visitor. There's stuff that appeals to the history fanatics, as well as a lot of more modern Irish pop culture references that may appeal to younger generations too.

The staff are very friendly and knowledgable. Our guide was museum director, Trevor. He was very engaging and informative. He had a good balance of humour and knowledge throughout. Volunteer Peter, was also around the museum to answer any questions and have a friendly chat.

Being from Dublin, I would recommend this experience to visitors to Ireland but also Irish people too. During a time when people are looking to support local or 'staycation', it's certainly something to add to the list.

The first section of the tour had many characters not often written into our history as lgbt. While the second section highlighted how far Ireland has come in regards to queer rights in recent years. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to further their knowledge on Irish history.,Aug 2020

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,We came to the museum mainly far the Italia 90 exhibition but we pleasantly surprised by all the other excellent exhibitions! Each room is packed full of memorabilia from Irish history. The staff are very friendly and always happy to point out hidden gems as well as answer any questions you may have. The treasure hunt aspect is a nice touch and ensures you pay attention in each of the rooms! Definitely would recommend it 😁,Aug 2020

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"Focused on Dublin moments in time (rather than island of Ireland) this is a nice way to spend an hour or so. Friendly staff who are interested in chatting and suits all ages but not all abilities. Lots of stairs and narrow spaces.

Visiting during ‘social distancing’ tickets were issued online for times starting on the hour. Not great as this meant everyone arriving at the same time trying to see the same exhibits.",Aug 2020
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"What a magical hidden gem in the heart of Dublin city! Having been at another museum earlier our children were NOT looking forward to it but the moment we stepped in to the little museum we knew this was going to be a fun experience! The quiz (and the promise of a prize at the end) had them 100% engaged and eager to find the answers to all the questions. There's something about the atmosphere that's hard to describe but it's palpable none the less. I think it's the beautiful old building and the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's kind of like being in your aunties house with loads of old memorabilia on the walls (minus the musty smell!). If you're a Dub (I'm a true blue!) it's a fabulous trip down memory lane but if you're not you'll love it just as much for the peek in to Irish history down through the years. The U2 room is a must for avid fans like me and the timing of the opening of the Italia '90 room seemed fitting given the passing of Big Jack a few weeks ago. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age. The staff were just lovely and really seemed to enjoy their job which transferred to the customers. I've been asked many times to leave a review on trip advisor but for what ever reason have never bothered. When I was asked today to leave a review, I knew I would! The little museum of Dublin deserves it's place as my first ever review. We loved it and the fact that our(hard to please) tweens did too made it the perfect family experience.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"My boyfriend and I visited the museum on the 1st August 2020 while we were staying in Dublin for the weekend. The museum was lovely and beautifully captured the history of Dublin in this quaint old Georgian House. The Italia 90 exhibition was amazing! It was a lovely tribute to Jack Charlton after his passing a few weeks ago and should definitely become a permanent fixture. The highlight of our tour was the staff. We didn’t book a guided tour or tour guide or anything like that but it felt like we had! The staff were so lovely and constantly coming up to us and telling us stories about the memorabilia on the walls. It made the museum feel more personal and we learned much more information! The treasure hunt quiz was also a great addition. Overall, fantastic little gem in the heart of Dublin just a 2 minute walk from Stephens Green Shopping Centre.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I've heard a lot of people recommend the Little Museum of Dublin and can I just say they were all right! There is no end to the amount of fantastic tidbits and displays they have managed to fit into this small space. The entire team on site were wonderful, very chatty and friendly. They made the experience even better, pointing out things on the walls that you would have missed otherwise.

If you're from Dublin this is a must see for a blast from the past. If you're not from Dublin, it's still a must see for a rich and informative display of Irish and Dublin culture from days gone by and how it compares to now. Make sure you fill out the treasure hunt for a great prize at the end! If you are visiting Dublin make sure to pick up the Little Book of Dublin in the gift shop for some fantastic suggestions of other things to see and do in Dublin.

We got to see the Diceman exhibit on its last day, and I'd say we will go back again to view the Italia 90 exhibit which is just starting.

It is packed full of interesting artefacts and memorabilia and includes special features like a U2 room and a small treasure hunt-type quiz. It can be seen within one hour and could be combined with the Dublinia tour to get a better sense of Dublin’s history.",Jul 2020

Took the writers tour around Stephen's Green, which was fun. Brenda clearly has a passion for the topic, always a plus. The museum itself had some of the old familiar treasures (golden monster munch!!!) as well as some new (Diceman exhibit) and is a great way to kill a couple of hours and, if you're a Dubliner, reminisce on some good, and some not so good, memories of our fair city.",Jul 2020

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I went to the first Queer Dublin tour and absolutely loved it. I'm so happy this tour exists. It covers so many different parts of Irish history and the important roles LGBTQIA people played in it. I think even if you're already really into the topic you'd still walk out of there having learnt loads. Fiona, our guide, was really funny and charming and had us laughing throughout but also spoke with great knowledge and conviction about a lot of the harder parts of Irish Queer history and about that history gets erased. I feel like I know my city all the better for it.",Jul 2020
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I went there randomly on my friends recoomendation and had a very nice time. The staff were excellent and welcoming. I was offered to do a treasure hunt where you have to solve a quiz and you get a prize at the end (which I didn't get to do in the end due to time). The exhibits were great, but if it weren't for Rob (I hope I got his name right! Forgive me!) who spent over an hour of guiding only me through all the things there the experience wouldn't have been as awesome. Learned lots of Irish history from him and compared some of Croatia's to theirs.

Overall I recommend a visit as there's a lot of Dublin (and Irish) history in there to learn and talk about.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I heard about this museum through two Dubliner friends, and being straight out of Sligo myself, I thought if they enjoyed it I probably would aswell. Through my work running educational programmes for inner city schools, I had been speaking to Robbie who was generous enough to send out some tickets for kids in the schools. My Londoner cousin (does a very good Irish accent to be fair) was over so I decided to bring him along. Ciaran was our tour guide (from Florida, USA, not Florida, Ireland, as one of the group asked) and arrived into the room singing, which is always a good sign. He took us on a lovely little whistlestop tour of the best bits of Irish history, giving the group loads of in-jokes and things to say in the pub to impress Irish people for the rest of their stay. As an Irish person, I thoroughly enjoyed this tour (and not just because I knew all the answers to Ciaran's questions). A great experience for all - not just tourists!!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"Quirky and folky in a charming way. The museum isn’t one of Dublin’s biggest but it compensates by being packed full to the rafters of historical artefacts. I found out tour guide Brenda really enthusiastic and she clearly knew her stuff.
For those who want a short but informative introduction to Dublin’s history you could do much worse than pay this museum a visit.

However I can’t bring myself to give 5 stars for two main reasons. Firstly the room dedicated to U2 wasn’t that impressive but I don’t like U2 so maybe I’m biased. Secondly the entrance fee is €10 which is very step even by Dublin prices.

All in all though it’s worth popping into if you’re visiting.

They enjoyed the visit which was fun and a different way of acquiring some Irish history.Would have liked longer time to browse the main display rooms. The playing of the JFK speech was drowned by the sounding of the air raid siren by the following group.They also very much admired the plaster work of the building throughout. Rob our guide was very pleasant and informative. We also visited the U2, Dice Man and Irish Times exhibitions. I realised that U2 are aging with myself when the teenagers particularly our French visitor were not familiar with them. They did enjoy the colour of the display. The Dice Man and Irish Times exhibitions are a social history in themselves. Likewise the photographs on the stair walls.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,1.0,"I was disappointed, embarrassed and annoyed by my tour of the Little Museum of Dublin. The director saw fit to denigrate Irish people at every opportunity, in highly inaccurate references. For example!e, he attributed our legal system to the English when in reality they supplanted a superior legal system that had been in place for centuries before their invasion (see Corpus Iuris Hibernici with texts dating from the 8th century). Thanking colonizers for building a few houses is akin to thanking your mugger for knocking out your loose tooth. If the wealth of this island had not been taken to develop English estates, we would not have inherited a country that was 100s of years behind our European peers in 1922. We could even have had the much dreamt of Dublin underground. Most importantly we would not have had the decades of war and troubles that have torn this country apart. We have an extremely successful post colonial country because of the capabilities of Irish people, and the time for Anglo-centric sneering at the Irish has passed.

The Little Museum is my favorite kind of museum: one that is packed with all sorts of miscellanea donated by locals. Everything from a Sybil Connolly dress to a poster of Che Guevera (there IS a connection) to an old air raid siren, all assembled together into a patchwork whole that is strung together by the equally delightful, enthusiastic guides (ours, June, was both great craic and a VERY snappy dresser). There are a few semipermanent exhibit rooms upstairs with I gather some rotating content as well, celebrating Dublin's unique residents and institutions. And also U2. Fine cafe downstairs as well.

When we had questions the team went out of their way to try to find answers if they didn't know themselves.

There is so much in a small space that it would be easy to go back a second or third time to try to absorb more.

He was very punny but knowledgeable. To top it off, the day I went was also the opening of the Dice Man exhibit and some of his family members had traveled from Scotland to be there and were in our tour. It was such a nice way to be inside one of the Georgian Houses and a great quick but fun history lesson. I’ll admit prior to going, I knew very little about Irish history aside from British Rule and Potato Famines. There is also a great restaurant in the basement, Hatch & Sons which I also recommend. They do mostly breakfast and lunch with a special Friday dinner.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"When we arrived, a tour had just started but we could join them straight away and it turned out to be a very nice and interesting experience. The museum itself is not big but filled with many artefacts and material that were brought to life by our smartly-dressed guide Rob who held a very inspirational talk about two rooms full of material on Dublin's history of the last couple of centuries.. He explained a lot about the photos, adverticements, newspaper clippings and other material and added some anecdotes. He also answered quite a few questions by other guests whom he constantly involved in the story by asking for personal experiences concerning the events depicted. This made the tour lively and interesting.
Afterwards we could look around in the rest of the museum. All in all a good way of spending the last couple of hours before flying back home.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"The exhibition is very interesting on the history of ordinary Dubliners, otherwise less know compared to ""History"".
Our guide was just so passionate and entertaining.
What I found an incredibly clever idea was to hand out a little crossword puzzle to children about things they would learn during the visit. It proved the perfect trick to keep them focused, inquisitive and busy. To get a little price at the end.",Feb 2020

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Last Saturday morning I joined the 10.00am tour at the museum conducted by Joan, and immediately I knew 'this was going to be good'. She entered the room and was an immediate presence, asking where everyone was from, and particularly involved the children there. She engaged the group immediately, pointing out photos and images,giving background to the individuals, from Joyce to DeValera and Michael Collins. Her style of delivery was very effective in retaining our interest, by comparison with tour guides elsewhere, whom you often feel are just going through the motions. Entertainment and education...what more could you ask for. Well done Joan !

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"We eventually visited this little museum on St Stephens Green.
Loads of Dublin memorabilia all around and the guided tour was good. Eamon our guide is well informed on Dublin matters and his delivery is engaging and witty.
The Irish Times room is worthwhile especially if you are an IT reader but unless one is a U2 fan (which thankfully I am not) that room could be put to better use!!",Feb 2020
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Most of us tend to think of a museum as being the resting place for antiquities and memorabilia which requires a certain reverence and hushed observance as one tries to figure out exactly what one is looking at. Nothing of the sort in the Little Museum on Saint Stephens Green where the irrepressible, witty and extremely knowledgeable Robbie, who was our in-house guide, brought the contents of this old Dublin Georgian house to life. From recounting why the lads involved in the 1916 rising, and based in the Saint Stephens Green park opposite the museum, took a break each day from the fighting (the ducks!) to recounting stories about U2 and Bono in the early days, replete with irreverent comments and jokes, the tour is an absolutely engaging and entertaining odyssey from start to finish. To get a unique insight into the people, places and things that have made Dublin the great city it is today, don’t miss a visit to the Little Museum.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Visited here yesterday , had a voucher for 20% off so for 8 euro each I wasn’t holding out much hope ! But boy was I wrong! We had 20mins before the tour started and was able to explore the first floor filled with beautiful drawings of old Dublin. The tour began promptly with the very knowledgable Robbie! The tour started at the very beginning of Celtic times and brought us right upto recent times. Robbie was funny, dramatic and loved word play! So do we! The tour felt relatable and easy to follow.
After the tour finished we went upstairs to explore the other rooms which included the U2 room. We spent probably around an hour there and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin !

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Small but very informative! We had to wait a bit for our tour, simply because we arrived at an inopportune time and the next two tours were fully booked (so we waited an hour). However, there are exhibits open in the museum to explore independently of the tour while you (such as an exhibit on U2) which are great. There is also a cafe downstairs, and more nearby, as well as Stephen's Green across the street if the weather is nice enough for you to pop over. The tour itself was well worth the wait! Our guide, Eamon, truly has the gift of Irish story-telling. With just a two room tour, we got a deeper understanding of Irish history and culture that set the tone perfectly for the rest of our trip and gave us a good foundation of information. Fun, engaging, interesting for visitors of all ages, and really representative of not only Irish history, but also of the Irish spirit!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"Located centrally off of Saint Stephen's Green, the Little Museum of Dublin is a fun experience. The guided visit lasts 29 minutes. Enough to pack cursory knowledge of the city. For U2 fans, there is a room dedicated to the band.

Trevor, the museum director, happened to be our guide on the day. He was charming and witty (but then again so are all Irish). He delved into some of the history of how complicated the history between Ireland and the UK has been over the centuries without berating one side or the other and he was hopeful for a better relationship going forward post Brexit.

Also, you get a discount at the cafe downstairs with your admission. Check out the whole thing. You won't be disappointed.

It is a nice short trip to do and even if you are only in Dublin for a few days, I would highly recommend going here as it only takes up a maximum of a couple of hours of your day. The staff here are all very welcoming and helpful. Our tour guide Robbie was absolutely brilliant. His execution of the information was fantastic, and I was hooked onto every word due to his clarity and comedic values.

The guided tour covered two rooms with an excellent guide and then had a free other rooms you could explore on your own.

Set in a three storey townhouse opposite St Stephen's Green, the different rooms contain artefacts (photos, paintings, memorabilia) donated by the people of Dublin, which tell the story of the city that you won't find in the guidebooks.
Tour guide Brenda is an absolute hoot! If she hasn't just stepped off the stage of the Abbey Theatre, she has a theatrical career awaiting her. Everyone was really friendly and it's the first time I've ever been asked about my experience by the museum's director himself.

There’s so much to see I spend another hour and a half after the tour finished wandering and reading. Very well done and a more comfortable museum than many that are of a more formal nature. All staff were chatty and so friendly.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I've been to the museum a couple of times before but had never done the ""Green Mile Walking Tour"" and would definitely recommend it if your visiting the museum. It's a walking tour of St. Stephens Green which is right across the road from the museum.

We started with a tour of the museum with Andrew as our guide and he was great! Funnily enough we had done this tour only a couple of weeks before and also had Andrew as our guide then. After the tour of the museum was complete (approx 30 minutes) we were introduced to Donal Fallon our guide for the Green Mile Walking Tour.

Donal was one of the reasons we wanted to do this tour, I have a number of his books and subscribe to his podcast, Three Castles Burning. He didn't disappoint anyway and was full of interesting information and anecdotes on a range of subjects from the minute we started the tour.

The walking tour around the Green lasted roughly 1 hour and then we headed back over to take a look at the top floor of the museum.

I would definitely recommend a trip to the museum and try to do it early on a Saturday or Sunday so you can get the Green Mile Walking Tour in too.

Thanks Donal and Andrew!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"I highly recommend this museum to anyone who has a few hours to spare in Dublin. The ticket includes an hour-long guided tour of the second floor, and you can explore the other two floors at your own pace. Our guide was Ronan, and he was awesome. The way he explained the recent history of Ireland was both informative and humorous. Also the self-led parts are really interesting — for a “little” museum, there’s a lot of cool information here. Well worth the admission price, and again, great job Ronan!",Jan 2020
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"We did a midday tour,and as an older and almost local couple we found the whole place a delight. Our guide was great, bright, cheerful, and well able to get the story across. The Museum itself is set in some beautiful atmospheric rooms, an old house overlooking busy park and street, though small in size packed with items that tell a simple story of life in the city. Having been around ourselves for many of the incidents depicted and discussed it was particularly nice. Simple good- humored quirky just like the city. All staff cheerful and helpful ( good to see ).",Feb 2020

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"We visited the little museum of Dublin on our first day in the city and did the guided tour with Mark. Mark was a great tour guide - he was funny, very knowledgable and really engaging. We left feeling like we knew so much more about the history of Dublin than we expected to. After the tour we had a look through the self guided areas of the museum and bumped into another guide Gerry. Again, Gerry was lovely and gave us some more info on the Irish times (one of the exhibition rooms) before sharing some of his local knowledge on other places to visit in the city. Very personable and friendly staff - would highly recommend!

With the DoDublin hop-on-hop-off bus it was free, just ask the bus driver for a ticket, but I would have paid the full price for the tour anyway.
Rob, the tour guide, was knowledgeable and could do a smashing British accent.

Great images all around illustrating the told stories. Abie our guide was so delightful, absolutely great in telling history and making it actually enjoyable.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Don't expect a classic museum- this is more of a collection of unique and storytelling items, mostly donated by local Dubliners, telling the story of a city. A few items have placards and explanations but the overall sense you get is more like an antique store. Definitely get the guided tour, so much fun and so worth the time! I loved it in here, it was very quirky and a fun stop. Great location too, right off St Stephen's Green close to Grafton Street.",Jan 2020
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"We were on a DoDublin hop on hop off tour of the city.
The bus stops right outside of here and the driver gives you a ticket for free entrance (inclusive in your DoDublin bus pass).
We timed it just right to join the start of a tour, with June.
She assured us that her boss (a wonderful fella apparently) reads every review. June is a most thorough and knowledgeable guide. It was a pleasure to be on her tour (my bribe is in the post, June, isn't it?).
She included all on the tour in her chats and made it fun too.
Next time we get to Dublin, we will, most definitely, visit here again and hope to see June, again too. Keep up the good work.

The tour was conducted by Eamon and he was amazing: so funny and we learnt so much in such a wonderful setting.

As the saying goes: Size doesn't matter! And it sure didn't for The Little Museum of Dublin. Well worth a visit for those looking for a well-rounded and summarised history of Dublin.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Following our visit to The Little Museum of Dublin, the high expectations that we already had from this attraction due to its themes and reviews, were greatly surpassed. We were granted with a half an hour guided tour at the beginning, which was absolutely essential for the museum’s experience, given the content intensive rooms. Happily, we were fortunate enough to have this such amazing guide, Joan. Charismatic and straightforward, Joan quickly showed a great empathy towards the entire the group. Along the visit she demonstrated a perfect balance between having a serious and intense speech every time a more dramatic episode in Dublin’s history asked it, and an ironic and hilarious tone whenever some curiosities or context related jokes arose. Altogether, Joan was able to manage a highly enjoyable and coherent visit to the museum, conveying to the visitor an image of Dubliners as rebel spirited and heritage proud persons, who despite several challenges across times, always seem to have an hilarious way to live their lives and look back at their history.
In the name of the group we would like to thank Joan and all the attentive staff, while recommending to all future visitors of Dublin, this little relic of a museum that this vibrant city has to offer.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,3.0,"A pretty short guided tour (approx. 30 minutes) through a few rooms plastered with posters from different periods in Dublin history, so nothing special really, you could get more info from an average printed guide. I liked the fact that the museum is located in an 18th-century Georgian town house, representative of the architecture from that rich period in Dublin's history, so it was cool to see inside. Our guide Robbie was of the charts bonkers, he takes his performance (and yes, it's an Oscar worthy performance!) quite serious and he just gives it his all. For me, this was an OK experience, but don't be disappointed if you don't make it while you're in Dublin, there are far better tours and exhibitions.

Our Guide was Luke. He guides us through the main three rooms and it was Great. He took us realy back in time. Not only a high knowledge was what we liked , his Humor, the ability to step in other historical or famous people of the certain aera made him great. It seems that it is not only a job for him, he loves what he does and make you able to feel that love, ist love for Irland and exspescaly for Dublin!! So please Go join it. For me as a german, beeing out of school for nearly 30 years and no Need to Talk english everyday, it was some times hard to get every joke or every Point, but Even that made no problem enjoing that Tour.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"This was a very different take on a museum – but we loved it. The 30 minute tour takes place in 2 rooms on the 1st floor of a traditional Dublin Georgian House.
Inside the rooms, on the walls, fireplace and coffee tables are ‘small’ artefacts which represent Dublin through the decades. Starting at around the turn of the 20th century, the tour guide tells Dublins history through the use of small images, books, furniture pieces etc which have all be collected or donated to the Museum.

We loved the concept and would certainly recommend this experience.

After the 30 minute tour, you can also visit 2 more rooms on the top floor. When we visited these were dedicated to the history of U2 and the life of one of Dublin’s mayors Alfred Byrne ‘the shaking hands man’.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,3.0,"As a Dubliner home for Christmas, I have to say that I did enjoy going around the museum and seeing a lot of objects that brought memories of both my childhood and youth in Dublin. I puzzle over how a non Dubliner can relate to it, because it's so specific. The guide on the tour really makes the difference, I took it and found the guide to be too general for the foreign tourists. My husband was on the tour a second time and said the guide was excellent and really enriched the experience. So it's the luck of the draw. On the very top is an exhibition on U2 which was interesting. It's a pity that one cannot return to the bottom floor exhibition sections as this was the most interesting from my point of view.

The museum afterward is just as worth a look as the Gaol itself with lots of cool artifacts and human stories from Ireland's independence movement. You learn so much about Irish history and the struggle for Home Rule that a mere book couldn't convey.

The Gaol staff was pleasant and helpful; however, the visit was absolutely made by our guide Adam. He was so passionate and knowledgeable and answered all of our questions with enthusiasm.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Very Informative and soul touching experience! You will see and feel what the Irish independence patriots (their so called Easter Uprising) have to go thru to finally get their independence.

This is a very very popular attraction so please book the moment the website opens for booking for your date. And that could be months in the future. I have been watching it and it does sell out especially if you try to book just a week or two before. You have been warned!😉

There is a 15 minute arrival time before your scheduled time but if you arrive earlier, you can visit the museum first ( you normally end your Gaol tour in the museum) to save some time. So arriving early is not really a waste of time waiting. It also makes it easy to time your transport. I used the Green Dublin Bus tour to get there.

Please note that I asked if I could be moved into the next tour but they were strict. Stick to your scheduled time.

Tour (about 1 hour excluding self guided museum tour) was well done. You could really get the history just from the narrative of the tour guide. I read so I knew what it was all about. My wife doesn't and at the end of the tour she had a great appreciation of this period of Irish history.

Don't fail to see Countess Markowicz. The first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament, and was elected Minister for Labour in the First Dáil, becoming the first female cabinet minister in Europe.

Very much worth your entrance fee. It is rated #1 of the attractions in Dublin by TA and I wholeheartedly agree.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Brilliant way to end your Easter Rising tour, as Kilmainham Gaol is the place where Conolly and others were executed. Museum/Jail is located in center city north-west side, the best way of getting there from city centre is by using a tram - red luas line, direction from Abbey street / Jervis towards Tallaght. Tour lasts between 45 mins and 1 hour and it's telling sad, brave and heartbreaking story in regards to Easter Rising. I will highly recommend to book tickets online, because attraction is very popular and all the times fully booked, so you won't be dissapointed if you just walk in and they refuse you, because all the tours for a day are being sold out.

the tour started on time and was rich of details and anecdotes, but somewhat lacking in empathy and human connection, more so when telling about gruesome and sad events such as the ones that took place in kilmainham...
maybe it’s just the vibe of the place compared to the “tourist attraction” pretences that created some sort of dystopic effect.
worth experiencing anyway.

We ended up speaking to him outside for almost half an hour after the tour was over and given the chance could quite easily have listened all day. There were parts of the tour itself that I found myself quite emotional. From those who were executed to the thought of very young children (5yr old) having been imprisoned like adults just because they stole to eat horrifies me still... if walls could speak then the history of abuse of the most vulnerable groups during the famine (and later) should serve to remind us in this day and age to be more caring and understanding of the refugees fleeing to our shores...

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Excellent trip here today. Dave was an awesome guide. The magnitude of the history of the gaol was very evident and we left with lots to think about. Covid precautions were thorough but not intrusive to the experience. We did not get to visit the chapel but we were not expecting full access due to restrictions.

Would highly recommend. Wish we had have visited here sooner. The bonus side of a staycation is getting to learn more about “home”",Aug 2020
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,4.0,"Over the years I have visited killmainham gaol around 12 times. No one visit took the same route around the large old gaol. Depending on your guides educational background the focus may even be slightly different. But the overall theme of the tour remains the same. The huge role the goal played in dublin's dark history from the famine to the civil war.

Myself and some friends visited the gaol today. Our guide was named Adam and he struck me as exceptionally knowledgeable in the history of the goal and of the past prisoners. He was able to answer all questions confidently. Another thing I liked about Adam was he gave us the history in a manner that kept the children on the tour interested.

This tour is a must do for people visiting Dublin and even Dubliners themselves.

Prior to entering the jail there is a museum with a lot of great info about the revolution, the jail and the results. Take your time here. The artifacts are wonderful and the history is even better.

The jail is remarkably well maintained. The tour guide was fantastic as were his narration of the revolution and history.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Kilmainham Gaol is a must when visiting Ireland. I lived in Ireland for four months in 2019. I was very intrigued by Irish history and the fight for Irish independence. This eery prison played a crucial role in the history of the struggle for Irish Independence. Many of the leaders of the Easter Uprising were imprisoned and tragically killed for rebelling against the British. You really get a lot of insight into what it was like to be imprisoned here. Our guide was fabulous and went above and beyond by suggesting further reading I could do on Irish Independence. The gift shop has many books on this subject if you're interested.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"I really enjoyed the visit to the museum a lot and the guided tour was worth every cent! I bought my ticket in advance and when I was in the booking process (about 1 week before my visit) there were free spaces, but they were already quite busy and not all the tours were available. Therefore, if you have a tight schedule, make sure to book well in advance so you get your preferred time slot. I arrived a little early at the museum and had to wait for my tour. You are only allowed access at your allocated time. But the staff was really friendly and they let me into the museum (originally at the end of the tour) as it was raining. So I made use of the waiting time and could already inform myself about the prison before the tour. Therefore again a big thank you to the team, as it was raining that day and waiting inside was a lot better than outside. The tour itself started perfectly on time, so make sure you are not late in order to not miss your tour. It was very well narrated and our guide had many interesting information and also fun facts to share with us. I absolutely enjoyed it and would recommend visiting Kilmainham Gaol to anyone who is visiting Dublin!

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,4.0,"You have to book in advance and damn it worth the detour - as the prison is a bit far from the city center (cab is advised). You will need good shoes and not have too much back problems cuz the prison ground is quite hard. And it’s cold, so cold... Upon arrival, visitors are asked to wait for the next tour in a reconstruction of the former trial room attached to the prison. Visitors are then lead to an outside court to be given instructions; we were advised not to wander too far from the group as the prison was designed a bit like a maze and many parts are closed off by automatic locked doors. Our tour guide was a great storyteller and even got me to shed a tear... if must be said that the history of the prison, the atrocities that were conducted there by the british are just chilling and heartbreaking to hear. The guide was visibly very proud of his irish heritage. There is also a museum section to wander on your own at the end.

Now, the tour: mine was led by a wonderful guide who knew a TON about the building. From those who were imprisoned here, to the different styles of each part of the prison, to different stories about the Easter Rising leaders, she had a ton of info to keep everyone's interest.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,A truely haunting and inspiring visit. My guide was so enthused but the history of the place would be enough anyway!

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"A museum that lives and breaths the history of the City and Nation. I am well acquainted with 1916 and previous Irish History but to see where, Pierce and the other signatories to the Declaration of Independence were held and then executed was tear jerking. The guide whose name escapes me, was the best guide I have had the pleasure to enjoy world wide. Having been to Phoenix Park, The Guinness Brewery, Jameson’s and Bushmills, I really believe Kilmainham Gaol is the only “Must See”. The others are nice to see but Kilmainham is a reminder to all of injustice and in a way similar to Robin Island.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,4.0,"This place is really interesting, and a must visit for anyone coming to Dublin/Ireland for the first time. The tour was full of facts and information about the social and political history of the country, and it was compelling as you can almost feel the lives of the people who would have spent time at the Gaol in its heyday.
I would have liked a little more time to be able to take some pictures as we were going round, but with a big group we were rushed along a little. This didn't spoil our visit, however, just something I thought of after we left as I was reflecting on how it had touched me.

As I wrote in the caption...book this in advance! I didn’t and was lucky to get tickets. The history of this republic is very interesting and this jail housed those that fought for the country. The jail itself is very eerie and you will hear a lot of stories about the prisoners and why they were sent to the prison to begin with.

The tour takes about an hour and then you are free to visit the museum to read more facts as well as see artifacts.

Need to book far in advance though! Tickets are non-transferable too, need to have a refund and book again but subjected to availability.",Feb 2020
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,4.0,"A very eerie experience to say the least - the jail is intact and shows the cells and corridors in a well preserved manner. Interesting to hear about the 1916 rebellion, but wish the information was delivered in a more interesting manner.

Our tour guide was a little disapointing - no personality, no interpersonal skills, and was happy to just say what was needed to say, and continue with the next part of the tour.

However, a must see in Dublin.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,Visiting is a sobering but important experience. Whether you know a little or a lot of Irish History you will leave with appreciation for the people who sacrificed all for what they believed in or were just trying to survive. My family of 4 (2 in their teens) all feel this museum was a must do. Make sure to reserve tickets in advance.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,2.0,"Having been recommended the tour by loads of people previously I'd excitedly tried to book our tickets in advance but the dates we were in Dublin were showing as sold out. When I emailed to enquire about the availability as there was a notice saying there was work being done on the site around those dates, I had a copied and pasted response from the website. I then replied to ask a more specific question which was just completely ignored. That said, about a week before we were due to arrive, tickets strangely became available for the date we wanted but this was only found through checking the site every morning, NOT through any kind of helpful communication.

When we arrived for our tour, which admittedly we were running 5 minutes late for, we were asked if we wanted to go for the slightly later tour instead which worked perfectly as we had a nice coffee and cake in the cafe while we waited. Our tour guide had a lot of information but unfortunately she recited it in a robotic and clearly scripted way that left everyone on the tour bored and unimpressed.

Having been looking forward to this tour and been recommended it, I was left hugely disappointed and to be honest, no more educated on the integral part of Irish history that the museum holds. For a nation known for their passionate ability to tell a story, I can't help but feel our guide for the day really let the whole experience down.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,The tour was interesting with enthusiastic guide Adam who was full of information on the Jail's long history. Well worth the visit. A slight if understandable leaning towards the Natioalist cause at the Easter Rising at a time when men from Ireland and Britain were fighting WW1 together was an undercurrent but Adam did mention that the Rising was not popular in Ireland at the time and only became so later and as a result of the British Authorities handling of the situation.,Feb 2020
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"This is one of the best tour & museums I’ve experienced in a long time. The tour guide Adam was superb, his passion was infectious, the subject matter is a bit roar & quite political in different ways, however spell binding to hear about & very sad. The duration is 1 hour on a guided tour only, there are plenty of chances to reflect on what your hearing & take photos for the memories.

The only way to get tickets is on line it’s 8 euros per person & it should be more & I would have definitely paid it, however the museum wants people to hear the history of the Gaol. ( It gets very busy from March onwards, so book very advanced not to be disappointed )

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"The tour of Kilmainham Gaol is a poignant trip through the delicate history surrounding the foundation of the state and what lead to it.

The guide, Ben, was excellent. Weaving good humour through the often sad and gloomy stories housed within the cold limestone walls, he did an excellent job of illustrating the stories behind the cells and their occupants and life within the Gaol. He also answered questions and was good craic too. A great tour guide.

The final part, which takes place in a movingly silent yard where the 14 executed for their part in the 1916 uprising will stay with you. A tricolour flies quietly in the breeze presiding over the wounds of the past and the crosses erected to remember where those executed fell.

This is a must visit attraction in Dublin for anyone with an interest in history. Entry is €9 and a bargain for what you get. I couldn't recommend it more.

1. It was the first prison set up in the format of cells facing each other. This is how all prisons made in the past ~100 years have since been made due to improvements in rehab and re-socialization of inmates
2. Lots of irish history from the potato famine (ppl committed crimes so they’d goto Kilmainham and get free meals) to independence (are freedom fighters outlaws or heroes?)

We started in the newer wing that was built, then moved to the original west wing. The different between the two wings was incredible. Sadly, this gaol closed in 1928, but in the 1960’s, a restoration team (many were ex prisoners who spent time in this very gaol) decided to bring the gaol back to what it used to be. Very glad they did. For people of today, it is a good learning experience to see just how prisoners lived and were treated back in the day. This tour lasted around 45 minutes

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"I have already confessed a lack of knowledge of Irish history & most of what I knew was limited to that was given to me at school so the trip to the Goal was an eyeopener to say the least.
I was familiar with the harshness of the justice system of the past but I couldn't help but me moved by the guides description of the prisoners especially those executed there.
It's hard to fathom the logic or reasoning behind some of the decisions.
What equally struck me was the comment that those incarcerated during the famine where actually 'lucky' as at least they were fed! This concept has some resonance today with my voluntary work with the homeless for whom a spell in a prison can bring some respite to constant fear, risk of attack, cold & hunger.
Truly a thought provoking visit.
It is simple enough to get there by tram & short walk. There is a modest entrance fee & booking is recommended.When went the booking system was down so we turned up on spec & were lucky to be able to buy tickets for later in the day. We took the opportunity to look around the museum first & have a cup of tea in the cafe before the 30 minute guided tour within the inner sections of the prison.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,4.0,"This was one of the places that i wanted to visit during my short 3 day stay in Dublin, an i wasn't disappointed.
Located to the west of the city on Inchicore Road, Kilmainham Gaol is a definite must to go an visit.
I went here on a cold, rainy, dark all round miserable day in January after walking the distance from Parnell Square to here, so was happy when i finally arrived. I got here at around 11.48am, an luckily enough i was able to get on the next tour which started at 12.15pm, the tour lasts for 30 minutes.
I was fortunate as i am guessing that come the warmer months this Gaol would be very busy with tourists, so you might need to book rather than just turn up.
I was expecting to pay 8 Euro, but the admission was only 3 Euro due to current renovations on the West wing of the jail, which we were not able to see due to this.
As i had some time to kill, i was advised to go an look in the museum, which i did, an even that was interesting with old letters, newspapers from years gone by, old items from prisoners etc. Set across 3 floors it is very easy to spend a fair bit of time in this museum if this kind of thing is of interest to you.
The tour started in the courtroom, with a nice tour guide by the name of Dave, who knew his stuff and was very knowledgeable on the prisons past.
Along with the history of the prison, he told us the history of some of the prisoners, including those who were housed there during the very infamous Easter Uprising which took place in April 1916. Along with the prison cells, which you can go into, you also spend some time in the courtyard where, said members of the Easter Uprising were shot dead by a firing squad for what took place in April 1916.
It is an interesting insight into the history of what happened in Dublin at that time, an certainly makes you think.
Along with all this, the architecture of this building is stunning bearing in mind it was built in 1796.
When i go back to Dublin, i will go back here, hopefully by that time the West wing will be open. It was an absolute bargain for only 3 Euro, an to be honest, i would of easily have been happy paying 8 Euro.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"We only had a part tour as some is undergoing renovations, but what we did see was so interesting! Widely regarded as one of the most popular attractions in the city, we were repeatedly warned it pays to get to the Gaol early to avoid disappointment. Being winter, we didn't have too much trouble but I imagine in summer it gets very busy.

Hear about the tales of some of the more famous prisoners as well as some history of the prison. There is a small museum too as well as a cafe. Brilliant to see. For the very cheap entry fee I'd definitely recommend taking an early trip to see Kilmainham.

We would recommend this to anyone.",Jan 2020
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"This, for me, was one of the highlights of learning about Dublin (and Irish) history. This tour is really immersive, they take you through the cold stone corridors and cells, and tell you heartbreaking and inspirational stories about the men, women and children who were held there. Be prepared to walk through narrow corridors, climb stone steps, see some grisly stuff, but also to walk away with a bit of hope in your heart. I would recommend this tour to anyone over the age of 7 (that's just my opinion). Also, this is a really hard tour to book, since it sells out 3 to 4 weeks in advance, your best bet is to buy online tickets well in advance. Get there like 45 minutes early (or leave yourself some time after the tour) to check out their museum, you won't be sorry.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"This museum experience was launched in 2016 as part of the centenary of the Easter Rising. The gaol has been sensitively prepared for visitors without having the patina renovated out of existence. The tour, led by Erin, was extremely well-organised and slick and our guide was informative and knowledgeable. Having read about the rebels for over 25 years, it was a thrill to be able to see their names above the very cells where they were incarcerated. The site of their deaths by firing squad was highly moving. This was our number one experience as part of a three day trip to Dublin and I would highly recommend it.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"We visited on Thursday 12th December for an afternoon tour. We were staying in a hotel in central Dublin, but caught a bus very easily to and from the prison which is approx. 20 minutes from the city centre.

Our guide, Dave, was fantastic- a very clear and confident speaker, very well informed, and the emphasis he placed on stories of inmates who are not noted in history books in the same way as those imprisoned during the 1916 rebellions was extremely touching and emotive.

We learnt a lot about Ireland’s history and identity which was extremely helpful as a backdrop to the rest of our excursions during our visit to Dublin (e.g. St Stephen’s Park, Croke Park, EPIC Immigration Museum). The tour and museum are also arranged in a manner that respects the history of the site and the sinister events that have taken place there.

Moving around the wings of the prison to see both the old and modern wings provided a real insight into the ways that prisons have changed but also the dire environments of those imprisoned in the early years of the prisons creation.

We would definitely recommend a visit to Kilmainham, followed by a drink at the pub across the road afterwards to reflect on everything you will have absorbed during the experience.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Jail is in commercial area of Dublin and adjacent to residential areas. Upon entry to jail, we visited the courthouse portion and a holding cell.
We took a tour of this historical prison. Built in 1796 and used as a prison until 1924, is now a museum. Many Irish revolutionaries, including the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising, were imprisoned and executed here by the British. Take your time to not only take the tour (you must do this, can’t visit on your own – Denise was an excellent tour guide and gave time for questions), also take the time in the museum to see the exhibits (read the labels to get a broad perspective of not only Irish history, learn how the jail played a major role).

Kilmainham held thousands of ordinary men, women and children. Crimes ranged from petty offenses such as stealing food to murder or rape. Children were sometimes arrested for petty theft such as stealing a loaf of bread, the youngest said to be a seven-year-old child. Adult convicts were held here for long periods waiting to be transported to Australia. Take time to see the details - We saw the small corridors in original part of the prison, original doors showed patterns of leather overlay used to protect doors from moisture. Stairs show wear from many feet.

We learned that there was no segregation of prisoners; men, women and children were incarcerated up to 5 in each cell, with only a single candle for light and heat. Most of their time was spent in the cold and the dark, and each candle had to last for two weeks. An 1809 report noted that male prisoners were supplied with iron bedsteads while females ""lay on straw on the flags in the cells and common halls"". Half a century later there was little improvement. The women's section, located in the west wing, remained overcrowded.

Once the Great Famine (1845-1849) occurred, Kilmainham was overwhelmed with the increase of prisoners as people were chosing to be jailed and have a roof over their heads and meager rations rather than nothing. During the famine, about one million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to fall by ~25%. So many moved to the USA, that signs in larger cities stated 'No Irish Need Apply.""

East Wing was knocked down and rebuilt in a style that perfectly reflected Victorian design ideals. The new structure enabled all of the cells to be observed from the centrally positioned viewing area. Light flooded the space purposely, as it was envisioned that this would inspire the prisoners to direct their gaze toward the heavens and become more spiritual as a result. In direct contrast, several isolation cells were built below the new wing. Dark and unpleasant, this is where the most hardened criminals would spend time in isolation.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,As we were in Dublin we decided to get a day pass tour of the city and it was a great day we stopped off at the jail for a guided tour and what a very interesting story was told to us well worth a visit if your in Dublin,Dec 2019
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,Rebecca served as our tour guide. She was very knowledgeable and energetic. Her storytelling was very captivating and we learned a lot on the tour. She made sure to allow extra time for exploring/photo taking. The upkeep and maintenance on the jail was quite impressive. Definitely worth the trip. Be sure to check out the Gardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham which is right across the street from the gaol.,Dec 2019

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Great 3 storey museum. Fascinating tour of the gaol. Lovely, friendly staff.

Tip - take warm clothes (and maybe an umbrella or coat with a hood) with you if going in the winter, a lot of the tour is either outside or in the very cold cells. Also book in advance as when we went a lot of people hadn't and had to be turned away as it was fully booked.

You will need to contact the gaol in advance for any accessibility requirements.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"I can't decide if this tour or the GPO was the highlight in Dublin, but it was definitely one of the best sites of Dublin. Our guide was excellent. I was initially upset we had a 4:15 tour (only thing available for a Thursday in November two weeks before the tour) but in winter the 4:14 tour was great. It was mostly dark outside and the wind was chilly in winter. I think it gave more of a sense of what the jail was really like most of the time. The only disadvantage to the late time was that the museum that you can see after the tour closed shortly after we got there. I think you can tour the museum before the tour, so I would book late afternoon if you are there in winter and then arrive early to see the museum first- not the ideal order to see things but worth it to get what is likely the best overall experience. In summer I wouldn't book a late tour as I don't think it would have the same effect if it wasn't chilly and dark.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"We visited Kilmainham Goal as part of a whirlwind “hop on hop off” day trip to Dublin. The tour was fantastic and our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the Goal and the history of Ireland. The tour size was a little large but our guide always waited until everyone had gathered before starting to speak.
We did arrive very early for our tour and decided to eat lunch in the cafe, which I would avoid in future. The food was cold and sent back twice to be reheated and didn’t taste that great especially for the price you pay.
However, I would highly recommend the guided tour of the goal to anyone interested as it’s an important part of Ireland’s history and it’s a great way to get a 1 hour crash course on some really interesting facts.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"A very well-led tour, highlighting aspects of Anglo-Irish history not adequately covered in my British education ... some things I’d learnt since, but there were still new things. Very thought-provoking. All the staff were helpful and well-informed, including the gentleman (Dave?) on the reception desk who picked up on my name and introduced me to the story of Kathleen Lynn ... why had I never heard of this amazing woman before?
We booked in advance, and arrived early, so were able to attend an earlier tour rather than hanging around. We were told ours was a “smaller group”: it was still about 20 people which was enough. After the tour we spend another hour or so in the museum.

We had booked a dinner that day and the restaurant was overbooked so we met another couple outside who had the same problem as us. We went for food at a nearby cafe instead then they took us to the jail.

I didn't know what to expect but the museum was brilliant.
My husband is a history buff and himself and Tom had a great chat about the Irish prison system.

I would recommend this to people who like history,

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"This was a great tour, from the friendly welcome from Siobahn, who exchanged our online confirmation, and advised us what to expect, right through to the entire tour led by Eoin, who was an excellent guide, with a font of knowledge, and a very pleasant manner, and an ability to help you understand how the prisoners would have been treated, how they lived, and what they went through whilst in the gaol. The gaol is an important part of Ireland's history, and it is harrowing to hear tales of some of the prisoners that wee kept here, and what they went through. We were there on a cold day, and it did make it seem even more dire and foreboding, and the poor illumination, and the conditions they endured are very stark reminders indeed. It is an extremely enlightening tour through a piece of history, with many facts and anecdotes to bolster its reputation, and Eoin was very capable of helping us understand this. It is well worth the price, but it is best to try and book very early before you go, as most tours are sold out, and its very difficult to get one on the day. I highly recommend this as a snapshot of how conditions once were, and also to help understand Irish history and the part some of the prisoners kept here played in shaping its future.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Over the years, I've taken lots of people to Kilmainham Gaol but I had never taken the guided tour myself. Inspired by the present popularity of the song 'Grace', I decided it was time I did the tour. There were about 30 people in the group mainly consisting of American, Spanish, Italian & German visitors. There were only 3 Irish & I was happy to be one of them. We were very lucky to have had DAVID from the OPW as our guide. Not alone was he very knowledgeable about the Gaol itself since its foundation in 1796 but he punctuated the historical references with humorous anecdotes about some of the inmates down through the years. Not alone were we very lucky to have David as our guide but we as a country should be very proud of the fact that the volunteers who originally decided to preserve the building, also had the vision to make it the historical gem that it is today. I would recommend this tour to anybody visiting this country to make it a 'must do' tour when in Dublin.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Visited the Kilmainham gaol the week ending November 23, 2019. You would think, that, seeing that it was November in Dublin, you could simply jump off your hop off hop on bus and get a tour of the gaol. Well think again! Book online as soon soon as you can, there were only two or three timeslot remaining for the days I was in Dublin and this, inspite of the fact that every day there are scheduled tours every 15 minutes during the day). I am glad I listened to the many individuals that told us to do so, otherwise we would have left Dublin without seeing this wonderful attraction that was on on my list. The tour guides provide an excellent overview of the history of the prison, from the inception. the renovations as well as the famous and not famous people who had spent time there. You can close your eyes and image what it must have been like in the dark, cold cells. Make sure you go when in Dublin.

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"I can't stress this enough - To really understand the some of the history of Ireland and how about they came to their independence, you really should add this trip/tour to your list.

The prison was both a criminal and political prison and many of the men, and women, who shaped Ireland's independence were imprisoned here. Interestingly, children were also kept here, the youngest being 5 for stealing bread during the famine.

The grounds are really well kept and the museum is vastly fascinating. Tour guides are very knowledgeable and even know some of the more obscure historical points.

I recommend giving yourself 2 hours at minimum. The tour is about an hour but adding the museum and gift shop should take about 45-60 minutes.

Our guide was very well prepared, and as well as following his script was also open to being asked questions at any time. In the ""new"" block we were allowed to wander around looking into the cells and at various inscriptions.
At the end of the tour we moved on to the museum with lots of articles and exhibits of Irish history, and finished with a coffee in the cafe.

Our guide, Dave was just brilliant ~ passionate about his subject which he delivered very well. Very informative giving an in-depth insight to prison conditions & the political climate of the time.
Our very interesting visit was rounded off nicely with a visit to the Cafè, good cup of tea , managed to resist the mammoth sized pieces of cake!",Nov 2019
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Visited after recommendation from a family member who really isn't into history but their eyes lite up telling us about experience. I want with a very open mind as I'm not one for sightseeing old buildings and on arrival was already wondering is this going to be a waste of an hour of my life ! But once the guide started talking his enthusiasm soon had the whole group mesmerised with his story of Kilmainham, he at times made us laugh but still brought home the history and sheer horror of this place almost bringing tears to peoples eyes.
If you go to Dublin it's a must worth every penny.

The space leads to an amazing understanding of the recent history of Dublin, including the Great Famine and the Easter Uprising.

I'm so glad I was given the tip to book the tour ahead of time, as when I looked on their website on November 1, more than half the entire months' worth of tours was already booked! The gaol itself was really interesting to look at, and our tour guide was so knowledgeable, telling us story after story about the famous political prisoners who were held or executed there. He also told us stories about the mid 1800s and the famine in Ireland and what effect that had on the prison. Overall, the visit made me want to learn more about Ireland's history.

After spending majority of time reading about the history of the castle (that can be read on Internet) there is not much of an actual castle to see.

Nothing really to remember, compering to other castle tours in Ireland.",Sep 2021

was at a Metal gig here before covid as well (Amon Amarth and Behemoth) and it was unreal.

saw some people want to revert the name back to Limerick Castle.... go for it! King John was a bollix anyway, and he never even visited the place. de-colonise colonial placenames!

Well worth a visit! Pint in Treaty City brewery afterwards!

Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"Very disappointing tourist attraction given its #1 ranking on Tripadvisor for Limerick.

Entered castle at 3:30pm, due to Covid we had to wait in reception for a short while to allow room between other visitors however, when we walked upstairs families with small kids took up the whole of the first couple of exhibitions leaving little room to see/read any of the information. It then took approximately 20/25mins to walk through the rest of the exhibitions.

Arriving at the courtyard at 4pm (which is supposedly 1 hour before closing and the time of the last entrance) the staff started shut up shop. Not allowing my partner and I to engage in the archery for a few seconds but once we walked away the man in the charge was happy to allow other young kids. Very disappointing and he is a disservice to the attraction as he continued to clean up the rest of the games/activities as people were trying to engage with them.

Would definitely not recommend attending this attraction and if you are make sure you attend at least 2/3 hours before closing as the fella who looks after the archery might want to home before closing.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"The tour begins inside with giving the history of the castle. There is a lot of information but through the use of audio and visual exhibits it is easy to take in.

Eventually you reach the outside of the castle where there are some activities for children and you can walk along a section of the castle walls to take in the views.

On the way out there is a cafe and gift shop.

For the best views of the castle I would suggest walking across the river to the nearby Treaty stone and viewing the castle from here.

In the courtyard special mention has to go to Ocean and Nathan who have love and enthusiasm for history that comes across clearly when speaking with you. Ocean in keeping with the knights of old is equally at home explaining the finer points of using a long sword as excelling on the harp. Nathan is an archer who will pass on his skills with the longbow or horsebow in an easy and effective manner.
Next time you are in Limerick make sure you visit the castle.

In all areas in the outside ground there was very little to see in the displays. There was a video of a character doing a certain role. All rooms basically consisted of wooden boxes.

The views are nice and there’s some educational information to pick up.

Lots of information and good displays, but, having travelled in Europe and elsewhere it does disappoint me that there is no translations apparent. In general, in Ireland, we need to do better in this regard.

For young kids there would normally be dress ups and air powered canons but those weren’t available currently. They still had fun exploring.

Ireland,King John's Castle,1.0,"Visiting it now. It's ridiculously expensive to bring my family here. However, it is utterly galling to witness the ban on the Irish language from each and every history display here. Whereas all other museums in this state have a statutory duty to provide us with bilingual information on the displays, there has clearly been a political decision made by the management of King John's Castle museum to abnegate their legal responsibility and deny Irish speakers the right to explore Ireland's history here through their own language. A decision to impose English upon us, in other words. And to have access to guide headphones where we could choose Irish as the language is patently beyond the imagination. Even the names of the Irish Gaelic leaders are not given the dignity of their Irish versions, of their civilisation - e.g. Donel O'Brien rather than Dónall (Domhnall) Ó Briain. As a taxpayer in this state who raises his children through Irish, this pettiness towards my tradition is not merely unnecessary but it is ineffably hurtful.

Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"We had booked online and arrived to a packed reception area with no social distancing and were told to wait with the crowd. We were not given any information on the tour castle or layout just told to wait. We felt very uneasy with the setup and it appeared there was no covid 19 controls in place.There was no one way arrows around indoor exhibition spaces and no one to guide people safely around. There was no 2 metres stickers on the ground to remind people of restrictions in the indoor exhibition. It's such a shame I really feel management at the castle have let the staff and visitors down as it doesn't appear to be set up for the covid 19 restrictions. As for the exhibitions the castle is quite impressive but again not well managed such a shame. We have spent the last few days visiting other attractions in the Burren area including the ailwee caves and to be honest I felt safer in the caves it was so well managed and they are working in a much smaller space.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Fantastic castle, a wonderful museum that really brings the history of Limerick to life with a combination of audio visual displays, interactive exhibits, artefacts and really interesting story-boards.
The first half of the self-guided tour deals mostly with medieval history, the sieges, treaties and battles for power and what life was like for the people of the city then.
There are superb models of the city at its various stages of growth.
Then you can go down to the medieval foundations before ascending the towers and waking the battlements.
Fantastic place, I was there well over 2 hours and just loved every minute.
The staff were so, so helpful as well, it's important for me to mention that.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"I enjoyed walking through museum portion and then into the castle ruins and up a long the walls. You can walk the entire area yourself with an info brochure, a guided tour is not necessary. The history is interesting as most of us are familiar with King John but may not realize it. Mostly kid friendly exhibits.

There is a parking lot up the street across from the castle, but they will try to lock up at closing time of the castle.",Nov 2019

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Absolutely spectacular and worth every penny you pay in! A must visit if you are near / in limerick. 13th-century castle located on King's Island in Limerick, Ireland, next to the River Shannon.[1] Although the site dates back to 922 when the Vikings lived on the Island, the castle itself was built on the orders of King John in 1200. One of the best preserved Norman castles in Europe. You won’t be disappointed!",Feb 2020
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"I might have gone three however .... the first part of the tour is all video screens and posters and things like that. Which is fine, you know, it is clear and well written and provides a clear history of the castle and the history of Irish rebellion in the area. But that is not why you should visit, it is the interior, the rooms, the castle itself, the walls and all that. It is just that it is a long schlep through interpretative bits to get to it. I know alot of work has gone into this site and it shows and it is effective but still, no one is there for the video screens and posters, as much as they lay on anyway.",Feb 2020

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,Very cool history. Step back in time to when life was challenging to say the least. Ocean was playing the harp and gave us a private tour because it was a slow day.,Jan 2020
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"As we walked along the river, the large King John's Castle was easy to see along the river bank. Entrance to the castle is a visitor center and museum, capturing role Limerick and the castle played in the history of Ireland. Museum included displays of pictures, historic descriptions and videos. Museum was arranged in date sequence, showing history in numerous ways (visual, videos, recordings, dioramas, etc.). One of the exhibits we really liked showed how a castle siege and undermining occurred. This one happened in 1642 when the Irish rebels took refuge in the castle - English eventually won the battle.

Saw very nice models of the castle and the nearby St. Mary's Cathedral. We were able to self-tour the castle grounds and buildings. A display showed how scaffolding was constructed and how masons built castle walls. And no castle would be complete without narrow, curved staircases.

Castle itself was also interesting. Self-guided tour only when we visited. Allowed us to take our time. Several places had video displays describing what the area was used for – masons, constables, money men, etc. Signs told us about the chapel, great hall, etc. Take time to read and listen, plus climb the stairs to top of towers to see views of Limerick. The original Norman foundations were part of the castle, show that King Johns Castle was built on an existing fortification. The early defense system consisted of an earthen rampart, held together with limestone boulders and protected by a deep ditch. Diagram shows how it is thought to have looked.

One of our favorite parts of the castle involved a display of games and armor making. An attendant named Owen who shared various games played in medieval times. Our favorite game was called 'Pegs' where the idea was to remove adjacent pegs (at least two in a row). Winner was who removed the last pegs (had to be at least two in a row). We did not play the other game called Brandubh, a strategy game of unequal sides, the objective of the defenders is to get the King to the corner of the board unharmed.

All very well done - we spent 4 hours total here (2 hours in museum, 2 hours in castle). Castle and museum are good for older children (ages 8 to 10 and up), I don’t think younger ones would enjoy this for more than 15-30 minutes. Museum floor is flat, but castle grounds have stairs to several areas. One entrance fee covers both museum and castle.

It is also one of the largest, if not the largest intact Anglo Norman castle. That being said, it is not our favorite of the castles we've visited.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"A 13th Century building with interesting history. There was a docent in the large courtyard, a young man with a bow and I asked if it was a longbow. He pointed to one on a rack and said that one is a longbow, but would I like to take a shot with the re-curve bow he was holding. I haven’t shot an arrow in ages, and it was great fun to do. The castle is large and imposing. If you like archeology, there are several ancient foundations of viking style homes in the new visitor section. The towers are really interesting and some have old steps, some have new. You need to be reasonably fit to climb the towers, but the view is worth it. You get a feel for what life was like in centuries past. Any town or King with a thriving economy had to be prepared to defend against intruders. As an American, I found this to be a cool place! They also have a very nice gift shop there.

Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"The ability to climb up the old towers and see the city was the highlight of this visit. The exhibits also had lovely artwork and many hands-on activities for visitors.

While the exhibition has a lot of information, it could be hard to follow the story chronologically (you have to cross back and forth a lot). I also went on a quiet morning and without lots of people there, the many videos and sound effects were very distracting. They all play at once on a continuous loop and I found myself having to plug my ears just to be able to read the displays. Some of the overhead speakers were also just buzzing and one of the displays beeped constantly. I would not recommend this attraction for people who are sensitive to noise or who have trouble hearing.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Presenting ancient monuments that don’t actually contain very much is always a challenge. King John’s Castle does a great job. There is a lot of history to convey and they do it well, reminding us that Ireland’s tragedy is that the English don’t know enough Irish history and the Irish know too much. As I went round I thought to myself, I really want to know more. Then I got to the shop. Surely there I could find something about the events that had been painstakingly laid out before me. Nope. The shop is a total tat fest. Apart from the official guide there isn’t a single book for the over sixes. It’s all sugar and junk. I feel sorry for the curators. Their marketing colleagues are letting them down.",Sep 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"We saw lots of castles during our time in Ireland, but none of them were as well put together and appropriately curated at King John's Castle.

And obviously the castle portion was amazing. Definitely give yourself enough time to stop and take in all the information along the way. I learned so much about Irish history there that day! And of course, the views are amazing.",Aug 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Judy and I enjoyed our visit to King John's Castle, even though the rain kept us from hitting the top of all the available towers. The exhibits in the museum are very well done, and the idea of breaking up the historical information into several discrete videos, rather than was brilliant. The flow through the space worked well, and there were enough interactive displays at lower heights to take care of younger children while adults read the information farther up the wall. I also found the trek through the undercroft, where we could see what archaeologists have found, to be really fascinating.

To be clear, this is not the kind of castle you visit to see nicely furnished rooms, displays of beautiful furniture, or anything like that.You see well-done exhibits, learn some history, see Limerick from the top of the northeast tower, and see results of archaeological digs. We enjoyed it and don't think a better job would be possible.

Very big and the courtyard had replicas of village life at the time. And we watch two young men dressed in costume, fighting with swords. There are stairs available to climb to the different levels of the wall all the way to the top. Beautiful views of the City.

Just a side note...We stopped for lunch at Katie Dalys Heritage Pub which is just across from King John's Castle and they had the best Murphy's Irish Stout Stew. Nice little pub...worth a stop.

The advertisement said they had a bustling courtyard with people dressed in period costumes so you could experience what life at that time was like. There was one man in the courtyard blacksmith shop sitting in a chair. He didn’t speak or interact with us at all. It was quite disappointing. I did like that it was self paced and you could spend as much or as little time as you wanted to reading through the historical displays. And the view from the top of the walls was great.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"King John’s Castle provides a deep look into Ireland’s rich history, long before the castle was built in the early 13th century. A detailed exhibit on early Gaelic society (6th century) includes an overview of the legal system known as the Brehon Laws. The key takeaway for me was the fact that women were treated as equals. What a concept!

The castle endured a number of sieges in the 17th century. In one of my photos, you’ll see a large sand courtyard. Look carefully at the center where you can make out rectangular shapes in the ground. It wasn’t until the 1990’s that archaeologists came in and realized that bodies were buried there. They were victims of a siege and were interred in a mass grave. That part of the castle, it turns out, provided the best shelter from the attacks. It’s believed there are/were more burial pits, but they may have been destroyed by construction over the centuries.

The castle’s dark history continued into the 20th century, when it was under siege again in the Irish Civil War of 1922. Let’s hope those troubled days are over, and that the castle will remain just a tourist attraction.

In the courtyard 2 gentlemen in period dress were mock sword fighting and they were a wealth of information. They took time to let all the kids handle the spears and swords. Great fun for all. I loved walking up the tower to overlook the river. Pretty amazing.,Jul 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,This was an unexpected treat. A museum that wasn’t boring for a 6 year old. Great layout. Perfect for a rainy day. Be careful climbing the towers. It’s steep and narrow!,Jul 2019

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,This is a must when visiting limerick . Free car park behind the castle was a nice surprise. The visitors Centre which you go through is very well laid out . It takes a while to go round it but don’t rush it as when you have the history in your head and then step out into the castle it all comes alive . You can imagine the battles very well . And they have open air concerts in the courtyard. Well worth a visit.,Jul 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"Not much of the castle is accessible but the displays and exhibitions inside are quite informative and educational.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,A bit pricey but still enjoyed being there with family. Would love if there was more castle to view. The interactive stations were a bit lower in volume.,Jul 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,Since the renovation the castle is much more interesting. Lots of information and plenty to see. You can also walk up to the towers for a view of the city. At almost €12 I think that's a bit pricey but that I wouldn't regret paying that. You are also free to walk around without a guide so you can take as long as you wish.,Aug 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"This was a photo op stop on our tour in Limerick. Located on the banks of the Shannon River, the castle dates back to the 1200s and was built to fortify the defenses of the city. We could see costumed characters in the courtyard awaiting a visit of students from a preschool. According to their brochure, displays focus on Early Gaelic Society, The Normans, Change and Conflict During the Reformation, the Siege of 1642, the Siege of Limerick in 1651 and the Siege of 1690/1691. Ideal place to visit for those interested in the history of 17th century Limerick",Jun 2019

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Myself, my 3 yr old and my parents saw this event advertised locally. As the day was beautiful we meandered from Corbally up to the castle. Firstly admission didn't cost anything as it was free entry for first few hours which was brilliant.from the moment we entered the staff couldn't have been nicer. We had gone to see the Bastille day celebrations but was able to walk around the castle and see all the exhibits beforehand. Once outside the festivities were just about to start,but 3yr old decided to run over to his nana but misjudged the gravel and over he went. Skinned knee and tears. When I brought him through the gift shop to go to the bathrooms to clean him up a lady from the gift shop spotted his tears and asked could she help us. I didn't get her name but with the shop busy she still went out of her way to get the first aid kit and make sure my son was alright. After we had been given antiseptic swabs and plasters we continued outside to enjoy the displays. The wild geese soldiers were fully decked out and the local bothar bui band put on an excellent show. The tea and cakes after the ceremony were a lovely touch. We spent a good 4hrs in th castle and had a pleasant day out. I would like to see more events like this at the castle. Thank you to all the staff and organisers who made our Sunday a fab family day out

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"When traveling in Ireland I love coming across the countless examples of the nation's past in the form of castles, castle ruins, and small towns. To that end I feel compelled to understand better Ireland's past. King John's Castle is one such form to get some better understanding. For starters we purchased tickets online and showed purchase confirmation on our phone the next day when we arrived. If you are interested in purchasing ahead of time consider doing your own internet research to see what may be available as I imagine there are many different options. If you do go please try to be patient as the tour leads you through exhibits before leading you to the castle courtyard. While it is not expected you read everything on the exhibits I feel it's important to note these do contain so much fascinating and valuable information to the past and to the context of the castle's purpose. I walked away with a much better sense of the historical relationship between Ireland and England. Many of the exhibits are interactive so that is a bonus. When you do get out in the open you are treated to awe. You can imagine what it may have been like. You can then explore the various rooms and towers. Some of the climbs do requite attentiveness so close-toed shoes are important. At the tops of the towers you can get an awesome view of Limerick and the River Shannon. We all loved this visit and hope fellow travelers consider taking the time to visit and explore.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"I had a few hours off during my business trip to Limerick so I decided to go to King John's Castle to kill some time. I was expecting a tour of a castle, which I got, but I wasn't expecting the high quality history museum that is there as well! The museum has one of the best composites of Irish history that I have seen anywhere. Yes, the museum focused on the role of the castle and of Limerick city during several millennia of history, but it also delved deep into a whole range of Irish history as a backdrop and context for the history of the castle. It was truly fantastic. If anyone wants to learn a lot about the history of Ireland, this is the place.",Jun 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,This is a must. Today was a drizzly morning and we arrived 15mins early before opening but the cafe owner of the castle was so thoughtful he allowed us to step inside and wait until opening of the castle and his cafe. That is service. A big thank you. The whole tour was great especially when you get to the outside of it and the authentic part of the castle. Arrive early as less crowds and you’ll get to climb to the tower with ease.,Jul 2019

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,I enjoyed the touring King John's Castle. They offer free guided tours or you can walk through on your own! We caught a guided tour and I enjoyed following that through the museum portion. After that our guide told us where things were and we explored the castle again! Would recommend to others visiting Limerick for sure!,Jun 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"Really disappointing visit to the castle. The previous evening had seen a 'pop' concert and there was still a lot of equipment, staging obscuring the views of the walls. It all looked very sad and certainly wasn't what we'd expected. I did think that, as we bought our tickets, we should have been warned that we wouldn't be seeing it at its best.",Jun 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"We decided last night that this morning, before leaving Limerick, we would visit King John's Castle, which we did. Unfortunately, we only had about an hour in the castle (self-guided tour) and had to leave without seeing some of the displays. (I would suggest staying a good 2 or so hours.) The museum begins before the Norman conquest in the 12th century and goes through the 18th century (that we saw). It was quite interesting and we both learned quite a bit about the history of the wars for control of Ireland and the Celtic way of life. Next time we're in Limerick, we'll do the rest of the castle.",Jul 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"When we arrived in Limerick, we weren’t planning on seeing King John’s Castle, as we were initially only planning on being in town for a few hours and seeing a museum. However, when we found ourselves there for the full day, I wanted to take advantage and see all the attractions. I have visited many castles and found myself very impressed with this one. It was probably one of the most informative but still interesting ones I’ve seen. There is a ton of information to read, and the layout does an excellent job of laying it out chronologically so that you really understand and follow the progression of events through the castle’s history as well as the historical context surrounding all those eras. If you have kids, there are also some hands-on exhibits for them as you go along.

Location is also a plus, as it’s very walkable from city center and other Limerick attractions. If you’re also interested in seeing the cathedral nearby, I might recommend stopping by there first, as there are a couple of mentions of it through the exhibit, and it was cool to have that context and mental image to add to the information I was learning.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"I found this castle (museum) very interesting. It provides the visitor an insight into Irish history. It does so with interactive games, short audio-visual presentations, artefacts, and so the approach is varied. The visit takes you down to the foundations,, through the courtyard where tradespeople ply their trade and up into the tower overlooking the city. The museum offers something for everyone.",Jun 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"An authentic castle in downtown Limerick on the river side.

What else do you need? Swans? Okay, they are there too. Nice architecture in the older building and neighbourhood.",Jun 2019
Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"It was an ok experience but many of the museum areas were too loud. You could hear the audio from multiple displays at one time and the acoustics made conversations echo.

The towers were cool to see and they had a courtyard with a person to introduce guests to archery and experiences from that period, but overall it was rather underwhelming.

We went primarily to see viking artifacts and we only found a couple in the whole museum. It likely would have been better for younger kids.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"My wife and I visited this castle and had a great time. They show you how the castle was constructed and you can actually go under it and see how ""enemies"" would undermine it and gain entry. Unlike a couple other castles we visited, this one actually let you see how it was, back in the day. You can climb up on the tower and imagine shooting arrows down on the attackers. We thoroughly enjoyed it !",May 2019

They’ve set it up to educate you as a visitor first, tying the local history to what was also happening in the country at large. Then you get to meander through the castle grounds, entering different sections, seeing some ruins, and catching some nice city views.

You can climb about on the castle and the activities offered make up for the lack of furnishings. When we visited, there were no special events going on like feasts or festivals or jousting, but there were blacksmith types of demonstrations and the opportunity to try out archery. The castle also has a gift shop and a pleasant little café with delicious muffins.",May 2019

The staff on the reception desk were friendly and welcoming, and the inside displays are informative. I learnt a lot about the history of the castle and Ireland and I particularly liked the underground area.
We dodged the rain to explore the castle towers and walls and managed to get some good photos of the views over Limerick. Just be careful as it does get slippery on the steep steps and on the top of the tower.
There were outside activities with people dressed up but we didn't get to see any of these as it was too wet.

On the outside the castle seems not even touched by time, seems to “strengthen” by the neighboring river Shannon and its walls and towers are very well preserved.

Depending on the time you arrive, there may be actors and actresses acting the part of medieval times. We arrived slightly late so missed out on that portion. The castle is relatively intact. It is self tour. Sadly... They have modernized the tour to feature interactive screens and such which was a let down for me as I prefer everything as authentic as possible.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Wonderfully outlined exhibition spaces. Very interactive (although a few of the interactives didn’t work - such as the cannon ball and model town that lights up depending on what area you’re interested in), and accessible to all abilities and ages. Loved the exposed foundation which showed the true age and longevity of King John’s. Once through the exhibition space, the castle itself is well explained, with again, superb and well-acted and thought out spaces. The member of staff with the sword was “well met” and very very encouraging and engaging. Well met, indeed! Only reason not giving 5 stars the gift shop is very disappointing. It’s full of kitchy “Irish/Guinness” things versus something specific to King Johns! For those living in Ireland visiting around Ireland, the last thing you want is an “I went to Ireland” t shirt/cup/magnet you can get on OConnell street. Having a t shirt or sweatshirt with the actual place rather than something tied to Dublin would have made the trip an absolute 5 stars hands on. Such a shame - Shannon Heritage needs to have a rethink hopefully! Other than that, expensive to visit but well worth it.

Throughout the tour their are videoed actors who play the part of historical people of the castle.

Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"Once again a total fleecing of the tourists without any regard. I have read the responses from management on negative reviews and they say they will take on board and improve. Obviously never happened. The historic displays are confusing, they seem to be very random with no set guide. The audio visual displays are so loud they drown each other out, managed to get the basics of the history then proceeded to the castle. The displays are old and tired, litter was very abundant. As it was March there were no live displays but we still paid the same price, it was relatively quiet but in the peak season the place would be uncomfortably full to the extent u wouldn’t have been able to see the screens let alone move around the castle. I think the worse is if you do not have really good English, forget going as all displays were in English. Not worth the money.

Hadn’t heard about the castle before despite its size! Pleasantly surprised that the castle and visitors centre were well worth stopping off for.

Interactive museum, and areas of the castle refurbished to show how inhabitants would have lived. Kept two adults and a young teenager interested for a few hours!!!

Coffee shop across the road was lovely to stop off at afterwards.

There are a few places, like the towers, which are not, but there had definitely been an effort to make the facility as accessible as possible. The videos throughout the exhibition are also helpful in reaching a broader audience.

I also appreciate the hands-in aspect that is part of the tour... perfect for kids and those of us that just have to touch history.

Nicely done and a great value for the money.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"It's worth mentioning that not very much of the castle itself survives, but the attraction as a whole is absolutely worth the visit (and definitely recommended for children). Before reaching the castle grounds you are guided through an interactive history of Limerick and the relevant Irish history, told through visual displays, touch-screen puzzles, artifacts, and animated videos. Visitors are then taken underground to see archaeological evidence of different stages of the castle's history, from the remains of Viking houses to the siegeworks and fortifications added in the 17th century.

The two towers that remain can be climbed, giving spectacular views of the surrounding city and countryside, and there are videos of actors speaking as people from the castle's history in some of the rooms.

The interactive display before you enter the castle was good and even well-received by my then four-year-old. The castle is large and has several towers for you to explore with interactive displays in each. These were a big surprise and caught us off-guard. The views from the top of the towers across the River are amazing, albeit a little cold and windy up there in march. But worth the climb. This was a castle I wasn't expecting much of but thoroughly enjoyed along with my son. A must-visit if in Limerick City.

Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"Paid the entrance fee, and went through the exhibition, there is TONS of information in here, if you were a student doing a paper or a thesis on the castle, you'd get everything you need here! A lot of it seems geared towards schools, being able to touch and feel things. The interactive presentations by the mint, the Mason, soldier, etc., are very well done, but are done by English actors, it would be nice if they had been done by Irish actors to make it more believable. I kinda got lost by the time it got onto the under mining section, so much information to take in!! But to give it credit, it is well done. As for the underground piece /foundations of the castle, it's very dark down there, I think a few floodlights have blown, and a lot of rubbish has been thrown down into it, doesn't look like anyone is cleaning up. Out in the court yard, as it ws mid-week and off season, they were just taking down a marque I think, but they had a van in the yard blasting dance music from his radio, not very authentic!!! None of the blacksmiths or live exhibits were there, neither was the Masons tower open, I was told they are not open in the winter, I think they should charge less if that is the case. Again, lots of rubbish in the court yard, could really do with some one cleaning up, it could have been as it was after Christmas, but it was 3 weeks after and I'd expect that to be cleaned up quite quickly, rather than leaving it lying around. The rest of the towers are good and you can go up and get views of the city. Good visit and recommended, just the little things let it down.

Santa was very good and was good to ask the kids questions and to make the feel at ease. We parked up at the visitor car park. It has space for 50 cars. The cafe was good and served teas coffee and cake and sandwiches also soup. Mrs Claus was there too and was very nice to the kids.

Ireland,King John's Castle,1.0,"Shannon Heritage should really be ashamed of the disaster that is the Christmas experience at King John’s.

The winter wonderland in the courtyard consists of a few trees with lights and a sad old crib. Everything seems very thrown together and while some of the staff really try their best, others seem miserable.

The activities for kids are all over the place, Mrs Claus and the elves are in the main building where there are no decorations and no music. The elves activity station was just one elf giving the kids paper decorations to colour in. There was very little interaction between the characters and the children. We were also waiting a long time to see Santa; the system seemed very disorganised.

We paid over €100 for two adults and three children, including the extra tenner for the photo, and it really wasn’t worth it. We were very disappointed.

There were some good points: the kids really enjoyed the magic show and Santa himself was lovely. The presents for the two older children were good but the gift for the 1-year-old was quite shoddy considering we had to pay full price for him.

Nothing Christmasy or magical about the experience at all. Hardly any decorations around the place and no music to create a festive atmosphere

Apart from Santa himself, who was very pleasant, the staff seemed disinterested and were clearly embarrassed about the whole event.

We were left waiting around for ages with barely no communication.

Terrible value for money. Charging €10 extra for photo was an absolute joke.

Ireland,King John's Castle,1.0,"Today my husband and I attended King John's Castle for their Magical Christmas experience with our two children (3 years & 6months). We booked online and first of all I feel it was very over priced. €12 each per adult for what reason I have no idea. €24 for a child but our 6 month old was charged €24 also, the option of a babies admission €8 for each date and time to see Santy was ""sold out"" which I find very hard to believe and just a way of making money by charging a full price for the infants.

As we booked online we were so excited to read all about the magical experience that awaited us. Online it read ""Your journey has started. Within the castle walls, The Courtyard will be crammed full of fun shows, seasonal activities, trails, treats and festive workshops""

We checked in at reception and we were told an elf would be with us shortly. The elf met us after a few moments and brought us down into the courtyard to Santa's marquee. We looked around as we made our way to the marquee to see what our little boy would love to see first. To the right of the marquee was the cups for the kids to ride on, a big sign saying Princess Snow Chamber to which there was no body in there and nothing to do in their either. To the left of the marquee was a small hut that had 2 pony's, 1 sheep, 1 dog and a medieval house. Unfortunately before we met Santa there was nothing magical outside that our little boy was so excited about. We then made our way into the marquee and waited for our names to be called. A member of staff I'm not sure what his character was sat amongst children with a pen and paper wanting to know what would be the best presents kids could get. At this point our 3 year old was ""bored"". We waited a little longer until our names were called. In fairness to the Santa he was not in a rush he took great time in chatting to our kids, we got our picture taken (an extra €10) and the kids got a present each and off we went inside to the cafe and gift shop for the rest of the ""magical experience"". Upstairs Mrs Claus was supposed to be there but unfortunately no sign of her, a game of connect 4, and a table to do some colouring in. We decided to head home.

Our little boy was happy with his gift heading home. But there was no magic in this magical experience that we were all so excited for. No Christmas music, nothing to come away from the day thinking Wow that was a great trip and worth the money. Very disappointed after spending €72 to literally walk through a courtyard, see Santy and that was it. Online they make it out to be amazing and I was far from amazed. I wish I had better things to say about the day.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"This is really a fantastic place to visit.The castle is mostly intact and the way the history is displayed in the museum is just phenomenal. Some parts are outside, so I'd advise to bring a waterproof jacket if the weather looks bad or cold. One part I really appreciated is that the videos tell you how long they have left to finish, so you know whether you've come in half way or near the end. Everything ties in and links together and the history flows chronologically really well. It's a full-day activity with a great gift shop to boot.",Sep 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,This castle is in really good shape and very comparable to CarrickFergus castle. They have a good gift shop for special gifts to take home with you.

This is a must see in my opinion it’s one of those castles that has history galore.,Sep 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"They say that Vikings occupied the site in AD 922, but the local clans eventually drove them out. The present castle was completed in AD 1210.

Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"We went to many castles on our ireland trip and this was by far the most disappointing.

The museum part with all the information was cluttered, and a lot of the interactive panels didn’t work.

There was no one around in the museum to explain anything or ask questions.

The views from the top of the castle were awesome but overall it just felt like they could be spending some money on improving the grounds and employing more staff. The gift shop was honestly more interesting than the castle itself.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"We visited on a Sunday morning and were impressed with this stop. I see some reviews indicating it's for kids. Maybe I am a kid at heart but I think all ages would enjoy this stop, and frankly it was filled with adults enjoying the displays. There is a fee and it wasn't cheap. When you enter, you first go through a very well displayed history review of Limerick and the castle. There are some inter active displays that are interesting. I found the history display very informative ... in depth and over the heads of children. You then exit the displays and wander around the court yard where you view mock ups of blacksmiths and Mason's buildings etc. You can also climb the stairs to walk around the walls. This was a great hour long stop ... suitable for children of all ages from 8 to 80. There is also a cafeteria, gift shop and very clean washrooms.

Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,Visited King John’s Castle for the first time in years. The visitor section and historic displays are very interesting and give a great overview of historic Limerick.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"We spent lovely afternoon here roaming around the visitors centre learning about the history of the castle. Very informative and well laid out.

Afterwards we were free to roam the castle which is very impressive. I think it would be much more fun with some interactive activities and if there was some actors describing what their roles within the castle would of been at that time. Very enjoyable though.

Great view of limerick and the surrounds from the top of castle.

Ireland,King John's Castle,1.0,"We visited the cafe last Saturday. Omg the service firstly was terrible. The two girls on duty couldn't possibly have been slower. The sandwiches and ciabatta were prepared and wrapped in cling film and left sitting there. We ordered soup and they didn't even have hot soup it had to be zapped in a microwave. When it came out eventually it was served with brown bread wrapped in cling film and it was freezing cold and it broke up to pieces once I removed the cling film. The soup was terrible. I tried a soup of it and me and my partner just left . Please do not get ripped off by this place. It's NOT a CAFE. I feel bad for the tourists being ripped off. One man asked for his Apple pie to be heated up and she zapped it so like there was barely any filling left in it and happily charged 4.95 for it. So bad go to the pub across the way they do bar food.

You soon see a spectacular view of the castle in the middle distance.",Sep 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"I love castles but this might be the best one I’ve seen yet, for a couple of reasons. The first is that there is a big gallery before you go into the main part of the castle that is LOADED with historical information, artifacts and visual displays. The second is that the towers are open and you can climb to the top (which is fun and good exercise), and allows for beautiful pictures of the city. In many castles, the towers aren’t safe to allow you to climb them, so I always count it a blessing when I can. They have their own car park nearby which is free and open until 6 PM, which is a bonus.",Sep 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Take your time to view the information displays on Irish history before you go to see the castle. It is modern, entertaining and informative.

Also a wonderful cafe with very tasty cheesecake!",Sep 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"It's well worth a visit to this Castle, even just for the fantastic views from the top of the tower. You need a bit of time here to explore. The heritage centre is excellent and I think children would also like it. There is a self-explanatory detailed history of the tower, which you can follow as you take the tour of the Centre, before visiting the Towers. Very well laid out and the history well explained. You will also get to see recently excavated ground which shows the time of the Vikings.
Do explore Limerick itself. Thanks to DECLAN (from Hunt Museum), a group of 33 of us got a wonderful tour of this lovely, clean city. He knows all there is to know about Limerick and no better man to share his knowledge. The place oozes history and in a short hour, we had quite a lot to take in. Apart from the sad Terry Wogan statue (not a bit like the man!). ENJOY!

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"I had previously visited King John's Castle in 1996, and the changes are outstanding. Much more of the castle is open to climb around and explore--kids will love it, as they will the exhibits that specifically appeal to them, such as firing air cannons, dressing up as knights and soldiers, etc. In 1996, the castle focused on the Viking origins of the settlement, but that has changed. The bulk of he exhibits now cover the conquest of Ireland by the Anglo-Normans under Henry II, and the complex relationships that developed among the Anglo-Irish nobility and the English crown, and the tremendous impact that the English Civil War and the rise of Cromwell to Lord Protector had on Ireland and Limerick City in particular. Likewise, the various uprisings that occurred against English rule and specifically the Williamite monarchs, including the Flight of the Earls and the Flight of the Wild Geese. There is a free parking lot nearby, and the Castle also has a fine gift shop and café. In addition, parts of the castle underground have been excavated and are being studied archeologically, which can also be seen, somewhat in the manner of the Roman ruins at Bath (but not so extensively).

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"My young boys enjoyed the hands on stuff in the court yard area. The scavenger hunt for them also kept them occupied while the adults enjoyed the informative displays. There is free parking across the road from the castle. Watching many people (including myself) we were confused the we did not have to pay for parking. There weren’t any signs that said it was free and you’ll have to drive through a gateway that makes you think you need to pay.
Overall a good way to spend sone time. The admission fee is debatable depending on what you get out of it. However the price is reasonable compared to other attractions in Ireland.",Aug 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Having read some of the reviews I was concerned about paying the entrance fee, but have to say it was a fair price for the attraction with 2 adults and two teenage children getting entry for approx 36 Euro's. On entry you are taken through a series of rooms which explain the history of the castle very well. Once through the rooms you enter the court yard where there are a number of displays depicting castle life in days gone by. You then enter the castle where rooms are decorated in an attempt to demonstrate how they might have been through history. From the battlements there are views of the city of Limerick and the River Shannon. All in all I would recommend the visit if you are in Limerick.",Aug 2018

Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"Obviously a visit to any mediaeval city isn't complete without a visit to the castle, and so I visited Limerick castle. €13 entry for an adult is quite pricy in the great realms of things. The castle consists of a few information boards and some reconstructions upon entering, with a few videos about the castle. Then you are free to roam the castle itself. Although interesting and lots of history...I had a feeling of underwhelmingness. I can't help but feel there needs to be a bit more...a few more artifacts and suchlike...And the horrendous glass gift shop and café...an eyesore of a building built into the walls of the castle feels like a modern travesty and sacrilege. If I had paid half the entry price then I would have been okay with that. I have added an extra star to my review however because the views from the top of the tower are excellent. So I would neither recommend nor not recommend this place. Just use your own judgment...

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"I visited by myself on a Sunday afternoon, and it was a good way to spend a quite afternoon. The day was a bit rainy, so the castle wasn't over-crowded. The exhibits before getting into the castle were very interesting - the entrance building shows the history of the area and the castle, then you actually enter the castle by going under the walls and seeing some excavations of some of the tunnels dug during the sieges. Once inside, there are a number of parts of the castle to explore, some interactive displays, a cafe and gift shop. It looked like they may have some living history demonstrations, but there were none while I was visiting.

While I appreciate the technology they used in this part we were very underwhelmed. After walking through the maze of history we embarked on the most exciting part...the castle, or so we thought.

It tied elements of forgotten history back together. I did expect that there would be a greater presence of guides on the ground, particularly in the courtyard and on the ramparts but only one was evident and she, despite being dressed for the part, was on her phone all the time we were in the vicinity.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Spend a very enjoyable 4 hours in the castle with my family of four.

The visit starts in a education center with multiple displays, videos, exhibits and information boards explaining the history of the castle. My wife and I enjoyed the detailed history and explanation of who the King was, how the castle was built, the multiple seiges over the years etc. The kids were more engaged with the dressing up & shooting cannonballs at targets.

The tour then goes round a section of excavated castle and then into the main courtyard inside the castle.

There are several towers to visit, lots of spiral staircases to climb but the views from the top are superb. In the various rooms are full of furniture & props that you can touch, sit on and use, there are also full sized video screens showing a re-enactment of a member of the Castle's workforce explaining their job. Included are a stonemason, coin maker, a Solider, the Castle Constable etc.

In the courtyard are a series of wooden shelters where staff dressed in traditional costume are enacting roles. On our day we had a hunter with a bow & Arrow which the kids were able to use for a few shots at a target, and also loads of swords, shields and chain mail to try on.

Special mention though goes to the Minstrel who played songs on both the Lute and the Harp for us. He was dressed in traditional clothing, explained the minstrels role at the castle, and superbly played songs on both instruments. He took time to answer all our questions, and was friendly and polite with us. This chap is a credit to the castle.

We had a coffee and a superb Chocolate muffin in the visitor center. Don't miss going upstairs where some of the recent history of the castle is covered including the excavations and restoration work in recent years. I was really surprised to see that regular terraced houses were built in the courtyard for the majority of the last 80 years.

I think the castle is the best attraction in Limerick and recommend it to everyone.

The views from atop are really lovely! There was construction going on outside that you have to walk around but that’s what happens when a property of that age is being preserved.",Jul 2018

We enjoyed our morning here, we both found it very interesting, if you're into history it's great, and the view from the top of the tower is fab.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Best part of the castle was the history of it. Upon entering the modern area at the beginning of the tour, there was a lot of interesting history that was set up very well, in the form of interactive ""tests"", time lines, large boards with dates and a few movies. There were actors, and a few of those live movie people things that start talking when you walk in to the room. The ONLY disappointment was that they were setting up for a concert in the middle of the castle, which killed the tour for me. They don't do this all the time, and it's def not what I want to see when I go to a medieval castle.",Jul 2018

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Very pleasantly surprised, with time to kill before a flight home this was our go to and we weren’t left disappointed.

Prices where more than advertised online, however still worth the money. A great blend of modern and historical architecture. Facilities are good, well signed with plenty for all age groups. Good open spaces for children to play safely. Not to mention a decent gift shop and cafe.

Also worth a look is any gigs that may be going on, we missed out on a live band but when passing could see and hear and a castle isn’t a bad venue for what seemed like decent music.

In the beginning of the self guided tour, there is a timeline of people and events. Told in large storyboard form with video clips, artifacts, and auditory experiences. Then you get to enter the courtyard which has a few interactive stations including a blacksmith, and play protection to try on (shields and armor)! There’s a church and then you get to enter the castle. The castle is, again, an opportunity to listen to short videos, visit the rooms, look at artifacts, and get some scenic pics from the top.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"My 15 year old son and I visited King John’s Castle and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in the exhibit portion that precedes entering the castle grounds as well as walking the castle grounds themselves. It was really something to be able to explore the castle grounds so freely, going up staircases and through several rooms out to some amazing viewing points. It wasn’t crowded and we took our time checking everything out. I would say we were there about an hour to an hour and a half and got to see everything. It was great for my 15 year old, he liked the interactive portions of the exhibits and founds the grounds interesting. And for him an hour to hour and a half was just long enough not to get bored!

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"After touring 7 castles over the past 2 weeks, King John's 🏰 was a refreshing treat. Great history, touring at your own pace, and very interesting how the castle is being restored.
I would challenge them to improve their reinactors, including getting rid of the OSB plywood, be more authentic in their weaponry, and daily review of the courtyard area, to remove the broken displays.
You have a great canvass, use your best oils to paint the picture.
Definitely worth the price of admission.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"This is a very well considered tour of a historic Irish castle. The tour covers two floors with interactive displays, telling the visitor all about the history of the castle. There is enough ""fun things"" to hold younger visitors attention while you tour around. There are drawers that you can open to discover items that would have been in use at the time. Often you are encouraged to touch and feel these items. There were videos which helped to tell the story and each was surrounded by displays that matched theri content. I do wish the videos had subtitles though because it was very difficult to hear when other visitors were enjoying the other displays nearby.
I was also disappointed when drawers that were supposed to be full of costumes or other items were empty, and a cool little game using a cannon required little balls to be loaded into it, but there were none to be seen. Also we discovered some of the videos that ""interviewed"" the historical figures were broken.
While I feel that the museum portion was beautifully presented, well paced, full of interesting information and used multi media to great effect, I was disappointed with the missing and broken parts. I also note that there were no staff members in this section of the tour. Once your ticket is purchased, it is a self led tour, which I liked, because you can go at your own pace, but because there was no staff available we couldn't draw their attention to the missing/broken displays, nor could we ask and questions or seek further information.
The history discussed is also quite complex. It was difficult to follow who was who and why they were doing the things that they were doing. This was made more difficult by the lack of subtitles on videos and the noise of the other patrons. I imagine that if you were already familiar with the history this tour would be delightful as it would round out your knowledge, so this would be an excellent place for history students to visit.
The multi-media tour ends and you follow the path to the site of the actual castle, first through a covered section then out into a courtyard. Here there were two staff members in costume going about their business and doing some archery. This was quite cool.
The towers are original and so it is advisable that you wear clothes and shoes you can move in easily, watch your footing, use hand rails, watch your head and be courteous to other patrons especially as you climb steep spiral stairs.
You can tour almost the entire castle and see the spaces presented as they would have been, some even included videos of actors portraying the castle's historical inhabitants.

The tour ends in a nice gift shop and cafe.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"King John's Castle is a must-experience item on one's itinerary when visiting Limerick! You will learn so much of Ireland's overall history (from the beginning of Gaelic society to the Anglo-Norman ""invasion""). The displays are so interactive that I can totally see kids having a blast - and we as adults really enjoyed the technology as well. If you've seen Night at the Museum, you can picture characters coming to life - just through a well-developed video that describes life within the castle. The views at the top are extraordinary. The river that runs through Limerick is one of my most memorable scenes that I'll cherish forever. The price is right and, if you give it the time and attention it deserves, you'll walk out knowing so much more about Irish history and culture. You'll get an ""in"" to what the locals already know!

The history was fascinating and was told through a mix of interactives (for kids), videos, and museum-type displays. After walking through this indoor area, you are led to the courtyard, where there are stalls where visitors can interact with staff about life during this time period.

You can climb up to the top of the towers, getting a spectacular view of the city if the weather cooperates. We had a beautiful, clear day and could see the city and surrounding fields.

The castle is definitely worth a visit if you are in Limerick.

It is done very well, I was thinking as I was walking around that it would be interesting for children as there is lots of interactive things with games and puzzles for them to do. We visited about 11 years ago and there is some new parts opened up which we didn't see the last time. The stairs are a bit steep and narrow in parts so you need to be careful and wear good footwear. It is lovely when you get up on top and have great views of the city. The ladies on the entrance desk and the lady at the gift shop were so friendly, they give you a great welcome to Limerick and the Castle. Even if you have been before it is worth a second visit.

Ireland,King John's Castle,1.0,"Was very disappointed with King John's Castle.

Basic upkeep is lacking - the displays were lacking and some had cobwebs that seemed to have been there for a long time. Weeds were growing out of the walls. There was litter that seemed to have been there for days (granted people should dispose of there garbage) but for the price of admission someone can go around and clean up. The actors seemed very disinterested in what they were doing - very cheesy ( I could see very easily the pair of converse sneakers one of them was wearing.

The most annoying thing was the large blow up dart board that was set up in the courtyard that was some sort of commercial promotion that dominated the views in the courtyard.

The informational displays were good and informative. Overall though you would be better off buying a book about the history of LImerick and skipping this shabby castle.

Sad because it has great potential/

Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"Encouraged by our tour guide to pay to visit this castle, I was somewhat disappointed with the ""interactive displays"" Some were not working. The sound on the commentary from the video was inaudible and competed with the noises coming from various other exhibits. If you called a damsel and a villain crossing swords an historical representation, it was half-hearted and lacking in credibility. The man with the harp gave information about his instrument but was hardly riveting. I ascended one of the towers, and there is a view over the City which doesn't come close to those from St. Canice's Cathedral & Round Tower in Kilkenny.

There is a coffee shop and a gift shop. My travelling companions said the coffee was good there.

The walk through the exhibition/historic display was well signposted. It was very enjoyable and brought back to me my studies of Irish history (I was educated in a convent in Athlone a thousand years ago)!

On leaving, I mentioned to the staff that the audio recordings were great but were all on simultaneously and quite loud, so it made life difficult for me who was making an effort to read other sections on my way through. So, one audio would be talking about the O'Neills and another would be talking about Henry VIII - all at once! Confusing? Definitely.

However, it was a great tour and I think would be ideal for all travellers. The castle has a great shop and cafe. Staff were wonderful.

The view from the towers is nice to see the other historic churches, bridge & buildings. You do get to go under the castle & see what I think was the foundation & outline of other building that once stood there.

However nowhere near the experience of Blarney or Kylemore. No gardens, nothing special. Felt we overpaid after leaving the castle. Hopefully OPW will acquire this castle one day and add it to its list of heritage card sites. Would not recommend paying for an overpriced unguided castle tour. Displays were broken and or damaged.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"You've probably heard of King John. He's the Baddie that Robin Hood and his Merrie Men were upset about. He's the guy who put his name on the Magna Carta. And he's the King who, in 1210, ordered that this castle be built. King John reigned from 1199 to 1216, but ironically he never saw the castle that he ordered to be built. This castle, now around 800 years old, is one of the best preserved Norman castles in Europe. Visitors can roam the castle, climb the towers, walk the walls, and descend into the Great Hall. Being a history buff one of the things I most enjoyed about the visit was the excellent museum which traces the history or the area from the time of medieval Ireland, to the invasion of the Limerick area by the Normans, to the Irish rebellions suppressed by Elizabeth ! and up to the Siege of 1691. The Castle sits in a lovely location, next to the River Shannon in Limerick, and in a real sense the building of this castle represents the beginning of Norman and English control and suppression of the Gaelic people and their culture. The museum is very well laid out with informative displays and videos, I had an hour here (limited by the schedule of my tour bus that stopped here on way to the Cliffs of Moher), but I could easily have stayed longer. Well worth the price of admission.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,This historical site offered a lot of details of the past hostilities. We should have spent more time there to absorb more of the facts.,May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,Disappointed with King Johns Castle. Was expecting more of a grand castle but really its a Fort. There are no Grand halls or rooms to view just a walled open area and a strange glass protrusion at the front. Yes the interactive area is very informative about the history and the conflicts of the Fort ( sorry still cant call it a castle). If you have young children they will enjoy it but if you are looking for a lived in castle with rooms etc you will be disappointed. If i went in knowing it was just a fort i might have enjoyed it more.,May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,King John's castle is a very worth while place to visit it was a real look back in time from the two tribes men at the entry to the very end very good video shows at each place showing you what would have been going on in that section back in time also access to the towers was a real bonus offering a lovely view of the city would go back again,Jul 2017
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,We stopped in on a drizzly day in May there were no crowds which was nice the tour is nice the history before the castle proper was well laod out and worth the price of admission on its own. The castle was intersting and fun we spent about an hour and a half but rushed a little with the dizzle and rain on its way,May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"This place is definitely a must when you are in Limerick. History very well explained, interesting and educational. View from a tower is amazing and I recommend to go on it. You will probably need around 2 hours to go all around the castle. Only thing that I was missing there was souvenirs. Fridge magnet with a Castle would be nice.",May 2018

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Got a late start to our day so limited to one journey this trip through Limerick. First, the price is spot on for different categories. Second, they have set it up for children, elementary (age 8-15), will enjoy both education and Interactive posing, firing cannons, open drawers of discoveries and mixing/matching clothing. Last, an elevator is available for those needing it. Easily spent two hours and gained an further insight into the history of Ireland. This, the castle at Enniskillen, and the one just north of Belfast are all great places. Other castles we've visited (our third trip from the States) are more into how the rich lived; these tell the story of the Emerald Isle.",May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"The museum did a good job of explaining the history behind the castle. You could look down into the old footings and walls under the existing site. Within the castle walls, you can climb the stairs into the tower. Note, if you have large feet, you might find this challenging. The steps are NOT deep.",May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"We were in Ireland on a 4 day coaxch tour and as luck would have it our short visit to Limerick was on a public holiday with many places either shut or only open on restricted hours.

We were able to walk along the riverside and see the castle from a couple of external vantage points but really didn't have the time to go inside. One to do when we next visit the city which is a distinct possibility as we have friends who live in the city..",May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Had a great afternoon walking round this castle. Each exhibit had just enough information to make it interesting which made you want to move onto the next stage. There were about 4 videos giving you the chance to hear rather than read about the history of the castle. After going round the castle you go outside to the courtyard and can go into various areas the mint, the armoury and down into the Viking part of the castle.",Apr 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,The castle itself is very interesting and the way the exhibits are done using audio visual presentations really adds to the experience.,May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,I have visited countless castles throughout Europe. This was hands down the best laid out and organized. If there on a clear day climb to the top!! Amazing views!!,May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"I thought it would be difficult to find the castle but as it's right on the banks of the river Shannon and as you get fairly near it, it becomes obvious and the signs get better. There is a free car park just 3 minutes walk away. We found it very easily particularly as we drove in via the Dock Road.

I also thought some negative comments on TA about it being ""too renovated"" were unfortunate. The only way you can safely allow thousands of visitors to really see as much of the old structure as possible is to add safety railings, stairwells and an interpretative centre etc. For €13 it was good value (adult ticket), I would like to have the opportunity of a guided tour though, even if it cost a few euros more. There's nothing like an informative human to replace text boards and TV screens.
The exhibition at the beginning (before you get into the castle) is very informative, but a lot of reading there and quite a bit of it is repeated. If you have a strong interest in early irish history there is a lot of information there for you.
Just when my wife muttered ""I thought we were going to see the old castle"" we actually did emerge onto the castle proper, going first through what seeemed to me a 'mocked up foundations' and then onto the main square which is very large and can accommodate a lot of visitors. For a Sunday it was not very busy and we were easily able to access all the towers and rooms within them and there were no queues. I thought the TV screens with the ""interactive"" actors were good, but to be honest I did not stay until the end of any of their narratives. Great views from the towers of the city and the river. I didn't like the modern glass building at all with the gift shop/café and the toilets could have been cleaner. Overall though I was glad I visited and it was worth the trip.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Cool placed to go to for occasional concerts they have on. There is a lovely pub called Katie Daly's across the street from it, nice starting point, or the Locke Bar/ Curraghgower are nearby pubs that are walking distance. In the castle you walk through the shop part- and they have some nice food/tea/coffee available, and outside there is a full concert rig set up, full bar (Dolans') and portaloo's which were clean and reasonable wait time. Warning- it's Limerick so it's liable to rain and/or be cold, so just dress accordingly and you will love your night in the castle. Free parking across the road (around the bend in the road). As night fell, we had a nice view of the fireworks over the river.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Very good information displays , films and interactive features giving a history of the castle and its inhabitants. I learnt a lot. However there’s not a huge amount left of the castle when you’re at the museum. If you have mobility issues it might be difficult to look round the ruins as the stairs are narrow and steep. Nice views on a sunny day from the turrets. You can see more when you cross the river and look back at the castle.",May 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"There's no doubt this is a site which is historically important but the castle is mostly rubble.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"The main reason we stopped at King John's Castle is that one of the people in our group was John, and how could we skip it when we were so close. How lucky we were! The exhibit was easy very informative and well presented. Our group was all adults, but we noticed that everything was presented in a way that it would be interesting to adults and kids. Once through the exhibit area, we arrived in the castle courtyard and we were able to explore different areas of the castle. I believe in busier times (there were just a handful of visitors when we were there), there are people reenacting castle life. There are further displays in the different rooms of the castle, all very well presented. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"King John’s Castle is a stop on most Limerick tours and understandably so. The castle is part original structure, museum with interactive displays which present the history of the area and cafe/gift shop. The exhibits will delight any person interested in history. You have the opportunity to climb a circular staircase into the castle and to its very top, which provides a very nice view of Limerick and the river Shannon. Cafe is small, but with a nice selection of soups, teas, sandwiches and desserts. Very friendly staff here and in the gift shop. Typical gift shop selections, but good souvenir selection. There is a exhibit of Viking era housing found during the excavation around the castle grounds. Most interesting stop. Be sure to wear appropriate shoes for climbing, especially since the stairs themselves are uneven and can be slippery if wet.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,Fun to learn about king Richard the lion hearteds brother from robin hoods tales having built a castle in limerick.

Not much artifact except the castle,Apr 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"Nice visit, though our four year old ran through most of it without allowing us to read much.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,King John’s castle sits on the banks of the river Shannon - on the opposite bank is JJ Bowles pub - the oldest pub in Limerick. The castle has a very good interactive exhibit which tells the history of the castle from the 12th century.,Mar 2018
Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"We visited on a cold and wet afternoon, though by the time the visit ended the sun was out. The entry price is fairly steep. On entering there are a series of exhibitions that are jumbled and unclear and in terms of relevance to this particular castle seem to test the boundaries.

Once clear of this and entering the castle itself, you are left pretty much to your own devices. There's no suggestion at all of a route and no indication of what you are looking at. If its raining you'd better have an umbrella.

On the day we visited, one room was being painted, while in another the audio-visual display was not working at all.

On departure one is obliged to exit through the gift shop, which pretty much destroys the experience - its not even remotely appropriately-themed.

If you've seen any other decent castle in your lifetime, you can skip this one.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"King John's Castle is a large and impressive castle on the edge of Limerick City centre. It is possible to walk there from the shopping centre and easy to find.

There is a really good visitor's centre with displays of how Ireland, Limerick and the castle developed throughout the ages since (and before) the Viking invasion. Lots of the displays are interactive and suitable for children and there is a quiz for the children to fill in with a prize that they can collect in the gift shop.

There is a large cafe and also a pub opposite that caters for visitors to the castle.

I gave it four stars and not five because a few of the displays need a bit of attention - for example there is a cannon game that is missing the cannon balls.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in Limerick City as this is an attraction that can be enjoyed during all weathers.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"Hello, My wife & I are visiting Ireland for two weeks from Portland, OR. We decided on this tour after reading all the great reviews about this company. We booked the trip online and thought the price was great for a day long excursion. The morning of the tour, we were greeted at our hotel stop by a very friendly gentleman named Gerry. Gerry was our tour guide and driver for the day. Gerry was very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. He told us all about the history of the area, the beautiful towns we drove through and where the most interesting spots were that I enjoyed photographing. When we got to Doolin, we easily got our boat tickets from him and proceeded down the way to the dock. The boat crew was efficient and professional in getting us on board quickly and we departed shortly thereafter. It was a short 20 minute voyage to Inis Orr (the first and smallest of the 3 Aran Islands). Once on land, I’d recommend going on the tractor tour with the local guide. He pulled about 8 of us in his rig behind the tractor all over the island showing us the highlights and stopping several times along the way for us to shoot pictures. The cost was $10 Euros per person for the hour long excursion. We had an hour left so we grabbed a snack and a couple of pints before heading back to the boat. We headed by the Cliffs of Moher and then got to cruise by the cliffs closer in and at a much slower speed which helped in taking better photos and video. When we made it back on the bus, Gerry told us more about the area as we drove up to the Moher cliffs visitors area. We had about an hour to roam around and explore as we walked up to the vista points overlooking the ocean. On the way back on the bus, Gerry told us some great jokes and pointed out places that we could stop again for a few minutes to take photos. We were safely back in Galway by 7:00 PM. Overall, we totally though that the experience we had far exceeded our expectations and that Gerry had a lot to do with that. Definitely check out this company to book a tour, request Gerry for your guide and have a most excellent experience. Best, Glen & Kris.

The Wild Atlantic Way is an Irish initiative based on the Atlantic coastline, offering intrepid tourist a varied menu of culture, cuisine and craic. Drombeg stone circle is one of the most visited megalithic sites in Europe and even for a domestique, on a bad day, it is a mere three hour cycle from Cork airport. It lies close to the stunningly beautiful harbour village of Glandore where Michael McWhite one of country's most famous diplomats was born. For those interested in Irish history the Michael Collins museum on an elegant Georgian square in nearby Clonakilty is worthy of a detour. Locals there will modestly tell you that their home was crowned Best town in Europe in 2017.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"We are seekers of authentic local arts and crafts. Especially if we can meet the artist/maker (not the importer/trader). Driving the Wild Atlantic Way near Downings - Donegal, we were thrilled to find Pixalili and interrupt their work. And to see the printer action. We found lots of gifts and 'keepers'. And learned a lot from chatting with artists - so glad we stopped at Pixalili",Dec 2019

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"We drove from the Cliff of Moher in the south to Roundstone in the north. It is spectacular, regardless of the weather. The scenery is ever changing. There are so many places we could have stopped to admire the view. However, be warned that it's easy to underestimate how long it takes to drive since the roads constantly winds and every so often you get stuck behind traffic and it's not always possible to overtake. Also, you can't take bends too fast with young kids, otherwise they'll get travel sick. But if you're on holiday why hurry? Just relax and enjoy the view. If you need to get somewhere fast don't go on the Wild Atlantic way.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"Spent about a week in this area. Many things to do, with breath-taking views. Only disappointment was that our bus tour arrived at the Cliffs amidst a cloud of fog that didn't lift until we were driving out of the parking lot. Had I been on my own, I wouldn't have entered until it was gone. Tour wouldn't return because of driving schedule.
The area has great walking paths that are well marked. As I walked the path near my ancestors lived, I wondered what they were thinking as they looked west (water). I only touched the surface of things to do and see. I hope to return.",Aug 2019
Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"If you're going to Ireland and have the time, this is one of the things you need to see (like Cliffs of Mohr, Ring of Kerry, etc.) We liked this better than the Ring of Kerry because this part of Ireland is less densely populated with fewer cars and tour buses. Spectacular views, cliffs, windswept landscapes, great hiking and photo opportunities are found throughout the drive. so you don't need to follow the entire route along the NW Irish coast. If you like seeing breathtaking natural beauty and spots where you feel you're the only people on the planet, this is something you might regret not doing when your Irish vacation is over.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"The Wild Atlantic (County Clare area recommended!). Site seeing first - then please stay with me for the mention of the most wonderful people and stores!!! We were fortunate to have Mary (a dual citizen with her husband Rich - and home owners with numerous relatives in the area) as our hosts!. Layer your clothing and leave your city shoes behind. The rain is of no consequence - come prepared. It's incredibly clean but practical shoes make sense. We suggest being flexible and plan your days for total rain days (shopping in Doolin or Galway), semi-rain days (castles, Doolin Cave), and the nice weather for the Aran Island/Cliffs of Moher experience. Best meal in the area - Ballinalacken Castle County House & Restaurant - castle tour view amazing - family owned - Declan the best. Most recommended site seeing: enjoy the DOOLIN2ARANFERRIES.COM experience out of Doolin. Eugene and his family are incredible. Safe passage to Aran Islands where you should ask for Eamon (sorry for spelling) the horse carriage tour - he's fantastic (we made the correct choice to forgo the bikes!). Nora up the hill knits wool out of her home shop - you must find her! After Aran Island and the boat tour of the Cliffs we hopped onto the shuttle to the top of the Cliffs and hiked down. There are no words to describe the beauty. No need to do a 2 or 4 hour hike - you can enjoy the Cliffs of Moher from the top. I did enjoy the hike - muddy and challenging but exhilarating! Now onto the Burren - my thought is it's best at blooming season - but still a remarkable exhibit of Mother Nature. Beaches to walk - Fanore and Lahinch. My bucket list included horseback riding on the beach - WOW! - Lisa and Martin of West Clare Equestrian in Doonbeg were so easy to work with considering the weather, etc. - and you can pick up Lahinch on the same day. Gary at the Doolin Caves - WOW - you ROCK! Denise too! Now onto the music: must see 'Blackie' and Eoin O'Neill - playing in the Doolin, Ennistymon or Lisdoonvarna area. Shopping experiences - over the top: Gabrielle at Irish Crafts in Doolin; Maura at Village Crafts - Doolin; Noreen at Doolin Chocolate Shop - A HUGE BRUCE SPRINGSTEIN FAN - Bruce - you should stop by to say Hi to Noreen; Dierdra at the Sweater Shop - Doolin; Sinead & Gary at the Cheese Press in Ennistymon; Appleblossom Thrift Store in Ennistymon - WOW!!!; Jennifer at the Cournerstone Pub in Lahinch. Teresa at Sue's in Lahinch; Han at Allure in Lahinch; Andrew at the Clare Jam Company - still recovering from his father's 70 birthday party weekend - Happy B-day and thank you for the wonderful jams! To everyone we met on the Wild Atlantic - Doolin to be specific: go raibh mile maith agat (thank you a million times!!! - special mention to Gerry and Mary). Hugs to All!!! Pam

It would take several visits to navigate the entire way since there is over 1000 miles with all the twists and turns along the coast.
Don’t be alarmed if there is nasty weather. Some of the best ways to experience this epic drive is when Mother Nature is fierce.
YOU MUST GET OFF THE BUS TO EXPERIENCE THIS!
Please don’t hook up with a tour company that stays on the bus all day never stopping to take photos and visit the locals!

Its a great experience to go with a ferry over the harsh and wild Atlantic Ocean and see this wonderful exciting little Aran Island "" Inisheer"". We rent a bicycle to discover this lovely island by ourselves. Afterwards we went with a ship close to the Cliffs of Moher to see them bottom first. The highlight of the tour was the Cliffs of Moher top, which we have seen afterwards and last. The driver and guide John was great! He was very funny and he just made everything possible that the travel group feels good. He does his job with passion and a lot of experience. Conclusion: We can highly recommend this tour to everyone who visits Galway area!!!

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"If you are in Ireland, the Wide Atlantic Way is a must, A tour is the easiest but driving it is an experience of a lifetime, especially for North Americans as the roads here are narrow - Really narrow! At some points, there is only enough room for one vehicle and lay-bys allow one vehicle to wait while the oncoming vehiicle passes. It can be stressful at times but you do get used to it and the views are worth it.

The markers along the highway have a jig jag symbol with an N or S denoting the direction traveled. This route connects the most beautiful coastlines of Ireland..

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,4.0,"We have been staying in Ballyconneely and using the WAW to get about as well as an experience. The coastal views are stunning and do not disappoint - everything it is cracked up to be. On this stretch in Galway it is mostly bays and deeply indented fiord like inlets. These are of course tidal, and so the appearance at low water is quite different from high water - something you should consider if photography is your thing; much better with some water! It was much more developed than we had expected, with lots of newish bungalows in amongst pretty restored and photogenic derelict cottages scattered all over the landscape. Off season - we went at the end of September - and you will find many of the smaller eating establishments and cafes closed; but still enough open to get that coffee hit when you need it, and a good lunch. If you are in your own or a hire car, do understand that the roads that the WAW uses in places can be quite narrow and twisty, and a little bumpy at times. Places to pull over to stop and admire the views are limited, as are access points to the coast itself. This lack of pull over places makes the job of driving more tiresome and less rewarding than it might be. Your passenger says, Wow, did you see that lovely ....whatever it was? No, is the reply - concentrating on keeping the car on my side of the road!
This lack of pull ins was a real disappointment and so for that reason alone I am giving four not five stars. If you were in a coach if might be different.

However, that part alone is quite stunning and is what you anticipate, when you drive through the Irish countryside. Castles, scenery, landscapes, quaint villages and of course (our final stop) The Cliffs of Moher, are all there to see and admire.
Leaving Galway on the N67, the first stop is Dungaire Castle, for a 10 minute photo opportunity, then the pretty village of Kinvarra. Next is the village of Ballyvaughan and the stark, desolate landscape of the Burren, followed by the villages of Lisdoonvarna and Doolin. Finally for us, the beautiful Cliffs of Moher. Along the way, there is beautiful farmland, coastal views and rolling hills.
The full drive of this part of the Atlantic Way requires 2 - 3 days, to be able to take your time, to appreciate the beauty and to visit each village. Set aside time to do so in your itinerary. A wonderful part of Ireland.

The land was filled with some amazingly beautiful scenery. The Connemara Mountains, dozens of lakes and streams. Stone walls that go on for miles and ascend the mountains, and the Ocean that seems to go on forever.

The WAW travels north & south from this point. heading North via Achill Island, worth a visit, then south to Clifden. Well sign posted, if you visited all POSTS more time needed. Travelled & stayed in Clifden before venturing to Galway, more cosmopolitan than the rural towns. Heading south, plan your route, Lachinch, Cliffs of Mother, coast views, ferry to Tralee.

I feel the cost was very reasonable considering the amount of time that was involved in this excursion. The Cliffs were breathtaking! The Aran Island was beautiful too. I toured around the island on a truck-cart. Other options were horse and carriage, bicycle, or walk. I’m sure I saw more of the island on the cart, but I think it would’ve been nice to walk around and explore on my own. Our guide was Peter and he was very entertaining. He was very good at engaging the passengers and answering questions. He provided us with so much information throughout the drive. He also was very clear about our timelines.

It absolutely changes your mindset on driving and you quickly realize that speed limits are limits and not the minimum driving speed as you have many sharp turns and need to pull to the side and stop when a tour bus goes by. It was our second day of driving and because of it, it made the driving afterwards so much easier. The views are beautiful - gorgeous shorelines, small towns with gorgeous architecture, and lots of small ruins to stop and see if you have time. This is the best way to experience the beauty that Ireland has to offer.

Fundamentally you take this drive for the scenery. The Burren is very different to Connemara, and Sligo very different to Donegal.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"Best done by bike. I was cycling around Connemara for eight days so inevitable ended up on this route many times. There are plenty of helpful information boards at most parking areas, lay-bys and beaches along the route. I say best done by bike as the roads can be very narrow at times, and you will drive round a corner and find a foreign visitor driving on the wrong side, or just as likely, stopped for photographs and blocking the entire road. If you are on the bike you can stop quickly and easily at almost any time without causing any obstruction to other traffic. Worth remembering that this is a working landscape, and people who live here have lives to lead. A little thought for those who live here is a small return to give for their, often, unstinting welcome and generosity.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"After driving from Dublin to Galway for a 3 day relaxing weekend in the second best city in Ireland (my hometown of Cork wins), we went due west to Clifden through the isolation that is the West, beautiful and remote which my Scottish fiancé adored. Following the easy signposts, we then went south back through Galway stopping off at all the tourist spots, taking photos around Ballyvaughan with some French tourists.
We then drove to Dpolin cave for a wonderful trip underground, best pictures taken with the help of a knowledgeable and passionate guide.
A few drinks in Doolin and then to the Cliffs of Mower, stunning.
We stopped off in Limerick for 2 nights to see the iconic Thomand Park.
As we were going to a church wedding in Cork followed by the reception in Killarney, we sidestepped the usual route but continued our journey from Killarney to Baltimore, I can only say it was the most beautiful stunning drive I have ever experienced and I have driven the Garden Route in South Africa, so that is some statement.
The bars, restaurants and locals left a deep impression of my fiancé. Glandore is amazing.
I could eulogise about our 2 week trip for pages and pages but all I would say is, drive or cycle and you won't be disappointed as driving back to Manchester was a let down in comparison ☹️

I am rather glad I wasn’t driving as the roads are very narrow and the bus had to pull over multiple times to let another vehicle, going in the opposite direction, pass. But the scenery is beautiful and of course both the Cliffs and Galway were very much worth seeing.",May 2019

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,3.0,"We were warn d when we left Killarney that some spots o. The road are narrow (even was told single track/single lane in spots) but we found that while narrow you had room to pass bus and large trucks with little issue as long as you SLOW DOWN! As a matter of fact most of the speed limits along the route are 100km/ hour, we topped out at 80 amend in some spots was down to 50. So don’t take this route if you want to speed and make up time, take the motorway instead as you will only risk your life and others. Plenty of quaint small towns and villages along the route to enjoy either as you pass or stop in to explore, and plenty of option s for lunch along the way with prices varied depending where you stop and want to eat.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"A must see area of Ireland. You'll be blown away by the scenery. Top tip if you're driving, drive the ring in an Anti clockwise direction as this is the way the buses go so you won't have any worries with meeting a bus at some of the narrow roads",May 2019
Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"On our way from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher we decided to follow the wildest road via small villages to reach our destination and having also on our right the Atlantic ocean. The scenery was spectacular and compensated us for not taking the easiest road. Too many try the same, so inevitably sometimes you have to stop , the road in specific places can not accommodate two cars from different directions. Still , there are some spots from which you can take some photos and feel the ocean breeze. Till we reach the biggest village Doolin it took us more than 45 minutes to cross this road, (around 35 Klm)
but if you ask me I would certainly do it again

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,4.0,"We drove much of the Wild Atlantic Way over about seven days and enjoyed every part of it.
Were we to do it again we would base ourselves in Killorglin to do the Ring of Kerry and DO NOT MISS the cliffs of Kerry out of Portmagee, and then the Dingle Peninsular before heading up to the Cliffs of Moher, staying in Doolin overnight. Take the extra time to do the Connemara out of Galway as it is also a great drive, both along the coast road and cutting back inland.
Take your time and soak it up. We could have spent twice the time and not be bored, and the driving is pretty easy, although not sure that I would want to do it in peak season.
There is plenty of accommodation available, so don’t be afraid of dealing direct on line to seek a better deal than the booking agencies.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"In April, my wife & I visited Ireland for our 10th Anniversary. While planning our week long driving trip, I hadn’t initially included a drive of the Wild Atlantic Way other than our day trip to visit the Cliffs of Moher. Once we were in Ireland though, I spoke to several locals who INSISTED I drive the “Ring of Kerry” via the Wild Atlantic Way after visiting Blarney Castle and I’m SO GLAD we did!! It took 3-4 hours for us to drive it b/c we stopped often to take pictures as it was the most beautiful and scenic drive we had ever taken. I’ll include some of our pictures w/ this review, but you must understand that the pics don’t come close to doing what we saw justice. If planning an Ireland vacation which includes the West coast, DO NOT skip this route. It’s longer and winds along the coast, but you will NOT regret taking the “longer route”!!

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"For me this travel path is the best full of lovely villages, towns and all sorts of varied history. There are faster ways to get around Ireland and every time I travel in Ireland I see new roads and motorways popping up.I think that is great for locals and business in general but for the tourist it is the last route they should take. Also the great thing about the Wild Atlantic Way is that most of the historical sites are free and as a result maintain their natural beauty. You will never have enough time to see everything in one trip and you hear about new attractions from villagers in every pub - so it is important to do this trip two or even three times so that you miss nothing. One other point of interest is that there is great fishing, sea and inland, and fantastic photo opportunities along the way.

I loved the low stone walls that mark out all the boundaries and the ivy that was wrapped around almost every leafless tree that, with the little ruins and turrets dotted along the way, made everything look that little bit eerie.
The houses and farms that are situated right on the edge of the Atlantic also blew me away. I couldn't stop marveling at how these people wake up every day on the very edge of this wild tumultuous ocean. I am certain that to them it is all very ordinary but not so for me.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"My wife & I spent five days driving up the Wild Atlantic Way from the Dingle Peninsula to Malin Head in Donegal.

Naturally we couldn't follow the WAW all the way in the time we had and we diverted off the signposted route on numerous occasions but in four days we were treated to isolated beaches, stunning cliffs, lush greenery and rugged rock formations. Not to mention the freshest seafood, great beer and fantastic hospitality.

There was so much we missed out on and we only started half way up so we wil have to come back and pick up some of the places we missed and the southern parts we have yet to see.

The only con to this drive is we are used to roads that are much wider and it can get a bit scary. My husband negotiated it very well but if you are a fearful driver, do not attempt this drive, you will be stressed most of the time!

I do love the of the beaten track parts of the journey where many tour buses do not venture.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,1.0,"The 'Wild Atlantic Way' has involved cluttering the west of Ireland with signs and rusty metal branding marks that defile some of the most beautiful parts of the country. Vast amounts of money have been given to advertisers and branding consultants while hospitals are crowded and patients left on trollies.

The pleasure in the west of Ireland is that, up until now, it hasn't been ruined by those who want to reduce everything to rampant commercialism. It has encouraged 'AirB&B' that has destroyed the rental market for local people, led to more and more silly coffee shops, and encouraged restaurants to make false claims about things like 'local salmon'.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"We rented a car in Dublin and drove across to the Wild Atlantic Way. We worked our way down from Galway to Dingle over 5 days and made stops to take in the many sites and landscapes. We enjoyed every minute of our adventure and highly recommend it to anyone considering the same. Our highlights included the Cliffs of Moher (very touristy but so worth it), a pint at Gus O'Connors Pub in Doolin, lunch at the Blue Door Restaurant in Adare, the town of Dingle (can't say enough and worth at least a couple nights stay).
We didn't come close to seeing all the Wild Atlantic Way has to offer over the 5 days we spent driving down the coast.
Roads are narrow and requires a confident driver, especially when sharing them with large tour buses.

He was very polite and funny describing the history and spots we passed along the route to Doolan where we caught the ferry to Inisheer (or the smaller of the Aran Islands). Once there he gave us the options of touring some sites around by horse & pony, bicycle, or tractor pull as we elected. Nice ride through the roads with 11th century ruins, quaint Irish farms with rock walls and a shipwreck on the coast. If you know any phrases in Irish (or gaelic) this is a great place to try speaking with the locals as they were ver happy to see that I knew some of the old language and responded in kind. After lunch in a local tavern we were back on the ferry and cruised under the Cliffs of Moore. Upon arriving back on the mainland we were back on the bus and then uptown the visitors center for the cliffs to observe the beauty there before the return to Galway.

Mayo's southern coast was difficult to see from the road and we had to drive out onto the coast to appreciate the views, most were worth exploring. The Cliffs of Moher were busier than we would have liked but definitely worth the crowds.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"A lot of travelers from the normal world (hahaha) are intimidated by driving on the ""wrong side"" of the road. Factor into that the very, very, VERY narrow roads (often times one lane), the omnipresent tour buses sharing the very, very, VERY narrow roads and you don't just have a drive, you have an adventure.

That being said, this drive is absolutely BRILLIANT! The scenery is jaw-dropping, and every corner reveals another spectacular view. Drivers are courteous, as we're all sharing roads that were constructed originally for horse and wagon. There are no shoulders; there are walls. And by walls, I mean they vary from three feet tall to six feet of solid rock, or solid rock overgrown with briar. But still...

Every bend reveals another spectacular view, or interesting side road that takes you down to the ocean and small villages, working boats and working farms. The scenery is overwhelming, and the people are universally friendly (well, they're Irish, aren't they?).

If you REALLY want to enjoy the road, I mean REALLY enjoy the road, rent a car with manual transmission. It's absolute heaven on earth.

We would recommend the tour to everybody who is interested in combining one of the 3 Aran Islands with the Cliffs. Inisheer may be the smallest, but it is a nice island to explore and the locals are very friendly. Especially,when you do not only want to walk along the Cliffs but if you also want to see them from the sea, the tour is perfect. The view is absolutely fabulous.
All the best from Germany!

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"The Wild Atlantic Way is the coastline route along Western Irelands coast, we explored it around the Galway Bay area and had a lovely time. Galway itself is a good base to explore from, Salthill is the nearby seaside town with some lovely views and a long promenade with several beaches. There are many opportunities to drive around getting some spectacular views of the coast, but obviously you will need to explore the Cliffs of Moher at some point. The main Visitor Centre offers parking and access to the clifftop walk but it is rather expensive to park there, best bet is find another place to park up and explore from there. There are always boat trips you can go on and explore the cliffs from below, this can give you a totally different perspective on the cliffs and give you a better idea of the size and grandeur of them.
Wherever you decide to go I'm sure you will find something to make you say WoW!

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"The Wild Atlantic way is 2,500km long and I’d recommend that you visit their website to help you decide which part you’d like to explore.

The route runs through Galway, Donegal, Sligo , Clare , Kerry, Mayo and Cork.

There are so many activities - walking the cliffs, beaches and headlands.... biking the greenway, plus kayaking & surfing along this incredible coast line.

I’ve just returned from visiting a section of the Mayo coastline and it was amazing.

(Roads are well surfaced so makes travel easy. )

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"We drove the WAW during our return trip to Ireland. On this trip, we took our time driving the coastal route and stopping along the way for pictures and restaurants to visit. When we stopped at a restaurant, both locals and owners were interested in where we are from. Very friendly people we have met along our way.",Sep 2018
Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"This was an excellent experience! My husband and I are in Ireland for our 1-year wedding anniversary, and while in Galway, decided to do a tour out to the Islands and Cliffs of Moher for a day. We picked up a brochure in our hotel and booked online (booking was super easy and the price is well worth it). They offered pick up service at 8:45am the next morning from the front door of our hotel, and we enjoyed a very scenic bus ride out of Galway out to the island ferry. The ferry ride is included with your tour booking and only takes 15 minutes! Once on the island, we opted for a horse & buggy ride around the island with Tom and his beautiful horse Benji. It was beautiful and informative, and we had a blast seeing the island. We stopped for lunch and a whiskey in the local bar on the island, then were back on the ferry for a tour underneath the Cliffs of Moher and back to the mainland. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. Having done both the water view and the top view of the Cliffs, I have to say that the boat ride is really an exceptional way to see the magnitude and beauty of the Cliffs of Moher. The tour also includes entry to the Cliffs of Moher park portion, and after a quick bus ride from the ferry dock to the top of the Cliffs, we were able to walk around the top of the Cliffs along the beautiful paved trails. We also highly recommend the Americano from inside the visitors center :)
Our tour guide and driver, John, was an absolute blast! He is funny and informative and very helpful if you have any questions about the islands, Cliffs, or really any part of your Ireland itinerary.
We can not recommend this tour enough - it was a beautiful, memorable day for us.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"I cannot say enough great things about the Wild Atlantic Way. Between the friendly people, delicious food along our roadtrip, and the most gorgeous views I've ever seen, Ireland is now officially my favorite country that my husband and I have visited thus far (That being said, my husband and I have been to only 10 European countries). We started in Galway, walked around the Cliffs of Moher (A MUST SEE... I was honestly blown away), staying in Dingle, driving Slea Head scenic route (from what I've heard from locals is actually better than the Ring of Kerry, not as crowded with tourists and only takes about 2.5 hours to drive vs. the half-day drive doing the Ring of Kerry). We stopped in Kinsale for dinner and a stroll (absolutely adorable and colorful quaint town) and ended that evening in a cute and comfortable ""farmhouse experience"" Airbnb in Ballymore, 15 minutes away from Cobh (pronounced ""Cove"")(the last port Titanic left before she sunk). Would stay in Cobh if we ever get a chance to go back. It was unique town. We ended our trip in Dublin; such a fun city. There is something so Unique and different about each town. If I had to do it over again, I would have added a stay in Kinsale. It was just so cute and colorful!) I would go back again and again even though there is so much more out there in this world to see. Such a lovely, beautiful country.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,1.0,"A marketing exercise very badly executed. Our once beautiful coastal route along the West of Ireland is now ruined with hideous and excessive roadsignage along it's entire length. In many locations, over sized signs are plonked right in the middle of what were once spectacular views.(and many are incorrectly labelled for the locations!) Totally inappropriate tall rusty marker posts have sprung up everywhere adding more clutter to spoil the landscape. There is virtually no infrastructure to cater for the increased volume of traffic. The original roads are not big or safe enough to cater for the masses of coaches that use them. Many of the few parking areas outside of the villages are rough and in very dangerous locations.Many of the car parks have overhead barriers preventing larger vehicles from using them and there are virtually no toilet facilities or waste collection points. The once spectacular beauty of this Atlantic coastal drive has been enormously devalued by this ghastly inappropriate marketing exercise.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"The Wild Atlantic Way covers the entire West Coast of Ireland. At 2,500km long it is a huge trip, covering varied scenery. The roads are frequently narrow and bumpy, although I found the signs quite good. Unless you have unlimited time, I personally recommend taking part of the drive and stopping frequently to take in the breathtaking scenery. The website link on Tripadvisor breaks the route into 6 areas, each with their own beauty. I have covered different parts in the past, but on this occasion drove through some of the area from The Cliffs of Moher to Clifden. That included places such as Roundstone, Dog’s Bay and The Burren. I loved all of them. Like all of Ireland the weather can be a challenge. The term Wild is an apt description, so expect rain and wind - and hopefully you won’t have mist and low cloud to spoil the views.
