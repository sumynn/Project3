Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The Jameson Experience started as soon as we were entering the Distillery. We loved the interior how they managed old with new elements. Because we came a little earlier we enjoyed the included drinks before the tour and were even allowed to bring them with out on the tour - so no rush and need to finish them quickly!
The tour itself is very informativ; the history and making of Jamesons is presented in a multimedial way. Due to our highly entertaining guide Cilian it really was an experience. The tasting at the end felt as a little game/quiz show - we liked it a lot!
What a pity, we could not tip him by card!

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,"Venue and bar options were great. Bar man on arrival was friendly and made 2 banging cocktails. We weren't directed where to go for the tour on arrival , meaning we were made to run downstairs to check in when the tour was about to start. The tour itself was very insightful but Erin the tour guide was very impatient and frequently said it was her last tour of the day , meaning she rushed through it and didn't allow people to enjoy or ask questions. Felt like being at school being told off by a teacher. Delivery very robotic and not engaging as it could have been. After the tour ended we went to get our free jamesons drink at the grog bar and when we engaged in conversation with the bar man he replied with 'I should have been home 30 minutes ago' , again making us feel unwelcome. I wanted to buy quite alot of merchandise from the shop , when I returned from the toilet after the tour the shop was closed and the bar too. We were not informed of this on arrival or by the tour guide. Pretty disappointing .

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"The cocktail making class was fantastic. We made a couple drinks and had a great time learning a little about Jameson. This place is 1,000 better than Guinness. After your tour or class you can enjoy some Jameson at the bar. I highly recommend doing this and skipping Guinness.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,We chose the cocktail making class at Jameson Distillery and absolutely loved the small group experience. We made three different cocktails and were able to stay in the bar for an extra 1.5 hours after the one hour formal class. Our teacher was so knowledgeable and fun to be around! We also enjoyed getting to know the other couples in class with us. This was a unique and fun way to learn about whiskey and Jameson!,Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"We had the best time in Jameson's Distillery. It was a perfect present for my hubby's birthday. Kayleigh who was a guide for our tour was excellent, fun and told the story perfectly. Very knowledgeable and interesting.
Later on we did the cocktail masterclass with Ciaran who is absolutely nuts and we had an absolute blast! And we loved every second of it. All the staff members were friendly and made our tour very enjoyable. Definitely coming back to bring more friends to enjoy this fun expirience. Thank you",Oct 2021

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,the tour guide does it only in english with irish accent not always obvious for foreigners. but it was interesting and very well done,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.0,"The tour was interesting, quite short, but each of the 3 rooms offered something interesting. Liked the fact that you get to taste 3 types of whiskey, would have liked 2-3 extra minutes though to sip them. You get a free drink at the end, but they also have cocktails should you wish to spend some more time there, as it's a nice bar.

Overall we enjoyed it and would recommend it, but if you can choose only one tour for alcoholic beverages in Dublin, I'd go for the Guinness one.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,Even though we knew the original distillery was closed and moved to Cork we thought that the location would be more representative of an old distillery and offer more insight into the workings of a distillery. It was mostly a bar with a store. The tour was below average in my opinion and rather costly (I've been to others). I will say the staff was quite helpful and courteous.,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Jameson's whisky is smoother because it's triple distilled. Scotch whisky has a peaty taste, whereas Jameson's is very smooth and pure. Scotch, if you do a compatative tasting, tastes a bit like cardboard compared to Irish whiskey. The Bow St Distillery is a good place for a tasting, but the whiskey is distilled in County Cork.",Jul 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This was a fun tour. Naill was our tour guide. He was funny, educational, knowledgeable and helpful. I'm not a Whiskey drinker, but I now love Jameson. The staff in the pub, were very helpful and friendly. They also showed us how to make cocktails with Jameson.",Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"You can't go to Dublin and not visit the Jameson distillery. We had no reservations or plans to explore the distillery itself so just went straight to the bar (through the gift shop and after buying a nice warm jacket of couse). My wife had one of their cocktails while I tried the ""family tasting"" menu. You can't go wrong with ordering pretty much anything on their menu.

We both enjoyed our drinks, walked around the place to take a few pics and left with his smiles on our face. Would absolutely recommend to visit if you're in the area.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This was somewhat low key and quite refreshing after Guinness tour. We had a small group, get tickets ahead of visit, with comparative whiskey tasting as part of the tour.",Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,Kayleigh provided a bright and cheery experience that we thoroughly enjoyed! The facility is really well restored and full of interest.,Oct 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,3.0,You will learn the history of Jameson and hear how whiskey is made but only by viewing videos. Skip the tourand go straight to the bar for a drink. That's why you came anyway.,Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Learned a lot about John Jameson and the process of making the whiskey. Aiofe was our guide and she was lots of fun and very knowledgeable. Added the cask draw, was well worth it to see the cask room and taste a draw directly from the barrel. Would recommend to anyone who has not seen it. The complimentary drinks weren't bad either.",Sep 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Great tour and great place.

The decor and the layout of the distiliery is brilliant. Modern, clean, warm and inviting. Bow st and Jamesons certainly got everything right here.

Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and the latest tech used to help with the tour is very interesting.

It's a whiskey lovers dream. Even if youre not a whiskey person the tour and building is a good way to spend an hour.

Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,Erin our tour guide was the bomb.com. she was so knowledgeable on Jameson whiskey put my Irish whiskey knowledge to shame and I know alot.

Awesome staff, tasty whiskey and wonderful atmosphere",Jul 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Irish whiskey was once the most popular whiskey in the world; now it is undergoing a revival. It's not hard to understand the appeal of Irish whiskey -- it's silky smooth. Scotch, on the otherhand, has a peaty, burned taste that some people find unpleasant. By the way, Jameson's whiskey is now distilled in County Cork, in the south-east on the island.",Jun 2021
Ireland,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"Excellent experience, staff very friendly and certainly knew their stuff Erica was the perfect host with good chats, home mixing tips and the best whiskey sours and old fashioned we've had. 100% would reccomend to a friend.",May 2021
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,3.0,"One advice I would like to give you: make sure you eat something before engaging in the taste or you will end up spoiling the following hours, certainly if you are walking in a group. Interesting activity and well explained. The taste is somewhat compulsory after en during the listening.",Oct 2021
Ireland,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.0,"We took the simple tour and it was excellent. I believe they do different types of tour including a more premium tour,Malm√∂, worth noting that they do have live music on some evenings.",Jun 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Extremely well prepared for CoVid travelers. One way trails are in place. There are also many, really good, porto-sans (outside toilets) that use a flush valve and have tissue and sanitizer in them. Thank you for that.

We visited twice. Once, when arriving in the area later in the day, for the short yellow loop, and then again the next morning for the combined red and blue Diamond loop. Very impressed with the maintenance of the trails, especially after a tremendous downpour two days earlier. The views along the trail change constantly as one reaches higher level. We found it very enjoyable.

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"A fabulous National Park, we did the blue loop which is very well signposted and the signs explain all the walking trails, we would have liked to have done the red loop but we ran out of time but we will be back, The Playground could do with an upgrade, apart from that the place was lovely",Aug 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,Well worth a visit---great scenery. Bring rain gear and good footwear. Kids loved it. Will return again.,Aug 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"I came on a rainy morning and by the time I got to the top of Diamond Hill, I was soaked and couldn't see a thing. Back at the bottom the visitor center was closed but the cafe open (outdoor seating but undercover). As I finished my coffee, the rain stopped and I set off for a second time . This time, the midges were out but they disappeared higher up. The views were beautiful and the hill really isn't as tough as it looks. The path has been made superbly. A great day out.",Aug 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,Three different walks to choose from and we went 2 days in a row to try another path. Excellent car park facilities. Lovely cafe in the courtyard. Well worth a visit.,Jul 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Connemara National Park is amazing, just stunning scenery. It's free to enter and has a big car park with toilets. Maps show you 4 coloured walks. The green is a forest walk, the yellow is an easy one around the animal paddocks and lower meadows. The blue walk goes up the lower slopes of Diamond Hill and the red one ascends to the top.
I cannot understate the beauty of the views all along the coast.
The surface is a mixture of gravel paths, wooden boardwalks and stone slabs. It is a tough ascent but really well worth it. If you have good runners and reasonable fitness you'll do it no problem, but you'll be tired! Well worth it though. Bring plenty of water though!

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,"Something we've been planning forever. Finally, ticked it off the list today. The one way Covid system is easy to follow and helps that everyone is going in the one direction particularly on the narrow bits. Despite the constant moaning and complaining from teenage daughters most of the way up, they were delighted with the views and accomplishment when we got to the top. They're even talking about doing this again, can't get a better recommendation than that.",Jul 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,My friends and I visited the park on a day trip to Connemara and went early in the morning to avoid the midday sun which was a good call as climbing Diamond Hill was pretty tough for us inexperienced hikers. The trail was well mapped out and the views from the top made it all worth it. I would recommend bringing plenty of water and some kind of insect repellent as the midges were out in force!,Jul 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,"I would recommend this for anyone in the area. With three looped trails, the longest of which brings you to the top of Diamond Hill and some excellant views, the park is ideal for individuals, families and dogs!! I didn't need the centres facilities on this visit. The only comment I have is that there are no bins in the car park (only at the visitor centre) as I found out on my departure.",Jul 2021
Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,5.0,Highly recommend doing the Diamond Hill Loop. The views at the top are outstanding! The little cafe within the centre also had some lovely food and great customer service.,Jul 2021

Ireland,Connemara National Park & Visitor Centre,4.0,Beautiful walk and congratulations to the staff for all the work they have done.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"This excellent museum gives a comprehensive overview of emigration from Ireland over hundreds of years.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,2.0,"The exhibition was very much style over substance. Lots of stories of people bit lacking in historical context, and really oversimplified. Not a patch on he GPO or Kilmainham Gaol. Maybe good for kids but not worth the entrance fee for adults.",Oct 2021

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.0,"We arrived to find that the museum was quite so we could take our time. The tour requires a lot of reading and interacting if you want to take in the whole experience.
Covid conditions were as good as they could be with sterilising hand rub at every stage.
Unfortunately we were over run by a large group of students who didn't appear very interested in the Irish history but more so in their attempts to damage the stamps provided to log the adventure.
This put a bit of a dampener on our experience for the 15 minutes our so that they were around us.
The tour gave us a great pride in being Irish and showed us a lot we didn't know about the many people who have had to or have chosen to leave our home shores. To all those and your decendents, This Will Always Be Your Home. N√≠l aon tinte√°n mar do thinte√°n f√©in

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,Great experience. Fun interactive museum for all ages. I enjoyed the passport routine and the stories.,Jul 2021
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"We loved the interactive nature of this museum. I was worried with Covid precautions that many things would be off limit. But there was continuous cleaning of surfaces by staff and ample hand sanitizer available. We had rooms that we enjoyed more than others of course, but our favorites were the arts and science rooms showcasing many things that we didn't realize were attributable to Irish citizens or Irish immigrants to many countries.
It was our first full day of a three week trip (long anticipated) and it was the perfect introduction. We were there on a week day right at opening time, and there were several school groups that had been dropped off and were generally acting like the 15 year old ""eejits"" that we remember being at that time of our lives. Luckily they passed by quickly so we could take our time and enjoy ourselves.
I don't know why, but I was surprised to find the place located in a shopping mall, but that also gave us the opportunity to lunch after our three hour visit. We are in our mid 60's, an age group often not comfortable with multiple forms of digital activity going on all around us, but it was very pleasant. I can see that it would agitate folks on the autism spectrum and be a problem for those with seizure disorders as there are many flashing lights.
I did register one of my Irish ancestors at the end of the visit and enjoyed that personal touch very much because I now appreciated what he had to do to make it to the United States and the difficulties he possibly encountered when arriving there.

I am not at all Irish, but I was moved and impressed.",Oct 2021
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,2.0,"EPIC IS NOT A MUSEUM. A museum is somewhere where objects and artefacts are displayed. Epic has ONE display case showing a convicts jacket, a brick, and a pair of handcuffs and that's it.

EPIC is a series of rooms showing 3-5 minute video clips on loop. I found the first couple of rooms interesting where it was about 6 particular migrants and their stories but after that it became quite boring and I think younger children would find the whole thing quiet boring.

If you've already been through the Irish education system, you're not going to learn anything new at EPIC.

At ‚Ç¨16.50 it is wayyyyy overpriced. For me, it was not worth ‚Ç¨6.50, let alone ‚Ç¨16.50. There are much better things to see and do in Dublin for less.

I wish I knew how to find that gentleman and thank him. This museum SPARKLES in cleanliness and liveliness and organization and depth of information. The staff was diligent and courteous and helpful. A lucky conversation with a good cab driver saved me from missing the boat. The Jeannie Johnston was a beauty to behold even though Covid safety prevented boarding that week, this is the kind place you would visit every time you're in town, so I'll have another chance.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,2.0,"The museum was quite disappointing. It portrayed a very shallow and sanitized view of history. There were mentions of why people emigrated specifically: Famine, conflict, etc, but it was somewhat glossed over and seemingly downplayed the horrors that many emigrants were escaping from. There‚Äôs so much interesting things that they completely missed: why not have a section on how Irish people at that time fit into the racial views of the cultures of the regions that they immigrated to. There‚Äôs also a discussion to be had on assimilation into other countries and the definition of ‚ÄúIrishness‚Äù, for example. Instead, it seemed to just blindly praise the achievements of Irish-descended people in various areas. I get that this is supposed to be an overview, but it‚Äôs a rather poor one.
Also, the exhibits themselves were boring. The most interactive exhibits were ‚ÄúClick here to read this,‚Äù and that‚Äôs about it. Not a ton of artifacts or physical things either (considering the many millions of people that emigrated, it shouldn‚Äôt be hard to find at least a few more).

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,1.0,"Very interesting exhibit which missed an opportunity to educate the visitors, in more depth, in the key reasons people emigrated (the wars, the famine, etc). These were touched briefly and then the theme of the exhibit overwhelmingly became about the Irish trying to claim any and every achievement/contribution to the world by attempting ancestral connections to everyone. Got an Irish great-great-grandfather...they'll claim your achievements. If you have coffee with an Irish person a few minutes before achieving a Nobel prize...they'll probably try claim that too. A bit unnecessary and taken too far. So much to celebrate without stretching it...",Sep 2021

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"Two colleagues who had only met on zoom for a year met in person last Saturday. How to fill a day for people who had never met in real life was the challenge. The solution was to bring these colleagues to EPIC, a space where they could absorb a taste of Ireland and the impact our country has had around the globe. Afterwards, we walked along the banks of the Liffey and chatted about the various rooms we had visited with our EPIC passports - which ones they liked best, which ones they had already heard of (Riverdance was a favourite) and which ones they would like to learn more about in the future. And so the conversation continued over dinner and the next day. Thanks EPIC for giving us so much material to fill a weekend and a lifetime. They'll be back!

The latter half focuses more on Ireland‚Äôs influence ‚Äî also a tear jerker if your think too much about how incredible it is that one small island could spread its roots so far.

Josh was one of the employees on shift the day we went and he had a great amount of knowledge and was very interesting to listen to! He was very friendly and helpful.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,If you're into history and love an inactive experience there isn't anything that compares to the Irish Emigration Museum,Jul 2021
Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"I booked Epic for myself,my Dad, niece (9) & nephew (7) ;all four of us had a fantastic time.The museum is divided into 20 rooms spanning from beginning of Irish emigration to modern day and how as a people we have spanned the globe and had an impact on so many other countries and societies.
Belief,Playing the World, Achieving Infamy and Music&Dance were favourite rooms as they were super interactive. Was fun to be in the stands at a sorts match and take a photo, and stand and be measured as one of the Good, the Bad and the Irish. You have to do the front and side profile prisoner photo.
The Riverdance room was great, I recorded my niece, nephew and even my Dad as they repeatedly followed the dance steps.
Everyone gets a souvenir passport that they use to follow the museum tour. My nephew really loved stamping it in each room. It made it even more fun.
From arriving to leaving the staff were super. Greeted with warmth, then as we did the tour, a staff member popped up in some areas to tell small facts and give interesting information. They were all brilliant with the kids.
Staff were friendly and all made the experience even better.
We went on a Saturday afternoon, and parked nearby putting money in a meter. We spent 2 busy hours, but we could easily have stayed longer.
The museum has a kids go free offer when I booked, which made it even more affordable than usual. I would have paid the price of the kids tickets, well worth the money.
All the health and safety measures that Epic has in place gave peace of mind. We all felt safe and as we were there on a really sunny day, we had place almost entirely to ourselves. I have no doubt that with more people it would still have been comfortable. There are lots of machines and screens available throughout the museum which meant everyone could participate and do their own thing, follow
What interested them most.
Overall we had a wonderful day, learned loads and had a good laugh and quality time as a family.
Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone; everyone whether Irish native, resident or tourist should visit. There is something for everyone.
We will definitely be back.
Thanks Epic for a truly memorable experience

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"A lack of time at the present moment will not let me write more than a quick note. In fact my time at EPIC was rather limited too - it was not possible to give full justice to all the reading and lingering as I had a train booking time to keep an eye on. Purely by chance, having wandered along streets from a work meeting in that unfamiliar area near the quays, and thus vaguely towards my return journey that Monday, I happened across the place. It had been a disappointment to remember earlier that museums in the city are usually closed - and that being the only day I could travel from the midlands, after many, many months of travel restrictions. Thirst on that very hot afternoon and need of a rest from carrying my increasingly heavy baggage, I welcomed what looked like something 'caf√©-ish'. When it dawned on me that the location was a MUSEUM which COULD be visited - delight! This museum I had had seen a few adverts for and was in the back of my mind to visit was open, and with just about enough time to get an impression of it all, for a return in the future. There are many layers to the experience within the galleries. Some visually simple but adequate sets, and some media displays and interactive effects which are very clever and amusing, and also, many details to glimpse. So much information unfolded into a fascinating story of Irish emigration. I felt some surprise when I began to realize that it wasn't just 'their story' but in those broader sweeps within the exhibition, were connections with my own family. Those emotional responses crept up on me. As an artist, and former exhibition designer (heavens, not on this scale!) I appreciated the visual, the thorough research and the very balanced historical text. Of old, I know this is always a tough task where Irish history is concerned, which a fellow artist and I have experienced recently with our Famous & Notables of Birr Trail. On some point, someone is always going to express anger about something, no matter how balanced, accurate and also informative we have tried to be. Righto, that's it - must dash but will complete with these final comments: I left with a tear in my eye, a welling in my heart, and there have been warm recommendations on my lips since. Looking forward to seeing it all again and properly, with my husband and perhaps my niece and nephew.

Ireland,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,5.0,"My wife and I visited on a wet sunday in May, we had intended to browse through in an hour but very quickly became engrossed! The content is very broad, easily digestible, smartly presented and thoroughly convincing. We have both been to Ellis Island in NY in the past and this really manages to complete the story, to use modern idiom, it is the Origin Story.
However, the real twist in the tail is that this is not just about the Famine, emmigration continues to the present day and that too is captured.
Excellent way to spend an afternoon, I highly recommend it.",May 2021

He also has a great sense of humor which made the tour extra enjoyable.

Ireland,Spike Island,3.0,"Given the positive review for Spike Island tours, I was very disappointed by the Spookfest event. We have been to other Halloween events with our 6 and 2 year olds that were so much better, including free events. There were times on Spike Island that I wondered if the Halloween event was even on it was so minimal. Even the presence of staff was minimal apart from the lovely girl who walked us up from the boat. For a charge of ‚Ç¨16per head including the same charge for babies, the effort it takes to get there with young kids, and the expectation of having lots of Halloween fun I would have expected more effort on the part of Spike island organisers. My recommendation- Dont waste your time on this one for Halloween '21! There is a fantastic opportunity for it to be great if much more thought and effort was made and IF this happened we might give it a second chance.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"John G is an excellent tour guide; very good, clear, informative, humorous delivery of knowledge and facts. Continuously holds one's attention throughout the 40 mins. Would loved to have done the walk around the island but ran out of time, so on our next trip to Spike, will manage time better!!
Exhibitions excellently displayed and the leaflet given at the kiosk a great help on finding our way around.
We also hope that a TOTAL restoration of the historical Island takes place and that the venue becomes the No 1 place to 'must see' in Munster and Ireland!!
All in all, a great day out.

We met our tour guide as soon as we stepped of the boat, to be honest he was fascinating! Actually quite disappointed he couldn't walk us all around the place! So thank you Peter! Also bought the book on his recommendation and it's a great read!
There is one down side though,in our group we had 2 very mature ladies üôà so between our speed of walking and having to have a cup of tea we didn't get to see much after the collection of machinery. Next time we will have to leave the old birds at home üòÇ. Thank you again to peter",Oct 2021

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Well worth a visit.
Short boat journey from Cobh, very well protected inlet so nice and calm journey.
We did the 40 min tour with the guide when we got off the boat, its optional but I think worth doing if its your 1st visit.
This includes so good stories and some recent and less recent Irish history.
We did the walk around the outside of the fort, great view of harbor.
There is also a coffee shop if lots of walking and history isn't your thing.
They do take away so you could enjoy the harbor views (anfd Cobh) from inside the fort with a nice hot drink and some cake.
We didn't get around to doing the walk around the full Island but we are planning a return visit at some point and will make sure to do that but and see more of the old houses.

This place has so much history, and so many strains of history too. If you have an army or military interest this is an amazing day, war of independence and prison and daily life.

Great experience, truly so much to explore, we had 3.5 hours on the island and still ended up pressed for time.

Take Karls advice on where to start self exploring as 3 hours is not enough to read everything but his route you get to see all the island, we rushed back for the boat. the island is steeped in history, we will have another trip back as it is impossible to take it all in.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Visited here recently with our family. We took the guided tour at the start which was delivered by Karl. He was very enthusiastic and seemed genuinely interested in what he was doing. He was very knowledgeable and answered every question that was thrown his way‚Ä¶ even the ones asked by my 5 year old daughter! I will say that I would have liked the guided tour to have followed on inside the walls. There are plaques and information points around the place but I personally would have preferred to have a guide. I can appreciate with Covid going on how this might not be possible so maybe that‚Äôs an idea for the future.

As for the island itself, it‚Äôs steeped in history and you can sense it as you go about. It‚Äôs got this weird ominous type charm to it. You know some bad stuff has happened around here and yet you can‚Äôt help but be intrigued and interested in it. I‚Äôm not sure if the older fenced off buildings will be opened up at some point but if they were, I‚Äôd go back just to go in to them. I‚Äôd also like to see one or two of the houses in the village be made safe so people could enter them and look around. Kind of made ‚Äúperiod correct‚Äù. With the guided tour aside, I‚Äôd also like to see a more interactive experience. Maybe some people in period costumes, Gardai, military etc etc. being in character. Again, that‚Äôs just my personal preference.

Overall it was really enjoyable and well worth the money. If you‚Äôre down that way, give it a look!

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"What a spectacular Cork attraction. No.1 in my book.
Our day out started with sunshine in colourful Cobh, we couldn't have asked for a better day.
The ferry (all travellers were wearing masks) was smooth sailing all the way, even bringing us past Haulbowline Island. We spotted a seal in the water as we docked. 2 very friendly guides met us and walked us up to the gate,while telling us so many fantastic stories about the people living there years ago. They were hugely knowledgeable and very friendly and funny.
Food in the cafe was perfect. Seating and all areas spotless. Incredible views of Cork Harbour from the surrounding walls. Lots of nooks and crannies for kids and adults to explore. Water around the island was crystal clear. Cork is such a stunning place.
Overall it was one of the best days out we've ever had.
Our only complaint....we didn't stay long enough.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Really enjoyed our time on spike island. There is lots to see and explore. It‚Äôs advisable to take the optional 40 tour guide at start to get a real history of the island. The island is full of history and there is lots to take in even though you are there for 3.5 hours. The cells and military room are fantastic as well as seeing all the artefacts and becoming familiar with the inmates that once stayed there and the conditions they were kept in. On the whole a fantastic site and experience and would highly recommend it.
But !!! even though it is a historical site there is lots of unsightly dereliction on about half the site and lots of horrible chain link fence, hoarding and barriers scattered about which does nothing for the kerb appeal. It would be nice to see these buildings tidied up just on the outside and nice barriers erected, basically make a feature out of their derelict state. It‚Äôs a terrible shame on how bad the village is and terrible to see some of the old buildings been used to store site rubbish.

On the whole a great experience but lots more potential available.

We decided to go to the cafe there to dry off and get ourselves a hot drink.my daughter came back,she is 13 yrs old, from ordering a hot drink and said the lady behind the counter was so rude to her. We were not even there 30 mins and the staff were telling us it was closing and literally shouting telling everyone we had to leave as they were banging chairs and cleaning around us, they we're not far from lifting the chairs from under us. There was no notice of time of closing displayed anywhere and if it was close to closing time they should not have served us and i definitely would not have spent my money there. Otherwise everything else about the island was brilliant.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"If you mentioned spike Island to me 3 weeks ago, I would have responded ""what is that?"" Absolutely Well worth it to come see and hear about this piece of Irish history amd heritage. It's even more worth it for you to stay and take the 40min guided tour that's optional.

Our guide Rob was whitty and very knowledgeable of the history of spike Island and was open to any questions you wanted to ask with a few jokes here and, I would nearly go see it again.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Our day trip to Spike Island exceeded all expectations. From the moment that we were greeted on the pier by our knowledgeable guide Jessie we knew we were in for a great day!! We learned about Irish history and Cork harbour and the trade routes it offered, and we were enthralled by the stories about the heritage of Spike Island.

Jessie‚Äôs tour was brilliant. She is interactive, funny, and extremely well informed. She kept the tour interesting and engaging for all age groups, whilst also providing factual information - and she was more than capable of answering all questions that were asked of her!

The facilities on the island are all very well kept, clean and easy to find. The artefacts are very cool and the staff were all friendly and happy to help! The boat ride to the island was an added bonus and definitely provides some extra excitement for those with young children.

Although it cannot be totally attributed to the island management, we had beautiful blue skies all day and these served as the backdrop for the stunning views of Cobh and the mouth of Cork harbour from Bastion 3.

However, we all agree that the true gem of the day was our tour guide Jessie - she provided us with an insight into what life would have been like on the island and in the prison when it was running, and kept us entertained all day!! Thank you Jessie for the brilliant tour - we will definitely recommend your tour and a visit to Spike Island to our friends and family, and we would definitely hope to return soon!!

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Well worth visiting Spike Islands if you're anywhere near Cork City. Excellent guided tour by John G and the War of Independence museum among the highlights. You can cover a lot in the 3 hrs but probably worth spending longer to see everything,Aug 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Amazing experience, the history and stories of the island was really interesting, our tour guide Jessie was absolutely amazing, told history in great detail and made it really fun for adults and children.
The only thing I would recommend is to bring your own lunch with you, as took us 1hour to que for food, very expensive and not alot of selection and also took an hour off our time that we could have been exploring the island, we missed a few areas because of this which was disappointing as it takes the 3.5 hours to see it all.
You don't have to stay with tour guide but we did as we wanted to hear all the information, tour guide only takes 1hour.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,This is a great day out - it was a challenging day weather wise but nothing could take from this fascinating trip. Our guide Peter explained some of the history and related stories very well and gave a great introduction.

We didn't get to see everything but will definitely go back to see the rest, kids loved it, wife loved it, i loved it.

There is quite a trek to the fortress at the top so if you've got kids make sure they have walking shoes on and them buggys have good brakes for your stops along the way.

Enjoyable day for all the family of all ages and the knowledge of the staff is absolutely fantastic.

The tour is about 3 to 3.5 hours but we stopped for breaks along the way for food etc so this is why we didnt see everything.

Definitely a must see and well managed by all the team from the mainland in Cobh to the island itself.

The boat was full. The queue was not managed for covid. A family were in the queue and additional members joined them. As the numbers swelled the gap between them and other people disappeared but the staff ignored the congestion. During the trip all the seats were occupied. People were very close. One of the crew went through the cabin with no mask on and the other wore his mask with his nose out all the time. (see photo) On the island things were different. Good Covid management generally. Excellent guide. Good coffee. Suitable for all ages. Good displays. Good views. Amazing weather the day we visited.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Only downside was we Didnt have enough time to explore the island outside of the prison could have done with another hour.

Bring a light snack or eat at the cafe... plenty of area to picnic.

Advise a tour guide as you learn so much about the island and cobh itself.

Our guide was Donal. Very energetic young man with alot of knowledge to share and kick started our tour with great energy.

A must visit.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Spike island did not disappoint! A truly historical and thought provoking spot. The day trip started with a 10 minute ferry ride across from Kennedy pier and on arrival, we were greeted by the wonderful tour guide Jessie. She was very informative and helped to capture the island‚Äôs history with lots of funny and interesting stories. I would definitely recommend this place if you are a keen history buff but don‚Äôt worry if not, the remodelling of prison days will help you get the perfect cellfie! We ended the trip with a lovely walk around the grounds and a closer look at the bastions.",Jul 2021

Our tour guide was Karl, he was very knowledgeable, and kept us entertained and interested! Beautiful scenery around the island, a photographers dream! Great information on the different buildings, a cafe and gift shop on the island too. The only downside is that the 3 and a half hour tour is a little too short to truly enjoy the full experience! Would have loved to have lunch there, but we had way too much to do! Thanks for a great experience.",Jul 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Can‚Äôt recommend a visit to Spike Island enough! This is coming from someone who was born and bred in Cork. Our tour guide Donal was fantastic - spoke loud enough for everyone to hear and his energy & enthusiasm about the Spike Island story was so engaging. There were lots of children in our group and he managed to hold all of their attention aswell as the adults. Our trip over was 3.25 hours but we could have spent another few hours there exploring. The takeaway cafe has plenty of choice and the ladies working there were great craic! It helped that it was a beautiful day and the cells were a welcome cool break for a few minutes. Well done to the staff at Spike Island for making it a very pleasurable, professional and informative experience - not something you get at alot of tourist attractions in Ireland üáÆüá™

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"This trip is well worth doing if you‚Äôre in the area. You will need to book a few days in advance especially if a large group as it books out quickly.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"The boat trip was approx 15 mins from mainland to the island. We were greeted on the island by a tour guide named Karl. He was very welcoming and enthusiastic. He gave a quick introduction and then gave us the option to go alone or stay with him for some history on the area. He was very informative and knowledgeable about the island and any questions thrown his way were very well answered. He ""guided"" us for approx 45 mins until we got to the main courtyard. He then pointed us in the advised direction of the buildings and left us to tour at our own leisure. When he finished with our group (Family of 17) he took time to personally answer my questions about escaping prisoners, which, again, was very informative. We then had approx 150mins of our own time to look around. The island is very well signposted with lots
of signs and TV's telling us how life here used to be. My kids (16 & 12) also enjoyed the time here. We had a total of 3 hours on the island which was a good amount of time to see everything. The boat left the island to take us back exactly on time as instructed when we arrived.

The boat trip over alone is a wonderful experience.

A special mention to our tour guide John G. He guided us up the hill to the fort, stopping along the way to tell us the history of the island. He then told us how to make the best of our 3 hours on the island and highlighted all the must-see areas.

There is a lovely coffee shop and toilet area on the island. There are sandwiches, pizzas and lunches and an impressive array of cakes. Soup, tea and coffee are also available and a freezer of ice creams/ pops for hot days. The toilet are was very clean.

There is so much to see on the island. The views are amazing. In particular from Bastion 2 and 3 and then from the little beach down near the family houses.

A few hours well spent. We were sad to leave the island!

My six year old wasn‚Äôt too interested but there was a little fairy trail where she had to find fairies which helped and my 12 & 13 year old enjoyed it. The restaurant on site is just average so probably better off bringing a picnic, we‚Äôd plenty of time to look around and it was an enjoyable day",Jul 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,2.0,I expected it to be a lot more interesting based on it being in the top few things to see in Cork. Two buildings were burnt down so couldnt see in them and the ones you could see were good but nothing mind blowing. The staff were nice on the boat. 10 minute boat ride. Cafe queue moved really slow.

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Loved our trip to Spike Island. Our tour guide Marion was fantastic and gave us a great overview of the island and its many various inhabitants. There was so much to see and do around the island, we'll be back to pack it all in.",Jun 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Really enjoyed this tour. Did not expect the island to be as big as it was. Our tour guide Jessie was excellent - really knowledgeable but made it fun! Boat trip was really short and really well managed. Loads of time to explore after tour and the time flew. Would definitely recommend as a trip for any age group.,Jun 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,My wife and family of three kids under the age of 10 visited Spike Island. The tour guide Karol was a wealth of knowledge and entertaining to listen to. We never realised the rich and fascinating history of the island. Our three hours on the island flew by and found it a really enjoyable way to spend the afternoon. We'll worth the money and visit.,Jun 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Spike Island Tour is excellent, our tour guide Peter was very informative and knowledgable and the tour was fantastic.

Ireland,Spike Island,4.0,"Took a trip to Spike Island on a recent visit to Cork. Well worth a trip. Tour guide was great and full of information. Trip is seeped in history and you finish the tour with a knowledge of interesting facts . Kids found the trip a bit too long . Ferry left cobh at 1pm
And we were collected at 4.3pm . There is a coffee shop on the island however with young children trip could be cut by at least an hour . We were lucky the weather was in our favour but would not have enjoyed wandering around the island in bad weather . Still would recommend a visit plus Cobh is such a lovely town to visit also seeped in history",May 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"We visited as a family of 5 (7yrs, 5yrs & 18mths). We booked online - we got a family ticket for ‚Ç¨53.95 incl. booking fee...the baby was free. I thought it was great value considering what's included. Boat trip over was pleasant & plenty of space on board for the buggy. We opted for the guided tour (FREE) and our tour guide Karl was brilliant, he was energetic & engaging. There is ALOT of history within Spike Island and Karl covered it so well in the tour time of 50mins.
We wandered off through the exhibits afterwards & got some cakes & drinks in the cafe. We left Cobh Harbour @ 11.30am and caught the ferry again from Spike Island at 2.30pm. I think there is an option to extend or shorten the trip by speaking to the guys in the gift shop.
The terrain was fine with the buggy, there wasnt much we couldnt do with it.
Highly recommend üëçüëç

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,Great day out. Ailbe our tour guide was excellent and gave plenty of time and knowledge and stories that kept us interested. The history of this little Island is unreal and after the tour and a coffee we were able to follow well signposted walks and places of interest. The boat ride out was well managed as each group was escorted to their seats and socially distanced and both sailings were on time. All staff were friendly and the island was spotlessly clean and well maintained. The beautiful weather added to a magical day out.,Jun 2021

Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"This was the highlight of our week's holiday in Kerry and Cork. Boat trip was lovely (short) and crew really helpful when we had a small problem. The island's history is fascinating and tour really works for all ages. Our tour guide Jessie really brought it all to life - she gave a great sense of island's history and what it was like to live there, especially as a prisoner. Teenagers were really interested in the story of its recent past as a prison for joyriders and others.
Fantastic views and an easy day out. Best review is from the 14-year-old, who said, ""this is the only museum I have actually enjoyed!

Practical stuff - parking behind cathedral is great - 7 mins walk to ferry but longer back up - Cobh is hilly! Also, nice toilets at the cafe. You still have time to explore after tour.

I had been wanting to see Spike Island for a few years and it didn't disappoint. We availed of the free parking along the pier which is great. Our guide was Karl and he was brilliant, very knowledgeable and made the experience really engaging even for the kids. The tour lasted about 45 minutes and you have 3 and a half hours on the island but we could have spent longer especially with the beautiful weather. We brought lunch but there is a lovely restaurant on site also. All staff we encountered were so lovely and friendly. Highly recommended.

All the staff were very nice and professional.",Jun 2021
Ireland,Spike Island,5.0,"Probably one of the best and most enjoyable tours I have ever done in my life, I have taken the Spike Island tour now about 3 times and not only do I not ever get sick of it, I learn something new each and every time. The location is beautiful, the boat trip over is very comfortable and extremely enjoyable, the guys on the boat and absolute gents and the tour guides are all very friendly and so polite, and I would like to give special mention to one of the tour guides Karl, who was very funny, very knowledgeable, very friendly and a perfect gentleman. The facilities were brilliant and the exhibits around the island were very cool and the views were unbelievable. It‚Äôs a shame I can only give it 5 stars because it deserves so much more. There is a spooky and creepy vibe around the modern cell block which I though made the place much more interesting and exciting and the punishment block was very scarily quiet when we were there and made us really feel how bad a place it must have been for prisoners there which also made it very real and exciting. Heard some really funny stories too which broke up the sort of potentially boring history of one should find it boring at all but there‚Äôs not a thing to be bored by on this island as everything is so interesting and the tour guides keep you hooked on the tour the whole time. Rarely have I seen your guides that can hold a crowd as well as the spike island guides can do day in day out. Will totally be doing it again in the future and hopefully it will not be too long before I do it again.

You can cycle the entire lakes and the views are amazing.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,4.0,"Great and very interesting place, great tour with Rosa (nice singing voice and a great sense of humour). Takes you longer than the size of the museum might lead you to believe, tells you more than you might think. A must, but a fun one..",Oct 2021
Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"The 30 minute presentation by Luke was phenomenal. We were able to learn many interesting facts about Irish history.

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,1.0,"The man at the door was very friendly and helpful.

There was lots of brick and brack and photos of famous people. Feels like a 2nd hand shop.

One room has history of the irish times.

Another room has u2 pictures.

Another room had the history of the 1916 rising.

Another room was old phone cards, old Irish money and gold covered crisps. Its a bit odd.

The tour guide insulted the Irish efforts in Ww2 , She said "" we are neutral so we did nothing for WW2 and anyways Irish are not good fighters. ""

Actually thosands of men from Ireland travelled to the UK to join the British Armed Forces. The Irish government had tried to keep the war secret by telling the Irish media to call it the emergency.

Plus tens of thousands of Irish people crossed over to work in war industries in the UK.

There are lots of FREE history places to visit in Dublin this place was not worth the money if it was free and had no tour guide then it would have been alright.

I am Irish from Dublin and I went there with friends who are from other countries to show them a bit about the rich history of Dublin,

My friends liked the first room which had drawings of famous Dublin buildings and the Harry Clark glass art work but they were are bit confused at everything else there.

The chap at the desk was friendly and polite as well as being interested and informed, while Eamon's tour was both humorous and showed his depth of knowledge.

You only get guided around two rooms, one of which is of obscure facts of the 20th Century, if you are not from Ireland. All the items are randomly donated, which means they are a hodge podge, and do not go back before the 18th Century.

It hosts artefacts, memorabilia and knick-knacks from everyday life over the past century or so, and it provides a great insight into how modern Ireland has been shaped and how it has changed.

There are treasures in every nook and cranny, and if you like nostalgia (and quirky nostalgia at that - check out the current display of Virgin Mary statues!) it's a fantastic place to visit.

The staff are absolutely brilliant too. I've been coming here - at least once a year - since it opened and I always discover something new or hear a different story! While there was no guided tour when I visited last week (due to Covid - but a good thing to do, when available) there were staff dotted around the museum ready to help visitors or tell a story about some of the items on display.

Also, if you like U2, this is a must-see. There is a dedicated room to genuine U2 memorabilia and has a great amount of posters, tickets, flyers, special editions, accessories, etc., which would interest most music fans.

Altogether, a huge thumbs-up from me!

Moreover, the staff at the Museum were so welcoming and friendly. I spoke to Fiona over the phone and she was so helpful with regards booking and ensuring the activities were suitable for the age of the group.

Ann, our guide, was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We wove a path in and out and roudabout St Stephens Green. Ann told us a good deal about the historic role of key buildings and their connection with writers and poets. Inside the park, she led us to the statues of many important writers and poets suck as Joyce and Yeats. She blended humourously facts about their lives with anecdotes and witty gossip - it was very jolly. Sensitive to her audience Ann drew in elements of Irish, American and British history. It was a great way to spend sn afternoon.",Aug 2021

Our tour guide Eamon was knowledgable and great craic. Although I live in Dublin and have done many tours over the years I still learned many interesting things about the characters that coloured the Irish literary scene and Irish history more broadly. A very enjoyable way to pass and hour - and we had access to the museum itself when it was done. Great value.",Jul 2021

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Myself and another person wanted to go on a cultural date, a museum or gallery, in Dublin so I suggested this. It seemed easy to access (on St Stephens Green a few doors down from The Shelbourne Hotel) and reviews were favourable.

So I booked tickets online, easy to do, but also easy to pick the wrong dates when one is rushing around booking things on one's mobile on a hot day!
Discovered I accidentally misbooked the date, but someone was very quick to contact me back to correct my booking, easy to do and surprisingly no trouble to them (this given that one usually cannot get anywhere after one has made a booking online to modify it, so this extra touch is much appreciated). Nice customer service....before even arriving, well that is always a great start.

It was on a hot sunny July day in late afternoon. I arrived unsure of what to expect but was happy to go get my map and hear about the hunt and museum, a nice bonus is free entry to MoLi too if one wants to see that museum also. As it was in the middle of the heatwave, I hoped the Treasure Hunt could be a leisurely stroll through the leafy park in the shade from the sun, and maybe get some respite inside the museum from the heat outside. I was a little mistaken on this one!

Unfortunately, the heatwave and plenty of glass windows meant massive indoors heat. The museum was an oven. Very few other guests was a relief at least. There were stairs to climb as it was held on 3 floors but each floor was a delight.

The museum is FULL of memorabilia. One could spend hours just looking at everything, let alone reading captions or interacting with exhibits (personally got a kick from the red curtain reveal!). There was everything laid out in decades which meant it was easy to find info on historical and cultural events. The 70s and 80s brought me back to my Irish childhood.

I enjoyed seeing bits about Collins and Dev first, a nice photo exhibit and then up to the 60s-80s was my personal fav. I found it fun seeing things from my childhood and having recollections of political figures and cultural events from the 80s and 90s, which are still etched in my memory. The millennium milk bottles, phone cards, remembering the Oscar success of My Left Foot etc.

Staff were wonderful - helpful and friendly but not intrusive. And quirky! The certificate and the magnets and pencil were a lovely touch. And the music at the desk.

I found it very enjoyable, if not for the heat, but noone could fix that for us.
The description as ""little"" is apt for the size of the rooms, but not for the collection. It was well worth the visit, 10e is a great price, and we both decided another day to come do the Treasure Hunt in the park, maybe even return.

Final words, anyone who knows even a little about Ireland and Dublin will be interested in this museum, the U2 exhibition was especially vital to visit if one has even a passing interest in the band.

Spotting Bosco, standing beside Bono, seeing young Bertie, a huge Podge and Rodge and so on was all great craic too! And seeing how young U2 once were....like myself, back several decades ago. Little Museum of Dublin, a great find!

Ireland,The Little Museum of Dublin,5.0,"Fabulous activity. A really enjoyable afternoon on a very rainy day in Dublin (first one in a long time might I add - to quell that myth of rainy Ireland!!). The option was given for the outdoor treasure hunt in Stephens Green also which is great to have. The museum ticked a very important box for me in that it was particularly suited to younger teenagers and kept my 14 year old very engaged and excited to get all the answers while scouring each room for the information she needed to fill in the questions given to us at the start of the tour. Not many places that tick this box!! It's self guided but there are friendly and helpful guides along the way that come and chat to you about different aspects of the room you are in. We spent 2 hours in a beautiful Georgian house on the green. No better place to hang out of an afternoon.

Self guided while in current restriction level but was still great to wander just ourselves at our own pace through this fabulous building which overlooks stephens green.

Every room filled with memorabilia - sometimes crazy random, sometimes sobering and always nostalgic pieces from irish history and culture.. Never a dull moment in this wonderfully eclectic museum.

Will be back for another visit when guided touring resumes. Advise locals to book now before the crowds return as it was nice having almost whole museum to ourselves.

Non national tourists will for sure love this museum too but I highly recommend it in particular for Dubliners themselves!

Its a bit of a way out of the city. We walked there and it was quite a way. We got the bus back (thanks to the driver who let us on for free - lol).,Sep 2021

The Tour was excellent of this very significant place in Irish History and a must visit. Museum is also very good. Bonus:free!",Sep 2021
Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"Absolutely worth a visit if you're in Dublin. The tour only takes about half an hour, during which you get to visit both the newer and the older wings of the prison complex, as well as the courthouse and the inner courtyard. In addition to that, you'll get a very brief (but fairly informative) glance at how Kilmainham was, in a way, a new breed of prisons and how it influenced Ireland's modern history.

The tour guide, David, is a professional at what he does. Extremely passionate and very helpful, a joy to listen to.

Remember to book in advance!

Ireland,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,5.0,"The Gaol is a must-see stop during your visit to Dublin! While our tour was abbreviated because of COVID restrictions, it was 100% worth the visit. We saw the courtroom, the Gaol's main floor, some cells, and various outside spaces used for exercise or executions. The museum afterward is just as worth a look as the Gaol itself with lots of cool artifacts and human stories from Ireland's independence movement. You learn so much about Irish history and the struggle for Home Rule that a mere book couldn't convey.

The Gaol staff was pleasant and helpful; however, the visit was absolutely made by our guide Adam. He was so passionate and knowledgeable and answered all of our questions with enthusiasm. He is the kind of tour guide who has so much love for the place and it's history that you leave loving it, too. If you go, you simply must ask for him as your tour guide.

Adam was so welcoming and brought the history of the gaol to life and my two sons aged 14 & 18 were enthralled.

From the initial welcome at the door all the way through to the end, this was friendly and informative. Our guide was Shauna who was great, especially with the young children in the group. Visitors can spend as long as they wish in the museum at the end of the formal tour. This is a very poignant tour and brings home the history of the War for Independence and the Civil War.

And appreciates the hard work that went into building the beautiful architecture of the Castles that dot our coast line!",Sep 2021
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,We visited King John's castle and found it a very enjoyable experience. Firstly there is a self guided tour that is very interesting with some interactive stuff for the kids. Then there is a courtyard with lots of activities for the kids to take part in. We spent about 3 hours in the castle and were pleasantly surprised with how good it was. I would definitely recommend you check it out if you are in the area.,Aug 2021
Ireland,King John's Castle,3.0,"Not much castle tour, more of a nicely laid out self guided exhibition. After spending majority of time reading about the history of the castle (that can be read on Internet) there is not much of an actual castle to see. There are plenty of interactive activities, mostly for children, and a few guides in medieval costumes at the courtyard. Nothing really to remember, compering to other castle tours in Ireland.",Sep 2021
Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"We had a great time at King Johns Castle! The actors were fountains of knowledge and were great to talk to about the castle. They really knew their stuff. A few TVs around the place were supposed to play prerecorded actors talking but they were mostly broken or kind of boring tbh.

was at a Metal gig here before covid as well (Amon Amarth and Behemoth) and it was unreal.

saw some people want to revert the name back to Limerick Castle.... go for it! King John was a bollix anyway, and he never even visited the place. de-colonise colonial placenames!

Well worth a visit! Pint in Treaty City brewery afterwards!

We have traveled all over Ireland to various museums, piecing together Irish history, but nowhere put it together as comprehensively as King John's museum. On top of that, the way the museum presents it makes you feel like you are experiencing it on some level. They've done an amazing job bringing the castle to life and telling the story of what happened here.

We really loved this experience and highly recommend for visitors who are interested in history.",Jul 2021

Ireland,King John's Castle,2.0,"Very disappointing tourist attraction given its #1 ranking on Tripadvisor for Limerick.

Entered castle at 3:30pm, due to Covid we had to wait in reception for a short while to allow room between other visitors however, when we walked upstairs families with small kids took up the whole of the first couple of exhibitions leaving little room to see/read any of the information. It then took approximately 20/25mins to walk through the rest of the exhibitions.

Arriving at the courtyard at 4pm (which is supposedly 1 hour before closing and the time of the last entrance) the staff started shut up shop. Not allowing my partner and I to engage in the archery for a few seconds but once we walked away the man in the charge was happy to allow other young kids. Very disappointing and he is a disservice to the attraction as he continued to clean up the rest of the games/activities as people were trying to engage with them.

Would definitely not recommend attending this attraction and if you are make sure you attend at least 2/3 hours before closing as the fella who looks after the archery might want to home before closing.

Ireland,King John's Castle,4.0,"The tour begins inside with giving the history of the castle. There is a lot of information but through the use of audio and visual exhibits it is easy to take in.

Eventually you reach the outside of the castle where there are some activities for children and you can walk along a section of the castle walls to take in the views.

On the way out there is a cafe and gift shop.

For the best views of the castle I would suggest walking across the river to the nearby Treaty stone and viewing the castle from here.

Ireland,King John's Castle,5.0,"Visited King John's castle for the first time yesterday and it was a treat. The museum is well laid out with enough information to satisfy history buffs but it's not too dense for anyone else. They interactive parts add to the experience.
In the courtyard special mention has to go to Ocean and Nathan who have love and enthusiasm for history that comes across clearly when speaking with you. Ocean in keeping with the knights of old is equally at home explaining the finer points of using a long sword as excelling on the harp. Nathan is an archer who will pass on his skills with the longbow or horsebow in an easy and effective manner.
Next time you are in Limerick make sure you visit the castle.

Ireland,Wild Atlantic Way,5.0,"Hello, My wife & I are visiting Ireland for two weeks from Portland, OR. We decided on this tour after reading all the great reviews about this company. We booked the trip online and thought the price was great for a day long excursion. The morning of the tour, we were greeted at our hotel stop by a very friendly gentleman named Gerry. Gerry was our tour guide and driver for the day. Gerry was very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. He told us all about the history of the area, the beautiful towns we drove through and where the most interesting spots were that I enjoyed photographing. When we got to Doolin, we easily got our boat tickets from him and proceeded down the way to the dock. The boat crew was efficient and professional in getting us on board quickly and we departed shortly thereafter. It was a short 20 minute voyage to Inis Orr (the first and smallest of the 3 Aran Islands). Once on land, I‚Äôd recommend going on the tractor tour with the local guide. He pulled about 8 of us in his rig behind the tractor all over the island showing us the highlights and stopping several times along the way for us to shoot pictures. The cost was $10 Euros per person for the hour long excursion. We had an hour left so we grabbed a snack and a couple of pints before heading back to the boat. We headed by the Cliffs of Moher and then got to cruise by the cliffs closer in and at a much slower speed which helped in taking better photos and video. When we made it back on the bus, Gerry told us more about the area as we drove up to the Moher cliffs visitors area. We had about an hour to roam around and explore as we walked up to the vista points overlooking the ocean. On the way back on the bus, Gerry told us some great jokes and pointed out places that we could stop again for a few minutes to take photos. We were safely back in Galway by 7:00 PM. Overall, we totally though that the experience we had far exceeded our expectations and that Gerry had a lot to do with that. Definitely check out this company to book a tour, request Gerry for your guide and have a most excellent experience. Best, Glen & Kris.
