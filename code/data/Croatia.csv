Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"While a tourist trap ( that's what Dubrovnik is ! ) , it's a bit of history & a nice Morning walk. Too hot from 11am to 4 pm. Great views, take a camera",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Wonderful experience. Be prepared for lots of steps...and if it's a hot day go early in the morning to avoid the heat. Wonderfully preserved and what views, breathtaking!",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,We were very lucky for whether during our week in October. The walls were really impressive with amazing views out to sea and over the old town. A tad expensive but certainly very impressive. Takes about an hour to get around with some stops.,Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Lots of steps, very high, it was a wonderful experience ! There are bars along the way so you can stop and rest. You can ""get off"" half way around too. Shockingly fantastic views.",Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"After visiting Dubrovnik for many years and not walking the walls because of the heat and huge numbers of tourists in Summer, we went early in the morning in October. No crowds, no excessive heat, just relaxing walking and beautiful views of the Old Town, surrounding area and the sea. Awesome looking down on the roofs, alleys, and architecture. A drink stop overlooking Lokrum halfway round. Every view a photographer’s dream. It is expensive and I believe next year will be more so but as a once in a lifetime visit it is hard to beat.",Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,I loved this walk! I'm a very reluctant walker but so glad that I did this. Not as strenuous as I expected and well worth the steps at the start for the excellent views and insight into the old town.,Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Absolutely stunning views from the wall, worth doing it. Make sure to pack water and wear comfy shoes, about 2km walk around the wall. There are some refreshment/cafes along the wall as well.",Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Croatia is a magical place. Every corner is a postcard picture. The best view of the town is of course from the city walls, so this tour should be on your list as a must. We were lucky with not many tourists, but apparently can be very busy sometimes.",Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We walked the walls of Dubrovnik on our own and it was awesome! The weather was a pleasant low seventies and it wasn't too crowded--mid October was perfect. We took around two hours to walk the perimeter and visit some museums that were included on our Dubrovnik card. The views of the Adriatic were glorious and the peek into the backyards with the laundry hanging on the line enhanced the experience. Most of the homes within the walls have been converted to vacation rentals, but it was clear that some are still residential. The uneven stone walkways will give your ankles a workout!",Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,2.0,"The views can be pretty, but the walls are reminiscent of a Disney creation, as is most of Dubrovnik. After spending a week there, I felt that the entire city could be skipped. It's a tourist-trap on a major scale, with egregiously inflated prices -- especially for food and drinks. The walls apparently survived the 1667 earthquake (which destroyed nearly every building inside the walls) and numerous military attacks, and are an impressive 6 meters thick in some places, but they have been restored to an extent that makes them look new (nicely squared stones), hence artificial. There are walls (and castles) in other countries that have been standing since the 13th century, with less restoration, so more historical appeal. If you do walk the walls, go early, before you find yourself in an ant-like line of tourists -- and take water with you.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Do not Miss the monumental walls that encircle Dubrovnik. Undoubtedly the city's most unique and famous feature. There's no place like it on earth. Towers overlooking the sea, glittering Adriatic Sea on one side and red clay roofs of the Old Town on the other. You can easily explore the walls on your own. I recommend first thing in the morning or late afternoon.

Pro Tip:

Buy Dubrovnik Card and will save you money.

Bring water , wear comfortable shoes, a hat and a sunscreen.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Increasingly expensive but nevertheless the most iconic thing to do in Dubrovnik. Go during sunset and enjoy.,Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"This was our first visit to Dubrovnik so of course the walls were top of our list. I felt tickets were a little expensive but I imagine the upkeep is tremendous and it has to be funded somehow. The experience was worth it, some fantastic views and if you are a GoT fan like us then it’s a must.

Although there are quite a lot of steps, I think people of most abilities would be able to manage it if they took their time. If you are scared of heights or less able then it would be a good idea to avoid busy periods as some sections are a bit narrow and the sides seem quite low so could be scary navigating if there were a lot of people around.

There are several refreshment points where you can get a coffee, juice, beer, ice cream etc and they have toilets. It looked like there was a toilet for anyone to use at the bar on the sea section of the wall.

An absolute must do, we were lucky that it was quiet in October so we were able to take it all in and get a load of pictures without having to wait for others to get their shots first!

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,£20 to walk the wall and enter the St Lawrence fort (the red keep) is great value. Amazing views of the city and the coast especially for Game of Thrones fans. You need to have your wits about you as there are a lot of uneven steps and slopes with shiny paving that is slippery after rain.,Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Although to get up to the wall was a few steps, once you are up there not difficult at all. Several places to stop for refreshments if needed and a WC. we went up an hour before they closed and easily made it around in a hour. It was a little windy and not crowded at all.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Well worth the steps but buy a Dubrovnik one day pass as it only costs a little more than the wall costs and you then have the card for bus and other sights. Leave early as you get the full sun throughout in the hot weather - take a picnic and stop for your own break - plenty places to stop and have a break,Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,So much history was shared by our guide while we toured the walls. My respects to the City of Dubrovnik for maintaining these walls in such great condition. A true gem and a great privilege to have walked them.,Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"typical tourist thing to do but good experience . went about 5-6 and it wasnt too busy. Great views over Dubrovnik.

worth doing to get a flavour of the old town from on high",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The wall walk is a must but it is strenuous. Early morning was best for us. The views and historical perspective are best observed from the upper walls and it is one of the best walled city walks--if not thee best, in Europe.",Sep 2021

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,The views are amazing.Make sure you get on the walls early if you want to have some freedom walking around. We managed to get on the walls for 830am and had a great walk around with hardly any tourists from 9am onwards it looked really busy,Oct 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"This is a must do on visiting Dubrovnik, if it seems unaffordable I could suggest getting the Dubrovnik card that includes the walls and the palaces/monasteries. The views over the sea and the old city are absolutely stunning. If price is prohibitive you could consider the Fort alone which is about 50kn, this had beautiful views also of the walls, city and beaches.",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Best view of the city from the walls. Good to reflect back on what the city looked like hundreds of years ago when the walls protected old town. A lot of steps to get up to the top, but worth the effort to see the views",Sep 2021

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The best way to see the city, beautiful scenic views all around. There a few steep stairs now and then so keep that in mind. It also gets very hot so a bottle of water is a must, you can also buy it along the way (expensive). The entry fee is 200kn/around 27€ and it also gets you access to the Lovrijenac fortress - a lot of stairs to get to it, but a pretty nice view.",Sep 2021

There are a couple of places where you may exist early. There are several refreshment stands with toilets along the wall. Do not miss this experience !",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We followed the advice of our guide and ascended the walls at 8am for an early morning stroll. The views atop the Old Town are simply breathtaking. Wear good shoes and a hat, bring water. It wasn't too physically challenging overall, but there are some steps involved in portions that some guests may choose to skip. It took us about 2 hours, and by 10am the sun was noticeably stronger than when we started. I've also heard the sunset views are exceptional if you choose to go towards the end of the day.",Aug 2021

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"This is a MUST for a trip to Old Town Dubrovnik! As other reviews mention, try to go in the morning to avoid the heat as there is limited shade. Best views and photography opportunities! I would recommend buying tickets online so you can avoid any lines.",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"I was the only one in the party that wanted to spend the money for this, 200 HRK I think. It was worth it especially as it was around sunset. Maybe 1 1/2 mi walk all the way around. There are some great views.",Aug 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Excellent walking tour for the walls of the city while also getting great views of the old town and the ocean. Davor was a wonderful guide who knew the history of the entire country and city so well. He explained the complex history of the region and added his own personal to it which made it all the better.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,3.0,A pleasant walk around the old city walls in Dubrovnik. Holy moly I wish I’d opted to do the walk at sunrise or sunset though. It’s so hot and there is little opportunity for shade. It made that post walls beer even tastier though.,Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"I recommend sunset or sunrise as best for the walk on the wall. We did sunrise, less crowded. Beautiful views, and it is fun to just imagine what and who all walked these walls in the past.",Aug 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"Some friends said we should pass on the walls, but we are glad we did it. Lots of steps, so go early when it's cooler. It wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be and there are a lot of picturesque spots to stop for refreshments.",Sep 2021

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Go early to beat the heat and crowds. We went during a heat wave, buy survived all the stairs, etc. It's a must.",Aug 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A must do when in Dubrovnik absolutely beautiful views, do not miss it both myself and my teenage daughter really enjoyed walking the walls.
Can get very hot during the summer we visited in August and very little shaded spots so would recommend early morning or evening time.
If you are staying for a few days I would recommend a Dubrovnik card as this includes free entry to the walls so almost covers the cards fee.
Just a tip avoid stalls selling jewelry on the walls I fell into a tourist trap of buying a bracelet for €25 I later saw the exact same bracelet in several shops for €13.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Spectacular views and impressive infrastructure. Be ready for lots of steps! Would highly recommend. Nice to have beer half way through in one of the places offering beverages to take in the amazing views over the walls,Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Do not miss this. We went early in the morning to try to avoid the worst of the heat- not entirely successful there, but that's August in Dubrovnik. The walls are utterly spectacular, with the best views of the old town and the sea. It is no surprise they have never been breached. With entry you can visit a number of fortresses along the walls, and another fortress just outside on a clifftop (Lovrijenac). Entry is also included with the Dubrovnik Card, which in itself is a worthwhile investment. We went at the end of our trip so greatly enjoyed looking over the places we had visited all week. Walk carefully as many of the stones are rounded and slippery, and be ready for a fairly long and uneven walk- wear sturdy shoes and take snacks and water. There is a stop halfway round for food and drink if needed. Though I have no doubt that a sunset walk would be spectacular, the early morning before the crowds pile in is magical.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Incredible views and a fantastic experience of years gone by.
Arrived at 9.50 hrs so pretty quiet therefore a very leisurely walk with many photos. Advice if travelling in by car, park at the multi-car park as you enter from the main road and ignore the old town parking as already full and a LONG one way system out of the city which takes you away from it before you can double back.",Sep 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"The reason I’m giving 4 stars and not 5 is just because it was a bit pricey for what it was - 200 Kuna each when I visited. But of course I was silly and didn’t realise there is a Dubrovnik Card you can purchase that would have made this almost a steal combined with a couple other major sites to visit.

The views from the walls are amazing however and if someone said ‘what’s the one thing I MUST do on a visit to Dubrovnik’, walking the city walls would be it. Well, that and an ice cream from Peppinos. I know that’s two things, but shhhh.

If you like photography, you’ll love the opportunity to take a gazillion different photos of the expanse of red roofs and alleyways below. Toward the end I was beginning to feel a sort of IKEA dread, where you’re stuck in a seemingly endless one way system, but unlike IKEA you can exit the walls at quite a few points if you reach ‘peak wall’. There are also a few refreshment points where you can grab a seat and a drink, which are both very welcome in the heat.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"We didn't mind the expense, the climbing, the walking, the crowds, the uneven pathway, etc...but the heat, my goodness, it almost killed us! Yes, going in late June with temps in the 100s wasn't the best idea, but - when in Croatia, right?

The walk itself is quite the workout - the path is made uneven and slippery in places by the smooth, rounded inlaid stones and the stairs are very steep with a shallow riser height and tread. Almost all of us had flip flops on which made traversing the unique foundation a little complicated - particularly with the heat! My flip flops were much thinner and had far less structural integrity than when I started out. Ultimately, we didn't mind the workout after eating and drinking our way through Croatia, but it was more than we expected or planned for.

If you go in the summer, be prepared. We each had a water, but that was mostly gone halfway around the fortress and we soon realized we'd need to ration our supplies if we were going to make it out alive! I had a small tube of sunscreen in my purse which came in handy, but it wasn't nearly enough and we all ended up getting fried anyway because there is NO shade for most of the walk.

My suggestions are these: Take your time - rest often and pace yourself; Carry a backpack with extra water (even if it's cooler out and you think you won't need it) and sunscreen to reapply; wear a hat; definitely wear shoes with a tread and support; and take CASH as there is a stop at the midway point for a cocktail, frozen treat, or bottle of water. The prices are steep though, so take that into consideration. It's a pricy trip around the castle for an entire family.

***If you have kids - BE CAREFUL! The walls are VERY low and it would be easy for a child to fall right over the side. My son is 17 now, but I know that if I took him on that trail when he was younger, he'd be all about climbing all over the place - it's a fortress for goodness sake, a kid's dream! (I can't imagine any such amusement being open to children in the U.S., but traveling opens your eyes to a lot of things - most of the world gets along just fine without the safety regulations we have in place). I'm not trying to be preachy, just giving advice you can take or leave :- ) To keep the day pleasant and avoid a tragedy, a conversation with little ones about safety should be had in advance. It's important as well to adjust your mindset to be prepared to be on guard the whole time. There are plenty of other fun spots for the kids to pretend play on the ground level).***

Aside from the unexpected distractions and difficulties, the overall excursion was pretty cool. The views are breathtaking and once you get to the side facing the water, the unobstructed panorama of the shimmering Adriatic and distant islands coupled with the cool breeze gives you just enough energy to keep going!

Ultimately, it's a pricey and challenging excursion but we felt it was well worth it - after all, how many times can you say you've successfully circumnavigated fortress walls of the unconquerable Croatia? The Venetians can't!

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,3.0,"The walk is beautiful, and it is almost a must see. It is however infuriating that the walk over the walls (which is about 2km, by the way) is this expensive. We paid 400 kuna for us two, which is over 50 euros. The walls were made to withstand cannon balls, me walking on my flip-flops won't damage it too much.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Amazing walk! Such interesting stories told beautifully by Davor; his deliberating skills kept everyone engaged for the whole 2 hours! Would highly recommend as was such an amazing couple of hours!! Excellent historic knowledge, any questions I answered he gave me perfectly structured answers with great accuracy and depth.",Aug 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,I highly recommend walking around the walls of Dubrovnik. I would consider the walls a must do activity in this city. My wife and I walked the walls over a 3 hour period. We took our time and enjoyed the wonderful views. I would recommend going early in the morning or later in the afternoon. It can be very crowed and very hot. The walls are totally worth it. I would walk them again the next time I visit the city.,Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Absolute must. Probably takes about 2 hours if you're in a leisurely pace and stop to take pictures. We got tickets online in advance just to make it easy. But KEEP your tickets because you may be asked for them once you get about half way through as you pass the other entrance. I also suggest going early. It gets more and more crowded later on plus it's hotter. We went around 9:00 am.,Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"If you're here in the summer, definitely do this earlier in the morning before it is too hot.

Overall, it was really cool to walk on the walls and see the views. Recommend.",Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A must see when in Dubrovnik. There are two different entrances in the Old Town. The entrance costs 200 kuna in summer and apparently 50 kuna in winter, I advice to check online for the prices. It is possible to go around the walls in around 1 hour with some quick photo stops. It is really long and goes around all Old Town. Many stairs and climbs at certain points. Amazing views of the Old Town. Recommend to go at around 6 to 6.30 PM in summer since it can be very hot!! At this time the temperature was perfect and the sun was going down. They close at 7.30 PM during summer. There were some small bars around the fortress selling refreshments.",Aug 2021

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,100% recommended. Great experience. A must-see in Dubrovnik's Old Town. With Dubrovnik card for €33 you can enter the city walls and several other museums and the Franciscan Monastery in one day. City walls entrance is €27.,Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"The best way to get a full overview of the old city. A full round takes about 1 hour and is well to do for most. Has some slightly steeper sections, yet hardly as steep as regular stairs. Comes at price though - 200 kuna or just over 26 euros per person.",Jun 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Walking the city walls is a ""should do"" for any first-time visit to Dubrovnik (or for subsequent visits if you're with new people who haven't done it before). Ticket prices are 200kn for adults (about $30 USD), at least as of May 2021, and I think the walk is worth the price.

Great views of both Old Town and the Adriatic abound as you walk along the walls, ducking in and out of fortresses, climbing numerous steps...

Best to go in the off season, or early in the day before the wall gets crowded.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"If you want all the pictures you see from Dubrovnik, you pretty much have to pay for a walk on the walls. The price is kind of too high for something as simple as this, but you kind of have to do it if you are here. It is quite hot in the walls so it is advisable if you go at the start or end of the day. There are public fountains at the entrance of the north side of the city. You can fill your bottle up here before you go up. There are also various food/drink vendors on top if you need to stop and rest. The admission here will include admission to the fort across the bay. Make sure you see that as well to get the most out of your money.",Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A lot of steps so consider the time of day you go however there are refreshment stops around the walls as you go.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,4.0,"Almost two kilometres of Wall to explore. Once you are up the flight of steps that leads to the wall it’s predominantly flat. Nice to walk around. Probably takes about three hours but far to hot yesterday to do the ‘full round’. Can imagine it being slippery in the rain.

Great views of the sea and the old city. Good views also of Lokrum and Fort Royal. Take care to cover up and use sun screen otherwise you will burn to a cinder.",Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"Great way to spend an evening at sunset! We went in at 6:30 and came out at 8pm just as the sun was beginning to set. It was warm but the breeze on the sea side was perfect. Wish we had known there were snack and restaurants along the way as we would have planned to have a drink and sit and enjoy the view! As it was, we wanted to make sure we completed the entire walk before it closed at 8:30.",Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,Definitely a must visit when in Dubrovnik. Glad they cleaned up the vendors that used to be all over the walls. Now it is a great visit. Don’t miss.,Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,What an amazing walk on top of Dubrovnik- where Kings Landing from Game of Thrones was filmed! the city looks and feels mediavel - making the comparison with the show that much exciting! looking on it from above- is a breath taking scene- don't miss it!,Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"I do this walk every time I visit Dubrovnik because the views and the colours are ever-changing. The different perspective over the sea and down into the folded canyons of this millennia-old city are something that should not be missed. The light and temperatures are friendliest early in the morning or evening- the hours listed pertain to when you can enter the wall, but once you’re up there, they’ll let you stay on the wall until sunset (in July, sunset was an hour after the wall “closed” at 7:30p).

It’s expensive, sure, but this is one of those cases where money does buy 2 hours of happiness in the form of an unforgettable experience. Think of it as a worthy investment into your vacation. Unless you’re there on a super busy day, just buy the tickets at the gate as it’s much cheaper.

Bring water and snacks!! There are some cafes and restaurants where you can buy supplies on the wall but they’re very expensive. There are 3 exit/entry points so you can go down and come back up (to the same gate) if you need a break.

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"As seen, the city walls surrounds the old city so you can find a lot of points with nice view!
I had a drone with me and took some amazing videos so greatly satisfied :)
Some tips:
- It takes around 2-3 hours to walk all of the city walls so it would be better if you choose a time when it is not that hot as you are definitely sweat out.
- Stay hydrated! you can take water with you, or sit in one of those stops on the walls where you can buy some refreshments.
- Make sure that you are in shape as you are going to climb a lot of stairs.. like really A LOT!

Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,5.0,"A plus for the refreshments points/bars along the walls - very good servings, nicest personnel ever and best view!",Jul 2021
Croatia,Walls of Dubrovnik,2.0,"STAY AWAY!

After Covid19, everyone in Dubrovnik wants to recover their losses from returning tourists.

Access to the walls used to cost 30 kn, now it is 300 kn. In this weather, not wortn it.

Besides, access to the very few public toilets costs 7 kn in coins only. Trying to find change from kiosks or restaurants becomes a nightmare because they do not seem to have the right change or they want you to become a customer and dish out for their overpriced menus. What shark tactics!

To finish, English-speaking visitors somehow get higher prices or no discounts at all.

Truth be told, the FREE water fountains are a blessing in this weather and icecream is always a treat in the whole region.

To do the whole circuit took us under an hour and a half including photographs and a twenty minute break. You can take quicker and come off at one of the exits along the route. I would highly recommend doing the full circuit. The views are gorgeous. There is a cafe mainly selling fresh juices and drinks but it's pricey.

Don't buy any of that crap in the basement. People come on. If people stopped buying it, those shops wouldn't be there and it wouldn't be so tacky to walk through.
Check out the bell tower next to the mausoleum. Def pay to walk up the tower. No need to go see saint lucia crypt, but the baptistery is kinda cool

Part TREASURY was good and nice to read and learn something, part CRYPT was completely waste as there was absolutely nothing, no any signs or any information what was there before and last part BAPTISTERY was fine with at least some information about first king and place.

Croatia,Amphitheatre de Pula,4.0,"A new acquaintance looked over my list of ""must see/do"" items for Croatia and told me to skip Pula altogether. Although she gave some great advice overall, I'm glad fate had other ideas. A needed stop for gas and water put us right at Pula's door, so we made a turn here and there and accidentally happened upon this ancient Roman amphitheater (one of the six largest in the world), both an incongruous and inevitable part of its surroundings .

There is something both unbelievably startling and absolutely spiritually grounding to happen upon such a site. It stops you in your tracks. Those feelings are only magnified as you walk through the colosseum and take in the sheer scope of it. It's easy to imagine how magnificent it must have been, once - and still - the pinnacle of achievement, overlooking the Adriatic. The subterranean gallery conjures a whole other set of emotions as you remember exactly what took place there.

The juxtaposition of ancient and modern is somewhat surreal, but it in no way takes away from the surprise or admiration. I'm glad I saw it.

I recommend everyone to take the audio guide, since it is stacked with interesting facts and is a great chance to learn a lot about the arena and the Roman times as well.

However, the audio guide device is a little bit too old and some of the spots in the tour seem to be out-of-sync with the audio guide. This is the only downside of the visit, apart from that, everything else was fabulous.

P.S. I recommend the visit at the sunset - the colors and the setting is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life.

- audioguides are too old and NOT Working well. I asked to replace it and i was told by the woman taking care to push stonger on the butons (like hell) to make it working… I wasn’t able to hear some points.
- For people paying entrance and not taking audio there is almost no indications. Better for them to watch from outside.
- No storytelling in the audio explanations. Why not inventing the story of a citizen of Pula, the life of a galdiator, … Audio would be more engaging
- Missing a VR experience and movie recreating the atmosphere during the games and how the theater was looking like. A bit like in the antic theater of Orange to give an example.

I put 2 stars hoping inside visits will improve as there is potential. Nevertheless, i defintively recommend to visit this charming and so well conserved amphitheater.

We just googled and read about it while we walked. Two things to note: parking is a bit of a nightmare. And if it's raining in Istria, do NOT go to Pula. Apparently (unbeknownst to us), we had the misfortune of scheduling our Pula visit on a day it rained. It was coincidence. But the problem as we found out later, was that when it rains in Istria, all the beach and island bound tourists scrap their plans and go see the Pula arena instead. So our 40 minute drive from Rovinj took an hour and a half because of traffic and police were closing routes and diverting traffic. We had just made a turn into Pula when an officer walked two cars behind us and closed the route.

There are some stairs in place but my wife with her heart condition was able to do it without issues. We spend all morning here and the used the included in the ticket price tram to go to the upper lakes, walked down to where the boat is, which is also included in the price, and took the boat across the lake to where we walked maybe ten minutes to where we were staying. The waters are crystal clear, there is no trash, nothing to mar the natural beauty of the lakes and waterfalls. We have been to all the major National Parks in the US, to Iceland, Switzerland, and most or Europe and this is by far the most spectacular park we have finished in terms of the amount of waterfalls and the stunning natural beauty.

The paths are well curated and in some places there are wooden walking paths on the water that do not have hand rails. It wasn't difficult but some people might need support.

When I visited, I was with my 80 year old (very fit) mother / we did the lower lakes hike in & out. The hike out is a switch back up a pretty steep hill. For most people with moderate fitness levels it will be no issue. The views were totally worth it!

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I stopped here for a few hours on my way from Zagreb to Split, motivated by the fact that it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. I was able to buy the ticket online and scheduled it for between 12:00 and 1:00 PM. It being past the tourist season and also because of COVID, the park was not crowded, and I was able to do the long trail in less than 4 hours. (On the average, there were about 10 meters between visitor. So, one could walk pretty much as fast as one desired.)

The park lives up to its billing, and is quite a unique experience. The water cascades down the lakes via innumerable waterfalls and streams, and the gentle gurgling sounds of the water together with its beautiful turquoise color gives the park a unique ambience. It is maintained well, and there are plenty of pictographic signs so it is easy to find one’s way around the park and also locate facilities such as toilets. The boat ride (halfway through the hike) and the motor train (at the end) gave welcome respite to my tired legs.

All in all, it was an excellent way to spend the better part of a day (if you include travel time).

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"I spent far too long planning the perfect trip to Plitvice, getting to go after years of looking pictures of the otherworldly lakes. And it didn’t disappoint, it’s stunning. But it was confusing trying to work out the the best route, which entrance etc etc. so here’s what I did which may help a few people.

We stayed overnight in a B and B in the Plitvice Selo area, the night before entering the park. The advantage of this is you’re right next to the park, so you can walk along the cliff top to get birds-eye view without needing a ticket and before you enter. You also don’t need to pay for parking). From here you can enter via entrance 3 (which according to Plitvice doesn’t exist, but it definitely does. There’s a wooden cabin with someone in it to scan your ticket. It doesn’t matter if you’ve booked for entrance 1 or 2).

We got there first thing, at 7am. The advantage of this is how quiet it is. We didn’t see anyone for the first 20mins. Although I assume that wouldn’t be the case at entrance 1 or 2. The downside is entrance 3 takes you to P3. Where the long boats ride takes off from. But the boat doesn’t start running until about 8:30am. So you have to take route H from here. Another downside of starting so early is the sun hasn’t risen. And the colour of the lakes isn’t as turquoise when the sun isn’t shining on it. But there’s a way around seeing the beautiful colour lakes without having to go back on yourself, which I’ll explain later, and it was so nice being so quiet. Anyway, because the boat wasn’t running yet, we had no choice but to take route H.

So at 7am, it’s quiet, so doesn’t matter re. the crowds if you do the lower or upper lakes first. But when it starts dramatically picking up about 10/11, route H was much quieter than route C. When the paths cross, it gets busy, but when C and H split off from each other, C was always much, much busier. The downside of H is you’re often walking away from the waterfalls. So you find yourself having to turn around to take photos of some of the waterfalls. Wasn’t a massive issue though.

To do all of route H, plus lunch, took us about 6 hours. We then got the boat back to P3, and walked back to Plitvice Selo to our car. But this is where you can take advantage of being higher up, with the sun being high, and taking photos of the lake in their full glory! When you get back to the ticket hut, keep walking along the pathway through the woods. Along here are loads of view point of the lakes. You’re also on the right side to get that famous photo everyone talks about. You could walk to it, or drive a bit closer and park up along the road. If you’ve got Google maps working, the coordinates to it are (44.9023904, 15.6073713). It’s just over the bridge, and there’s a little pathway to your right. Follow that for a few mins and the lookout point is there. Definitely the best view in the park imo.

Other points, the food was average (burgers, chips, cheese and ham baguettes etc.), but did the job when I was starving and hadn’t eaten in hours.
The park transport seemed efficient. But did get busy around the time we were starting to head back.
Obviously the park is very busy, so if you’re taking a photo on the boardwalk, just be aware of people around you and move to the side, it’s not hard!

So in a nutshell, I’d recommend getting there first thing. The quiet and tranquility, although short lived, is worth it. To do that, it’s worth staying overnight there the night before, assuming you have a car anyway. If you’re fully intent on doing route C, either enter via entrance 1, or start about 8:30 if using entrance 3. And walk along the cliff tops when the sun is above you. At 2pm, it was dead quiet, you’re shaded from the sun by the trees and views are next level.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"An incredible experience. Believe the hype. The lakes are magically blue. There are several routes to choose from, depending on how much time you have and how physically demanding you'd like the route to be.

September is a great time to visit. There was a crowd but it was manageable. We went in at 09:00 and we found it a good time. If you get there earlier you'll surely have less of a crowd. Main entry time seems to be 10/11 AM, so our suggestion is to get there before then. We came from Zadar by car and it was an early wake up call, but 100% worth it. Even though the weather was partly sunny partly cloud (with some rain mixed in toward the afternoon) it was extremely beautiful and not too hot.

Suggestion: buy tickets online one day before to avoid the long queue on the day. You just get there, show the ticket and you're in.

We too route C which took us 5 hours in total. You'll get to see everything with this route. If you want something more demanding, routes K and H are for you (H is around 18km). In any case, bring enough food and water + hiking boots (no flip flops).

All in all a wonderful experience.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"It was a little disappointing at the beginning of Sept. It's the dry season and the volume of water over the falls was very low, so it didn't look like the advertised pictures at all. But it was worth the day spent there.

We were just there last week. We stayed at a small inn outside the park, Villa Verde, and the owner suggested a route for us as we are not all that young that is mostly downhill. I don't think it's one of the lettered routes but it doesn't matter, once inside you are free to roam. No one ever asked us to select a route. You can buy a ticket the night before online, but this time of year I doubt there is an issue. But you can select and reserve an entry time online one day ahead. We did that. You can park at entrance 2 and walk to St2 which is the bus stop. It's a tractor pulling a linked up train of panorama coaches, so some say bus and some say train. Take the bus going to St3. From St3 you have a downhill walk to the boat dock P2, just follow the P2 signs. Take the boat to P3. From P3 you have a mostly downhill walk to the main attraction, Veliki Slap the Big Waterfall, just follow the signs to Veliki Slap. From there you walk uphill and follow the signs to St1. It's not so far and ok if you take it slow. From St1 you ride back to St2 which is entrance 2 where you came in. If you go the opposite way, you are facing continuous uphill especially from P2 up to St3. Going at a slower pace and stopping 1/2 hr for lunch this took us between 5 and 6 hours. It's about 5 miles of actual walking, not counting the bus and boat rides.

At P3 there is food available, some of it hot sandwiches for reasonable price about 40 to 50 HRK I think but can't remember for sure, and a large grassy area with outdoor tables. We brought our own sandwiches though.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful scenery and definitely worth a visit! We went in September which is not the typical holiday season but it was still very crowded. Dont want to even know the amount of people visiting during school holidays!

We took Path C though and also had some moments where we were alone on the path. Just avoid the the big guided groups, those are really annoying. And if there is a beautiful picture spot ahead there is more likely to be a crowd since everyone wants the perfect shot.

Anyway, we enjoyed our stay in the park and I would definitely recommend you go if you are in the area and have a day time.

Parking is 10kn per hour and you can buy snacks/food/drinks at various spots in the park. Bring good footwear though, its not necessarily Flip Flop proof. Also make sure to prepare for different weather. The park is in the mountains and it can get chilly when there is no sun.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,3.0,"I was really looking forward to this so I was really bummed when it was so disappointing.

This is a MAJOR MAJOR tourist attraction. The crowds are ridiculous. They use two separate entrances to separate the large throngs of people. Your ticket is good during one time frame at one entrance. They send people down differing paths to break it up but you can't separate that many people all the time and it turns into a gong show quickly.

There are numerous paths through the park. We had 4hrs there so we took the very 'typical' path B. That takes you down to the big waterfall, along a series of lakes and falls and ends at a boat.

The falls and lakes are stunning. There's no denying that. This is a drop dead gorgeous area. But being pushed along down a wooden gangway the whole time is not the way to enjoy it. I literally just stopped a half dozen times to let the pushy mobs of people go by.

The B route takes you along all the 'must sees' and you end at a boat/souvenir/snack area (of course). There you get in line for a shuttle boat that takes you on a 10 or 12 minute ride to the next station. There you get out of the boat, walk up the hill, walk down the hill to another boat and then get on a different boat to take you to an area where you can catch a motorized shuttle most of the way back to the entrance.

Part of the path is cobblestone - easy to turn your ankle - part of it is dirt/roots/rocks - also easy to turn your ankle. Wear supportive shoes/boots.

Are the lakes/falls beautiful? absolutely. Is it worth the crowd experience? Not on a bet.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Europe's most gorgeous natural wonder! A few practical tips:
(1) visit the place with a tour guide. The place is more than just stunning landscapes and photo backgrounds. The lakes and their formations are naturally evolving and it is great to learn about those processes. You will also get through the queues and best photo spots easily.
(2) Take a waterproof cover for a phone. Even if it is not raining, the paths are very narrow - you can accidently by pushed and drop your equipment to the water.

We walked pretty much every part of each trail by doing a combination of various trails and boat rides. You need to check the timings of the boats as they don’t start early - so we walked up to the upper lakes boat station P1-P2 . This boat service runs very frequently and is just a short hop - there can be queues for the other longer boat route.
We also climbed up to the lookout above Veliki Slap - as you enter the waterfall viewing area go up the steep stairs on the left side ( there is a no entry sign but the path is ok , if a little overgrown ) this take you to the viewpoints above the waterfall which are magnificent .

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We visited Croatia and wanted to visit this park. We stayed just outside if split so the journey to the park was 2.5 hours…..so quite a drive…..but so worth it!!

The park itself is simply beautiful….nature at its absolute best. Worth the drive and the ticket getting in. Book your ticket on line to avoid queuing when you get there.

The big waterfall is at entrance 1. We entered via entrance 2 and walked around that part of the park around the lakes and smaller waterfalls and then saw the large waterfall at the end. Beautiful.

We were typical tourists, and came wearing short sleeves and shorts as where we travelled from was 34 degrees.

When we got to the mountain it was quite chilly (very obvious, but at the time we just didn’t think!!) and it rained for the whole day. It didn’t ruin the experience as the views and scenery were spectacular, however had we layered up with long sleeved clothing and bought a waterproof Mac, it would have been so much better!! We were cold and wet all day so one piece of advice before you go…..wear appropriate clothing and footwear….comfy walking shoes or trainers to make the day more enjoyable if it does rain.

So glad we visited despite the long drive and being under prepared with the colder temperature and wet weather…..apparently the water in the lakes is the cleanest in the world….you can see why……as mentioned before nature at its best! You are not able to swim in the lakes snd you can see why when you get there, the preservation of the park is what keeps it looking so beautiful.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,4.0,"First off the place is beautiful and stunning and definitely worth a visit. There are different routes through the park and we did route/program B from entrance 1. The park did a great job of putting boardwalks in so you can see the park but they are narrow in many spots and with no handrails so I definitely do not recommend for anyone with small children. We loved the first half of route B as we were hiking and got to see a lot. The trail was clearly marked with lots of signs. The second half of route B involved 3 shuttles (2 boats and 1 bus). The shuttle part was a little confusing but there was always park staff at these points that gladly pointed us in the right direction. I think we had to wait 20 minutes for the 1st boat shuttle which was the longest wait. Personally I’d much rather hike between the spots, but that is my fault for not doing research before going.

Plus, there aren’t enough side-places for people to take photos, making it impossible to enjoy your walk while having to stop every 2 minutes and wait for 14689 people to take their pictures. The food is horrible and it costs way too much, considering the quality. There aren’t enough toilet establishments and trash cans.",Aug 2021

YES, the crowds are similar to Disney land, according to one reviewer, (which I appreciated as it mentally prepared me for the worst) BUT, this place is magical. We only took the ferry early to dodge the crowds then walked the rest of our 6 hour tour. If you were mindful and up for a heavy day of walking, you can steer clear of the masses for a good part of the day. We came on a Tuesday and the weather was overcast with a soft rain which may have helped the crowds. When most people took the ferry, we walked the pathways from 1 point to the other. Grab a sandwich in the park or bring one with you and enjoy the scenery as there is nothing like this place in the world! Just stunning! YES, it's crowded but you can't go to Croatia without a stop at Plitvice Lakes. In my opinion, 1 full day is enough to see the entire park.

It’s cheaper to buy directly from the ticket office when you are there or if you want to buy in advance, buy it online via the official Plitvice Lakes website. We had gotten vouchers and it wasn’t worth the trouble nor the price!
Secondly, once you have tickets you don’t have to enter/exit via the main entrances. There are mini entrances around the park. We stayed near P3 entrance and avoided the crowds at the main entrances.
Finally, don’t forget to bring your mask. It is required for the boat and bus ride inside the park but if you forget you can buy them for 6HRK at the coffee shop.

You can mix and match walks as much as you like. All staff in park are very helpful. Food places at various stops but long queues so recommend you take picnic. Water fountain to fill up at boat stop 1 which you should use as bottles to but are pricey. Glorious scenery at Plitvice Lakes, it’s a distance from the main cities but well worth the effort.

It was very busy which slightly lessens the experience and if I could offer any criticism it would be that in places the queues mix from different directions and this really creates a backlog. We had to queue for 45 mins to get the very short boat ride back on the way down. I imagine going out of school holidays is much less hectic.
We did route C which covers the whole park . This involves walking over 20,000 steps , two boat rides and a bus/train .

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"You can read all about the park in other posts, so I'm going to highlight some tips:

1. Buy tickets online in advance. It'll save you a lot of time because the ticket line at the park is long.

2. If you just have 3 hours you will not be able to circle both the upper and lower lakes, but if you want to see the lower lake and a little bit of the upper and are decently fast walkers, try this: Park in parking 1 and follow the A/B route until you cross the lake on the first boat (P3 to P2). However, here, don't get on the 2nd boat yet. Follow the route like you are going to the upper lakes, but just go around the first ""upper lake"" - Lake Gradinsko and then just circle back to the dock and take the P2 to P1 boat. At least you get to see a bit of the upper lakes this way.
Then you can just grab the shuttle bus back to the 1st parking area. Note - when the shuttle brings you back, it is still a 20+ minute walk back to the actual parking area.

3. Pay for parking before you leave otherwise you'll do what we did which is find yourself at the exit gate with an ""arm"" but you can't pay at the exit gate. You have to walk into the ticket office which is right beside the gate.

4. The P3 to P2 boat may have a long line, but it moves quickly and the boats come very frequently.

5. If you see a tour group, either walk around them, reverse course, or trail behind the slow moving group. Those are your options.

Overall, a really beautiful park completely worth visiting.

It is an easy and magnificent walk through one of nature’s wonder.

Recommendation: book the tickets in advance.
Note: through the Viator website you usually get a reservation with a barcode. Go to the information point at the entrance and exchange it for the tickets to “cut the line”.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,1.0,"The good:
The park itself was a very nice place with great views and routes to hike through

The bad:
Entrance to the park was a shambles. We entered via entrance 2. The parking was a maze with poor guidance as to where to go, resulting in cars driving the wrong way through one way loops only wide enough for one car. This caused jams with nowhere for anyone to go. There were no stewards around making up for the lack of clear signs directing traffic.

Buying a ticket was a shambles, we didn't book online as the website said tickets could just be booked at the park entrance. When we arrived there was a 2 and a half our wait for tickets. The queue was hundreds of meters long and several groups of people were trying to cut in and skip the queue. There were no stewards controlling the situation and a lot of angry confrontations around us resulted. The entire ticketing system needs a complete overhaul, the majority of people were just turning around and going home at this point.

The park was extremely busy to the point of ruining the experience. Granted our presence there was contributing to the business but had we known how busy it would be we wouldn't have went. The paths around the park are extremely narrow and there are crowds of people constantly flowing in both directions. You can't stop for a photo or to enjoy the view due to the crowds of people behind you being held up. The queues for the boats and buses to get around the park were miserable, we spent half the time in the park waiting in queues, so if planning a long hike be aware several hours of the day will be spent queung stuck at bus/boat connections. Either the number of tickets allocated each day needs to be controlled properly and capped at a suitable level or the infastructure in the park needs overhauled, with the paths significantly widened and the number of buses and boats running doubled.

In summary, we had an awful experience due to terrible management of the park, which is a shame because the location itself has nice views and walks that are fairly unique to the area. Unfortunately couldn't recommend Plitvice to anyone until large improvements are made.

There is a boat and train that take you to locations along your trail. The temperature was very comfortable even though we were in the end of July.

And as hot as it was, there was nothing we could do to cool off because you're not allowed in the water at all. At one point, we were waiting for the boat to take us further into our Program H tour. We finally got on the dock after a very long wait, but then the boat left without taking anyone on. A staff member was there but did not stop people from getting on the dock. It got so crowded on there that I was sure the dock was going to crumble. We finally bagged the whole trip and hopped on another boat that took us back to the parking lot. We paid a lot of money for 8 entrance tickets and completely regret the trip.

The only saving grace was that we chanced upon a lovely restaurant on the way home, Vila Velebita. That saved the day!

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"We visited Plitvice in the early morning (8am) on a Saturday. It was early enough to stay ahead of the crowds and not feel too congested on the paths. This park is absolutely gorgeous. The only downfall is you will probably not be impressed by other waterfalls once you have seen the array of bright blue falls here at Plitvice. The paths are all well marked and will lead you through the program that you select. We followed the C route and felt like we got the most out of the park. It took us about 4-5 hours to complete this circle if I recall properly. This is a must visit and is not really on the same level as anything else. I read some reviews that suggest Krka may be a better visit. I went to both and that is simply not true. Plitvice far surpasses any similar experience in the country.

The complaints that I'm seeing about being overcrowded and not accepting cash (which they now do) seem like silly things to take away from the whole experience. Is it crowded? Absolutely, but it's the NUMBER 1 UNESCO World Heritage Site in Croatia, so obviously it's busy... Any amount of research will tell you this, especially the fact that you must buy your tickets in advance. But that did not ruin my trip whatsoever as you are able to move through the very well-marked park at your own pace. Food and drink just ok? Well it's a national park, not a food court, so I'm not sure why food options would lower a rating of the amazing views.

I am semi reluctant to go on guided tours but was quite pleased by the treatment of the Apodos staff and especially our guide Renato. First, I would like mention that this is a long ride to get to this wonderful National Park. It takes some 3.5 hours or so and it good to be prepared for that. Also, it can be chilly so bring a sweater or light jacket just in case. The remainder of what I have to say is about our guide Renato.
From the time we departed until we arrived at the park, Renato provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the Croatian people in terms of the history, present realities of government and people as well as the future challenges and goals of Croatia. It was obvious that he had an impressive background and understanding of the many subjects that he addressed during our trip. Renato provided a wealth of information but was always sensitive as to not go too far and talk too much. However, after each of his short presentations as we traveled through various areas, he would receive many questions to expand on what he had to offer and he welcomed them with enthusiasm. Everyone on the excursion felt quite at home and interacted easily throughout the day.
While at the park, Renato was careful to ensure that everyone knew exactly where to go and what to do if they should have a question or get separated from the group. Again, he provided a wealth of information as we made the transition from our van to the park trails, to the boat crossing and back in a seamless manner. He watched over everyone without them really realizing it or having the feeling that they were being “guided.” It was a really spectacular and cool experience.

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"to do it properley does involve a fair bit of walking some of it quite strenuous.
Everybody loves Crotia. There is not a bit of this country that wasn't perfect.
It was being loved to death so covid will hopefully give it time to recover",Jun 2021
Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Beautiful! Cannot be described by words... I am so happy we choose this part of the year when everything is soooo green and water is still quite strong. We choose H path and I am happy about it. It has length of cca 10 km which is not too long and you can see all lakes (it would be a pity to skip some parts). Also, upper lakes are less crowded so you can truly enjoy there. It took us cca 4 hours. Don't drink too much because there are toilets only on few locations.",May 2021
Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Absolutely incredible. It would be such a shame to go to Croatia and not see Plitvice.

We spent 4 hours there. I'd say 2 hours absolute minimum. Up to 5.

Great way to see this is on the way from Zagreb to the coastal cities. A transnfer can take you there and you stop at the park which is kind of in the middle of Zagreb and the coast.

You can buy tickets from the Plitvice website I think for 80 kuna each. Don't buy from the vendors on tripadvisor who mark it up a lot. They sell tickets directly on the Plitvice Lakes park website.

Note that there are a lot of stairs to manage. So being in shape is important. Also, the path is narrow.

Enjoy!

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,Exiting natural phenomena. Waterfalls and lakes. Long paths for walking and hiking. Beautiful nature.,May 2021
Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,2.0,"The nature is absolutely amazing. BUT

1) You pay 200kn for tickets then you arrive and have to pay for parking 8kn per hour!!!!! Average time od walking around is approx 3 hours.

2) the lady at the info point and everybody that works there are rude and are sharing wrong information about boat tours and overall what to do in the park

3) once you have finished 3/4hours of walking you arrive at the bus station to take you to your car, but then the bus arrives full you have around 50people standing and wAiting to get on. Then the bus leaves and you are left waiting for another 30min as the park worker will say but when in reality it is 45min to an hour to wait for a new bus.

All in all 2/5 because of the nature everything else sucks specially the service

Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Perfect winter wonderland atmosphere.
Lakes look amazing during the winter and covered in snow. Maybe even better during the summer months.
Entrance is cheaper in this part of the year. Weekends still can be busy.
Some parts of the road may be closed due to slipper floors, but nevertheless, all the major sites remain open.",Jan 2021
Croatia,Plitvice Lakes National Park,5.0,"Plitvice Lakes, as the first national park in Croatia, was proclaimed in 1949. It's the oldest, largest and the most beautiful national park, situated in the mountainous region in Croatia, mainly in Lika - Senj County. This area has always attracted many visitors, including nature lovers and tourists, with its beauty. In 1997 National Park Plitvice was put on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The park covers the area of about 300 km square kilometres. There are 16 lakes divided in the Upper and Lower lakes cascading from one into another. The largest lake is Kozjak and you can take the sightseeing tour by boat. The greatest attraction is the exceptional waterfalls at the end of the lakes cascades. Also, you can enjoy the local home made food and drinks, and accommodation at the hotels near the lakes and in the surrounding area. There are two entrances to the national park ; 1 day entry ticket per person is 11 - 40 Euros ( depending on the season), children of age 7 - 17 ( 8 - 16) Euros, under the age of 7 is free.

Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"A bit of an uphill walk for a people with walking problems, but it wasn't a big deal for us. Still, there are many benches on the way if you need a rest. The actual fortress isn't huge but worth visiting for some amazing views. We also liked prison cells :) nice easy coffee shop with lovely sitting area is a great bonus in a nice sunny day.",Oct 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"Quite a climb in the summer hear, great views from the citadel but also on the way up too. At 7 Euro admission with no concessions it was overpriced for such a small site.",Sep 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Great walk and nice view, we had a guide who was really kind and telling us lots of history about Hvar too.
A shame about all the weird people at the top faking spontaneous pictures for their instagram though",Sep 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,Beautiful walk (I have asthma and I managed this without much difficulty) great accessible path that slowly winds up the mountain side - the steps through the old town is the hardest part! The gardens you walk through are beautiful and the view is out of the world! 100% worth the walk up for the view and the beautiful place. Can see why Hvar town is dubbed the St Tropez of the Adriatic!,Sep 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,The view from up there is the best thing you can get from a short trip on the island Hvar. The city itself is very nice with it's small cozy streets. The climb to the fortress is about 30-40minutes long.,Sep 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,We arrived at the bottom of the fortress about 11am before the tour trips begun to arrive. There are great views and entry to the fortress was inexpensive. The views are great. There are a few little areas to look at such as the prison and small area of artefacts.,Sep 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,Great views and a lovely location. Not sure the value of the entry fee as there’s very little to see and not a lot of information boards to explain the history but well worth a visit for the views alone,Sep 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,3.0,"At the entrance we got no ticket nor any kind of receipt, just a brochure.
The fort itself is pretty spectacular! But, as in many forts and castles around Croatia, there is a total absence of any kind of educational panels or text! Just one at the entrance and then a few of them concerning underwater archaeology. Except that, nothing. I presume most people go there for the view and pretty sunsets which are great, but to each it's own, I guess.",Aug 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"I think that when you are in Hvar, you should go to the fortress at least once because the way up there is not complicated at all. There are some stairs in the Old Town and then it is just an asphalted serpentine way so it is not very steep and there shade from the trees. It was much more pleasant than expected. When you arrive there, the fee is 50 kuna to enter the fortress and go more up and have better views of the city. There was also some kind of prison cell and canons. It is a quick visit and more to enjoy the views and say you have been there.",Aug 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"Amazing view!!!
It was a perfect sunset date with my husband ;)
Pakleniski island’s in front of us and kiss of sunset 🌆",Aug 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"From Hvar Old Town Main Plaza, the hike up the old city stairs is the steepest part of the walk. You can head up the alley from the plaza next to “Archie’s” for a direct route, or drive a car/bike around and up to a parking lot at the top.
When you enter to fort grounds walking from the old town, the walkway is not as steep and winds slowly to the fort.

There are great views from in front of the fort without paying the entrance fee, but the best views are from the walls. The $9USD entrance fee is not cheap, but there is a small museum, informative plaques, and of course your favorite Instagram moment of that’s what you’re looking for. We thought the prison was a cool place (no pun intended) as the prisoners had a good view of the sea. You’ll easily see all there is to see in 30 minutes or so. There is a restaurant within the fort walls, although we didn’t eat or drink there.

Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,"This fortress is very easy to reach, the road is wide and the parking lot is not small so there is always at least one place. The fortress can be reached on foot from the city center. The fortress is not large, but the view that stretches is enchanting. Entrance is 50kn per person. Within the fortress there are a couple of souvenir shops, a cafe and a small museum. Outside the fortress are benches in the shade with a beautiful view.",Jun 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,The walk up was not as bad as anticipated. The walway is smooth and there sre not that many steps. The grounds need some watering and tlc as there were several dry plants. We did not go inside the fortress but just enjoed the views of Hvar harbor.,Jun 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"It was totally worth the trek up the hill! Amazing view of this beautiful town and a cool historical site! We found the path very easily by using google maps and just putting the forts name in. Also, we enjoyed touring inside the fort (about 8$ per person). Would definitely go early morning at late afternoon when the temperatures are cooler.
You do need to wear good foot wear and be in relatively good shape. We went the equivalent of 26 flights of stairs according to my phone.",May 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,5.0,"We did not pay to go in to the fort, but we walked around after riding our electric bikes and enjoyed the fantastic views of Hvar Harbor. Definitely worth the trip up the hill if you're in Hvar.",Jun 2021
Croatia,Tvrdava Fortica,4.0,Really nice views and lovely walk up through the alleyways. Relaxing and easy walk. It was funny as we tried to go three times but struggled to find it. There are directions but none of the roads seemed to lead to it. So close yet so far! We finally got the right road but still struggled to get to the top. Probably just us! Would recommend.,Jun 2021

They are narrow with tall brightly colored buildings on both sides. There are lots of great small shops to buy art, pottery, and many other beautiful handmade items. There are numerous excellent restaurants. This might be my favorite small town in all of Europe.",Sep 2021
Croatia,Old Town,5.0,"Rovinj's old Town is in my opinion one of the best preserved and breath-taking of all Istria.
Lots of old houses, tiny alleys, peculiar shops and restaurants, you can walk for hours without getting bored and always seeing something new or worth taking a look at.
We've been coming for the past 4 years and every year we seem to enjoy it more and more. Life seems to slow down between the alleys, so grab a drink at one of the many bars, and just see people pass by while enjoying your time there.
Definitely recommended!",Aug 2021

It is not huge so you can reach everything on foot very well. There are of course a lot of bars and restaurants, especially along the water but in the centre of the old town it is mainly living area. It is located right next to the dock of Rovinj.",Aug 2021

Stroll through the little pedestrianised streets, grab a glass of wine sitting by the Adriatic and watch the yachts sailing past.
Lots of indie restaurants to enjoy fresh seafood and fish.
Tip: Park in one of the furthest away car parks and walk in as the nearer you get the more expensive it gets! Cars not permitted in the centre (unless you're a local).",Jun 2021
Croatia,Old Town,5.0,"Narrow alleys and passages; old and traditional buildings; bars, konobas and small restaurants popping out in most unexpected places; great sunset views; great walks throughout the city and always there is something new to discover.

Croatia,St. Mark's Church (Crkva sv. Marka),5.0,"The Church of St. Mark’s is the parish church of old Zagreb, Croatia, located in St. Mark's Square. It is one of the oldest architectural monuments in Zagreb.

On the roof, tiles are laid so that they represent the coat of arms of Zagreb (white castle on red background) and Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.

A church that has come to symbolise Zagreb with its decorative tiled roof. Sadly out of bounds to visitors following last year’s earthquake. Spectacular from the outside and well worth the visit. The pathway at the sides of the church are also closed off. Be sure to see the church from the south side.

Brilliant and spectacular. The must see in Zagreb.
