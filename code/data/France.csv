France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The Orsay is a wonderful museum in a beautiful old train station on the Seine. It has a light, bright calm feeling where you can enjoy the art. The Impressionist collection is the star. I suggest to start on the top floor (by the giant clock face) and work your way down). It's great to go on Thursday evenings when they are open until 9:45pm and there are less people. The audio tour was a small extra fee and had good info (plus an augmented realty view of the train station through history). Buy your tickets in advance from the museum's OFFICIAL website (others will charge you more).",Oct 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This was my favorite museum in Paris. I loved seeing my favorite impressionists—Monet, Van Gogh, Manet, Degas, and more.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I was a little bit skeptical of this museum since i am not a big impressionist fan. I was wrong. This is a fabulous museum. It's really big so if you have limited time focus on the masters - Van goth, Monet, Renior etc,.. When we were there they had most of their paintings on the 5th floor but there was also a special exhibit on the first floor with some really cool stuff as well. Van Goth's Starry Night alone is worth the price of admission.
Go early - we had skip the line tickets for 9:30 am on Sunday and the crowd was light. By the tome we left around 1 the museum was pretty full.
This a do not miss place in Paris.

France,Musée d'Orsay,1.0,"We had three days in Paris and this was the top of our list. We booked our tickets in advance and had all the necessary paperwork. However our 14 yr old daughter was denied entry on the basis her Covid test was taken in the U.K not in France, despite it stating it was recognised in the EU and taken within the specified 72 hours. This was made all the more frustrating as we had queued for over an hour to get our paperwork checked.",Sep 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"After traveling via the red eye to Paris, we decided to push through the jetlag and use the afternoon to sightsee. The museum is open late so we decided to go there. There are works from several famous painters including Manet, Monet, Cezanne, etc. Housed in a beautiful old building along the Seine, there is plenty to see here..... perhaps too much. Wander through the gallerys that interest you and move along. There is likely too much here to see everything. Recommended",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We went early on the first Sunday of October. It was free admission. By the time we left, it was standing room only.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"d'Orsay is smaller and generally less crowded than the Louvre, but whereas the Louvre probably takes a couple of visits to completely view, Musee d'Orsay is easier to view in a few hours - this was my impression on a first time visit in September, however, I think one of the floors was closed temporarily. The works displayed here are fantastic and generally more accessible than the Louvre on a crowded day.",Sep 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We chose to visit the Musee d'Orsay in Paris rather than one of the larger museums, like the Louvre. We spent about 3 hours wandering through the many rooms and halls of beautiful sculptures, paintings, and fascinating exhibits. The famous Monet and Van Gogh painting were absolutely gorgeous! When we left, we felt like we saw a lot, but were not totally overwhelmed. Beautiful old building as well. Amazing how the old train station was converted into an excellent space for a museum. Great experience!",Sep 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This spectacular old train station and its art collection are indeed better than Louvre. Wish I had read earlier review and started on fifth floor because by the time we got there and walked out for a magnificent view across the Seine, we were pooped from climbing, standing and listening to too much audio guide.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"1. It was my 5th time in Paris and I still think that it's the best art museum in Paris. Of course if you like impressionism ;)

2. The best pictures of impressionists and postimpressionists are here like Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Deags, Gauguin.

3. There is sculpture also, mainly on the ground floor.

4. Important for parents! Children have free entry and for you as a parent price is reduced (you pay 13 Euro, not 16 Euro).

5. Moving around is also quite easy. It's not so easy to get lost like in other museums of Paris.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This is the finest collection of Impressionist Art in the world, I believe. Buy your tickets for an early entrance as the Museum gets crowded even in Covid times. The audioguide is well done and worth the cost. But don’t try to listen to every available work or you will be exhausted before seeing all the highlights. Start at the top since that is the most popular and becomes crowded. There is an outdoor space near the coffee shop that was a good place to take a break and enjoy the Paris skyline. If you only go to one museum besides the Louvre, make it this one!",Sep 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This museum has a truly massive collection. If you like Impressionist art this is where you want to go. Paintings by Monet and Renoir as well as a number of original Van Gogh works grace the walls everywhere you look. My personal favorite are the massive paintings that can be found on the bottom floor. I believe that the first Sunday of the month is free and there are a few other discounts that you can get. They are listed on the website. All in all, this place is worth a visit if you appreciate good art.",Sep 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"There are few iconic paintings that anyone, from anywhere, from any age and from any culture, can recognise. The Musee d'Orsay has all of them. The incredible value of this museum is all there. You saw them in postcards, school books, social meme, on TV, everywhere (!), here you'll see them for real and they're breathtaking. A thorough visit may take 2-3 hours, but to see the world-known masterpieces, one hour and a half may well be enough. Top floor, plus some paintings hidden on the lower floors... go find them ;-) Don't miss Rodin's Gates of Hell. PS: 5th visit to date.",Sep 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The exterior of the Musee d'Orsay is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful buildings in Paris. The imposing building was built in 1900 and sits on the left bank of the River Seine. The original use of the building was for a railroad station. The Musee has a second building attached in the back. In the photo, you can see the half-circle exterior of the other building. Attached is a photo of the interior of the half-circle building.

As you look at this photo, the entrance is around the corner of the right side of the building. The stunning photo also includes a church (Basilica of Saint Clotide) and the ""Les Invalides"" building (with gold dome) which includes Napoleon's Tomb and the the beautiful chapel.

Don't miss the fifth floor which includes the Impressionist section. Enjoy !

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,I enjoy the Musee d'Orsay so much that I've visited it multiple times. The entire collection is impressive but the impressionist collection is especially wonderful. The size of the museum is large enough without feeling overwhelming and the atmosphere is very cool. My tip would be to go early and start on the top floors (impressionist and post-impressionist collection) and you will have considerably fewer crowds.,Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The Orsay Gallery is a great place to enjoy impressionist works. On the first floor, there are many sculpture on display. The building of Orsay Gallery is one of the three great art treasures of nowadays.",Aug 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Make sure you get a plan and be aware that some of the good stuff is right up top! But just like IKEA, it seems, expect to have to go through everything to get where you want to go. Fantastic museum, even for just the architecture. Plenty of the impressionists' and post impressionists' work on display here. Allow plenty of time. Free cloakroom. Audio guides are good but it seems there isn't commentary on a lot in the museum - all the important ones have some commentary. Overall, a wonderful Museum.",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,I've been visiting the Musee d'Orsay for 22 years. And each visit is a privilege. Feel very fortunate to be based in London - a short train ride away from this former beautifully converted train station.,Jul 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Utterly lovely collection in a gorgeous setting. Some of the escalators were out of service for our visit, but this was not a problem. I particularly loved architecture around the Art Nouveau collection - throughout the building, your eye is drawn to the details of the original train station, which adds to the whole experience. Great crowd management due to Covid-prevention rules meant that it did not get too busy while we were there.",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Absolutely no lines here and they have some outstanding art, especially from the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, the original ""Dr. Gachet"" being probably my favorite.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"What used to be a railway station and a hotel has now turned into a museum. Such an impressive building, which was built on a golden era, where the architects surely took the extra step in designing an over the top building.

This is a must see while in Paris, not only because of the amazing art collections it features from time to time, but also as an architectural monument, a piece of art by itself! Lovely to observe from the outside at all times of the day and night throughout the year.",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I like the size compared to the Louvre. Like most of the museums in Paris, the building is beautiful. There's a lot to look at, spent 3 hours inside.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Excellent museum, for sure.....
YET in this review, I'd like to nudge museum administration about the quality of toilet facilities -- the 3 women's toilets on the 6th floor (yes, only 3) were poorly equipped (all missing paper).

For a popular, top-notch Paris museum open to the public who pay for the privilege of entering,it is ""la moindre des choses"" to offer a decent standard of hygiene to those who come to the museum.",Jun 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Museum is really fantastic. I was so impressed of such a big magic collection of the biggest painters and artists. I even bought the book about museum and paintings. Interior is beautiful and good complicated. We use the phone guide and were happy enough. Very interesting stories.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"If you love art, especially the Impressionist period, then this is it!

Lovely restaurant inside (closed for Covid, so check before you go).",Jun 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The entire experience is WOW factor! The history of the building itself is amazing, it is just so spectacularly beautiful that is difficult to believe that someone actually wanted to demolish it - thank goodness it was preserved and converted to a museum. The art collection is just so impressive, there really does have to be something in here to please everyone. The collection of art nouveau furniture is greater than anything I have ever seen and the collection of impressionist work is the most impressive point for my visit. Just so overwhelmed to see some of the works I have in print at home, actually hanging here on the walls - just wonderful really. Loved every minute of it.",Jun 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Just a bit of advice for those lucky folks headed to Paris ! If you are planning to visit the Musee d'Orsay or the Louvre, buy your tickets on-line at home. The lines are painful and you will deeply regret having to spend valuable vacation time waiting in line.",Jun 2020

This was the most enjoyable visit every. With no Foreign tourists in Paris, we found the museum almost completely to our own. We arrived at 10, stayed several hours and never had a crowd. We are able to enjoy the art especially the Impressionists art without the push of others around you. Ate in the cafe and it too was very quiet and relaxed. We love the Louvre as well, but this is a much easier museum to handle in just a few hours.",Oct 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The Paris commune of 1871, the world's fair of 1900, and President Pompidou contributed to the creation of Orsay. The Orsay Palace burned down during the Commune. The Paris-Orleans railway station was built for the world's fair. When the station became indecently small for long post-war trains, it was decided to demolish it. However, the successor of the legendary de Gaulle, President Pompidou, decided to save it and supported the project of creating a Museum here. The Museum was given its former name, and the monstrous Museum of modern art was named after Pompidou. Pompidou did not wait for the opening of the Museum and died, and the Orsay Museum was opened 16 years later, not even under his successor Giscard d’Éstaing, and in the time of Mitterrand. The French conquerors and millionaires collected so many works of art that there was no Museum of suitable size, so they were divided into 3: the Louvre, the Orsay and the Pompidou. Orsay inherited art from the revolution of 1848 to the beginning of the first world war in 1914. The Louvre contained all the art before the European revolution. Its collection is huge and filled with world masterpieces, but there is one cardinal advantage of the Orsay over the Louvre in the eyes of tourists. You can get to Orsay for free throughout the year on the first Sunday of the month, and to the Louvre only on Bastille day on July 14! There is a difference. The Orsay Museum is difficult to see in one visit, so it's worth setting priorities. However, the Louvre can not be viewed in principle. After waiting in line for an hour and a half on the first Sunday, you get to the first floor in the Central hall filled with sculptures, where there are many sculptures of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. Paintings of Ingres and Delacroix Romantica is a side gallery on the right. The realists millet and Courbet are in the gallery opposite. The main hits here are Millet's ""The Gleaners"" and two paintings by Courbet, a revolutionary in life (a member of the Paris commune) and in painting ""A Burial At Ornans""and ""tThe Origin of the World "". The revolutionary nature of the ""A Burial At Ornans"" is that in the multi-figure composition Courbet showed not historical figures or religious figures, but ordinary peasants. The Origin of the World is striking even now in the age of porn sites. The artist's irony is embedded in the title of the picture, because the female vagina is frontally depicted on it. 2 years ago, the hypothesis that the model on the canvas is Courbet's mistress was refuted. From the correspondence of Alexander Dumas-son with George Sand, it turned out that the model was a Parisian dancer-concubine of a Turkish diplomat. He was the customer of the scandalous picture. On the second floor of Orsay, separate from the impressionist halls, there are works by van Gogh with his famous self-Portrait and Gauguin with his bronzy juicy Tahitians. The third and fourth floors are filled with objects of decorative and applied art in the art Nouveau style. I missed them. Sofas and massive clocks do not cause me artistic awe, but as the French say: Don`t argue about tastes and colors. And finally, the fifth floor is the most important. This is where the most exciting collection of Impressionists Degas, Manet, Seurat, Sisley, Pizarro, Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet and Renoir are located. Drowning in Impressionists don't forget to look at Paris from the top of the observation deck on the roof of the Museum through the clock. To plunge again...

We prefer to travel and visit places on our own so we do our research before visiting.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Beautiful museum with some of the best art in the world.

If I had one suggestion for the museum it would be to have something that would make the museum more child-friendly (scavenger hunt - in each room, find the painting with the woman wearing a red hat, find the painting with the spotted dog, etc.) to ensure children remain engaged. If children remain engaged their parents can more fully enjoy the museum and gamification is a great way in which to drive people/children to action.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,Must see for any visitor to Paris. Fantastic collection of impressionist & post-impressionist art. They are doing some renovations so the layout of some rooms has changed. Tissot Exhibition was a big draw and wonderful to see but very busy. Visited with teenage daughter who did not approve of all the nudity in the paintings & no amount of explaining about technique would appease her! She perked up at Van Gogh as he preferred flowers to naked women. Nice rooftop with great view of the Tuileries. Cafe looked decent although we didn’t eat there. All in all a worthwhile visit.,Jul 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Bluntly you either want to visit the Orsay or you don’t. In many ways, I prefer it to the Louvre as I like the (comparatively) smaller collection and ability to focus on themes rather than “everything”.

As of July 2020, it’s far quieter than normal and Covid precautions are mainly limited to masks. I’m assuming some of the individual areas may have restrictions on numbers that are lower than normal but the Tissot exhibit was the equivalent of a London gallery “mid week busy” - not bad but as busy as you’d want without queuing to see pieces.

There are building works in some parts of the gallery - the signage is generally ok but at times misleading. If anything the areas that are closed help focus on the other (probably better) collections!

When we went sadly 2 floors were closed to the public so we only spent about 2 hours here. The Van Gogh section was worth it! They was a restaurant on site. Recommend heading straight to the back and take the elevator up to the top floor and work your way down.,Oct 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"I booked an early morning guided tour of this incredible museum that houses the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world. Painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Wished I had time to see the le modèle noir (the black model) exhibit after our tour. Unfortunately my son and I only had a bit of time to eat lunch at the museum because we had to meet a group for our next tour.
**Keep in mind this exhibit was on display last May 2019 a year before this injustice happening in American in 2020. This just makes me even sadder I didn’t get to see these masterpieces; artists from from Géricault to Matisse and get pics.
The restaurant in the museum is upstairs and also has an awesome display of colorful glass art. As a food blogger my only excuse for not getting pics is we were in a rush. From what I remember I had a simple salad and ordered my 6 year old (now 7) had a burger and fries. I remember the price was a bit high for the average food I got but I expect that from a museum restaurant.
I am giving this museum a 4 star because I thought the food was overpriced.

Inside, the museum is huge and there are so many exhibits to enjoy! I doubt whether 1 day is enough to see everything, but in any case one must estimate at least 3 hours for a quick walk in all rooms. If you are a fan of Impressionism, you will be delighted, as the collection of impressionist paintings is staggering. We hadn't buy our tickets in advance (although I usually do it everywhere), but alhtough the queue was quite long, it didn´ take much time to wait before entering, less than 30 minutes.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We stopped by here as part of our morning while planning to do some other sightseeing in the afternoon. We had already visited the Louvre in which we spent about half the day exploring all there was to see. Because of this, we weren’t quite sure what to expect and if we’d be in for another long day. The museum is located just across the river from the Louvre surrounded by small streets which would make you not notice it at first. It originally served as a train station and was eventually turned into a museum later on. While keeping with the theme of a train station the layout of the museum is very different and at times confusing. Nevertheless, it is great to see how this building was repurposed and still kept the intiial charm. This museum is much easier to get through and offers plenty to see over several floors. The top floor also offers some great views of the surrounding city including the giant clock which perfectly frames the basilica in the distance. If we had to choose, the Louvre would be our top pick but this was also great to stop by since it was included in our Klook museum pass that we had purchased for 22 USD for 48 hours of access to a long list of sites in Paris!

I started with the 4-5th floor dedicated to Impressionism, and walked down the building to the main sculpture terrace. There were some halls devoted to art in furniture and decoration stuff, but I was not really kin on those ones, but I have to say that I saw some very nice art expressions. There was an exhibition called “Black Models: From Géricault to Matisse”, and this room was indeed crowded, so that I missed some paintings due to the amount of people; it was indeed very good, anyway. Elevators are available in the museum, it was crowded, but halls are ample. I got fast access with the Museum Pass.

The crowds were huge so look at what is on when you plan to go.
on the ground floor everyone go into this sidestep pattern so we all moved along together doing a side step , but had people pushing in to take selfies, with the art as a poor mans backdrop.
It may sound as if I had a poor time , but I did not. Certainly people's behaviour was rude etc but the use of the old station and the space provided was clever and allowed you to get away from the crowd and enjoy the experience with other works. Spend a day and you will still not see it all

We were here for 2 hours but it deserves at least 4. The cafe looked lovely and I wish we could have stopped for a bite.,Mar 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Ou est Pompon? Pompon is the artist that created the iconic bear sculpture in this museum and if I'm not mistaken this bear is the museum mascot of sorts. This museum has it all. If you abhor the overly elitist art collection and want to avoid the touristy Mona Lisa fans waiting in line for a selfie at the Louvre you will love this museum. Many iconic works are here. There are sculptures and paintings here. The architecture of the museum inside and out is breathtaking. There are two cafes and three gift shops at least. What I did not like is all the stair climbing yo have to do. You may have to retrace a ton of steps to get to where you want to be a few times too. The cafe at the top is gorgeous. The iconic clock window offers a gorgeous view of Sace Coeur in the distance. There was a pretty long line for a seat in the cafe on the lower level.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Went in October last year with husband and teenage sons ...I knew how impressed they would be as I've been before.

The fifth floor is the highlight with all the impressionist masters , apart from the two French school parties who all sat with their teachers right in front of "" Starry night"" and two other Van Gogh's pieces.
This meant that you couldn't get any more than 3/ 4 metres near the paintings....I k ow that's a bit petty ut quite irritating.
Good news is that if your children, under 24, bring their ID they enter free of charge !

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I visited the museum recently and the security was good at the door. The collection of impressionist paintings, sculptures, the more recent furnitures and more were all very impressive and educational. Too bad I missed Huysmans exhibition which just finished. The shaking thing was too many tourists take photos of anything, selfies in front of such precious pieces of art, what a shame, no respect ...",Mar 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"If you are a fan of impressionist art, this is a place you must go. It is over flowing with all sorts of different impressionist artists, along with a nice assortment of statues as well. The building itself used to be a train station and the architecture shows this, and it adds to the character of the whole place. There is also a whole lot to see here and I recommend taking your time as you travel through. My one complaint is that there is an excessive amount of escalators. There was one place where I was trying to get up to the next floor, and there were at least three flights of escalators just to reach the top. Not a huge thing, I just felt an elevator would have done a better job in that situation.",Feb 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Second only to the fabulous Louvre in terms of our favourite museums in Paris on this trip, this place was great for impressionist paintings especially - just chock full of famous paintings by famous artists.

We were cramming all of Paris' main attractions into 5 days, so we covered this in just a few hours, but it was enough to see the highlights. Unlike the Louvre it is well laid out, and has some great restaurants as well. Highly recommended.",Feb 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,A much more manageable museum than the Louvre and filled with the classics of the French impressionists. GO!,Nov 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Pick a postcard. Any postcard. Well, pretty much any postcard you've seen with the photo of a painting on it. With the exception of the Mona Lisa (it's in the Louvre, and it's probably not worth the money) and the roof of the Sistine Chapel (it's in Rome, and it's a roof), chances are the original is here. Monet, Manet, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec... the list of famous painters and sculptors goes on. You can comfortably spend a day wandering around this beautiful gallery without getting bored or your eyes glazing over.
Refreshment wise, the restaurant is excellent, and a stunning place to eat, but pricey.
If you're debating between museums/galleries, and you only have time to go to one, then choose this one. You won't regret it.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,We chose to visit here instead of the Louvre because so many people recommended it over the Louvre. We spent most of our time with the Impressionists and it was amazing to stand so close the the actual paintings of people we had heard about all of our lives. Truly mind-blowing.

The Impressionist paintings spoke to us more and this houses a large collection, along with two floors of sculptures. While also large, it’s easier to navigate than the Louvre.

Featuring mostly French art, the museum was built in a late 1800s style train station that was abandoned. The architecture is a spectacle in itself.

Only limitations: only place you can eat and drink is in the cafes. We had to wait a long time to get in as it was busy. There were also very big queues too for the toilets - but I suppose to be expected. The audio tour is highly recommended.,Feb 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Great Monet and Van Gogh collection and wonderful pieces by Camille Pissarro, Bonnard, Manet. Very well laid out and marked- I loved the Louvre, but it was overwhelming whereas I found d’Orsay much more relaxed and enjoyable. It could be that we did Louvre in the summer and here in February, so it was far less crowded. We didn’t get tickets ahead of time, there was no line (we arrived around 11am). In my opinion, it’s a must when in Paris.",Feb 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"If you're a fan of Van Gogh and Impressionist artists like Monet, the d'Orsay should definitely be on your list. So many incredible artworks to see including pretty much a whole room for Van Gogh and some pretty amazing sculptures including the original Statue of Liberty and a Rodin work featuring the Thinker. So much to look at and the audio guide really adds to the experience by explaining what artworks mean/their significance.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Well, having studied the Impressionism and Post-Impressionism movements I was really eager to visit this museum and it didn't disappoint. It was such a great pleasure to finally contemplate all paintings that I only knew from books!!
The museum has two small shops and 3 cafes inside to ensure you can spend a long time in there.
Only downside for me was finding rooms and directions was not straight-forward. The layout of the museum kind of makes you to walk back and forth between aisles and rooms so you have to keep an eye on the map to ensure you're not missing anything. Probably doing a bit of planning before the visit might help with this.

It is free for people under 12 and a reduced price for under 26.  It has been created in an old train station. At the top you have a good view. The only bad thing was the fact that some of the staff was bossy and unkind.,Feb 2020

This is the epicentre of impressionism in Paris. Even though it was free day the crowds weren't as big as you would expect, we only queued for 20 minutes and it was quite a relaxed and civilised affair.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Despite two floors being out of service for works, it took a while to get round this museum. Study the plan well and make sure you don't miss any of the galleries. It would be easy to miss exhibits here, go through the gallery on the top floor from the shop end, and make sure you go beyond the cafe to the galleries beyond! We bought a joint advance ticket combined with the Orangerie, and were were glad we went there first as woks there meant we only needed a short visit to see the Monet Water lilies and could move on the the Musee d'Orsay. Orangeries opens at 9 so there is time to go there and get to d'Orsay just after it opens (9.30).",Feb 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Thankfully, Paris did not implode their palatial central railroad station to build a modernist sporting arena (yes, I'm looking at you New York!) but instead have invested the space with the finest of fine art of the past 150 years.
Clearly the life-altering visual orgy focuses on the upper level collection of impressionist, neo & post-impressionist art. Basically, every masterpiece Albert Barnes didn't bring to America (Philly reference here!) hangs here in unequaled density and quality.
If there is a single building in Paris which might inform urban architects as to beauty, context and restoration; this is the one. Sadly, its lessons have fallen on deaf ears.
PRO TIP: There is a >half-hour wait for students to Instagram themselves in front of the iconic giant glass clock-face. But, there are two such faces...the other is in the cafe, excellent service and even a door to the roof-deck, no waiting!

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,Our first trip to Paris — January proved to be a great time to visit some of the museums since the crowds were less than summer and no wait if you purchase tickets before! The Louvre was amazing but a bit overwhelming and lighting not that great—hard to see some of the artwork. Musee d’Orsay was our favorite — the layout of the museum and the lighting was perfect.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"No wonder this gem is TA Nr.1.
First of all it's a magnificent Beaux Arts bldg on the Seine embankment, opposite the Louvre gardens catching your eye.
Second, it's former use as a train station gives it a unique, vast interior and special character.
Third and most important, the exhibits are mind blowing with best European impressionists.
In my opinion it's better than Louvre which is too large and complicated. Orsay is very concrete and easy to navigate.",Dec 2019

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I’m embarrassed to share that I’ve visited Paris more than once and had never been to Musée d’Orsay until this visit. The entry into the main gallery space took my breath away! And the collections were phenomenal. If you love Impressionist art, this is your place. Matisse, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Gauguin and even Whistler’s Mother! Easier to navigate than the Louvre and we were even able to see a Degas retrospective. They offer a two-day museum pass with Musée de l’Orangerie, but we were unable to take advantage of it because a major pension protest was planned for the next day. A museum not to be missed!",Jan 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The D'Orsay is housed in a stunning Beaux-Arts building, a former railway station, now adapted to show off art dramatically. A wonderful place to see Impressionism, especially - the Impressionists are housed on the top floor under a skylight, and this work shines in the natural light.
Beautifully ornate dining room that's worth the investment if you decide to spend a longer time here.
I have been here over 30 times and it does not get old.
The Carte Musee lets you skip the line and the line is the worst part of the D'Orsay...it can be brutal getting in here - but it should not be missed.",Nov 2019

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"My first visit years ago sparked an appreciation of art. Especially Impressionism.

Today the museum is just good. Better than the louvre inmho.

The only negative is that there has a special exhibit of degas and the opera and the paintings had such large frames that the top of the pictures was in shadow. Very clumsy.",Jan 2020

One of my very favorite French art museums and highly recommended.",Jan 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I spend a lot of time here. Tips: avoid Tuesdays unless very off-peak season. The Louvre is closed so visitors opt for here. Don't neglect side galleries, which are rarely as crowded as the top floor impressionists and post-impressionists. The museum is much bigger than you may at first think. Easy to spend a day here or, in my cases, days and days. Free, and crowded, on first Sunday of month.",Jan 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This museum is by far, my favorite museum in Paris. It is advisable to get the “museum pass” before you go so you can skip the line. We went on a rainy day and it got crowded, so go early. Take your time and enjoy the view and don’t worry so much about taking a photo of every piece.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We visited on the first Sunday of the month when they were offering free tickets. As expected there were long queues, but these were managed extremely well and we were inside after about 20 minutes.

With only an hour and a half to spare, we went straight to the Impressionist, Neo-Impressionist and Post-Impressionist exhibitions, which were superb. The curation was first class, with really clear explanations of some of the technical aspects of the paintings. It was great to be introduced to artists I'd never heard of before, as well as see more familiar works up close.

Definitely recommended.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This is huge by all standards. We can spend days together in seeing the artifacts and can never be completed in a single day. So much history at a single place is a feast for any history lover. Downside is, 1 day is not enough.

Any given day this is better then Louvre, save the building.",Jun 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This museum is worth visiting if you like European art, mostly from the 1800s with some earlier and later works.

There are great view of Paris from the top floor so be sure to go up the escalator or stairs and enjoy the windows.",Jan 2020
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I don’t know much about art but the masterpieces here can easily take your breath away. Appreciating the intense work that went into each piece it itself humbling, and I found myself inspired by the beauty that is so well cared for here. Be warned that, even on a supposedly light day, there are crowds, some of whom are there simply for “selfie” purposes and think nothing of pushing you aside in order to get the best angle for themselves.",Dec 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Would recommend 100%.
Set in an old train station with many of its original features.

Van Gogh is very popular - lots of people taking pictures . Hard to admire a little bit with people shoving cameras about..

As a layman I really just wanted to be spoon fed the route to the ‘highlights’ with some info

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,If you know anything about art you already know about the Musee D'Orsay. It truly lives up to the expectations. I am a big fan of post-impressionism paintings and this has some of the masterpieces and representation by the top artists of that genre.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This was my second trip to the Musee d'Orsay but it had been awhile and I loved it again.

First thing to do is to go up to the 5th floor and work your way down. The top floor is where you will see the Monet, Degas, Renoir, etc. Amazing collection.

The current Degas exhibit was exceptional, especially with the audio guide to help you gain the rich background of his times, the art world, and the Opera Garnier (new opera house) and its history.",Jan 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Don't try and do the whole museum in one day - it's overwhelming especially if you have children - I was given this advice before going and it proved to be worth it. We chose just to do the section of the impressionist artists and then ambled around the entrance and restaurant areas. We spent 2 hours there - more than enough especially with a 6 year old. This said the museum is really worth a visit, just decided what you're going to see before arriving.",Nov 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Plan to spend an entire day here, maybe just on Level 5. Try and get here early as the crowds swell massively around lunchtime.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"I’m not normally a big fan of art galleries, but Musee d’Orsay left me pleasantly surprised.
I enjoyed walking around and looking at all the art. I specifically remember thinking how surprised I was that I was enjoying myself. This is likely due to the short queue and lack of crowds inside. I actually also really enjoyed exploring the building itself, interesting architecture and design.
Being in Paris and looking at art feels right. So I would recommend visiting, even if, like me, you question if looking at big paintings is a good way to spend a holiday, you might be pleasantly surprised.",Feb 2019

France,Musée d'Orsay,1.0,"We purchased ""Reserved access"" tickets and waited 90 minutes in the reserved access line. We were rushed into the museum after 90 minutes of waiting in the cold. To be clear....we were on premises 4 1/2 hours before closing time. Once in the museum we were told they were closing early so we only had 60 minutes (instead of 2 1/2 hours after the wait in line) but literally 30 minutes later they closed all of the rooms and did not allow further access as they herded us out like cattle.

France,Musée d'Orsay,2.0,"This museum is always a painful experience. The waiting line outside in the cold, on a windy plaza is particularly annoying. It is at least 30 minutes with a reserved ticket and at least one hour to an hour and a half without reservation so bring a good coat and scarf and hat, eventually you will need all of it while you wait. However be aware that you will have to spend as much time again inside if you want to check your coat so make sure it will be light enough to carry it on for the entire duration of your visit. In the summer make sure you bring strong sun tanning lotion as you will be burnt by the time you get to the door. Also MAKE sure you will have a big meal before arriving: there is only one restaurant with mediocre food and an insolent staff that considers serving a special favor, not a job, so be ready to spend at least an hour and a half for your meal if it’s simple up to 2 hours if you have several courses The cafes are worse with not enough seating so you can wait again after making your purchase.
The security staff by the doors is unbearably rude, much worse than going through a security check point in an airport in China. They enjoy screaming and howling instructions that no one can understand because they don’t speak French, although they think they do, and that you will understand better if they yell louder, they act and look like recent refugees that are more familiar with border patrol behavior.
The design for this museum may have been great for the much smaller crowds of 30 years ago but the spaces are now cramped and inadequate for the viewing of the paintings. This is painfully evident in the Impressionist galleries. It’s easy to resolve this problem with timed tickets but the staff remains attached to an obsolete method of stamping tickets instead.
The crowds on the hallways leading to an important exhibit there will remind you of trying to get to the toilet on a crowded dance club on New Years Eve. And you will find that the entrance to the temporary exhibition is at the very end from the entrance of the museum so that you will struggle for st least another half hour through the crowds viewing the permanent collection before you get to the roped entrance to the exhibit that will again, demand more time to get in. This methodology of permanent frustration is doubtlessly a tribute to the memory of the Marquis de Sade and can not be taken as accidental mismanagement.
Even buying a catalogue can be a tortured process in the inadequately small and crowded book shop or much worse at the exit from the exhibit where a large table with books and cards will bring back the atmosphere of frantic grabbing and pushing of a sale day at the grand bazaar in Istanbul.
By the time you get to the art and you decompress from the brutality of the process of getting to it you may bee too exhausted or upset to be able to see anything properly never mind appreciating anything.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Understandably, everyone went on the first Sunday of the month as it is free! So it was very busy. The 5th floor, was, as always, pleasing. This time, on the ground floor, there was a Degas exhibition, which was amazing.
I also enjoyed a nice glass of wine at the very picturesque cafe on the 5th floor!",Jan 2020

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We had been to Paris 3 times previously but had not been to this museum so it was a ""must do"".
We did not book reserved tickets so walked to the entrance and took pot luck. We did not have to wait very long and got in reasonably quickly.
This former train station is simply brilliant.
The artwork is stunning. Some of the great masters such as Monet, Manet, Gaugin and van Gogh are displayed in excellently designed galleries on severl floors.
There are also sculpture by Rodin and other great sculpturers so it is truely worth the visit.
The highlight for me was seeing Starry Night by van Gogh. It is well worth seeing and also works by Monet were equally brilliant.
You could stay for hours at this place if you wanted to.

We did not feel overwhelmed by all the paintings and sculptures...it was a very comfortable visit. And the view of Paris from the upper floors was spectacular. The impressionist collection was magnificent...so many famous works.
We used a combination of information to navigate the museum. The Rick Steves app was a nice introduction to the artwork.
We will definitely return to Musee d'Orsay on our next visit to Paris.",Dec 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Though this was our third visit to Paris, this was the first time we visited the Musee D'Orsay. I'd heard it was going to be busy and it absolutely was, but it was still well worth it. As it was the festive period, we thought it would be prudent to get advance tickets through our hotel. It's worth noting that, although these were called queue-jumping tickets, there was still a queue but it only took about 20 minutes to gain access. The galleries featuring the Impressionists were very busy but bear with it; it's worth it. The only painting that we couldn't get anywhere near, curiously, was Van Gogh's Starry Night Over The Rhone. Everything else could be seen up close and marvelled over. The rest of the museum is also worth a look (and is much less busy). We particularly enjoyed the Degas exhibition and the wonderful Whistler's Mother, which we got to see totally uninterrupted by any other visitor.

Unlike most of the visitors that I noticed they went straight to the upper level (where the famous and big artists were). The gift shop was not as great as Pompidou, though.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Musee d'Orsay has incomparable works of art. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there but it's quite difficult to see it all in one day & without a guide. The audio sets are helpful but next time, we will bring a guide to help us navigate this very large museum.

Another benefit of a guide is I believe it gets you priority entry. Even though we purchased advanced tickets & didn't have to wait in the ticket buying line, the line for ticket holders was long & it took us about 30 minutes to get in. Someday, perhaps the museum will employ a more efficient & speedy entry process.

This was worth the time and the money.",Oct 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This is my favorite Paris museum by far. The Louvre is a must see but it is huge and overwhelming. The Orsay has a beautiful collection of French Impressionist art, along with being a gorgeous building in and of itself. You can see the entire collection within about 3 hours- more if you spend lots of time in each gallery. It's not huge, it's well laid out, you don't feel like you are missing something (which can happen at the Louvre).
You can get tickets online ahead of time but they must be picked up at a tourist site- NOT at the museum.

A couple of galleries were closed due to the strikes in France while we were there so we actually got a discounted ticket which was nice.

Get there before opening as you will have to wait outside in line to get through security. Pregnant ladies- alert the staff you are pregnant and you can skip right to the front of the line. The French treat pregnant women very well.

France,Musée d'Orsay,2.0,"Beware, this ticket doesn't get you into the museum as quickly as it implies. In fact, I do believe I would have gotten in quicker if I had gone to the standard ticket line. To explain: there are 2 basic lines, one for those with tickets (like this one), and those without tickets. The line for those with tickets wrapped around the block - I arrived at 0930 (museum opening time) and I did not step foot inside the building until 10:40. That's correct, I waited over an hour in the ""Skip the Line"" line. The line for those without tickets was relatively short - it didn't even extend beyond the line setup laid out by the museum. The only way to really skip the line is to book a tour which does get you into a special entrance.",Dec 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This is my favourite gallery. Be prepared to queue for 40 mins outside, rain or shine waiting for security checks. It's worth the wait.

If you love impressionist painters such as Monet, Manet and Renoir you will love it. Also the Van Gogh paintings were fantastic too, especially as I missed out on going to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (bonus side you are not allowed to take photos in the Van Gogh Museum however here you are). The other thing that is a must here is Rodin’s Gates of Hell, the plaster version, however if you have time you must visit the Rodin Museum to see the bronze version. The views through the windows at the top as you head to the impressionist paintings are brilliant including the Sacre Coeur and The Louvre. Also the Clock face overlooking the Seine and in the main building are impressive, it reminds you that this used to be a Train Station. From here you can walk over the pedestrian bridge to the Tuilerie Gardens and visit the L’Orangerie to see Monet’s famous Water Lillies (a larger extension to the solo one in the Musee D’Orsay). We had the Paris Museum Pass so used Skip The Line, although there was still a shorter queue to get through security.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"If there's one museum in Paris that I would not miss, it would be the Musee D'Orsay. It is conveniently located close to the Seine river walk. Easy to find. It use to an old train station that was built for the world fair. It had a grand hotel too. After the fair, it stood unused until the ministry of cultural affairs turned it in to a museum and thank god they did. What a splendid place this is... incredible. I know nothing of art or curating for a museum, but the power of a good curator can be felt even by untrained eyes like mine, especially on the 5th floor. Thats where I recommend you start your journey. The exhibition starts with joyful colors of Monet, Renoir, and Gaugain among others. Then you move to some revolutionary era art by Maximillian Luce. Its a bit dark. Then Monet brings you back to joy with vivid colors and happy festoons.

Walk down the floors to see greek and roman sculptures. Also check out any temp art shows they may be hosting. I saw Degas.

Pro tips: There is bathroom on the 6th floor. Its usually less used and clean because few people realize its there.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Thanks to the advice of my TripAdvisor friends on the Paris forum and those new friends who reviewed this attraction before we arrived, I knew to go straight to the fifth floor to see the impressionist paintings (Claude Monet et ses amis). And what a great idea suggestion that was!! It was so fantastic and incredible! Truly breathtaking and mesmerizing!! Amazingly fantastic!! It was unbelievable to be in the middle of such remarkable and historical art treasures.... do you understand that I loved it?

How about this- after admiring and looking out from the fifth floor though the massive analog clock on the wall of this old train station, I explored the first few rooms up there... until I entered gallery 35. I actually stopped in my tracks- breathless at the priceless treasures hanging directly in front of me- 12 (or was it 15) of Monet’s most enduring and famous masterpieces- all in one room, including four versions of the entrance to the cathedral at Rouen at different times of day and different sun exposures.

After a while, Mrs. H contacted me via WhatsApp so that we could move on. I responded that I was fixated and stuck in the room, figuratively jaw hanging open at the quantity of beauty revealed to me in that room.

... but after a while, I tore myself away and explored the also fantastic other parts of the museum. And I admired the structure of this fantastic museum in a renovated train station- from the entry level and also from the roof level.

The museum has fantastic art and sculptures on its ground floor too- I also enjoyed that very much.

Listen folks- anyone coming to Paris for vacation should visit this place.

Yes- it can be a challenge to get in with the admission lines and it can be incredibly crowded... but hey- there is a reason for that.

Our practical experience- we arrived on a late October weekday with the Paris Museum Pass and were in line at 0915 for 0930 opening of door C. We were inside within 10 minutes after that.

You know me already from my many other reviews, so this is where I invite you to “like” this review, to read all my other reviews about Paris and other locations, and to enjoy all the photos that I’ll post.

And I’ll close by writing that all this is true because——

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"On our second visit to Paris, we did not want to miss Orsay after already seeing Louvre. We had initially planned to spend about 2 hours visiting the museum but we spent about 1.5 hours only on the ground floor, when the main Impressionist exhibition is on the fifth floor, so please take this into account and allow at least 3-4 hours for your visit. The Impressionist gallery is really ""impressive"" and I would reccomend taking an audio guide, because it creates a better understanding of the paintings. My favourite paintings are ""Bal du moulin de la Gallette"" by Renoir and ""Starry night"" by Van Gogh.",Dec 2019

France,Musée d'Orsay,3.0,Beautiful art but not laid out very well. We arrived at 1500 and purchased a combo ticket as they advertised the other museum was going to be open until 1830. This museum closed early - without us knowing and so did the other. We wasted our money as the museums are closed on Monday and we are returning home on Tuesday.

Unfortunately, due to the strike the post-impressionism exhibit was closed. This was our second time at the Orsay; the first was over 20 years ago. Always enjoyable. Lines were short this time given the time of year.",Dec 2019

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Fabulous art gallery, much smaller and less frenetic than the Louvre. Current Degas exhibition was really great and I loved the Impressionist floor. No wait to get in either. Loses a star only because 3 floors were closed and we were booted out early at 4.45pm without warning - possibly due to the current strikes? A tip to save money is to buy a joint ticket at the Rodin museum ( which is well worth a visit too) for 21 euros which saves you about 6 euros overall.",Dec 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,My wife and I went to d'Orsay on our first trip to Paris with my wife and my god this has got to be the best-kept secret in Paris! Sure the Louvre is the Louvre but OMG the pieces in this Museum are breathe taking! Simply Breathtaking!,Jan 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,2.0,"So I basically purchased a ticket online before my trip. I went to the museum and when I got there there were hundreds of people waiting on a line.

I thought that there was a separate line for ticket holders but no. So I tried to talk to the security people to try to clarify my ticket situation they were really down right rude and most unhelpful. It was chaos.

It turns out that pre- purchasing a ticket doesn’t guarantee you entry. I left because I had a few days in Paris and standing on line for 3 hours something I wanted to endure. When I returned home I protested the charge with my credit card company and managed to luckily get my money back.

The museum is massive, so allow a full day to see almost everything. There are lockers for coats and bags on the lower levels, so you do not have to carry everything everywhere. Photography is allowed. There is a restaurant, but wer did not eat there so I cannot tell you about it.",Nov 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Unlike every other museum in Paris, Musee d'Orsay is open on Tuesdays- so my husband and I decided to come here in the afternoon. There was a short wait to go through security and buy tickets, but worth it. Skip the main floor which is mostly sculptures and go off to the sides and upper floors for really gorgeous paintings. There is a huge selection of classic Monet paintings as well as Van Gogh and Renoir. Really beautiful and manageable, plus the setting of the old train station with the massive clocks is stunning.",Dec 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The Impressionist movement arguable represents the endearing heart of Paris better than any other artistic period. And this museum delivers some of the most endearing and indelible paintings of that era (for the rest, go to MoMa in New York).",Dec 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Must confess that I've heard about Musee d'Orsay before but never paid much of attention. After many years of visiting Paris, I decided to give it a try and I""m so disappointed that I've never been to this place before.

It""s an old train station that was going to be destroyed, but they decided to transform in a museum instead. The collections of Impressionist painting are amazing. Actually everything inside Musee d'orsay is fantastic. I was really mesmerized with this place.",Nov 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Was skeptical a museum restaurant would be quite good, thinking it would be only snacks, but this was a great experience.",Feb 2019
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Musee D'Orsay has a wonderful collection of impressionist & post impressionist paintings, most of which any layperson with even a slightly artistic inclination, would recognise. It is like a small treasure trove, packed with beautiful paintings by artists such as Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin and Van Gogh, all on the 4th floor.
i would say if you are there just to appreciate the beauty of the artworks and not to study them, about 3 hours should be enough time for you to cover it, top to bottom. I say top floor to bottom because for me, the biggest draw was the paintings by the impressionist masters so i chose to start there and work my way down to the rare coin collections and sculptures and paintings by other artists.
If you're short on time but still want to pack in some art culture, this is definitely the place to go. unlike louvre, it doesn't leave you feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, numb and indifferent in the end.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We have been to this lovely museum in the past, and came on this trip specifically for the Degas exhibit.

The museum is great, but if you can get there during this exhibit, make it a priority! The exhibit is set up in an easy to navigate fashion, and is much larger than I expected it to be. Our young daughter enjoyed it as much as we did - she is taking ballet and loves ballerinas.

This is a beautiful museum with plenty to see, but it isn’t overwhelming. Great way to spend an afternoon, or an entire day!

A sign in the window says they'll open at 9:45, at 10:00 there's an announcement, not sure what it said given my language challenges but listening to those around me opening had been postponed indefinitely.
Before hyperthermia kicked in, we left.

France,Old Town,4.0,"This is the part of Nice that has a romantic Bohemian charm. Set on the hills overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, it has long been the summer home of some of the world's rich and famous. Elton John and Steven Spielberg have owned homes here.

Narrow medieval streets with winding alley ways are lit at night by old lamps which expose multi-colored French balconies, windows and beautifully colored red tiled roof buildings with rich histories. Street performers entertain in the evenings as you stroll through the narrow streets. Colorful and artistic personalities seem to gravitate to this part of town. Bars and restaurants are plentiful and diverse offering a wide range of cuisines. Some restaurants can be pricey like Le Boudoir and Di Piu but you can also find less expensive fare.

It gets very hot in the summer but Old town Nice is blessed with many shade trees and the breeze from the sea is welcomed.. Small unique shops that sell local soaps, boutique clothing and perfumes can be found. There are also some more modern shops. Open air markets selling flowers, candies and sea food add much to the overall vibe of this area of Nice. I love gelato and thought the French have a nice version but I prefer Italian gelato.

Besides the old architecture there are high quality eating places and fascinating small shops. It is interesting at all times of the day and into the night. I've been there at 10am, the afternoon and midnight. My favorite place for socca! One happy aspect of Nice is that local people like to be out and about.",Feb 2020

France,Old Town,4.0,"One asepct of Nice's old town that makes it particularly special is that it is authentic - real people live and work here. It's not just a medieval museum of windy streets and tiny alleys and old architecture and amazing churches. It's replete with history and is a delight through which to walk, especially when the tourists are not yet there and when they have left for the day. By day, it's very different than in the evening. During the day, shops are open with displays of product in the pedestrian street areas; at night, when shops are closed, they are barricaded shut and you would never know anything at all was there - no glass shop windows that just go dark after closing time. It can be like two different worlds - and navigation then is a bit more challenging! There are so many little hidden bars that you only find late in the evening. Find your way everywhere and explore.

France,Old Town,5.0,"I did plenty of research, boned up on my French, packed for the French Riviera...
Little did I know I'd touch down in a laid back beach town.
I was greeted with fellow travelers in shorts & flip flops.
English was readily spoken especially after I showed my less than stellar accent.
It was much more affordable in almost every way...
So some tips....
Bring water shoes or flip flops for the pebble beaches.
Be ready for amazingly affordable Italian, French and pretty much any other type of food you wish to eat...
(a great 6 euro pizza, a 1 star Michelin rest where we had a Filet with Foie Gras sauce that would have been $30 for the Foie alone in Chicago, but was $30 total therewith tasty vegetables and potatoes )
There were 188 Michelin restaurants in Nice a town of barely over 300k people...amazing!
You can eat Lunch at the 3 star Louis the 15th in Monaco than many 1 star Prix Fixe meals here in the states, and you get the added bonus of overlooking the Monte Carlo casino and the blue. blue Mediterranean.
Ride from Nice to Monaco for 1.5 euros ( taxi or uber think 50 to 100 euros ) a steal the view alone is priceless.
Be nice and the language barrier will become virtually non-existent.
Be ready to walk bring the comfiest of shoes and comfy stylish clothing.
It's hard to get lost here... it's compact and the water lends a nice (no pun intended) landmark.
Do visit all the tourist spots.. they're frequented for a reason !
Most of all don't rush, take your time to enjoy the perfect weather, warm wonderful people, and the Light... like no other I've experienced.... again there is a reason so many famous painters flocked to the south of France !
Public transit is great, and reliable.
Rent an Electric scooter if you need to cover more ground but still want the experience of not being in a bus.
Taxi's were the one spendy thing we found there... the streets force then to take the long way round.
Tram from the airport to the promenade and close enough to oldtown.
(2 euros a cab ride could be 30-50 euros )
I'd go back in a heartbeat, and I'd take even more time to smell the flowers...
Lastly the train station while being very efficient was not the easiest for non french speakers and was CROWDED... research your ride... I found out almost too late that the train to Avignon ( highly recommended for an over night trip ) was really the train to Paris even though my ticket made no mention of it.
So to recap,
Little to no language barrier
Cheaper than I thought
More laid back then I could have imagined.
Oh and no customs to pass though upon arrival ( we transferred in Portugal ) so off the plane straight to the tram and 1.5 blocks to our hotel after a 15 min ride )
For budget travelers we used Orbitz to book hit it over Labor day weekend here, and for a more than decent hotel with great staff 1 block off the promenade mid way down ( 1 block from the world famous Negresco hotel ) was under $1k per person for 10 days air, hotel taxes included.
WHAT's not to LOVE !
J'aime Nice !
Oh I have to mention Old Town since it's under this section...
Loved it... had amazing food again for not crazy money, found great small shops, and again warm wonderful people ( and the Gelato .... pretty amazing too !)

The barroco Palace “Palais Lascaris” is highly recommended.
The temperature in summer is cool because of the narrow streets.

There are a few issues with the dog poo on the sidewalks as it's very common.
Had a blast but definitely keep an eye on your belongings. Even the locals explained to us not leave our phones sitting on the table/bar or anything unattended.
Was told if it's not screwed down, its gone...

This is a place to be enjoyed at any age, with great nightclubs all along the beach, and a nice mix of young and old enjoying the same place. Be prepared to eat dinner late, and to take your time savoring eery minute (as the French do). We rented a lovely air b-n-b apartment right on the Cours Salaya, a block from the beach, and in the heart of the market, and felt like locals after just a few days. We are an older gay male couple, and we encountered no problems with the local French people in this area (maybe a few comments from one or two tourists from non-gay friendly countries, but nothing as aggravating as the homophobic people we encountered in Ventimiglia, Italy, which was just horrible). We will return to Nice again soon. Make sure to master taking the tram, and the train that runs along the coast - so easy and convenient to all the towns on the Riviera!

France,Old Town,5.0,"Nice Old Town is one of the most popular areas of the city. There is a lively atmosphere in this area both day and night and really nothing to see here. You can choose to wander around the Old Town area with no neat plan, enjoy the look of the old buildings and stop at some of the shops on the way, or you can follow a pre-planned itinerary to see some of Nice's most prominent sights. If you are interested, you can also join a guided tour of the area of Nice Old Town and Castle Hill.

In the past, Nice's old town was detached from the new city, as the Paillon River crossed between the two sections. In 2013, the two parts of the city joined together through the Promenade du Paillon Promenade, a charming promenade adorned with trees, plants, ponds and beautiful fountains. This is your entry point to the ancient city of Nice. From there, proceed to rue St François de Paule, which is packed with specialty shops. After a short time you will see on your right the Nice Opera House. It is an impressive Italian-style building built in 1881. Continue straight until you reach a street called Cours Saleya. It is the busiest street in Old Nice. In the morning, the street is filled with stalls and becomes an open flower market, which also offers some fruits and vegetables. When you reach the end of the street, we recommend that you turn right, return to the shoreline and continue east until you turn left onto the 300 steps leading up to Castle Hill. There is also the option of getting on the elevator if you prefer. The hill rises to 92 meters above sea level, making it in the years past a particularly strategic military spot, overlooking Nice Bay. The hilltop castle was used between the 11th and 18th centuries, but was destroyed in 1706. Today, all that remains on the hilltop are the remains of the ruined castle and, of course, spectacular views of the surrounding area.

France,Old Town,5.0,"We were here on a cruise ship tour covering Nice, Eze, and Monte Carlo. Our bus stopped in a charming park and we were basically let loose to discover Nice on our own. Love that! Everyone soon disappeared into the narrow winding streets where we found charming shops selling everything from upscale tourist stuff to fine leathers, fabrics, pastries, wines. What we loved was that it did not feel overcrowded with tourists either in the old town or along the beach (rocks not sand). In contrast to the narrow streets of old town, the streets lining the beach are broad and open and lined with great looking hotels. We had plenty of time to shop, poke around, and visit the beach but no time for eating on this part of the tour. Restaurants looked very nice, tucked into squares that suddenly open out from the narrow lanes. Love Nice! We had about an hour here, which did not feel too cramped.

One Exception, the Gelato at Fenicios was amazing and it's on a big square, I presume to handle the endless line all day long !
We found great affordable one of a kind jewelry pieces, great spices and salts, clothes you name it it's in old town and it's steps away ( once you figure out how to get out ) from the Promenade de Anglais.a great kind of water park and much more.
It can get a wee bit claustrophobic, but that's the point I think....
it's the same as it's always been aside from what you can buy from ages ago.
We were there several times, and each tie we discovered something new.

From about 1-2 pm, those stalls are broken down, the street is WASHED, and the center is re-set with tables and shade extending the seating for the myriad of restaurants up and down the street. At night, some additional stands & restaurants (e.g., gelato) are opened with some restaurants provide music making it a one-stop party for locals and tourist alike.

France,Old Town,5.0,"Just returned from 6 wonderful days in Nice. We stayed in a 2 bed airbnb apartment minutes from the main square. On arrival, from the airport we hopped on a tram to the Old Town, left our luggage at a bag drop (I think cost was 8 Euros per case) until check-in time. Taxi's from the airport to the Old Town are around 30 Euro's but I would recommend taking the tram. There are so many restaurants in the area to choose from. We also travelled by tram/train to Antibes and Villenfranche Sur Mer which are close by and both definitely worth a visit. We visited private beach clubs in Antibes and Nice at a cost of 20 Euros each for the day (public beaches had no deck chairs/beds or umbrellas). I would warn people to be very wary of pickpockets. On the tram one day an elderly lady (I would guess in her late 60's / early 70's, tried to pick my partner's pocket (he had 300 Euros in this pocket). She stood close to him and hid her hand underneath a large bag. When he felt her hand for the second time and was aware of what she was trying to do he confronted her and made her get off the tram when it stopped. I was also approached twice in the train station by elderly women asking for money.

France,Old Town,4.0,"Almost a medieval town feel, many small winding pedestrianised roads to be lost in. But don’t worry it’s small you’re actually never lost. We were there during a heatwave and even in the hottest days you’re guaranteed to be able to walk in the shade. There are quite a lot of tourist shops as well as real local gems. Many many cafes and ice cream places for those essential pit stops. Service is pretty good too considering how touristy it is.. I would remind you to be vigilant for pick pockets though even though it’s not rife, I can see the opportunities for those who are on the look look out . It only takes that one to turn your day into hell. You don’t need any identification or as such so no need to carry your valuable documents like passports etc even so much cash for that matter. Cards are widely accepted.
While you’re there make time for Cathedrale st Reparate , it’s unassuming looking but inside full of gems.

France,Old Town,5.0,"I could spend hours wandering the narrow streets of Old Nice.
Everywhere you go, there are old, tall buildings in shades of ochre, yellow, pink. Most windows have white shutters (some of them have decorative edges – some are just trompe l’oeil paintings). Between the narrow passage-ways you will see washing hanging out of some – a real, lived-in place.
You will come across little squares with fountains, the restaurants setting up tables and chairs under umbrellas.
Quaint little shops in the laneways selling everything from clothing and hats and bags to tea and herbs, candy and lavender, ice-cream and wine.
This is where you’ll find the Cours Saleya market during the morning – but don’t limit yourself to the market. Wander past the Opéra and marvel at the decorative lanterns along the façade, pass the Palais de Justice and turn to see the Tour de Horloge. Find yourself in Place Rossetti where you can visit the Cathédrale Sainte-Réparate (it’s beautiful). This is where you’ll also enjoy refreshments (ice-cream, crêpes etc) at the famous Fennocchio.
Moving eastwards, you may be tempted by glimpses through the buildings of steps leading upwards – take them! You will find yourself climbing past eh Chapelle de la Visitation Sainte Claire and the Jewish cemetery, up to the remains of the old castle and the incredible views over the Vielle Ville and the beach in one direction and the port in the other. It’s well worth the effort!

We had a chance to explore the market and promonade while on a tour from Cannes to Monaco.

The only downside is that the vendors don't even try to speak English. France is one of the only countries I have visited where the street vendors have an adversarial attitude to tourists.

Most vendors love the tourists coming in and spending money in their shops. Not here. They seemed mad that we were looking and taking pictures.

Lively atmosphere at many places alternated with quiet spots and no tourists. Buildings are colourful painted and to make impressions to others, some of the ornaments are just painted (look for yourself closely).
Same for a large part of the 13 churches you’ll find spread around the old town: marble interior looks real but here as well partly it’s painted wood. Very nicely done.
Just enjoy walking around and embrace this beautiful part of Nice. From the castle Hill you have a nice view both on the harbour as well as on the old city and rest of Nice

France,Old Town,5.0,"If you are going to Nice or indeed any part of the French Riviera, the old town is not to be missed. Located on the south eastern side of Nice old town as its name suggests embalms the old world charm of European architecture with its narrow streets and typical European buildings. One can just wonder these streets for hours on end walking into a patisserie shop here and an antique shop there. The TRAM line borders the northern part of the old town but does not go in. You can start off from Massena and then just walk about the narrow alleys. I would recommend walking both during the day and the night. Nighttime is quite lovely with bars and restaurants lighting up almost every street corner. And its quite safe too even way late into the night when you can still see plenty of people on the streets. If you are looking for good food in Nice there is no other place than this. While planning old town ensure you include Castle Hill and the Promenade too. Old town hugs both these top attractions and both are a must do if you have the time. This is one of those places you can just be directionless and be lost inside. No need to panic though if you can't find your way. The town is quite small and if you keep walking you will either hit the tram line or the coast both of which will take you out of the labyrinth.

Unless you want to go to mass, avoid mass times or be prepared to stand in line to enter. Votives and tapers can be bought at several places at the basilica and while there's a rack or two for votives in the basilica, most of them are placed outside the crypt on the 4th floor. There's a special room for tapers there as well; it's about the size of a big closet and you leave your lit candle at small window and the man inside then places it, (I had the image that he was there atoning for some sins; it was in the 30's (C) outside, so in there it must have been a sauna.)

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Nice interior, but it's all about the views of the city. Take the #60 city bus to get here. Only 2 euro per person - can pay in change on the bus. Or take the Petit-Train hop-on hop-off. Half the price of hop-on ColorBus, AND saves you 100 vertical feet (10 stories high) of stair and hill climbing vs the ColorBus stop at Notre Dame.
The 60 bus runs every 15 minutes or so, needs no tickets and stops at Notre Dame at the same hilltop stop as Petit-Train. The 60 bus runs from virtually the same Old Port stop (near Metro Vieux Port stop) where both Petit-Train and ColorBus also stop.
And if you take the #60 bus down from Notre Dame, it passes by (and also stops at) old port and goes right to the MUCEM museum - very handy!
PS. The Petit-Train is also called Train Touristique de Marseille.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde is a beautiful building standing tall at the highest peak of the old city. It was built in a couple of different styles, one of which is the lovely Neo-Byzantine style. The history of the church goes back to around the 12th or 13th centuries. It started off as a small church and because of its high location became a sort of symbol, particularly for sailors, who ended up making offerings of thanks after surviving shipwrecks. This also explains the presence of small boat offerings which hang around the interior of the church. The present building is actually a kind of extension of the original smaller church, and was built in the second half of the 19th century. The interior of the church is absolutely stunning and the exterior is also beautiful. The views from the top of the hill where the church is located are really wonderful and panoramic. You can see practically the whole city down below. We walked up the hill and this took us quite a while, but it was pleasant. many people, however, prefer to either drive or catch the bus or tourist ""train"" to the top.

Definitely worth it when you get to the top. The church is a mariner's church - it is decorated with mobiles of ships hanging for the dome, and most of the art on the walls has a maritime/seafaring theme. it is quite beautiful.

The basilica itself is beautifully decorated with mosaics and full of a variety of thankful donations, including ship and plane models hanging from the ceiling, medals, paintings and many many marble plaques. We enjoyed reading those! People’s thanks range from being saved from submarine bombardment in the war through being healed of an ulcer to passing an exam. There’s also a crypt, gift shop, restaurant and museum but we didn’t go to the restaurant or museum. They crypt is full of votive candles and the gift shop is crowded but has a good selection of postcards.

We took the #60 bus - it's a steep ride up but the Basilica is the last stop so you can't miss it ( €1.50, pay the driver directly, he can give change). From the top, you will see a walking path that you can use to go back down, if you're wanting to explore the streets a bit more, but keep in mind that parts are unpaved with loose gravel (if you're heading toward the port you're going in the right direction).

Entrance to the basilica is free and it certainly warrants a visit if you like history, architecture, art or grandeur. The coral and white striped arches reminded me of the churches in southern Spain which have Christian/Islamic influences - quite unique. The building has been beautifully maintained with gorgeous paintings and ceiling detail. If I had to choose between La Major (another beautiful church that is much closer to the port) I would definitely choose Notre Dame.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"The Basilique Notre Dame dela Garde started in 1214 when a priest of Marseilles whose first name was Pierre erected a small sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary upon the rocky triangle forming the top of a 161 metre-high hill facing the town of Marseille, which was very small at the time.

In the 16th century the chapel is embodied within a fortress. Francis 1st came to Provence and decided to build two fortresses in Marseilles: one on the island of If ( the famous Château d’If) and the other on top of the Garde Hill where the chapel. This was the time when Charles 5th, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, was intending to take possession of the south of France in order to reunite the two parts of his Empire (Central Europe and Spain). For 4 centuries, the fortress served as a military sanctuary and as a chapel.

In 1853, the construction of the Basilica was started to replace the small chapel. For four days in June 1931, a host of 49 bishops and 300,000 people came to join the celebrations for the crowning of the statue of Notre-Dame de la Garde. In 1934, the church was officially demilitarized by the President. However, the Nazis came in WWII and occupied the fortress.

Today, tourists can enjoy looking at the beautiful mosaics inside the church. The views of the city are breathtaking. The golden statue at the very top looking out the sea is a majestic sight to behold.

Inside is a truly beautiful cathedral, but what sets it apart from most is that this is a mariner's cathedral. I think mariner's churches are really cool because they have lots of model ships hanging from the ceiling, either to ask for God's protection or to give thanks for safe sailings. Aside from all kinds of ships hanging, there were also planes, and submarines and even a space shuttle. The kitschy-ness of the models seems incongruous with the grandeur and solemnity of the architecture and design, but that's why I like it. Continuing with the sailor's theme, there's lots of old ship paintings on the walls. And as a bonus, for those not into the mariners, there is a really, really giant gold statue on the top of the bell tower.

Otherwise, there is a public bus service which will take you there from town (bus #60 from the Vieux Port).

The interior of the basilica does have some stunning gold leaf decoration that was unexpected and very ornate. There are also models of ships and other nautical items suspended from the ceiling. There is nothing really to see in the crypt - just a simple chapel where you can go to pray.

The final push up to Notre Dame de la Garde was steep, stepped and exposed to the sun but full of stunning views of Marseille and the surrounding hills... worth the effort (there is a little tourist train/bus that can be ridden up if you don't want the walk).
The basilica was very busy (11:30am) when we arrived but despite that there was space and time to enjoy the building at length as well as take in the STUNNING panoramic views. The architecture, decoration and general feel of the whole visit, even for non-religious visitors like ourselves, was humbling, thought provoking and well worth the effort.
There is a curious restaurant on site... in the UK some people might refer to it as a blue-rinse special. The 'older' French locals had totally booked the entire restaurant... a good deal to be had it would seem.

A nice walk to do after your visit is the signposted walk to Castellane.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Notre-Dame de la Garde can translate to Our Lady of the Guard. It is a Catholic church and Marseille's best-known symbol. The basilica is constructed on a tall (~180 foot) limestone hill, known as ""La Garde,"" overlooking the Old Port. Long before the basilica, dating to 1214, an original chapel to the Virgin Mary was built on this site. Subsequently, the site was used for city fortifications, including a fort built in the early 1500's. The basilica's construction, began in 1852, utilized the foundation of the ancient 16th century fort. Some remains of the fort can still be seen on the West side of the basilica. Construction lasted twenty one years under the direction of architect Henri-Jacques Espérandieu. This grand church is composed of a lower Romanesque style building or crypt, carved from the limestone, and an upper Neo-Byzantine style building. The upper building includes a square 135 foot bell tower topped by a 41 foot belfry. The bell within weighs over 18,000 pounds. The belfry is covered by a square terrace, which is enclosed by a stone balustrade - an angel with a trumpet stands at each corner. The belfry is the base of a huge 37 foot statue of the Virgin Mary and Child. The statue was built in four sections and is made of copper gilded with gold leaf. The lower building or crypt is dark and somber. The entrance features marble statues of Bishop Eugène de Mazenod and Pope Pius IX. The side altars are devoted to saints Philomena, Andrew, Rose, Henry, Louis and Benedict Labre. The main altar is of Golfolina stone with columns of Spanish marble. Behind the altar is a statue of the Madonna holding child and a flower bouquet. The upper buildings nave is ~105 feet by 46 feet. The side chapels are ~12 feet by 18 feet. The interior is wonderfully decorated with 13,000 square feet of mosaics, as well as alternating red and white marble columns and pilasters. The mosaics and artwork within the semi-circular apse area containing the altar are also beautiful. Behind the altar, a red marble column topped by a gilded capital supports a statue of Mary, made of hammered silver. The courtyard surrounding the basilica also needs to be toured. It contains several statues including Passion of Christ. Further, the hilltop provides tremendous panoramic views of Marseille and the Mediterranean. When in Marseille this site is not to be missed!!

Take the bus to the end of the line and you are dropped off next to Place de Joilette. 5 min walk from there to harbour and Le Petit Train.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Looking up at the magnificent cathedral de notre dame from the waterfront it stands proud and looks great by day it by night. So you want to visit but how do you get there?

We walked - wow not sure I’d do that again - it’s a long steep walk and the last part is brutal.

My suggestion is to get the bus-train. You get on by the waterfront and it drops you off “almost” at the top but there are still steps once you get there to climb.

The Crypt is full of candles and quietly respectfully somber - the basilica at the top is truly magnificent and the artisans work on the ceilings is amazing. It’s free to enter - just be ready for a hike!

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Enjoyed our visit to the church.The views all around the city were excellent from this magnificent church.The inside of the church was stunning.

We went up to it on the tourist train, which was a nice ride along the coast first, it was a shame it was difficult to hear the commentary.",Jul 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"I took a taxi cab with my brother from the city center up to Notre Dame de la Garde.
As other reviewers have said the view is beyond spectacular... you get 360° views of the Mediterranean Sea,the city of Marseille and surrounding hills and mountains in the distance. For that alone it would be worth a visit but the Basilica itself is also a stunning work of architecture that's worth visiting. It's style is Byzantine and the interior has many mosaics that reflect that style. This particular incarnation of the Virgin Mary is seen as the protector of sailors and all who go out to sea,and since we were on a cruise and are in fact Catholic we took the opportunity to say a little prayer for a safe voyage. Visitors will notice model ships of all types hanging from the ceiling as well as plaques along the walls from those faithful whose prayers to the Virgin Mary were answered. When it was time to go we descended on foot all the way to the Vieux Port,the walk was a lot easier than we thought it would be but of course downhill is always easier!

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,4.0,"We walked up to this site from our hotel near the metro of Castellane, what a hike..steps,steps and more steps..
It was worth it...amazing place...not only inside, but the views around to see all of Marseille was lovely...it’s where we saw the port area with the ships etc...worth the visit...",Jul 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"I don't usually visit churches but I had heard that the views were great from Notre Dame de la Garde, which isn't surprising given that you can see the church from most locations in Marseille.

I took the 8 Euro ""tourist train"", aka the Petite Train de Marseille, (Route 1). There is also a cheaper No 60 city bus that goes to the church, but as someone who has never taken a tour bus or anything similar, I still highy recommend this ""tourist train"" because, unlike the bus, the seating is outdoors, close to the ground, and the route is along the beautiful corniche, where you see beaches, etc. Really worth the extra money. You can catch this ""train"" at the Old Port on the Quai du Port.

The views of Marseille, the port, etc from the church are spectacular. Pictures can be taken from several outdoor locations. The church is also lovely and very spiritual. Small models of boats hang from the rafters, which is consistent with this port city. Really worth the trip. You probably need about 2 hours for the entire trip (back and forth from Old Port and on-site).

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,This is open daily and overlooks the Vieux Port. it was built in the 19th Century in the Romanesque-Byzantine style and is crowned with a statue of the Virgin Mary. There are amazing views from the church's terrace. Bus 60 runs from the Vieux Port every 20 minutes for only 2 Euros - great value.,Jun 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Very large and very beautiful structure located at a hilltop summit. Epic example of architecture in the city and most visited place, rightly so.
The view from the top is as breath taking as the intricate masonry work inside.
A little souvenir shop located on top is a nice touch.
To reach here you can take bus. No.60 from vieux port and this service is FREE of cost. Also there is a 4euro trip that can be done from the museum side of vieux port to the top in a open air toy train which too is a good fun ride for any kids.
CANNOT MISS THIS PLACE!

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,4.0,I visited having caught the no.60 bus down by the hotel de Ville near the marina. The views are amazing and the church impressive. You can also take the small tourist train at €8 per adult although the bus was €1.70 or free using the metro pass.,Jul 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"If you have time for only one thing in Marseille, go here. We walked from Vieux Port to the Basilique. Not for the faint of heart (a huge staircase awaits when you get up the hill) but it was fun to meander through Marseille neighborhoods. You can also take a trolley from Vieux Port. The views from the grounds are stunning. All of Marseille, the water and the Calenques in the distance. The church itself is very beautiful - ornate and solemn with a maritime theme on the side. There are model boats suspended from the ceiling and paintings of ships and sea line the walls on the right, facing the altar. After our visit we hiked down to the beach and enjoyed the refreshing waters of the Mediterranean. Lovely day!

Talking at the top of their voices in a church, including the part reserved for prayer. A man stood on my toe which was in a sandal so it hurt and did not even attempt to make any show of being sorry. I must be getting old. Do visit though, it's so beautiful",Jul 2019

It's very beautiful inside with intricate painting/mosaic work. The gift shop was a great place to pic up some postcards - 2 for 1 euro with a nice selection. In our opinion, it was worth it to take the trolley to the top. However, you can walk it or take an Uber or local bus since there is a bus stop at the top.",Jun 2019

Inside is beautiful. We had lunch there, but never again - We walk down from church on foot to the Chalet du Pharo stopping half way by accident at a really nice restaurant Sepia in a small park where we had lovely desserts and coffee. We will go there again on next visit to Marselle for a full lunch. Then we carried on on foot to Chalet du Pharo .

Dedicated to the sailors who lost their lives in exploration and commerce, the stained glass and architecture is amazing to behold. At one of the highest points of Marseille, there are three excellent vantage points from which to take panoramic photos of the entire city, bay and small islands nearby. A small gift shop is also onsite. Just inside the foyer are plaques from families the church has helped following loss of family members to the sea. An inspiring visit.",Jun 2019

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,4.0,"Baking hot day in June heatwave of 2019 - extinction rebellion might be on to something - took the 60 bus from stop at the mucem end of the port, ensuring a seat. The bus was cool and took in some great views on way up to basilica. We passed some exhausted looking cyclists on the way up. As much as I love my cycling, I couldn't think of a worse thing to do today. There was a nice breeze at the top and some fantastic panoramic views. Felt very lazy getting the lift up to the basilica but nobody seemed to know about it and we shared the lift with one other couple. If there had been a wheelchair or pram needing lift I would naturally step aside, honest. It's just inside the museum entrance if you go on an equally hot day and you too are trying to stay cool ( not really cool, more like less boiling ) then take a look. I suspect the queues are never that long. Beautiful Byzantine interior with nautical flavour to many artefacts. The opposite of Dr Who's tardis as feels quite cosy and intimate for a large cathedral. Couldn't help wondering how it got built. Would have been murder lugging all those stones to top of that hill, especially in this heat. Well I suppose that's what trips to places like this are for, to make you stop and think.

The facilities around the mount top are very good and can cope with huge crowds. A must visit for the camera..,May 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Way up on the hill, you'll need an approach that will not exhaust your enjoyment with the visit. I did the Color Bus because it will drop you close, so that the climb is significantly reduced. You can also set your watch for catching the bus on its return to complete the tour. Color Bus is good for two days and will allow you to see other sights in the same manner. Basilique Notre Dame's main attraction is its proximity and lofty status above the city. You can see for miles. It was beautiful in May with good weather. Try to pick days that are not too cold or too hot. Go inside the church and see its beauty also - you don't need to be religious to appreciate the magnificence of Basilique Notre Dame, it only requires you to keep your eyes open

One aspect that makes it unique - is that although it contains religious art and artifacts the main theme is about ships and other vessels who sail around there.

There is a small train that makes the trip, but we noticed that people waited a LONG time for the ride down the mountain.

The views of the city are incredible along with the wonderful architecture of the cathedral. You can walk up/down the hill to access or you can take the local #60 bus or Petit Train, all very frequent depends on your budget.",Apr 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,4.0,"I agree, some (not most) of Marseille's populace is catholic, for them ""La Bonne Mere"" (the good mother) is a symbol as Marseille's protector. However, a lot of other people don't think the same and here come a lot of disputes.
Concerning the building - nice cathedral, on the top of a hill, with impressive view of Marseille around , not too old like those from Avignon, Aix, Arles... nor recent like Sagrada. It is worth visiting if you're christian, catholic or hardened tourist AND have good feet as climbing the MANY steps might be a problem for those old or who have problems with the knees",Nov 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Great panoramic views of the city from the top and a stunningly decorated church. Try and go on a day with clear skies, We took the taxi up due to lack of time and walked back down.",Apr 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"A beautiful Church with a hell of a walk to enjoy the interior of the church and the all round views of the city of Marseilles.
The steps up will try the best of us but we'll worth it.
We went via the hop-on hop-off bus but the Number 60 bus from the harbour will also take you there directly.
Nice little cafe, souvenir and museum also on site.
A must see when in Marseilles.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Beautiful church on top of a hill overlooking the city. Don’t try and walk, just get the Dotto train from the Vieux Port for €8.30, and sit back and relax. The train takes you along the corniche on the way up, so a little bit of sightseeing too. Well worth it. Apart from the lovely basilica, there are great views of Marseille as well.",Mar 2019

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"This is a must do when in Marseille. A 360 degree platform around the Basilique provides amazing view of the entire city of Marseille as well as the Islands and Sea immediately surrounding. Once inside, the amount of detail on the Catheral is inspiring.

There is a small gift shop on level 2. There is another shop on the top, with an even bigger selection of both Religious and non-Religious items.

There are various transportation options to get there from the Port, which alleviate walking up very steep streets. There is also parking on-site, along with a handicapped accessible entrance and elevators available with access to all levels.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"The architecture of this hill top church is fabulous and it provides stunning views over Marseille City. We arrived on the ""hop on hop off bus"" and there was a short climb up a steep hill, but as an alternative there is parking close to the building for those arriving by taxi. The golden statue of Our Lady on top of the church, which can be seen from afar, looks down over the port and city. It is possible to stroll fully around the pathway on the outside of the building to enjoy the panoramic views and photo opportunities. Inside the incredible basilica are many mosaics, paintings and ship models. A visit to the crypt is also a must. A look in the well stocked gift shop is worthwhile and there is also a café and toilet facilities. An incredible place.

The views at the top are breathtaking, 360 views of Marseille, definitely not to be missed. The church itself is very ornate, and very peaceful. There is a little gift store too.",Feb 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"We went to the cathedral at sunset. That alone was beautiful. A wonderful view of the city. I was particularly interested in this cathedral because it is linked with ships and I worked on cruise ships. It has displays of anchors, other ship-related items.",Jan 2019
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"The statue of Our Lady (Notre Dame, known affectionately as the Good Mother) which overlooks the harbour is a key image of Marseille in France. I wasn’t aware of it before I visited but I now see why the towering figure and beautiful church is a must see. It offers the great combination of beautiful architecture, the best viewpoint in the city, being a well known landmark and being an enjoyable climb if you like an energetic urban hike. The basilica is on top of a steep hill which is built up with roads and houses, but you can also get buses, Ubers and tourist trains up there. There are brilliant views of Marseille up the top. It is worth going either on a clear morning or around sunset. The main panorama is of the city, harbour and islands but you can actually walk around the church and see 360 degrees of views. It is as if you are in a plane but unencumbered by obstacles to sight. Inside there is an ornate early 19th century basilica with colourful mosaics which on its own is probably the most beautiful church in Marseille. One detail which was interesting was the ship models hanging inside the church which is testament to how the church was seen as protecting the harbour and the patronage being over those who spent much of their lives as mariners. The church was also the site of the battle for Marseille in 1944 when Allied soldiers won the city back from the Nazis. One wall has bullet holes in it. It is a religious site with regular Masses and people often leave votive candles and messages in the basilica or crypt. I didn’t visit but there is also a museum, restaurant, shop and toilet facilities.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"The must-see attraction, or rather must-visit as you can see it from across town. Massive, impressive, yet moving. The interior is lined with plaques with votive prayers for the missing, sick or travellers; and votive thanks to Our Lady for restoring the sick, returning the lost and delivering mothers and babies. On top of all this is the commanding view over the town which you can drink in for hours, if you have them. If you are weary, you can spend 8 euro and take an unlikely little tourist train from the port to the very top. There you can spend some time before winding back down again. A great 90 minute trip.",Jun 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"This basilica is obviously à place you need to go in Marseille, you can see ""notre-dame"" everywhere in the city, the architecture is amazing and the view over the city !!",Jul 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"First get in shape to start the climb from the Vieux Port to Notre Dame de Bonne Garde.
Yes, on foot because that’ s the way to discover Marseille bit by bit, from high to higher.
Ans once you get there breath and give your eyes all the pleasure they can absorb. By Mistral weather it blows and it blows hard but it’ s sheer fun.
Inside look up. A bit kitchy at first but the magic will open up to you with all the ex voto’ s hanging there. Ships, planes, even a helicopter qho’ s crews were rescued. Look at all the paintings on the walls, each of them telling a story of rescue, of recovery.
And if OM, the local football soccer club won, try to get in, you won’ t believe it!
So yes climb up there, it’ s an experience. Use another route on your way down, more fun.

The basilica is interesting by it's history, architecture, nicely decorated interior and of cause the golden statue of Vierge Marie.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Most everyone visits, as the church is such a famous Marseille landmark, but I was pleasantly surprised by how different this religious building is from most others. The colorful interior, and the tangible and moving tributes covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling are special. We walked up, which in December is an option, but even so got pretty warm. It is very nice that the site has tourist facilities (toilet, restaurant).",Dec 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Having very little time, we took the tourist train from the Vieux Port to the basilica, otherwise we would have walked up the hill as it seemed like a nice stroll.

I think this is definitely the best thing to do in Marseille.",Nov 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Standing at the top I was absolutely awestruck by the history of the place, where fishermen from the past left offerings of thanks in the form of ships and paintings in the Basilique, and looking down on the city I could really appreciate the changes over the decades. Absolutely a caricature of Marseille, do not give this a miss.",Dec 2018

It is a spectacular place with a special charm where we spent almost 2 hours partly because of the breathtaking views. You can see the entire city and huge it is and all surroundings.
The church itself is gorgeous place with rich paintings and unusual decorations: the hanging strings with ships are very intriguing.
Actually it is not that difficult to reach the church by foot from the old port. It seems very high up the hill though it is very doable. If you still want to take bus: bus 60 departs directly from old port.
One hint: if you look at the church from a parking lot down right the church seems to be placed on the ship - it was a discovery for me.

There were a number of stairs but there is also an elevator at least from the lower level gift shop 2 deck and likely from 1 deck up to 6 deck gift shop. Views are amazing. The basilica was not as large as expected but seemed more of a place to pray for protection of ships than a place of worship for a city. It also seemed to be an historic attraction filled with tourists.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"This site is certainly a #1 attraction with two special rewards, the Basilica and the view of Marseille. Located on a hill on the outskirts of Marseille, it commands a panoramic view in every direction from the Mediterranean to the mountains of Provence. The Basilica interior is exquisitely decorated and the outside is artistically constructed of black and white stone. Bring your camera. We got to the hilltop by hiring a taxi along the waterfront in town. We negotiated a fair price for the taxi to take us right to the Basilica, wait for us, and bring us back to the harbor. The taxi driver warned us of pick pockets and we encountered no problems. It was a very nice sightseeing stop that took about 1 1/2 hours including the taxi ride. For those that are mobility limited there is an elevator from the upper parking level to the Basilica entry level.

Stay on the bus, right up to the top until it stops at the car park at the base of the Basilica as we were going to get off too soon because we were unsure of the stop. The Basilica is beautiful and well worth the visit. The interior is gold mosaics and is stunning. We went on a Monday and the shop and restaurant were closed but they have toilets and a souvenir shop open for the public. The views of the city and port are breathtaking from so high up and in the distance you can see Chateau d'If which is an island that you would need to get a ferry out to but we didn't have time on the day. It is worth going up to see the view alone so the Basilica is the icing on the cake!

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"We paid an unexpected visit to this lovely church. It was inviting, peaceful, beautiful and awesomely large. It fits 40,000 people. Really! Interesting colours on the outside. Beautiful dark and cool inside. Not old ( 100 years or so) but worthwhile dropping in and saying a little prayer or meditation or just visually resting your mind.",Sep 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"After a walk upstairs on the hill you meet with a basilique with an amazing view over the neighborhood of Marseille. The basilique has 6 floors with a restaurant, a boutique and the upper floor the basilique itself.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Do yourself a favor, take the tiny train up to this place and spend some time wandering around -- the site itself is beautiful, lots to explore, plus you have widespread views of the city and out over the water. Very soothing. Really enjoyed the narrative on the way up in the tiny train - translated into three languages, so it's limited to fit the time, but still very interesting. Enjoy!",Jul 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Everything about this basilica is a delight. Especially charming are the strings of boats hung from the ceiling; these are ""ex-votos"" (symbols or something given in offering or to stand as a testimonial to those who come later). These ships have a kind of folk art quality to them and are very unique; they are the gifts from sailors who survived shipwrecks, storms, and pirates.

The ceiling in the entire church is painted and frescoed in an array of images, symbols, designs, and all manner of dizzying beauty. The style is Neo-Byzantine which has elements of Eastern, Orthodox, and Christian styles (popular in the 1840's) but it has a Moorish feeling too. All the beautiful patterns in the floor mosaics and the bright colors would not be out of place in Istanbul's Blue Mosque.

A major restoration took place from 2001 to 2008 wherein pollution caused by smoky candles, acid rain, and bullet holes from the WWII struggle for the Liberation were repaired. The beautiful green and white striped rocks are layered; the green sandstone bricks were corroded by environmental damage while the interior ceiling needed to have eons of soot removed and holes professionally repaired.

Below there is a crypt carved into the rock. It is somber, contemplative, and has a lovely barrel-curved ceiling. Religious art is on display.

The church has 6 side altars and one of them is dedicated to St. Roch (St. Rocco in Italian where we first encountered this medieval saint in Venice). He is the patron saint of contagious diseases and is often depicted showing lifting his robe to show his plague sore on his thigh. All the saints have interesting stories, we really liked his.

The basilica (and its predecessor chapel) has survived the French Revolution, WWII, and continues to do battle with pollution. It began as a 13th century medieval chapel built upon an ancient fort's base. This is the highest point in Marseille, providing military vantage points. The views are extraordinary and exceptional; all of Marseille and the sea is on display.

The beautiful 37 foot tall Madonna and child adorn the top spire of the church; she is a copper bodied creation with gold leaf application. This present church was begun in 1852 and 21 years later (1873) it was completed.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"The Basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde is an extravagant neo-Byzantine building dating back to the 19th century. It is a very ornate structure with beautiful mosaics and, at 155m, is built on the highest point of the city providing stunning views over the surrounding city and sea. At its pinnacle is a huge monumental Virgin covered in gold leaf sitting on the top of a 46m bell tower.",Jul 2018
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,4.0,"Notre-Dame de la Garde Basilica is perched up on Garde Hill at 154 metres. We didn’t have the energy for that sort of climb, so we took bus #60 from Quai des Belges, which is in front of the Vieux Port. The bus stops right near the basilica and takes around 15-20 minutes. The buses are frequent and popular.

A priest named Pierre erected a small chapel on top of Garde Hill in 1214 dedicated to the Virgin Mary. During the French Revolution the chapel was stripped of possessions which went to the state. Church services resumed in 1807 and continued until the chapel was no longer deemed large enough, it would eventually be replaced by the basilica. The first stone for basilica was laid in 1853 and amazingly, the architect was only 23 years old, he was Jacques Henri Espérandieu a protestant. Lack of funds stalled building and the basilica was consecrated in 1864, with the tower being finished in 1866 ready to house the large bell.

The huge golden statue of Virgin and Child which dominates the skyline of Marseille, is the work of Eugène Lequesne. Made in four pieces using a process which was new at the time, called galvanoplasty. Latex moulds of the four sections were made, which were plunged into a bath of copper sulphate, then using electrolysis a few millimetres of copper were deposited on the moulds. The sections arrived in Marseille in 1869, where they were covered in gold leaf, with the statue being installed in 1870. The statue is re-gilded around every 25 years, it stands 11.2 metres high and weighs 9,796kg, (nearly 10 tonnes).

The work on the mosaics began in 1872, with completion in 1892, they cover an area of 1,200 square metres and are composed of more than 12 million tesserae. Building of the basilica concluded with installation of the stunning bronze doors in 1897.

Information on the basilica is garnered from the official website of Notre-Dame de la Garde Basilica.

The banded white limestone and green/grey sandstone of the exterior is quite striking, however the interior is entirely something else. Can’t say we were quite prepared, for the stunning mosaics complimented by the striped red and white marble. It is difficult to know where to point the camera next. Garde Hill is brilliant for the excellent views of Marseille, with a backdrop of mountains, the Frioul archipelago, Bay of Marseille, to a stretch of coastline. An information board helps with locating landmarks.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"We took the little train from Vieux Port it was only €8 each ( children over 11 pay adult price) the train takes you up the hills via the narrow streets of Marseille which is a joy in itself. Then once at Notre Dame De La Garde you get to go into the Cathedral on floor 4 and 6 ( there is a lift option ) to take in the brilliant architecture and internal paintings. The view from such a high point in Marseille is brilliant a full 360 of the city including the amazing roof of the Marseille football pitch. On the way back to Vieux Port on the little train, look out for the Sherman tank left by the US when they liberated the Marseille people at the end of WW2. Definitely number 1 on the vast list of things to do in Marseille. We are not religious people ourselves and so didn't appreciate that side of things ( as many there that day did) bit we appreciated the awesomeness of the building and it's location.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"OK - I won't go on about this because if you're visiting Marseille you're bound to visit this imposing church. However, here's a few tips …
Use the little tourist train (8e) for a return trip to the top. It's worth it just to see how the driver gets this long train round the little winding streets that criss-cross the hill. You can stay up there as long as you like and trains arrive and depart approximately every 20 minutes. On the journey down, look out for the Sherman tank that is still in place after freeing Marseille from the Nazis at the end of WWII.
Go back in the evening. Unfortunately the tourist train stops running around 6:30pm during the summer so take the normal bus instead. Leaves several points around the old port and the last one is around 7:30pm. It costs less than 2e and takes you right to the top. Take a drink and a picnic and wait for an hour until it gets dark. Only a handful of people will be there and you'll get some great views of the city when it's all lit up. You will have to walk back down but that's no hardship and well worth it !!

The gilt Madonna and child on the steeple can be seen from the sea , and in olden days was the first sight of Marseille for returning ships.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Nothing was planned on our first full day in Marseille. Instead, we followed Anne’s advice to visit the city’s top attraction - the Notre Dame de la Garde. But before we journeyed out to the Basilica, on our way to get coffee, we saw colorful street art and happened upon a farmer’s market. One kiosk sold paella and fried fish (dorado). We bought two servings of the paella and one fish for dinner that night.

From our apartment, the Basilica is only a mile and a half away and according to Google Maps, a 35 minute walk. But the last half mile or so is a steady climb of almost 500 feet culminating at the church with a 360 degree view of Marseille below us.

According to Wikipedia - Notre-Dame de la Garde (Our Lady of the Guard) is a Catholic basilica in Marseille, France, and the city's best-known symbol. Built in 1864 and the site of a popular Assumption Day pilgrimage, it’s the most visited site in Marseille. It was built on the foundations of an ancient fort at the highest natural point in Marseille, a 149 m (489 ft) limestone outcropping on the south side of the Old Port of Marseille.

The church itself is beautiful but what gives it more meaning for pilgrims, like us, are the small closed in rooms where one can pray, meditate or even receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation.

The other notable aspect of the church is a cafeteria run by missionary nuns who are here for a year or so to learn French. We met a Vietnamese nun who was a missionary in the Philippines and learned to speak Tagalog. It’s times like these when you realize that meeting interesting people is part of traveling in various parts of the world. It was a pleasant surprise to meet this friendly nun. Unfortunately, we forgot to ask her name and take a picture with her. Before parting, we promised to include each other in our prayers.

There is a museum which I think you could pay to have a look in to get a history on it however we didn’t have time to do this on our visit.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"From various places around the City the skyline is dominated and looks so different depending on what time of day from where. We started off mid morning before it got hot and wondered up through the old town and found great local produce shops and places of interest along the way. It was not a long walk from the old port where we were staying, but it is all up hill but not to arduous.
Some rally interesting buildings along the way and the occasional glimpse as you meander until you come out below the rock on which the this iconic building stands.

Once through the gates the views are well worth the effort and as much time can be eaten away looking to sea and the other islands in the bay.

It doesn't matter which level you enter at there is so much to take in and see, what with model planes , warships etc hanging from the ancient columns in the main church and the war scares on the out side of the stonework there is a story on every corner and every level. Some people had the usual reprints for wearing hats inside a church but photography was not discouraged and so some none flash photos will add tou experience of such an iconic spot-

Notre Dame de la Garde is one of the more notable churches in Nice. You can spot it from almost anywhere in Marseille since it sits on a hill. We took Bus 60 and it literally stops at the church so it is super convenient.

We visited on July 4 and it was pretty hot. So if you want to have some shade, bring an umbrella.

The visit inside is free and it is worth a look. Also, walk along the outside for views of Marseille. One of the must do's in Marseille.

The outside is spectacular with all the black and white granite and statutes, especially the one of the mother and baby at the top. The inside was a bit of a downer.

You can walk but it would take you hours and the incline is immense. The touristic train departs from the basilica to take passengers back to the old port also.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"Lyon old town, known as Vieux Lyon, is situated across the Saone River from the Presqu'ile district in the heart of beautiful Lyon. The 16th century was a time of thriving business since Lyon was a crossroads of trade between Italy, Spain, and France. Four and five-story houses were built with interior courtyards, staircases, and galleries as the area grew to accommodate the thriving business population. Many of those homes show the influence of the Italians who were key trading partners at the time. Vieux Lyon is one of the largest Renaissance neighborhoods in Europe and offers over 2,000 years of history including Romain ruins. Surprisingly, during the 19th century, the old town was thought to be ""unlivable"" and a plan was proposed to build a major road through the middle of it. Fortunately, this plan was dropped and major restorations and renovations were started in the area.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"It is a fascinating experience to walk throughout the old Lyon historical center.

I have a walkthrough Lyon with my family, including several teens, in December 2019 last year. The Christmas holidays brought us from Macau to Lyon, and the visit is much enjoyable. There are still some roman vestiges of Lugdunum, some medieval architecture as in the old St. Jonh the Baptist cathedral, and the historic center evolves along the calm Rhône, still a majestic river. Most of Lyon's historical center is a mosaic of late 19th century, early 20th century buildings, a lot of them transformed into commercial areas. Thus, a visit to old Lyon must include some shopping and lunch or dinner in one of the countless restaurants available. I have also visit antique bookshops and found some precious books.

Vieux Lyon is not only charming but there are so so many shops, restaurants, and Traboules (hidden passages) Our Greeter brought us inside these traboules which we would not have been able to find ourselves.
Glacier Terre Adelice, ice cream, was the best as our greeter told us about. 2 balls for 5 euros and they have over 50 flavors. We tried the chevre and the bergamot and both were outstanding.

The energy and the vibe in Vieux Lyon are wonderful and there is even a little flea market infront of the little church square on the weekends until about 7pm.

We stayed in an apartment beside Rue Maronniers which is in the center of the new Lyon for shopping and lots of dining but Vieux Lyon is like walking back in time in Lyon 100 years. We loved Vieux Lyon's charm!

Lyon Old Town is divided into three districts, all referring to Christian saints: St Paul, St John and St George. Within the old town there are masses of restaurants (most with outdoor seating), but the most fun part is looking for the seals that mark the entrances to the Traboule, then finding out what secret world lies behind the door.

Great fun to stroll and visit any shops. I could spend an entire day in this area but we took a free city tour and time was limited. Start the walk fr the cathedral and cross the bridge to Croix Rousse. The traboules are fun to explore but can be easily missed. They are marked with shield-shaped bronze plaques, while in the Croix-Rousse, it's a lion’s head on a blue background. From south to north, on rue st. Jean, Look for #54, 42, 28, 27, 24, 18. On rue du boeuf, 31, 27, etc. Note that some of these doors were locked. Good places to check out are: Boulangerie du Palais, Terre Adelice (fame ice cream), Maison Brochier Soieries (old silk shop), La Tour Rose (in traboule—a pink building owned by a rich dude during the silk booming era). We stopped in front of the oldest building in the city but I can't remember its location. In the same square is another traboule (at a corner).

France,Vieux Lyon,4.0,"We walked into old town, Vieux Lyon, and up to the Basilique de Notre
Dame de Fourviere, which is at the highest point in the city. We walked up 250 steps and 10 steep switchback paths that were the equivalent of 20 stories high. At the top, there were beautiful views of the city including the two rivers that pass through it. The cathedral itself was massive. Then we walked down past the Roman ruins that have been here since the city was founded. Since we were already worn out by the earlier climb up the hill, we declined to climb up the ruins. Julius Caesar made this city the headquarters of his Gallic campaigns. Finally, we reached the bottom, had lunch, and toured the Church of St. Jean, where Pope John XXII was consecrated centuries ago, and Marie d’Medici married King Henri IV in 1600. Inside the church was a massive clock built in the 1300s. Some event was going on so there were about 12 French soldiers with machine guns on guard. That made us a bit edgy. In spite of that, we found a geo-cache around the corner from the church. Walking through old town was an interesting experience that was only slightly diminished by the 99-degree temperatures. On the way back, we looked for and found a couple of “traboules”, which are hidden passageways that pass between buildings, may include courtyards and staircases and allow the owner’s access to the buildings. We found a geo-cache hidden near the historical plaque.

It is perhaps a bit touristy with the requisite gift shops and restaurants attempting to attract them, there are nonetheless a few genuine bouchons to choose from as well those which call themselves that.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"I loved Vieux Lyon, both wandering on my own and latterly with a tour guide. It is pretty small but is steeped in much history going right back to Roman times, then Medieval and Renaissance and now modern times. The streets are narrow and it can get very busy and now there are mostly cafes and bars there but if you scratch the surface there’s heaps of history.

Most of the area is paved and uneven but flat. The traboules (secret passages) are very intriguing and they are worth a bit of time to poke your nose in. You can get a map from the Visitor Centre, take a tour or just wander on your own.

Eating there is not cheap but there are a few lovely spots for both food and drinks.

Along the restaurants comes streets loaded with cute small specialised shops offering everything from jewelries, antiques and other specialties. The raise of the wall of prayer also starts here, down at the river side, you can walk the curved route on the way to the top, where you will find Lyons, Notre Dame, Cathedral, what an amazing building with a history worth studying. And if thats not enough, the view platform behind the Cathedral, just explores more or less the entire city of Lyon, the two rivers running parallel around Bellecour. Its just an astonishing view, that really portrays Lyon as an historic and architectual capitol from the past.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"Vieux Lyon is a UNESCO world heritage site, and well worth a visit. I have been many many times, as I live just outside the city, and I never get bored of wandering round this charming area. A medieval centre filled with hidden secret passageways (Traboules) to discover, cobbled streets, an imposing gothic cathedral overlooked by the Fourvière Basilica perched above upon the Fourvière Hill, this place is steeped in history. Many shops specialising in silk give a nod to Lyon's economic past as the European hub of silk production and weaving. Vieux Lyon is filled with restaurants, ranging from classic local cuisine in the many ""Bouchons"", to the Michelin starred establishments (rue du bœuf has a few of these), to street food available to passers by. There are also many museums, interesting shops and statues to visit or see. The atmosphere in Vieux Lyon is so relaxed and joyful, like a little village. Unlike other historic centres, people do indeed live there.
Vieux Lyon has so much to offer, and is a great place to start of you want a taste of what this city has to offer.
Worth particular attention:
- Finding the traboules (most are unlocked between 9am and 12pm)
- The St Jean Cathedral, it's stone carvings on the exterior, astronomical clock inside, and mix of modern and original medieval stained glass windows
- The museum of Miniatures and Cinema (first room is free to visit, and worth a look!)
- Take the funicular train from Vieux Lyon métro station up to the top of Fourvière Hill to get a view of the whole city from next to the basilica, and also walk around the Roman ruins of the amphitheatre and odeon

Local food to try :
- Quenelles
- A meal in a Bouchon restaurant
- a tarte au praline rose

Wine tip : forget Beaujolais Nouveau, and give a Beaujolais Cru a go. Aged, complex flavours, it's delicious!

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"We stayed in the middle of Vieux Lyon for a week and can say that although it is full of tourists, there are also many French there. In our time we sussed out that many were local people from Lyon who obviously enjoy the old town as much as we tourists do. The architecture dates from Roman times (ruins) to mediaeval to renaissance with wonderful buildings, facades and laneways to explore. There is an abundance of restaurants, cafes, ice cream shops and other shops worth exploring. We did not feel ripped off by it being attractive to tourists. There were so many French people around that we felt a part of local culture. We stayed right next to the Museum of Cinema and Miniatures and it was fabulous watching the passing parade from our 2nd floor windows.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"We did a walking tour of Vieux Lyon, one of the largest old towns in France, with our river cruise. Started at the Palais de Justice (1835), and on through the narrow, winding streets. We were able to go through several traboules - the city's hidden passageways. They join 2 streets as a shortcut, often running through several buildings. Originally to allow silk makers to transport their goods unmarred, used later by the French resistance to dodge the Nazis. Several of these are open to the public, but many are private and locked, only for the building residents' use. Lots of interesting Renaissance architecture - shops and cafes. We stopped at a bakery for a sample of delicious praline pastry. Many of the houses were built 4 and 5 storeys high, with interior courtyards and lovely ironwork. French Gothic style, with an Italian influence, apparently from the Italian silk makers brought in to teach the the locals residents about silk making. it can be a bit risky just walking along these narrow, twisty streets, as cars and trucks just push their way through. So many intersting looking shops and restaurants, I wish we had more time here!

From there corssing another bridge we had reached the oldest part of the town, where the roman city used to be built on, right below a hill. Walking through the medieval streets we admired the architecture typical of this area. Furthermore we also found out a typical thing of the city of Lyon: the Traboule. These are sort of passageways built as public streets cutting through private buildings and palaces, used mostly by merchants to reach the river quickly. We visited a few of them thorughout the city including the one where the Musee Gadagne is located. A lot of them are nowadays private but others are just closed and if you ring a bell or push through a door you manage to find some really interesting ones.

France,Vieux Lyon,4.0,"Old Lyon was preserved by the efforts of André Malraux, the hero of the Resistance, the famous associate of General de Gaulle, the Minister of culture of France. The quarter became the first protected urban area in France. Half-abandoned houses were forbidden to demolish, only to restore. 500 buildings of the district became a World heritage site in 2011. Old Lyon consists of three districts that used to be separate villages. The Northern quarter of Saint-Paul, where large bourgeoisie lived , Saint-Jean, the quarter of clergy and nobility and Saint-Georges for artisans and traders. It is clear that the first two have richer buildings and tourists are interested in them first. The main feature of old Lyon is the traboule, pedestrian passage through the block, allowing you to navigate from one street to another. Part of traboulay is public, others are closed by combination locks. The most famous traboule in the quarter is a Long trabol. You`ii find the entrance at Rue Saint-Jean 54, the output on the parallel Rue du Boeuf, 27. You`ll open the next one immediately. On the Rue du Boeuf is possible to ""dive"" into another traboule on the same street in the house 16. This is the Pink tower's vestibule. And, of course, it is necessary to visit the Cathedral of Saint-Jean. The Cathedral dedicated to John the Baptist is very important for French history. Here Henry IV married Maria de Medici and Richelieu became a cardinal . Wow-effect is impossible: the Cathedral was battered Huguenots in the sixteenth century, and the sans-culottes in the XVIII century.

My husband and I are walkers so we enjoyed the cobblestone streets and the walk up the hill to the Basilique de Fourviere. We stopped in a small convent on the way down the hill which housed a small museum and story about Christian martyrs during Lugdunam's Roman period. The curator was charming despite our poor French and we enjoyed the museum. By the way, you can also see the Roman amphitheater up near the top of the hill without paying to go into the Gallo-Roman museum. We've seen our share of Roman ruins in Italy so we enjoyed the view without needing to get up close.

France,Vieux Lyon,4.0,"The most traveled to location in France, perhaps even in Europe, is Paris. And there is certainly a lot to see and experience there. But to really experience France you need to see a lot more than that one city which, in the end, only represents a narrow slice of French culture. A well traveled friend of mine, on hearing of my love for Paris, extolled the virtues of Lyon as the ultimate food destination in France. I took to reading about Lyon and discovered it's rich history as well as it's alternate take on French city life. Lyon is smaller and consequently packs it's history and culinary delights into a smaller footprint. And with it's easy to navigate public transportation you can get to everything more easily than in Paris.

The buildings and cobblestone streets of Vieux Lyon (Old Lyon) date back to the 15th century and you can feel it's history walking those ancient streets. Depending on the time of year, you may be sharing those streets with a lot of other tourists, but we found that manageable and it doesn't take away from the charm of the area. There are numerous restaurants and ""Bouchons"" (family style restaurants specializing in hearty working man's food.) There are several large, significant churches / cathedrals and the Basilica on the hill above. There are also roman ruins on the hill that are worth a visit. And after a day of sightseeing, Vieux Lyon is a wonderful area to take in at night with it's bars and restaurants serving outside tables (in warm weather), Crepe and Gelato stands, and public squares. The walk along the river in the moonlight is especially memorable.

We had to get Rome, London, Madrid, and multiple trips to Paris out of the way before we added Lyon to the list. We combined that trip with Provence, Marseilles and Nice, all of which was wonderful. So when you are ready for that ""deeper dive"" into Europe I would certainly recommend Lyon and when in Lyon, Vieux Lyon is not to be missed.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,Historic Old Lyon is especially fascinating because of its “traboules” which are passageways leading from streets through courtyards in buildings where people reside. They were used as early as the 4th century to allow more direct access to the water than the winding streets would allow. A very few are still open to the public and are so interesting to see.

Also, the fantastic cathedral is up there - don't miss it! There are shopping options, and lots of excellent restaurants. Consider a tour of parts of the taboule path network, a stop at a street side cafe for lunch or coffee. Open air markets for fresh produce, fruits meat and fish. Pastry shops that won't stop their temptations, and chocolate shops with some of the smoothest candies you will find. Wear good walking shoes and enjoy a full day (or two) wondering around.",May 2018

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"I have been in the different Lyon areas in one weekend and I can conclude by saying that overall, this is my favourite area of Lyon. It is like you expect an old city to be: very cosy and the perfect place for strolling around. It is centered around one cobbled street (Rue Saint-Jean). Along this street, you can find many things: museums, places to eat, ice cream shops, souvenir shops etc.

In concrete, I would recommend visiting the Cathédral Saint-Jean-Baptiste and the Musée Miniature et Cinéma. For food, try out 'Bintje & Zoet' (with real Belgian fries) and ice cream shop Amorino. Also the Place Neuve Saint-Jean is a really nice square to eat or drink something. Moreover, if you want to buy a classic souvenir from Lyon, or typical Lyon chocolates, this is the area to do so; you won't have another area with so much different options.

We had eaten on our way down from the Roman Amphitheater but all of the places looked nice and well patronised. To the point where I would recommend getting here early for lunch on a sunny weekend, or the tourists will take up all of the tables. Even there it is worth an hour or so looking specifically up at the architecture and the traditional signage. Really is a photographers paradise.",May 2018

France,Vieux Lyon,4.0,"Situated between the foot of the Fourvière hill and the Saone, Vieux Lyon is aptly named, since the district dates from the Middle Ages.
The medieval city ran into disrepair and was scheduled for destruction, but saved by the national government's Malraux law, designed to protect France's cultural sites.
A major reconstruction effort resulted in the area becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998.",Apr 2018
France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"Vieux Lyon, or old Lyon, is a lovely place to spend a few hours. I liked the tourist shops as well as the quirky little museums and displays. Visit the marionette museum and the displays of the miniature movie sets in the museum of cinema. There is some great movie memorabilia there too. Crepes are everywhere and there are little cafes / restaurants so no lack of food to be had. Pity the cathedral saint Jean is undergoing renovation but the astronomical clock is worth a look. The little passageways linking the streets are fascinating. If you are fit take a walk up to the top of the hill to visit the basilica and enjoy the view - if not fit like me, there is a funicular railway.",Apr 2018

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"A lot of effort has gone into restoring Lyon old buildings and they look amazing. The locals are really proud to show their city off and celebrate its heritage. When we decided to spend two days in Lyon, we initially thought that there will not be much to do. But we were proved wrong. There was so much to see and enjoy that we wish we had a coupleof days more to spend time and see Lyon. We made the most of our two days by buying the Lyon City Pass and fitting in as much as we could. It was hectic but we have left Lyon with wonderful memories. If you are planning to visit Lyon, we suggest you spend 3 to 4 days atleast so you can go around and enjoy the beautiful restored buildings, admire the architecture and learn more about the history and culture of this place. It is a good mix of the old and the new.

Crepes being made on the street, numerous shops, restaurants, cafes, boulangeries and gelato. A feast for the senses. We only planned 2 days here and would love to come for more days during another time of year prone to less rain and warmer temperatures. This tour gave us an idea of what was in the area and where to concentrate our time.",Mar 2018
France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"This place is usually a bit crowded, especially during weekends, but for good reasons !
""Le Vieux Lyon"" is one of the old historical parts of the city (together with ""La Croix Rousse"" on the other hill) and certainly contributed to Lyon being awarded UNSECO status.
Enjoy the tour of this medieval/renaissance town, which is even more pleasant thanks to the pedestrian situation of this area (with cobble stone streets). The whole place is quite charming, quaint, and the history of its development (linked to the development of trades, banking institutions and the silk production that developed in Lyon).
Try to get inside some of the famous ""Traboules"" which are passage ways through the houses, allowing at the time the merchants and inhabitants to circulate vertically while most of the streets are ""horizontal"", i.e. parallel to the river. But please be quiet and respectful of locals when crossing through those hidden alleys.
This area is also full of bars and restaurants, some of them quite good, some other not so much so rely on Tripadvisor or our travel guide to select the best ones.
To avoid crowds, try to schedule the visit during week days rather than weekends if you have a choice, and start early. It is however also nice to visit again in the late evening.
Don't miss the Cathedrale !
After your visit you can take the cable car up the Fourvière hill, from where you can walk back down to the Vieux Lyon afterward.

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"This is pedestrian heaven! And foodie paradise. I had no idea there could be so many specialty food shops. Do you want truffles? Limoncello? Or just the usual chorale or pastries or butchers? It's all there at your nostrils within a few short steps.

The cobbled street and old old buildings welcome young and old. The shop keepers are warm and friendly. And it's fun! Through side streets you glimpse steps up to the basilica or the not so distant Alps. The Saone River scours past sweeping fallen trees in a turbulent current down to the Confluence where it meets the Rhone.

Some of the traboule are open to the public and you can readily imagine life in the apartments up stone spiral staircases.

Life starts on the street early and finished late but it is not antisocial hustle, it is civic bustle.

We also walked along the river where the winter sun sent shadows from the leafless trees to dapple the nearby muted pastel buildings. There is much here to enjoy!

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"Definitely helps to have a tour guide to walk around the historic part of Lyon to discuss the architecture and life in the medieval times. Lots of shops selling silk, chocolates, pastries, etc. What the jewel to explore in Lyon is the interior corridors and courtyards. You access the courtyards by opening a door and stepping through the passage (first turn on the corridor light since it is dark) and then you are in the interior courtyard and you see some very interesting architecture - like a staircase turret to move between the floors. I think most tourists miss the courtyards if they are just walking around. Apparently during the Occupation, many of the French resistance used these passages to avoid the Nazi and to hid from the Nazi. This is a must do in Lyon.

Lovely to walk around at night.",Oct 2017
France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"Vieux-Lyon is a small area between the cliff edge of Fouviere and the river Saone, first build up in the middle ages. The street pattern is still medieval, so narrow streets, without much sunlight, certainly as later the buildings were extended upwards. The buildings from the later renaissance onwards became taller, and they build in what used to be the gardens between 2 row of streets. To reach these, there are covered walkways, the traboules, and inner courtyards. Both off these make the city unique. A lot of Florentine bankers left their mark on the city, which has many renaissance buildings and courtyards. Most of these are private, but like a few traboules, a few are open to tourists, such as the long traboule and the courtyard with the rose tower (the unofficial symbol of the city). This is a very touristy area, so there are many restaurants and tourist oriented shops. The St Jean cathedral is well worth a visit, but currently the astronomical clock doesn´t function.

The 'hidden secrets' are the traboules - the enclosed passageways connecting courtyards and usually start in one street and end at another. They aren't really hidden but the entrances to the traboules are not easy to find. The door to the traboules is usually marked by large but unassuming brass plaque. All of the traboules are privately owned and some are locked and not accessible to the public. A lovely area to visit but the narrow streets can get very crowded.",Oct 2017

France,Vieux Lyon,5.0,"Vieux Lyon has a lot to offer. Everywhere in vieux Lyon is walkable.EVERYWHERE! It's a great way to get around the city and discover shops that you would otherwise miss in transit. The views are spectacular at high points of the city making for perfect photo opportunities.

While the whole area is walkable, the option to take public transit comes in handy after a long day out. Their transit system is easy to navigate and personal transit maps are provided in English and French.

The people we came across in Vieux Lyon were friendly-if you show the effort of communicating in French, they will be more friendly. A majority of residents we came across were not fluent in English so I recommend brushing up on your French or bringing along someone who is fluent. :-)

There are a lot of different restaurants offering various styles of food. I highly recommend trying Lyonaise food and Lyonaise style food. It's delicious!

Please note: August is low season. Many business are closed until mid to late August as the owners have gone on holiday. It makes for a more quiet stay but some museums and businesses have different hours so it's best to plan ahead if there are specific places you wish to experience.

Grab some famous Cousin de Lyon and pink Prailenes while you're there. There are many shops that sell those and other famous candies of Lyon.

The architecture is very nice! There is a famous mural in Vieux Lyon that is changed every 10 years to reflect the changing city and it's people.

I recomend Vieux Lyon. Its a very nice part of Lyon that you will never get tired of visiting.

Some of the buildings are covered in a cover that looks like the buildings and this is a great idea but money must talk so a very large car advertisement has been pinned to the building. It’s blot on a beautiful view.

Hopefully in summer this area will return to it’s beautiful self.

3 stars just because of car ad but when it’s at its best it’s a five.

France,Place de la Bourse,4.0,"One of Bordeaux's most famous sites, the Place de la Bourse, or Royal Palace, sits by the riverfront, and acts as a striking break from the more modern buildings that house cafes and restaurants on either side of it.

Very well preserved and maintained, I'd don't believe you can enter the palace, but it certainly makes for a striking photo, especially when lit up at night.

Arguably it's biggest draw is the water mirror located across the road from it. This large, shallow pool has 3 settings, a vapour spray, waves and a perfectly still pool which offers a perfect reflection of the palace. These alternate at a rate I didn't quite work out, but fairly regularly.

The mirrored pool also acts almost as a focal point for citizens as throughout the day and night they meet and sit there, which creates a nice atmosphere. On a hot day you'll find kids and tourists ditch their shoes for a stroll through the pool, and occasionally teenagers will cycle through it, presumably just for attention from the passing crowd as I can't really work out any benefit.

Something of a must see if visiting Bordeaux, I've got to recommend at least taking a stroll past, truth be told it's something easily done unintentionally and a pleasant surprise!

France,Place de la Bourse,4.0,"This is a kind of huge flat paved area which fills to about an inch depth of water and then little emits streams of mist to about 4 feet high. This happens roughly every half hour or so. The mist is ice cold and very refreshing and lasts about ten minutes. People are allowed to walk through it and the kids love it. Afterwards, all the water drains down through the cracks and it almost dries up before happening again about thirty minutes later. As it is next to the river it gives a kind of magical and eerie atmosphere and makes for good photographs. When it fills up and before the mist starts, providing the wind isn't too strong, the water creates a kind of mirror effect which is good to photograph the skyline reflecting in it. If you are after such a photo though go early or late otherwise you will have hundreds of small children in it. :)

Whatever time of year you visit don't expect the perfect reflection as between the Place and the 'mirror' runs a very busy multiple lane road and tramline, hence there is normally a coach, or big white van, spoiling any reflection you see.

France,Place de la Bourse,5.0,"La Place de la Bourse in central Bordeaux is a particularly beautiful stretch of the elegant frontage along the left bank of the Garonne. The square faces out towards towards the Miroir d'Eau and is the backdrop for Bordeaux's impressive imagery.

The area itself is historic. It took 25 years to build from start to finish until the unveiling in 1745. It was always designed to be grand though the intended royal connections did not last. The name of course relates to the trading of stocks in the city.

The maritime stock exchange sadly no longer exists but the grand structures around the square still do. They are impressive sandstone buildings in great shape after the restoration of the square in 2004. They gleam and are beautiful, especially the two larger buildings on either side despite some repair work being carried out.

The building in the centre is slightly less attractive but is still a pleasant backdrop. At night the three are stunning thanks to the deliberate lighting. Against a dark sky the place is beautifully lit.

The actual square itself is also appealing. The cobble stones are all a little too aligned but nevertheless they are an enjoyable feature. The fountain is ok but not as impressive as the rest of the square, especially given the water doesn't seem to flow by mid April.

Place de la Bourse is easy to get to either walking or using the tram stop nearby. It is an essential part of Bordeaux and a wonderful element in the city.

Shares the same heritage as similar fountains we have visited in London where you are encouraged to get wet, but the size (about 80m by 20m) and situation were really exceptional. It’s sandwiched between the beautiful buildings of the Bourse and the river.

We got the tram from the rail station into town getting off at Place de la Bourse. The tickets can be bought inside the rail station and are franked by a machine on the tram. Easy 10 minute journey. The tourist office is across the road where we got a street map that provided a walking tour of the old city. Most of the day was spent walking the route. It proved to be an interesting tour - fantastic architecture, interesting squares, lots of open spaces - a youthful city. Will have to return for the museums another time! Word of caution! I was pleased not to be driving into the city - it's very busy and has an exceptional amount of lorries approaching it from Spain / Portugal. We stayed in Arcachon & got a train into the city. Easy to do!

Extremely clever use of contemporary electronic devises and VR enhance the experience.

At the end, you have to pick a single wine from maybe 8 or 9, and are served with a pour that in my view, doesn't do the ""wine capital of the world"" the justice it deserves.

My feedback ... finish the journey by serving maybe 3 or 4 tastings. Showcase those magnificent Bordeaux reds.

If you have children then go and visit.
If you want to get away from children maybe visit at 5 o'clock in the morning and you might be able to get the photo shown in the brochure.
We did get lucky on a second visit, as there was a dance class going on nearby and a lot of the people had moved off to that, so you could actually start to get the effect (a little). I actually think this could be fantastic, just have to time your visit.

It was a lot of fun watching kids and even adults play and splash around in the water. We were there for maybe an hour or so, as the golden hour of photography approached, we had many opportunities for really cool photos!

There seems to be two things that the pool does which is mist and fill up with water.

I am fortunate to be staying very close to this so will be seeing it again at night when it is lit!

France,La Petite France,4.0,"Quartier de la Petite in Grand Ile, Strasbourg is a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE since 1988. During Medieval Times this area of Strasbourg was home to many guild craftsmen especially tanners. The Maison des Tanneurs (Home of the Tanner's Guild) dated 1572 lies in the heart of La Petite and is still erect today. It is an area of canals and bridges, as well with clean maintained cobblestone streets. The Pont du Faisan is a swing bride near the center of town along with many footbridges. There are many 16th-17th century picture book half-timber homes to look at with many flower boxes hanging from their windows. When the buildings are lit after dark it presents a fairytale atmosphere. One of the buildings to look for is the House of Kammerzell dated 1427.

The Cathedral of Notre-Dame is the centerpiece of the Munsterplatz. Here you will find the cathedral museum, restaurants, cafes, bakeries and shops. If you are interested in authentic Alsace Lorriane cuisine. The restaurant, Au Vieux, is a good bet. It is a block from the cathedral tucked in with a lot of restaurants around it.

Another area of Strasbourg worth exploring features the Barrage Vauban (16th century guard towers)on both sides of the river with a long footbridge crossing. This area provides panoramic views of the Pont Couverts and is used by tourists as their starting point to view La Petitie. Strasbourg is a post card city full of enchantment, history and great restaurants.

After our cathedral visit, we went through narrow streets with intriguing buildings, ending up in beautiful La Petite France, a historic quarter of the city. La Petite France was located at the western end of Grande Île (Big Island) which was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area with many restaurants and shops was festive and vibrant with many visitors. We walked through the streets and crossed the bridges over the canal. The view of the canal and surrounding charming buildings were fascinating. We also saw canal tour boats packed with cheerful tourists passing by.

France,La Petite France,3.0,"The “La Petite France” district, with its canals, narrow streets and half-timbered houses, is the most beautiful district in Strasbourg.
The entire district is a pedestrian zone with many small shops, boutiques, antique shops and numerous restaurants and cafes. Some of the restaurants and cafes have beautiful terraces, so you can sit outside comfortably in good weather.

Worth seeing are the Münsterplatz (Place de la Cathédrale) with the Cathedral Notre-Dame Strasbourg, the Palais Rohan (the former city residence of the Strasbourg bishops), the Gutenbergplatz (named after the inventor of the printing press), the historic Barrage Vauban (with panoramic terrace and view on Pont Couverts).

Strasbourg is ""nice"", everything okay, but Strasbourg certainly cannot keep up with the ""big European cities"". It has too less to offer. 1-2 days, that's enough. It was on my way, but I would not recommend it for travel from far to there. You may be disappointed. It is nothing special.
If you are traveling by car, be careful not to get a ticket. I found the procedure extremely complicated. To pay retrospectively online - in the age of technology, only one website in French - sad and annoying.

France,La Petite France,3.0,"Had it not been for the colony of bed bugs that overtook us on December 26, our review would have been a 5-star one in the context of the hotel's official 3-star rating. The location is superb, the young staff was cheerful and attentive and the rooms though small were manageable. Unfortunately, due to the bed bug invasion, this episode left us visiting the Emergency Ward of a local hospital and generated a lot of work on the part of the staff and ourselves in eradicating the intruders. The hotel did change our room but relocated us immediately next door which did concern us. They also laundered all our belongings and paid for dry cleaning of some garments. However, we were astounded to hear the hotel manager suggest that we were responsible for bringing the bugs with us. Upon returning home, we contacted Accor Hotels to ask for some compensation on two separate occasions (using their website feed-back form) but received no response in the three months that since ensued. This is unfortunate since we have using Ibis hotels for well over 20 years, often annually, and could not even merit a reply one way or another. Further, this was a two-week stay, over the X-mas period, that marred our holiday including the fact that it generated unforeseen expenses. We are both seniors. Any compensation would have demonstrated good will.

It comes from the ""hospice of the syphilitic"" (Hospice des Vérolés, in French), which was built in the late fifteenth century on this island, to cure persons with syphilis, then called Franzosenkrankheit (""French disease"") in German.This is the most picturesque district of old Strasbourg. Fishermen, millers and tanners once lived and worked in this part of town where the streets have been built level with the waterways. Nice atmosphere with French and German influence.

When the tour was over, we got a chance to explore but not enough time to go back to all of them again.
Maybe next year I will return and see more of the markets and of Strasbourg. The people were lovely, the place diverse and welcoming, and walkable. We took tram to close by the market. It was a fun night but you really need at least 2 days there to explore in day and at markets.

France,La Petite France,5.0,"Located in the ""Western part"" of Strasbourg's ""Grand Isle"" lies this masterpiece of history. UNESCO has awarded it, in 1988, its ""World Heritage Designation""... The ambience is reflective of the 16th Century buildings and roadworks construction {made of ""cobblestones""}. There are ever so many ""fine details"" which will ""excite one's imagination"" as well as contribute substantially to one's memories of the small to Medium sized city. Strasbourg's ""rich history"" and economic evolution is displayed... TripAdvisor has also awarded it the coveted ""Certificate of Excellence"". It is also one of the most highly rated (by travellers like you and I) attractions in Strasbourg. Definitely worthy of a visit- both to the city as well as this ""historical district"".

France,La Petite France,5.0,"I had never heard of Petite France until we went on a walking tour in the area. It is a beautiful part of the city, and you immediately feel like you have stepped back in time. Strasbourg has lots of history, and has changed hands over the centuries to be German, then French, then German and back again. Because of this, you have German and French influences all throughout Strasbourg, reflected in the street names, architecture and food. Petite France has saved its French influence in all of these areas. You can take a boat trip along the river, you can eat and enjoy the ambiance, and shop or just take pictures and marvel at the charming and relaxing atmosphere.",Aug 2019

France,La Petite France,5.0,"La Petite France or Little France has a thousand words in it’s beauty. If you lovemaking beautiful picturesque than bring along a good camera since you’re talented and you’ll not miss a thing here. Strasbourg has plenty of beautiful sites and La Petite is sure to please artists. I wish I could just sit at one corner bridges and sketch them all. France is blessed with many beautiful sites and every cities has a different story. Strasbourg is just a border city from Offenburg and not far from Switzerland and Liechtenstein so you’ll get to see mostly local tourists. While on the long bridge just don’t let anyone rushes you. Stand right in middle of La Petite bridges and get the best pictures from left to right where the centuries old Chatéau sits on the Rhine River before your eyes.
Than take a walk to the end bridge that takes you through the pretty villages along Rhine and you’ll find for more. You could sit at La Conde â Lindge a Cafe under big trees next to Rhine River and appreciate the manifique views. This places has great energy with the rivers currents running loudly and sorts of characters within the community. There’s one begging with an honest placard asking €1 for alcohol. You don’t find that many in France and some find their home under the centuries old solid metal bridges. The pretty florals arrangement along the bridges is typically French as same with their homes. Walking further you’ll find surprises, the Place De La Cathédrale another manifique piece of art.

Then, if you are also an amateur photographer, take out you camera and record a few memories. My gear: a DSLR with a zoom lens. No tripod. No extra lens to weigh me down. Every once in a while check your white balance and histograms to make sure all is going well technically. Walk around, keep your eyes on the alert, and grab some fascinating shots.",Sep 2018

It takes you at a slow pace round La Petite France part of this lovely city.
Whatever else - you must see this part.
It is a time warp with very narrow streets/canals and half timbered houses from the 15-16 century -all well preserved.The streets are cobbled and the whole area is very picturesque
In the Middle Ages it was home to the tanners/millers and fishermen and today is a world heritage site.
There are many characterful eateries and bars to enjoy.
You can also take a river/canal trip through the area.

It was a smaller area than i was expecting but crammed full of places to eat. Gorgeous on a sunny day. We found it extremely easy to find this area even though we drove and parked here. There are signs everywhere so it would be hard to miss. We also found it a fairly easy walk to other parts of Strasbourg like the Cathedral etc. Sadly, it was so hot that we decided to miss out on a boat ride since there was no cover on the boat.

France,La Petite France,5.0,"Gorgeous area largely flanked by the river Ill allows you to wander and get lost for a while among bridges decorated with flowers and winding cobblestone streets. The area did not feel overly touristy though it is very popular with visitors - my impression is that there may be fewer ""tourist"" shops in this area selling the usual trinkets. Instead I encountered shops selling quality clothing, locally-made crafts, terrific Jeff de Bruges chocolates and a terrific tea shop called Dammann Frères. An actual women's plus-size clothing shop (Couleurs ronde en couleurs) made my day. This beautiful section of town gets busy as early as 8 or 9 in the morning in July; crowds began to thin after 4 pm. A multitude of quality restaurants in the area are within walking distance if you are staying nearby. Both the Strasbourg Cathedral and Place Kléber are about 1 km from Petite France. During my stay the area was quiet by 10 pm, with almost no one out on the streets at this time, so if a quieter area of town is desired (at night) for lodging, consider Petite France.

So picturesque and photo-worthy. I took so many pictures of this area and don't regret a thing!

France,La Petite France,5.0,"The picturesque areas of La Petite France are between the 2 bridges Pont Faisan and Pont St. Martin and probably center around Place Benjamin Zix where the House of Tannners, now a restaurant, is located. This area is a tourist magnet. The 16th and 17th century half-timbered 4 story row houses that line the narrow lanes and the waterway provide an ambience of yesteryear without the smells of open sewer ditches and the noise of tanneries and water mills. The multilingual illustrated boards around Place Benjamin Zix inform visitors about the industry and past living conditions of this area. The spice, grain, and water mills and bathing houses have vanished from the ""3 fingers"" of land in the RIver Ill channels, but the houses have been renovated and still are used for shops, restaurants at the ground level. From Place Benjamin Zix there is a pedestrian footbridge over the canal from where excellent photos and views of these houses lining the canal can be taken.

One would think this area could be called ""Little Venice"" instead of ""La Petite France"", a name used in the past for this area because of its hospital to treat French soldiers with syphilis. The area is also referred to as ""tanners' district"". Tanners who lived in these houses used the upper stories to dry their animal skins, often hanging them out from those upper windows. They had their own pub across from the House of Tanners.

Crowds will thin out around Pont Couverts where the 3 towers and Barrage Vauban are located. While Rue de Moulins provides distant views of the 3 towers on Pont Couverts, it is better to actually walk along Pont Couverts to see the Barrage Vauhan. It's only a 5 minute walk from Place Benjamin Zix to Pont Couverts using Pont Faisan and Quais de la Petite France, one of the ""fingers"". However, the best photo of those 3 towers on Pont Couverts, once part of the medieval fortifications, is from the roof of the Barrage Vauban, another 7 minute walk.

Rue des Dentelles also connects Pont St. Martin with Pont Faisan. This narrow pedestrian lane has guild flags hanging from the buildings and many restaurants, but it is not particularly picturesque. Walk 10 minutes along this winding lane to finally reach the Cathedral Notre Dame.

We walked a circular route in La Petite France which took about 30-45 minutes. This area is a ""must see"" as it is so charming with its well preserved half-timbered 16th and 17th century houses along the waterway. We took many post-card type pictures.

France,La Petite France,5.0,"This was a wonderful stop on our down-the-Rhine river tour that required us to take buses from our dock across the Rhine in Kehl, Germany. An imperial Free City during the Reformation, Strasbourg's embracing of the Reformation made it a magnet for refugees and reformers alike. My personal quest was to find the church where Reformer John Calvin pastored a group of French expats. I found it, but it's no longer a church. A plaque notes its historical significance, and while that was a bit disappointing, it was still cool to find and identify. We visited lots of little shops, eating outside of a simple little local bread/sandwich shop with a mother and daughter from Australia. Walking around, we tried some bakeries, and then found a confectioner's with excellent macaroons. Just a great time, and so absolutely worth visiting!

All the French, Germanic and Swiss influences, seem to come together harmoniously in this location. Peaceful walks along the river in the evening, with floating bars on the banks, which seemed to be most popular with the students. It is very central to all of the sights, shops and resturants. One does not need a car, or a cab to get around in this city. I would recommend walking everywhere. There is so much to see. I would also reccommend the boat trip that is very informative, about 1 hour long and vey enjoyable. Note. If taking the 'Topless' boat in the summer months, I would STRONGLY reccommend one wears a hat or a head covering of some discription, for the duration of the trip.

Throughout the neighbourhood you can find a lot of little shops packed with souvenirs, cafes, bars, restaurants, beautiful small old city squares and other city's famous landmarks such as: Barrage Vauban, Ponts Couverts, Saint Thomas Church and Old Saint Peter’s Church.
The most interesting fact about this place is the name. It doesn't come for, like some people think, patriotic or architectural reasons, but from the ""hospise of the syphilitic"" then called Französenkrankheit (""French disease"") in German.

We were so mesmerized by the picturesque historic quarter we came many times at different times of the day. The fact we just stayed across the river helped.

The old half-timbered houses were previously occupied by leather tanners hence the name Le Tanneries. Who would have thought the stinky place would one day be a major tourist attraction for Strasbourg.

Obviously it is the tourist highlight of Strasbourg. Many small cobbled streets and bridges pass over the River I’ll and all provide magnificent scenes through to medieval style houses/restaurants etc being the old tanneries etc of the area.
It is largely pedestrians only with few cars allowed in the area.
Certainly tends to get very busy with tour groups all over the place

Le Petite e France (also known as the Quartier des Tanneurs; German: Gerberviertel; ""Tanner's Quarter"") is a historic quarter of the city of Strasbourg in eastern France. It is located at the western end of the Grande Île, which contains the historical centre of the city. At Petite France, the River Ill splits up into a number of channels that cascade through an area that was, in the Middle Ages, home to the city's tanners, millers and fishermen, and is now one of Strasbourg's main tourist attractions. Petite France forms part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Grande Île, designated in 1988.[1][

A simply magical place where the camera cannot be put down.

France,La Petite France,4.0,"Try to get here early in the morning, then it is not that crowded. We stoped here on a Sunday when we thought that it might be a bit calmer because all shops is closed, but most of the restaurants will open, and at that time a huge amount of bus loads of tourists come here in groups. So if you are here early, then you might be able to get some pictures without masses of people.
We came by car, and found a parking garage under ground between the cathedral and this area, very good location. Not cheep of course, but great to have access to a toilet and easy parking. Check the height of your car before driving in to the garages. You don’t want to have a roof box on your car!
Be aware that some streets will be closed during some periods in the day, so you don’t get stuck in town.

The need to use every space led to the overhanging buildings which in places leave almost fully sheltered walkways. There are a variety off shops and the old symbols of the guilds can be seen all through the streets. Traditional food is made Andrew sold including the local gingerbread that had an amazing shelf life. To the tankers, up in the roofs there are there are flaps that open, the tanned leather was left to dry in the ever and the flaps open for ventilation. A guide will always be able to tell you more, so worth tagging along. This is a very picturesque place and it almost impossible to take a bad photo.

There is a section of town called Petite France, which is not this Petite France that has the many old houses. We were walking and typed Petite France into Google maps and it took us to a residential area. We eventually found it as it is adjacent to Ponts Coverts and Barrage Vauban. We did get many great pictures and almost took a boat ride, until we found out they just rented boats and we'd have to pilot the vessels. No one in our group felt confident to do that. Also it has few gift shops which we were disappointed about. There were some great artists there if you're interested in any paintings.

One caveat is to be wary of con artists who try to get you to get your purse or wallet out and then try to rob you. I was approached by a well dressed young man who asked my for change. I was foolish enough to try to help him and was rewarded by a crude attempt to snatch a £20 note from my wallet. I was able to foil him and see him off with my money intact- my French is good enough to offer him some colourful language suggestions as to what he could do next!.

France,La Petite France,5.0,"Cobbled, very narrow streets lined with half timbered and some colourful houses make this a beautiful area. No traffic here except for the little train that rides tourists around. However Strasbourg has so much to see other than just La Petite France. It has a wonderful train station painted with lots of graffiti type pictures. Bicycles to hire everywhere so that you can cycle around. Roads are busy with cars, bikes, very modern trams and people so take care as sometimes the bike lane ends and you have to ride elsewhere until you get back on a bike lane. Do not use cellphones while riding bikes as it is not allowed and you will be fined. If you hire bikes from the self serve machine be careful when returning bike as you must lock it before returning key to the machine. There is an office in the station where you can go for help if you do something wrong when hiring/returning bikes. There is a beautiful river running through the town with lots of bridges, including an enclosed bridge, and flowers and of course swans on the water. It is very busy with a lot of hustle and bustle but when you get to the old town it is better because although there are a lot of people there is no traffic in the center so it seems calmer. Here there are lots of little shops and the beautiful Gothic style Notre Dame cathedral, with 332 stairs which you can climb to get a birds eye view of Strasbourg. When climbing the spiral staircase look through little slits in wall to get stunning views of the gargoyles and other statues as you pass level with them. You also get to see the roof and window areas from close which is different to viewing from the ground. There are so many places along the river that offer picturesque views and in some places you will see artists sitting below the bridges next the the banks of the river drawing. The whole place is full of beautiful coloured houses, some half timbered, and buildings, some covered in flowers, some in art. Would advise going on little train ride as it is interesting to hear about the houses, building and area in general. A wonderful place to stroll around, day or night and take in the surrounding beauty that is Strasbourg.

France,Le Capitole,4.0,"The Capitole (French for ""capitol"") is the heart of Toulouse’s municipal administration and its city hall, Opera/Theater. It’s a Neoclassical style pink brick 135 m long facade dates back to 1750 and the eight columns represent the original eight capitouls. In 1873, a bell tower was added by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, but only the gate in the courtyard remains from Henri IV medieval times.
The courtyard displays a plaque to the Duke de Montmorency who was decapitated there after his rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu.
City architect Raymond Moretti in 1995 redesign the Place du Capitole, creating a lovely pedestrian walking area in front of the Capitole with an Occitan cross on the ground in front of it. Around on the other three sides of the square are many popular restaurants and cafes, a little expensive, but a great place to sit and people watch. To the south of the square is the city's Vieux Quartier (Old Quarter), a tangle of lanes and leafy squares also full of cafes, shops.
If you have time visit the magnificent the 60-m long, 10-m high and 9-m wide reception hall and lounges with their wonderful collection of paintings on the walls and ceiling inside the Capitolium building.

TIP: Go early in the morning to get the red of the sunrise on the brick buildings.

France,Le Capitole,5.0,"I arranged for my hotel to have a driver pick me up at the airport. His name was Dani and he had little English. My schoolboy French was helping but only a bit. He was telling me today is a strike day - jeune vest. I had forgotten the meaning of jeune so I did not understand. He dropped me very close to the hotel and I walked past the first police cordon to see three police vans parked right in front of my hotel and a row of riot police in full armour lined up across the street. As i looked ahead to the Place Capitole which was thronged with people - I saw them - people of all types, races and classes of society in yellow vests - jeune - yellow, doh!
I dropped my stuff in the room and raced out to the Place and joined the throng. The photos are poor because I could not find a place to get up high. But there were all these people singing songs, marching around the Place. The riot police were there to ensure they did not march down past my hotel, but stuck to the Place. The mood was festive and all the cafes around the Place were filled with people enjoying the event. What are they protesting about I asked? everything! No molotov cocktails, stone throwing or violence in Toulouse as far as I could see. So I joined the crowd and had an awful beer and a melon and serrano ham late lunch. The place was buzzing. After the yellow vests passed on a concert began and it looks like the old Place is going to buzz tonight. This is the part of travel I do not plan that is just so much FUN! 🤩. Just as I am finishing this post some boys have sprung into a chorus singing folk songs. This is the centre of Toulouse - enjoy it.

When we were there, the square was not in use for any activities. You think of the great squares of Europe and wish that they would banish traffic completely and allow restaurants and other activities to flow out into the great square.

Today, it is the mayoral office & administrative centre for the city and is also the location for one of the main theatres/opera houses of Toulouse. To its front, you find a large impressive square, which is surrounded by complementary buildings and which is the site for a daily market. Behind it, you have a pretty plaza where you can visit the main tourist office of Toulouse in what was once the archive tower for the original Capitole building. On entering the Capitole, you are presented with a grand courtyard which gives a hint of the treasures that await you. The courtyard leads you to a majestic staircase where grand murals, depicting medieval fetes and jousting tournaments, pull you back to the days of knights & their ladies. From the top of the stairs you wander through a series of grandiose salons where local artists recreated various aspects of the culture of Toulouse and its environs in the form of huge paintings. The final Salle des Illustres is stunningly huge and reflects important events in the history of the city. It also provides wonderful views out over the Place de Capitole.

It has the usual cafes; shops etc surrounding that square.
To be honest theres far nicer areas to shop around Toulouse centre.
So, apart from the building being such a lovely building in its own right, the square and surrounding area is probably way down my list of areas to visit or hang out .... 3 stars for the building itself (if the architecture of the building wasn't so perfect I'd have the square etc down at a one star.

France,Le Capitole,5.0,"Le Capitole building dates back to the 17th century. It is still a functioning administrative building and houses the town hall and the Capitol Theatre. Whilst the exterior of the building is attractive in its own right, you need to go inside to experience its true beauty. And it is free to enter!

You get your first glimpse of the splendid interior when you approach the Grand Staircase (constructed in 1886), as the staircase itself is decorated with large colourful murals, a painted ceiling and gold-trimmed adornments.

Having climbed the stairs, you enter into an equally beautiful room with its own painted walls and ceiling, by the artist Paul Gervais (1859-1944).

The next room displays paintings by Henri Martin (1860-1943). These large paintings cover the walls of the room.

The final room is the Hall of the Illustrious that was redesigned by architect Paul Pujols between 1892-1898, when he converted three smaller rooms into this one impressive larger room. Interestingly, it seems that the Hall of the Illustrious is used for civil marriage ceremonies. What a beautiful setting for a wedding!

France,Le Capitole,4.0,"La place is a nice one, if not surprising, a classical vision that screams Mitteleuropa rather than Mediterranean coast. However, it's how well integrated the ever-present modern commercial establishments are that make for an interesting ensemble: Toulouse seemingly refuses to choose between its fascination with Nespresso, McDonalds and never ending clothes shops and its surviving ancient charme: from the gold leafed shop signs to the brick facades, the rest of the square complements rather than contrasting the well preserved city hall.",Jul 2017
France,Le Capitole,3.0,"We parked up here (very convenient!) and sat with a beer and a snack people watching for an hour or so before having a wander around the city. We went on a Tuesday when there was a hippy/African market in the square selling a range of throws, carved wooden sculptures from West and Central Africa and various trinkets. A nice way to wile away some holiday time. We wanted to visit the Capitol building but it was closed for some reason.",Jul 2017
France,Le Capitole,5.0,"Placed in the centre of the city, this square is spread out beautifully surrounded by various kinds of seating area, cafes, restaurants, shops, quirky art and little hidden facts about the city and its history.

City Hall building is nothing short of a mini museum, beautifully portraying the many talents, arts, paintings, murals, sculptures in its grand, spacious and majestic halls.. One leading to another. It's a little fairy tale. Do not miss this if you are in toulouse.",Jul 2017

France,Le Capitole,4.0,This beautiful main square is a good place to start/end a city tour. The capitol is a very impressive building and since the place is so huge it doesn't feel overcrowded. If you to have dinner there you should bring at least 30 € per person. But I guess this is normal if you eat at the touristic centre of a French town.,May 2017
France,Le Capitole,3.0,"Lively large space, some seating if you want to rest and watch the world go by. Not the best place to arrange to meet as it is quite large, so you need to be specific. The cafes that line 2 sides are ok, main problem if you sit on the front are the passing beggars - the staff get them to move along - but that's not pleasant. I wouldn't choose to eat here.",Jun 2017
France,Le Capitole,5.0,"I recently travelled to Toulouse for a conference and had already wandered through the Place du Capitole a couple of times, before I had the opportunity to enter the Town Hall/Capitole itself. Many visitors may think this building is out of bounds, but in fact, so long as you aren't there on a day that the council is having meetings, you have the chance to go inside and check out the architecture and the interior on your own! And what an amazing interior! I was immediately taken aback by how much art was crammed into so little space! And fantastic art for that matter! The walls of the interior are covered in large artworks, by some rather well-known mainly ""local"" painters: Paul Gervais, Henri Martin, Jean-Paul Laurens, Benjamin Constant and Jean-André Rixens, to name a few. The Salle des Illustres, the main gallery shall we say, is perhaps the most amazing thing to behold, I could have spent forever there! Just looking at all the fantastic expressions and beautiful artwork embellishing every surface! If you are someone who likes art or architecture, this is a MUST SEE. I was really really saddened to find out no books focusing only on the artwork inside this building exist!! I need one immediately!
nb. It probably doesn't need 1-2 h to look through this building, but I enjoyed spending at least an hour soaking everything in. It is also something you can do a quick fly through tour off, to at least have the experience of enjoying it.

That is something very personal and may well not be true for others!,Apr 2017
France,Le Capitole,4.0,"The Place du Capitole is s huge square dominated by the stunning Capitole building which is now the town hall. It's definitely worth taking a photo or two.

There's not any traffic bar the little buses that go round so it feels very clean.

France,Le Capitole,3.0,"The elegant public heart of Toulouse has been unnecessarily compromised with a plague of white flea-market tents that don't allow you to experience the space in it's entirety. About three-quarters of the perimeter is lined with shops, cafés and hotels with large garish gold lettering catering primarily to tourists. There are many other public spaces scattered throughout Toulouse that are not as grand and elegant but are much more pleasant and spatially satisfying. I recommend spending a few minutes here then go somewhere else for a drink or a bite to eat. Toulouse is loaded with great spaces with great restaurants, cafés and shops. The City needs to reclaim its heart and return the Place du Capitole to the high standard of urban quality it once had.

In front of ""le Capitole"" are ""Les Arcades""; the modern paintings on the top all along are amazing ! there are very interesting bars along ""Les Arcades""; The so called ""Le Florida"" is an institution, with a bar restaurent at the first floor, and a very cool tendance bar called ""Le Roof"" at the second floor, looking like the ""Indian Room"" ! All the bars of ""les Arcades"" have nice terrasses ! the two other sides of la place du Capitole are dedicated to shops and restaurents, from the lower class (north side) to the higher (south side) ! The place itself is big, without any fountain or anything excepted the giant regional emblem on its surface, but thanks to this a lot of formal an informal shows and animations occur moreless every days; we had very goog moments at Place du Capitole, like during a Ruggby Show !

France,Le Capitole,5.0,"This is probably one of the most impressive city halls that you can visit, and from my point of a view something you have to see when visiting Toulouse.
The architecture by itself is already impressive, but what really makes it special are the pieces of art from different periods displayed inside. It is actually more of a museum than a government building, and it actually served as a museum as well. Also, inside it you do get a good feeling for some aspects of French culture, where officialdom still carries a lot of weight, more so than in Anglo-Saxon cultures.",Jul 2016

We suggest to bring some water with you, as it can be challenging to climb the stairs when it's very hot (the whole stairway is not covered and it's very hard to find repair from the sunrays).

Additional tip: if you have some spare energy we highly recommend a walk in the old town, which is located just 5 minutes away by walk. There you can rest, have a drink or a nice meal in a typical restaurant.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,4.0,"From the old town we walked up the hill and many steps to reach the chateau and a wonderful cemetery. Mostly family graves but amazing gravestones and huge memorial sites. Sounds wrong but a beautiful resting place. Lovely to walk around and see the families going back 200 years or so.
Even from the cemetery you can get great views but walking and following the wall down to a couple of great viewing points gives you a panoramic shot of Nice and the promenade tight around to the airport.
On the other side you get the views into the port and beyond to Cap Ferrat. Just 1thing signs say toilets but we could not find any so certainly make a visit before you walk up to the chateaux & cemetery.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"In July my daughter and grand-daughter arranged to do this walk, and despite arthritic knees I decided to attempt it with them, and succeeded. Although there are lots of steps, they fortunately zigzag and there is ample opportunity to rest and take in the view. There is a spectacular waterfall on the way up (good opportunity for taking pictures). The views from the top are spectacular – The old town on one side, and the Promenade des Anglais in the other direction. An unexpected bonus was finding a small café on the top. I took advantage, and have never enjoyed a cold drink so much in my life.
I enjoyed it tremendously, and having found that it was not as difficult as I feared I did it again with my wife on a return visit in early October. We both managed, taking our time, and taking the opportunity to stop and take in the view en-route.
Since returning home I have read that there is a lift to the top. I was unaware and saw no signs indicating this. Just as well as I would not have had the same sense of achievement as I had in walking to the top.

there are at least two refreshment stands to visit ( on the day we went it was 87 degrees and humid we made use of both places ) the view from above is breathtaking.
Make sure you visit both sides of the hill, one gives you the postcard view of the bay & the other side gives you the port. What you can't see is under you on the PORT side ( not nautical term ) is the war memorial cut into the side of mountain, when you visit the port keep an eye out for it, it's HUGE and beautiful.
We went up twice during our visit once we walked down via the cemetery route and ended up right outside the Place Massena and once e took the more direct stairs back to the Promenade de Anglais.The View is die for & should be on every Nice travelers Must do list! ENJOY!

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"If you head up the western side of the hill, it does look like there are a lot of steps but it isn’t too bad, with several breaks along the way. This gives the best views out back over Nice and the beach, which in the afternoon sun was glorious. At the top, the waterfall is definitely worth visiting, if only to get some nice misty breeze to cool down! There are a few little cafes at the top, so it’s worth persevering and grabbing a drink there. We then chose to walk down the eastern side which was much more shaded, and while the harbour isn’t as picturesque the framing through the trees makes for some great photos too.

It was fabulous!! The elevator ride is free and there are easy pathways and stairs to get around the park to visit the castle ruins and get to the viewing platforms. We highly recommend going first thing in the morning (9:30am) because there are less people and great photo opportunities with the morning sun behind the stunning view over the blue/green water along the coastline and Nice promenade.

It's a lovely park area with views on one side of the Promenades des Anglais etc and the port of Nice on the other. There's a couple of cafes up there and we stayed for far longer than expected because it was just a nice place to be and plenty of bits to explore.

There is a lovely waterfall that is also a great viewing spot over the city. At this point there is a green park area and cafe where you can get a well-deserved drink and a bit of shade.

At the summit there is a 360 degree view of the whole area, again with a cafe for a well-deserved rehydration before the trip down.

Most of the climb is sheltered so a bit of shade from the sun. There is a free public lift too but when we visited that was working so check if you don't fancy the steps.

There are several kiosks at the top (at least one is cash only) and several bathrooms. There is also an archaeological site, several viewing points, a large playground and a man-made waterfall. The last isn’t always running and can be hard to find as the park is not well signed. The waterfall is on the promenade side directly under the top viewing platform.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,4.0,"I give this 4 instead of five because I do not see how this can be the number one thing to do in Nice over the shore and town itself, e.g., if Nice did not have the shore or interesting town you would not go there for this hill!

That being said, I think you have to go to Castle Hill if you are in Nice. The views are phenomenal.

There are two ways to get there, by foot or by car. By foot is the better experience because you get to experience the Old Town on the way and the path up itself looks at some interesting properties (and you get to get some exercise - we walked off some gelato). There is a man made waterfall to see on the walk up too - do research on how to find it, but there is probably just as good a view from below.

Warning, the path up is gated and closes relatively early (check the time online), so, plan accordingly.

Warning - the drive up can be narrow in several spots, but if you are driving around Europe these situations are common.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"Of all the places essential to see in Nice, this is one of them
On the top of a hill overlooking the bay of Nice, originally built for military purposes Castle hill dominates the city, separating the eastern part - the port - and the western part - the old town
Once at the top (you can climb up the stairs, or get in the free lift) it offers the most spectacular panoramic views of the bay, the ruins of an old cathedral, a view of the port, and has a lovely (though artificial) waterfall
There are toilets and a small cafe too
It is lovely to walk back down and visit the Jewish and catholic cemeteries, where you will find tombs of many aristocrats and famous people - apparently it costs 30k just to ‘reserve a plot’ with a substantial yearly upkeep fee

Our GPS lead us to a dead end (rue Emmanuel Philibert) and there were no indications on how to get to this place. Had to ask people on the street our direction...
Once we arrived at one of the entrance of the hills, we start climbing the stairs again and again.
There is a free lift that is located at the end of the promenade des anglais near the hotel Suisse but as we were at the opposite side, we decided to climb by ourselved.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"This is the gift that keeps on giving.
Take the stairs up from the promenade des anglais to tour ballenda for a quick viewpoint. Then keep traveling up the slope by the trees until you reach the waterfall. It is amazing and one you must see when visiting Nice. It is spectacular and the view on the other side just adds to the wow factor. Don't stop there - walk around and stop by the ruined castle. Not sure if you can walk among the ruins as they were carrying out archeology when we were there. You can certainly walk around them. Then onwards to the park and mosaics, all the while taking in the 360 degree breathtaking views. There is a lift to take people up and down. However the path to the lift going down could only just fit a pram in so probably not wheelchair friendly.

There are ruins of the old chateau, with some detailed explanations (in French, English and Italian). There is an impressive waterfall on the western side. There is also a children’s playground and a couple of small kiosks at the top, but the coffee was better down in the Old Town.

It was a spontaneous trip up, up, up with my 19-year-old fit, outdoorsy son! My middle-aged, out-of-shape body had a good work out and fun time. There were plenty of stairs and hills but lots of shade and relatively flat areas just when I needed them.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"Castle Hill is a must do if you are in Nice. It's a bit of a trek (believe me, I heard plenty complaints from those in our group who were not used to exercise), but there are so many little areas to stop and enjoy along the way. There's a beautiful old cemetery to stop at after the initial set of steep stairs. Along the road up to the top there are a lot of mosaic tile facades and great look out points along the way to enjoy the full scope of the cote d'azure. The waterfall is pretty spectacular, but difficult to take pictures of due to the size and the limited walk ways (unless you enjoy a lot of tourists in your picture...) There is a cute outdoor cafe area toward the top if you want a snack or a drink along with a rest. The views at the top are absolutely stunning though.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"If a sweeping panoramic view of Nice and the Mediterranean coast is on your mind there is no better place in the city.
Entrance is free.
There are two ways to get to the top. By stairs which are accessible all the time and by elevator which is a free service but shuts down at 7 pm in the evening.
The elevator entrance is located at the end of the Promenade. Its a big built white structure. You cant miss it (Picture attached)
The TRAM network doesn't go till the elevator. If you have a car, drive till the end of the promenade or walk from any of the stations near the promenade through old town to reach the base.
Carry water and note public toilets are very few in the park.
Don't miss the view of the port and the fountain.
Go during sunset for the best views.

This is a perfect spot to take in the views of Nice and the coastline and if you are a photographer its the perfect spot for some nice shots and time lapses. There are plenty of viewpoints offering different angles of the city and the coast. The park is a lovely place to walk about as well. There are a bunch of trails inside and well paved in even though it goes through lush vegetation. You will feel completely secluded and cut off from the rest of the world. One can spend hours here and best part is crowds thin down considerably up here. Apart of an ice cream store there isn't much in the way of food option so you will have to either bring your own basket or go up there after a meal. This is a must do while at Nice and one not to be missed.

At the top, there is a lot of park land, perfect for a picnic, as well as several ruins that are really interesting and well preserved. A little further up is a tower that provides stunning views of the harbour. During my visit, a guitarist was sat on this tower playing very beautiful music making the experience even more idyllic! My boyfriend and I did this walk and enjoyed Caste Hill for an afternoon, if you have a large group or children you could extend this experience over the day with a picnic. Would highly recommend.

if you have a stroller perhaps you’d like to access from the bottom though, because there’s an elevator and you can skip all the stairs that way.
there’s a little cafe with a few beautiful play areas for the children. lots of green space to picnic.
the scenery is gorgeous of course and all is at no charge.
Vielle Nice is steps away from the elevator at the bottom (not too many steps if you don’t want to wait in line for the elevator). we walked around here for a while and grabbed some food before hiking back up to our car.

There's a free elevator that we'll take you almost all the way to the top. (Be aware it is not always working)

You can also go almost all the way up with your own car. But to be honest, the best is just to take the elevator if it is working, because finding a parking is not easy task.",Apr 2019
France,Castle Hill of Nice,4.0,"Rather than depending on the elevator, which several people told us might or might not be operating, we decided to take a taxi--great idea!

We entered from the old town via steps. The man made waterfall is nice the views of the prom are stunning. The sea looks so blue.
It wasn't too busy whilst we visited over Easter and we were able to take photos and just look at the views with no issues. The area is well maintained. The park areas are pretty with well manicured plants and flowers. Mosaic floors.
Views of the port of Nice are good too. We were lucky we visited on the first few days as on Easter Monday the whole area was shut off.

There are several downsides:
1. The lift wasn't functioning for 3 days and the reason quoted was 'bad weather'! One cannot take the stroller by the stairs
2. There is no information about bicycle/car route going up but we saw several cars that had come up all the way

There are a few ways to get to the top, including a Little white train that runs from the promenade. There is also an ascending staircase and the road way winds up to the top.

We were on a Segway tour so got to the top with ease. The views were really amazing and you can see the whole city of Nice on one side and the port on the other. There is a lovely park at the top as well with playground for children and lots of paths to walk around for a 360 view.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"Castle Hill is well worth the climb. The views are spectacular. The parks and public spaces atop the hill are very nice. I would put this in my top five things to do in Nice.

Historically, it is an interesting spot because you can imagine why this hill was fortified in ancient times. It has a commanding view of the sea, river plains around it, and the hills further beyond. It would have been hard to sneak up on it.

There is an elevator from the Old Town near the end of the Promenade, but it was broken the entire time we were in Nice, so we climbed the stairs. If going straight up the stairs is too much of a climb for you, there are some more terraced stairs from deeper in the Old Town. There are some roads that switchback up the landward side of the hill.

Check out the cemeteries. Interesting history and art (if you like tombstone art).

There are some multi-lingual interpretive signs, but this is weakness. I suggest you read up on the history of the hill before climbing it.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,4.0,"This hill rises to about 301 feet at the eastern boundary of Old Town. Just rubble remains of the military fortress that stood here from the 11th to the 18th century. But we went up here for the panoramic views of Nice and the Bay of Angels and found picnic grounds, cemeteries, the remains of a tower, much greenery and more.

We didn't regret climbing hundreds of steps at the end of Quai du Etais Unis to get here, but we would have preferred taking one of the two free elevators that start around the corner from the steps.. Alas, both elevators remained out of order during our week's visit in Nice. We appreciated the occasional landings during our ascent. Not only did they give us a nice breather but they provided many photo ops for the scenes below. We saw few others coming or going around noon on a Sunday when we made the climb nor at the top. The hill proved to be quite peaceful and a welcome respite from the crowds at ground level.

The ruins of Bellanda Tower stand near the end of the steps and offer a platform to focus on the panorama. From this vantage point, the beaches, Old Town and parts of modern Nice provide the main views. Trails meander through thick brush, but I opted to visit the Jewish cemetery, the first of three cemeteries that I came to. It stands near a road, which gives vehicles access to the hill.

We descended via a road toward the port and agreed that this would provide a more comfortable way to the top than the steps.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"A must while in Nice - worth the walk! The best view of the city, and there are other ways to the top besides walking!!!",Dec 2018
France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"A trip up here has everything - fresh air, exercise, greenery and views over Nice and the whole bay. Be aware that going up there (either in the free lift reached via underground passage) or by the steps, you need to take account of the sun's position if you want to take photos. Afternoon, you are facing the sun if looking over Nice. Great views also over the port, old town and if feeling tired or can't make the walk, the 'petit train' will take you up there on your tour. There is also the cascade, the huge (aritificial) waterfall just under the summit - great on a hot day for cooling off in the spray. There are numerous access points from the old town side and the port in addition to the lift. Don't miss the 'Tour Bellanda', another viewing place about half way up.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"Le Chateau and Nice Castle Hill are the same thing. Just a head's up if it confused you. There is no castle, or it's hidden behind walls but it does have three key attractions: the tower, the waterfalls and the panoramic view. People also like Israelite cemetery You would have to climb a lot of stairs so be careful! There is an elevator available that will lead you up the tower, from there on, you can climb to other attractions using the slopes of the pathways. Water fall is beautiful and one can view all nice from top",Dec 2018
France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"We loved our visit to Castle Hill. Lots of people have pointed out the steep stairs but compared to other areas we have visited (like Rocamadour), stairs were not so bad if you are moderately fit.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,5.0,"Castle Hill is worth the effort for great vistas. Reward yourself with a coffee to go, from the cafe on top and walk over to one of several great vantage points..example, excellent lookout from above the waterfall over the Promenade des Anglais and the Old Town. Stop and enjoy the coffee and the view. Take some great photos. Only 370 steps or take the elevator (being repaired during my visit). Also, great view over the Port de Nice. Locate the Eglise Notre Dame Port church at the head of the marina....buses regularly leave from here to Menton via Monarco..great coastal views en route takes about 1.5hr for only E1.5 What a bargain!

France,Castle Hill of Nice,4.0,"Atop Castle Hill is the best vistas of Nice in the city. However, it is not easy to get to the top. Hiking, Uber, Cab and an elevator are the alternatives. Because my wife has mobility issues, and because the elevator was not working, we took Uber to the top. Unfortunately, Uber couldn't find us when we were ready to come back down. We had the owner of the snack shop at the top order us a cab and finally got back down. I later took the Le Petit Train de Nice which goes to the top of Castle Hill and stops for about a 15 minute stop.

I was able to take some great pictures of Nice from the south and the north sides of Castle Hill.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,zero magic - only massive and boring queues for a big amount of money spent - first time ever for us in Disney and we felt abused - wasting our time - should have gone to central Paris to visit and shop there - this was high robbery (2 attractions i.e. less than 5 minutes for 1 day of queueing!).

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"This is the second family visit I’ve made with a child under 10. We stayed at the Newport hotel on each occasion due to its proximity to the park.

We all had a great time despite the covid rules which meant you couldn’t really interact with the characters and the castle is still covered in scaffolding. You have to wear a mask outside and inside while in the park WH I although tedious is done for all the right reasons.

Most of the rides were working, though if your mask slips on a ride and it’s shown in one of their photos they super impose a mask on your face in the photo.

The food was excellent at all four themed restaurants we visited in the park as was the all you can eat breakfast at the Newport.

My only gripe, and I believe it a justified one is the lack of English being used. For example our 9-year old could watch Disney channel in the room in French, German or Spanish but only BBC news or a short educational cartoon on safety in the home which was on a loop in English. The 4D Star Wars ride with the accompanying short film was also only in French . This seemed to also bemuse the Germans and Dutch who we were sitting with. My wife’s been to the Tokyo Disney park and everything is in English not Japanese.

This kind of put a dampener on the trip, especially for our daughter who was very upset at seeing her favourite films being played in the room but not being able to understand the language. Will we go back? No. We’ll try Disney somewhere else.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Lovely place to go with the kids, or even as a group of adults. Be prepared for a very long walk to get into the park. Even though the car park wasn’t full, we found it extremely busy (i think it must be unbearable when it’s full!) and didn’t go on many rides because we would have had to wait for 45 to 120 minutes in a queue for a two-minute. We mostly stuck to the less popular activities (carousel, labyrinth, circus train) which was great for our 5 year old. Unfortunately, it rained heavily before the parade was due, so it was a very small parade. Still, we had a great time.
Everything is overpriced, be it food or gifts, but you know that before you go and everything is magical and special anyway, so as long as you’re prepared, it’s a nice treat.
We were a little disappointed that there was not much sign of Halloween when it was supposed to be Halloween-themed until 7 November and we were there on 1-2 November.

After many rearrangements we finally made it for October half term - even with covid you can still feel the magic & even I at 28 years old was like a child 😂 we had tickets included with our hotel stay. Getting into the park in the morning for early magic hours was a little chaotic. Getting through security and bag checks was quick it was the queue to get into the park that was large. We weren’t made aware that there was a separate entrance for hotel guests round the side that had a quicker moving queue til day 3. My daughters favourite ride was big thunder mountain and her favourite character meet was Jack Skellington, he was fantastic and engaging, he spoke to her for ages about her buzz light year costume. We were in the park all day from around 8.50 in the morning til 9 at night. We loved it so much we’re already looking at prices and dates to return. Such a magical 💫 place. The rides were well maintained. However we got on buzz light year ride at 9am and it broke down and we were stuck for about 10 mins 🙈 We had a green pass for my daughter and it was the saviour for our trip, the longest we waited in the disability queue was 35 minutes for RC racer in the studios park.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"I, my wife and the kids just loved this place.
Well, the kids in particular, we came here the first time and we enjoyed our day so the kids insisted for a second time, even overeacted about it a bit so we were forced to come over again. It holds a lot of love in our hearts, although the only issue is that on the second day when we went back it was crazy busy and that's one of the big issues people complain about, but otherwise it's very recommneded.

What you may also need to think about when going in is food and drinks which maybe expensive if you eat in Disney village, but i would recommend going to Planet Hollywood and Rainforest Cafe and sharing food because it is such big portions.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"After just having spent 3 days there, I can confirm that I will never come back in busy days!!!

The park is nice, ""magic"", for children, disney, etc...

But the business machine make it detestable.

After paying the travelling, hotel and the pass to the park, you are part of the crowd, that has to spend a lot of minutes (30-45-75) even hours!, for an ""attraction"" of a park.

No seats (just to seat), no free water (many/all fountains said that are ""non-operational"", nothing to buy just for basic eating (bread, ham, cheese, salad) apart from the expensive restaurants with limited places.

Many people do not wear properly their masks (included in the attractions where we are sited close) and there is nobody to dispute them. Even worse, there are many people smoking everywhere, and also people thinking that their ""vaporised"" stuff is allowed to be breathed and smoked by the ""others"".

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"After having an magical experience Halloween 2019 we decided to return this year to to return the spark to our lives that covid had extinguished but the spark never reignited.

Despite Disneyland citing covid as to why parades and firework shows were cancelled the park was busier than ever .

The parades that did go ahead were short and “ boring “ according to my 6yr old. They were 1-4 floats long with few performers compared to 2 years ago where they 10+ floats and 100+ performers.

The place completely lacked magic and excitement with the scaffold and boarding everywhere , long ride wait times and entertainment that would struggle to amuse a new born.

The rides are old and tired and really arnt worth the wait , the food is tasteless and overpriced, the staff are miserable and under trained .

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"I have been going to Disney land Paris evey five years since they opened in April 1992. I do not want to put a spoiler on this theme park as children love disney but the shame part is disney seem to have lost sight of what it is all about and how it was first started by Walt disney. Please do not get me wrong i am as big a child as the rest of you loving disney but Its all become a money spinning project and away from the magic that he intended. I have just come back from Disney Paris as it has not long re-opened since the covid 19 take over. Firstly the queues can be unbearable most rides did not open until 10.am. So that was disappointing. There is no fast track anymore and the staff do cram you in which we found in a lot of things at the park, the places they wanted to make money otherwise they used good old covid as the excuse. Mask wearing is for most people a done thing but we did see quite a lot of people wearing the masks under their nose or chin. That said there is hand sanitisers everywhere you go. Rides its the amount of time you have to queue and then the disappointment of the shortnest of the ride these seem to have shortened over the years and the most disappointing rides for me were the train ride around the film making part where you saw items from films how they made the films etc to be replaced by CARS my grandson found this boring. There is no longer the fun film set that you see how they make moving car chases etc. there is a lot of change and i can understand but its the magic that has disappeared. Food restaurants you need to book in advance otherwise you stand for up to an hour to be told sorry you should have booked. A simple sign at the venue in the queue would have helped, so many people were being turned away unaware of this new rule. The food areas where you could get food was so expensive and it was just burgers, chips etc fast food in other words. The main parade that was at 17.30 consisted of four floats and not the whole parade that used to be so long and wonderful. Their reasoning is they do not want crowds to be gathering.... sorry i could not see the reasoning behind this. You can be crammed into the haunted house, crammed in a long line of people where 1 meter apart was not adhered to or insisted by the work force. crammed into queues for food etc. so it made no sense. The merchandise is very expensive now and also they have made some shops into food places. Again its all about money and profit and making up for lost revenue lost and caused by covid. Its mainly the queues the huge amount of people the prices and change in rides that is the real kill joy. Children crying because shows were fully booked as soon as they opened or their legs hurt because of the long queues. Our grandson was so disappointed, we bought a three day ticket so we could sustain the activities into smaller portions but even then it never helped and we left the park early. The park was very clean this i noticed with no rubbish anywhere. Pirates of the carribbeen , haunted house rides like this are really good, Pinochio was very boring and not worth the queue. Enjoy your time there but we aware of queues, prices and book if you want a decent meal..

Disney is all about the magic....
it’s true the park is packed. There are queues for everything. BUT there has always been queues! The food is pretty rubbish - so take a packed lunch if you can. We went with a young family- all under 6. For us, there was no need to go on the “proper “rollercoasters. The atmosphere was amazing , we saw so many characters ( including Mickey) and went on 4/5 kids rides each day (we had a 3 day pass ). There were 3 parades (princess/dragon and Mickey parade) and everyone really enjoyed them. It wasn’t perfect, but we really enjoyed our Disney break and the kids will have great memories forever.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,So disappointed. Absolutely rammed with people. Poorly organised. Long queues everywhere... Big money grab from Disney. Disney Village is looking tatty. Very expensive and a very stressful experience. Will never return,Oct 2021
France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Having just returned from DLP for a 4 day trip I thought passing on a few observations, opinions etc might be worthwhile to some. So here goes. For the record, as a family with 2 kids, we had an awesome time, we managed to do everything we had planned and more, yes there are still lots of things not happening at the park due to “COVID” but still plenty to see and do and worth making the trip. Firstly, meals, MUST be pre booked if you want to eat in a restaurant, otherwise expect to wait in a queue for an eternity to be served crisps, there is zero urgency from kiosk/food outlet staff so make sure you book. We ate at the Agrabah and Billie Bobs restaurants, both of which were fantastic with huge range of foods. The App is worth downloading and using, the queue information is constantly updated and accurately reflects the queues making planning easier. Some rides, were ridiculously short for the horrendous queue times, the inside ones like Pinnichio, Snow White and Peter Pan are great but unless you are a super fan, they are not worth queuing over and hour for a 2 minute ride, just not worth it. Worse though are the outside rides like Flying Elephants, slinky dog, Aladdin carpet etc, queue times always over and hour for a ride that lasts less than 90 seconds. The magic hour for hotel guests, conscious the hotels were rammed due to HT, is pretty pointless unless you are literally first in the queue, they only open a few rides during that hour if you can even enter in time and they are already spilling out the entrance gates with maximum queue times already, we made a beeline for rides we needed to do in the magic hour only to find they didn’t open until 10am which was massively disappointing, by then the other rides queues were already horrendous. There were quite a lot of people not adhering to the smoking areas which I find annoying. Tidiness, both parks are cleanest theme parks I have ever visited, the staff are so quick to clean up rubbish and attentive to all aspects of the cleanliness of the park, really great to see. The hotel was basic but we didn't require anymore, it was clean and comfortable. Breakfast package is recommended, really convenient and you get away with taking some cake or fruit for the day. We didn't use the buses into the village at all, the walk really isn't far and quite pleasant and the buses are just something else to queue for. Sadly there were quite a few rides with technical issues that closed once you were in the queue, I know this cannot really be helped but it did make for quite a bit wasted time, unless you were in the station about to board then you are just herded out the nearest exit with no explanation as such, a bit annoying but cannot really be helped. There were lots of people that just dithered in the way, especially in the most busiest areas and choke points, it was extremely busy but people should still move to the side to look at a map or whatever but most just stop and stand right in the way oblivious to the carnage building up behind them, this happened lots! If you like a good cup of tea, take your own tea bags! Masks…..here we go. Masks are still mandatory and generally people do adhere to it. That said, as the park got more busy, the enforcement levels dropped off and more and more people began to remove them or just have them down under their chins. Sometimes in the shops and enclosed areas, you need to remove them briefly for some fresh air as the areas can become busy and hot. That leads me onto parades/fireworks etc, Disney will obviously tell you that they not on to reduce the mass build up of people in one area, that is complete rubbish. They are not on to save money, money they would have lost during the closures, which I get to some extent although the entry/hotel etc prices are not reduced etc so I felt it was a bit of a con really. They are happy to cram people into queues for rides, restaurants and shops etc but use the covid excuse for the other stuff. All of that said though, we did have a great time and all the chaos etc was worth it to see the kids faces although have no requirement to return for a long time now. To sum up our trip we both agreed it was “just on right side of unbearable”. The gross levels of consumerism and greed of Disney is there for all to see but overlooking that, the place and experience is magical even without the full package. If you are due to go soon, enjoy but go with caution, it’s absolutely mental, plan your day and expect queues....everywhere!

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Worst time ever. I've been a annual Disney pass holder since the late 1970's for the Orlando Florida Disney Parks.
Visiting Disneyland Paris over past two days has been horrible. Massive crowds with every ride from opening to closing having 45 minute to 70 minute wait times. Bathrooms were so crowded and fast pass price was outrageous.
Worst park was the extreme rudeness of far too many not only inside the Park but on the train as well.

We had grown men push and shove to get in front of me and my granddaughter to get on train first. I've never encountered so many rude people in my life.

In the several decades I have gone to Disney this Park in Paris was the worst. My five year old granddaughter never got to ride majority of rides on either day. We arrived at 9:30am and stayed until 8pm yet lines for majority of rides never shortened. Lines in restaurants were very long and again the worst part was the nasty rude people in the park and on the train. I was shoved, banged into etc yet not one person said 'sorry' for their pushing, shoving, cutting in line etc.

I also got the clear impression that far too many French do not like Americans as their rude behavior speaks volumes.
I will never return to Disneyland Paris.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Traveled as a family of 3 for 2 nights and 3 days during October half term. We had amazing time and we're so lucky with the weather, however there are a few oddities that I want to highlight to anyone who is planning a Disney Trip with a young family.

Firstly it appears Disney unlike other attractions has not reduced it's park capacity numbers (since covid). I checked during our stay and you could still book park tickets for the following day which felt ridiculous as the park was heaving already.

Queues on average were 60-120 mins long. With a young child these wait times are too long. The free fast past system was scrapped in July 21 so now you pay for a premier access pass at €14 per person!
You choose a time to return and then you can jump the queue. If you wanted to do all the attractions in one day this is really the only way to do it and some rides don't even have this option. Crush coaster is one of them which is always at around 80 mins plus wait.

In France currently it is obligatory to wear a face mask. Masks are enforced all around the park. Outdoors and in! The security are militant about this and I suspect this is partially due to the fact they can keep increasing park capacity. This could be a bit of a unwelcome shock to travellers from the UK who only are required to wear a mask in medical settings. On the shuttles and indoor queueing this is very uncomfortable especially when you are standing in long queues.

On to shuttles, do not leave it to the last minute to leave the park. It is like a stampede trying to board a bus back to your hotel and people behave in the most disgusting way - pushing and shoving children out of the way to get a space. It is very tempting to stay late but bear in mind if you have a pushchair or little ones this is most unpleasant after a long day and obviously dangerous.

Toilets are far and few throughout the park and you will have to queue for using the toilet. Again unfortunately with children who don't plan when they may need to go it's always too late and you will have delays getting in.

You will queue for everything. Food outlets, toilets, buses, park entry, rides, character meets, parades and snack shacks.
This is again tricky for little people considering it seems all you do is queue you won't get much done in a couple of days which is frustrating when you don't understand why you are waiting so long all the time . Personally next time I will
book 3+ days in the park to make sure we don't
miss out on things we wanted to do.

Overall it's a fantastic holiday and still magical in covid times but I would say the masses and crowds did spoil it a bit for us. It's hard to enjoy your stay when all you seem to do is queue and wait for anything.

Go out of term time if you can, otherwise try may half term as the french children do not share this half term with the UK so it should be quieter!!

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"What more can you can vs what others haven't! You could look and pick faults; rides not all working, no fireworks or parades due to Covid in 2021 (and long queues fir things like covid pass), pretty expensive - both getting in and things inside; shops food, etc.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"We bought tickets online, we made the reservation as requested, we arrived at the park and they informed us the tickets were canceled, nevertheless the money was never returned. Worst part is, they obliged us to buy new ones on site and to complain with the website in order to received back the money we have spent in the first place.
Besides, if you come here, expect to wait hours and hours to do the attractions! The duration of most of them is indicated from 3 to 5 minutes, and they last 1 min!!! Try to explain to your child why we waited for 45 min for something that lasted 1 min!!!!
The app is terrible also, pointless. Can't schedule a show, can't make a restaurant reservation..

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Such a disappointment; we were looking forward to this so much. An hour queuing before we even got in the door (with our tickets booked weeks ago). No characters walking around or any parades; one or two photos opps for which you had to - of course - queue. Not a single encounter of any kind with Frozen theme or characters, which left a four year old fan heartbroken. It's half term so sure, lots of people. But how can Disney pack the place out so we're crammed in queues for 60+ mins at a time, and then cry ""bUt CoViD""?! It's a crappy excuse for many rides being broken, almost all staff rude or surly, everything so grossly overpriced. 3 rides totaling maybe 10 mins, 6+ hours of queuing. Miserable day. So sad for my kids.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I hope that in writing this review I might save another family both emotional disappointment and a lot of money by choosing to go somewhere else.

My expertise is psychology and I work with teams in the worlds largest companies to lead innovation. The reason I highlight this is because I intend to bring teams to Disneyland to demonstrate how NOT to do things. Nearly every element needs radical innovation because eventually customers will stop coming.

My wife and I worked hard to make it a ‘positive’ experience but it was hard work - often made harder by Disney staff and poor reliability of rides.

There is plenty to illustrate but frankly I would just not bother. I have read their replies to other poor reviews and the responses are as you would expect from a team that aren’t committed to producing the best experience possible.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Staff very untrained as they coming back from Covid shut down is understandable, but the vibe here by staff is not at “Disney” standard. Rude staff, incompetent, unable to think how to make guests feel welcome.

The app for Disney Paris is terrible. It’s hard to navigate the site. We stayed at New York Marvel- sinks won’t drain, outlets don’t work in bathroom, wall paper peeling off in the hallways.

The food options are decent and they do ok serving thousands every day in the hotel - food is “average”- but kids like it

The park has many rides out of service and many breakdowns during the day. Some staff know how to manage- others don’t.

Parades every day at 5:05 are great! Kids loved it!

In the end- most decent rides you will wait in line for 45m each, I saw some wait for 70min! If you choose “fast pass” (premier access) it will cost you 14€ pp. rich kids ride, poor kids wait!

With these waiting times, you won’t ride much during the day- so the other activity is to go shopping- and they give you 1000’s of options to overspend on their merchandise and food.

They have 0 insentive to make ride queues shorter with more rides because this would not bring them as much cash.

It’s all about the money for Disney here. Cutting corners and not worth the value. If you have other considerations- I’d recommend going elsewhere right now. They are way off their beat right now here.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"It is difficult to enjoy the park given the number of visitors at any moment. The atmosphere is crowded out. This then knocks on to the length of waits for everything from the rides to getting a drink. You definitely need to book a restaurant table well in advance. It is all a 'well oiled' machine, but that hardly makes the experience magic. A number of rides seemed to keep breaking down through the day, only resulting in longer waits on other rides. Just the wait to go on Dumbo was over 30 minutes, and the bigger rides were looking at waits of 1 hour or more. Photo opportunities with the Disney characters was also very limited for those with children.
Average at best, but if you are very (very!) keen Disney fan then possibly the crowded and hectic nature of the experience will not be a put off.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"My wife was very keen to come while the children were young so they experienced the magic of Disneyland. Even on a Tuesday out of season we queued for 30min in the car before we could get into the car park. Then we had to pay €30 just for parking. Another 15min queue to check our covid pass. Another 15min queue to enter the park itself. Once inside, we see the Castle mostly wrapped up for renovation. Similar inside. Now, how do we find our way around? No maps. Occasional information signs with maps. We were advised to download the app. We did (don’t waste time trying to get a mobile phone connection - use the free wifi (and you can skip entering all the personal details)). Look on the app for “attractions”. You have a choice of list or map. Use the list and you have no idea where anything is. Use the map and it doesn’t tell you what anything is - just wait times. The wait times are wrong. Add 15mins+ to anything you see. Quite a few rides are currently closed. It is now midday and we have done no rides yet. We planned to arrive at 09:30 when the park opened. With children this inevitably became 10:00. By the time we’d arrived inside the park it was 11:15 and at 12:00 we’re queueing for our first ride. The children, with their understandable lack of patience, are not finding this magical. Almost any way I could spend £500 (tickets for 2 days) + £200 (hotels) + £50 (2 days parking) + £200+ (meals) = basically £1000 for 2 days for the children’s benefit would be better than this. If there was any magic about this I might reconsider but so far, no magic 😬

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"There are some very good elements to the park - the usual standard of rides and crowds are good regardless of COVID-19 and they are making a good effort to maintain the quality of the service, whilst keeping good measures in place.

This included using social distancing, enforcing the wearing of a face covering everywhere in the parks, and the use of perspex screens everywhere separating households when queueing. Unfortunately, a lot of people were not distancing or washing hands enough, but I can't blame the parks for this as it is hard to enforce this when people constantly ignore them.

Queues for the rides were generally good throughout our stay - unfortunately the EMH were a little pointless because such a high volume of people were staying at the parks, but this didn't matter because throughout the day, it was possible to only wait 30 minutes for larger rides such as Big Thunder Mountain.

Now there are quite a few drawbacks to the Paris park, including that the food is not great, the parades / fireworks currently aren't running (but scheduled to return, and also replaced by some small unscheduled cavalcades), and also the annoyance of the expensive Disney Premier access system (acting as the new Fasptass), but I strongly believe that the magical quality and level of enjoyment the park has to offer remains despite the virus, so I don't feel it is necessary to slate Disney for some drawbacks, especially considering the difficult financial period for large companies - it just means I wouldn't say it's value for money. But you can still have an excellent experience at the park!

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Just really poor !
Park’s absolutely packed and the longest cues.
Had early hour with staying at The Newport but not many rides open. Frontier land was shut and so many rides and attractions. This pushed people together.
I expected covid rules would apply but no one cared. Masks off and standing close together was stupid.

On big rides thunder mountain or pirates everyone is rammed in together like a cattle market.

We have tickets for tomorrow also but not going. It’s too risky!

No rides were cleaned after use, hand gels everywhere but hardly anyone using them.

No park maps and no assistance around and an obvious lack of staff in the park.

Parks close early like 6 and 7.
Totally pointless.

I’m a big Disney fan but this has totally ruined it.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"We’ve just spent a few days in disney and it was all just a bit meh. Without the characters and the parades, there isn’t much left to differentiate the experience from a UK park like alton towers, just a bunch of rides, shops and crap food. My kids are young (4 and 5) so the characters and shows are the reason we came, they aren’t really old enough for rides, and certainly not for hour plus queues, so were pretty bored.

We still had a nice time but i am sympathetic that for other families in the same situation probably would have found the experience pretty ruined. The website and app seem to be deliberately unclear - the app lists a lot of meet and greets with characters which were clearly never going ahead. If you look on the website for parade times it links to various dead-end pages rather than just state the parades are cancelled. We had to be in the park and ask an attendant to find this out, people should have this information to make an informed choice when booking. I regret not checking tripadvisor before booking, i have been to disney paris before and it was fun, but it honestly hadn’t occurred to me such core elements of the park would be cancelled without it being clear to visitors or discounts offered.

For travellers from the UK, bear in mind mask wearing is absolutely mandatory, including outside, with no exemptions like in the UK. If you are exempt in the UK, perhaps get a visor or something because you won’t be allowed into the park, on rides or served in a restaurant without one on. This was fine for us as we understand these are the rules in France but travellers with some conditions which lead to exemptions in the UK may wish to be aware before travelling.
I see on here a lot of comments about food. It is definitely Icelands quality at Michelin starred prices! That said if you are aware, you can bring a packed lunch. Food at every other theme park i’ve ever been to is naff too, so not a reason not to go.
I would agree with some of the other comments on here about Disney losing its way a bit. There are rides themed on Pinnochio, Snow White and even the generally maligned Dumbo but no sign of any of the last 30 years of Disney animation. What about Beauty and the Beast? Moana? Frozen??? What about Marvel? The park management need to invest a bit in keeping up to date. Currently we have a generation of parents like me who are nostalgic about the golden age of disney, so take our kids as a treat. But this won’t last much longer, and the park won’t last another 15 years as the next generation grow up and don’t know what Snow White or Dumbo are and want a park where they can have an experience which aligns with their own Disney memories, not just films which were released before their parents were born.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,I am 6ft and a UK size 24 I got on all rides with no problem. I thought it would be worth writing this for other plus size women who may be nervous about fitting on rides like I was. Obviously every size is different but worth coming. As for the park itself there is scaffold on the castle but if you have been before isn’t very disappointing as there is so much to do.,Oct 2021
France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"All I can say about Disneyland Paris is what a shame. It has well and truly lost its magic. It’s a shambles from start to finish whilst costing you an absolute fortune to be there.

We had three nights in an Empire club room at the new Marvel Hotel. It cost over £2500 for the three nights and it was not worth the money. The service is poor, the staff are grumpy and rude, there is no where to eat lunch in the hotel (I was rudely told to go to Disney village). We were constantly harassed to show our vaccine certificate pass just going from one room in the hotel to another, or scanning the anti covid app. We had to wear wrist bands as well and masks at all times apart from eating or drinking. It was exhausting just for the crazy covid rules, that made no sense whatsoever.

What Disney fail to tell you when you book and pay for an extortionately priced holiday with them is that a lot of things are closed. So the Castle is closed and covered in scaffolding, over half the restaurants are closed, there are no meet and greets just the ridiculous selfie spots, no character dining, Auberge de Criilion is closed, Orbitron is covered in scaffolding, the Railroad train only goes from the main entrance. There are no parades, no fireworks, no princesses, basically No Magic At All. It’s incredibly depressing to be there and I felt completely ripped off.

What’s nuts as well is that they blame everything on covid, it’s all covid a fault, yet they are happy to pack you in to long hour long lines to access a ride. But it’s ok, wearing face masks all the time will make it ok! The are queues for everything because so much isn’t open. Just to get a drink could take 15 minutes minimum.

Then there is the fast pass replacement, which is just another money grabbing scheme from Disney for tired and emotional parents dealing with unhappy kids who can’t get on any rides. €14 per person to access Buzz Lightyear! €14 per person to access the runaway mine train!!! It’s unbelievable that Disney think this is acceptable.

Then there is the supposed extra Magic time for people paying a stupid amount of money to stay in a Disney hotel. What they don’t tell you is although you can access the park at 8.30am only two rides in each area are open! The rest don’t open till 10am! What is the point of that! There is no extra magic hours in Hollywood studios so the queue for Crush’s Cost never went below 1.5hrs.

I feel so let down by Disneyland Paris. They are not a patch on Florida. The staff are the rudest I have every come across. I speak enough French to get by and I had a least 4 occasions where people I was interacting with pretended to not understand me.

I’m sure a Disney representative will respond with some generic ‘we take everything you say on board’ but I would say, save your money and don’t bother

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Message to Disneyland Management:First of all: a lot of these Photos are not nice, because: the quality, the light and the position is not the summary of a professional photograph. for instance: The picture with the HEARTQUEEN of Alice in Wonderland: The photograph told us to pose like we have a cup in our hand, because there will be later a cup on the photo. On some photos the eyes are closed! impossible! (Stitch). The photos with Dschafar are horrible. In my opinion, it has to be possible, to create a photobook on your photopass website with the possibility, to add some stickers from Disney, edit the photos by Size, cut and color. the onliest thing we get here for our money (75€) are some photos with bad quality, whitch you can zoom.

I think that what it does have is good, but it just needs a bit of an update, as the last new attraction (not a reskin/retheme) was opened in the late 90's I believe.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Where should I start? We came for the birthday of my son. It's been a long since I don't come to Disneyland Paris, it was called Eurodisney back in the time. I had big expectations as I remember it with a lot of magic. Well.... no magic, no enjoyment, and no Disney. It seems the years have transformed my childhood into a mirage of lies.
Let's kick-off, shall we? The management doesn't care about covid when it comes to bringing people, they do care about bringing money. However, when it comes to the Disney characters or things like that, hey, they claim that ""we are in covid times we cannot do it"". However, the shops open full time and forget about social distancing.
Prices? horrendous and crazy expensive! I remember the clothes to be good quality and unique, this doesn't happen anymore. It's all something you can find in Aliexpress for 1/10 of the price. They are made in china (as seen on the tags). Apart from cheap quality t-shirts at 25 and 30 euros, hoodies at 50 and 60, and so on, I've got more to comment on as this is not all. The food prices are as well, non-sense and my wife and myself were looking at each other as ""is this a joke?"". If the quality of what you buy is worth.....you can say, ok but this???? frozen food put in the microwave and things like that and overpriced? cmon now, please, Disney Paris management, do you think that I'm stupid as a customer? yes you do. Seeing the comments here I think they have even been polite. But the last point I'm saving is the one that has blown my mind and it's 2. My wife was cold and it was chilly outside, so she wanted us to go to a restaurant: all closed. However, we found one close to the main street and the castle for 36 euros menu..... so I wanted to take my son to the toilet and change him whilst my wife was asking to get there. What has happened today Disney ladies and gentlemen, I let it go in the park today, I won't let it go here and everyone should know: they treated her like nothing literally. Why? because she is black? we are a mixed couple (I'm white) and she is black and? they replied to her: only for reservations and she asked ok, can we? waiters inside looking at her bad and they said to her no reservations. She came to me almost crying. Let me tell you something, maybe I earn more, no need to be cocky or stupid here, however, politeness and customer service are all I'm expecting of a brand like Disney. Your staff has been rude here in this place with my wife and I won't tolerate it, not from you, from anyone. This happened here and unfortunately, I just made a raincheck and calmed myself, it was the birthday of my son. The last point from the 2 is the politeness of the people: everyone, absolutely everyone was talking to you as if you owe them something. Is it a French thing to be this cocky? every single place we have been in the park, even paying for the nonsense you sell, was acting rude. This is outrageous and for me that I had you on high standards, your customer service is 0. Apart from all of this, nonsense everywhere, no Disney characters, no restaurants, rudeness in your employees, cheap quality things, and so on. Please, review the manners of your employees, being humble for me is a must, review how you treat people, your quality in food and services, the quality of goods you sell. We won't come back for sure, you ruined my day, the birthday of my son, and get me quite sad about the racism too. I'm sorry but I can't say just 1 thing that was good and I was so looking forward to it.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I thought maybe some of the other bad reviews were left by emotional parents who were unnecessarily disappointed that their kids did not melt down in a puddle of Disney Magic. However, having visited, I can honestly say myself that Disneyland Paris is rubbish.

The iconic castle is covered in scaffolding so cannot be seen. So there is no wow moment when you walk into to Disneyland.

There are no Princesses at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

There are no Parades at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

There are no Fireworks at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

Only about 25% of food vans and restaurants are open so there are huge queues for the simplest of things. It honestly takes upwards of 30 minutes to get a little snack from a van.

Now, to put it into perspective, I will end with the all important cost. Disneyland costs a lot of money so you expect them to at least make it clear on their website that the experience will be limited due to Covid. They are charging full price for a minimal service and this is simply unfair. I would say it is worth a visit if you live an hour away and have an annual pass. However, if you have to travel from another city or even another country, I would not recommend it. My daughters both enjoyed themselves but only as much as they enjoy our local attractions at home which cost less than £50 for a family of 4.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I've been to every single Disneyland now, and Paris is a skid mark on the entire franchise.

Where to even start? The castle is currently entirely boarded up. And by boarded up, I mean - a couple of metres of spire are visible at the top. The rest was either scaffolded or covered in plywood with a painting of a castle on it. We had a five year old with us (on her fifth birthday), and she innocently asked where 'the real' castle was. Sorry, sweetheart - there's a very large and crap painting of one, enjoy.

Next: no princesses. Not a single one. When we asked why, we were told 'covid'. Yup: Disney staff were everywhere, wearing face masks, but princesses apparently cannot get their asses out of bed and do the same thing. Nobody's going to mind a glittery face mask on Elsa, but no princesses at all? So we had to explain to a devastated five year old in her best princess dress that sorry, we'd be seeing no princesses. We told her they were all on holiday, when actually they were on furlough.

Obviously, because logic in Disney is dead, Maleficent was still wandering about without a mask on: maybe her evil renders her Covid resistant? Or is it just princesses that are too fragile to wear masks like everybody else? Either close the park because masks don't work, or make the princesses do it too.

Restaurants: majority closed. The ones that were open were dirty, shabby and some of the worst food we've ever eaten. Stale chips, congealed cheese, absolutely no catering for anyone with a food allergy. Oh, and charged at 400% of normal. We were charged £40 for three cokes and two small bowls of cold chips.

Staff were the rudest we'd ever come across - screaming at us for removing a face mask for thirty seconds, outside, away from people, after eight solid hours of standing in rainy queues. If the situation is that tenuous, maybe don't open the park to thousands of people?

Ahhh - but you know where the rules all went out the window? SHOPS. Yup, no princesses (because Covid) and no restaurants (covid) and no castle (covid) and no keeping things clean and modern (covid) but every single shop was open, fully staffed and packed. So apparently 'covid' is only an issue when it costs money, but not when it makes them some.

And for all of this, the tickets were full price. There's no mention on the website that you're not getting even a third of 'the Disney experience' - and it should be in HUGE LETTERS. Nope: you pay full whack, then get a half-shut park with randomly allocated closures with zero logic.

Thanks very much for the most expensive holiday we've ever taken, that ended up with a tear-stained five year old in her best dress, standing outside a shop window with a mannequin of a princess in it and bravely declaring that 'she hopes Elsa has a nice holiday'.

Screw you all for making a little girl cry on her fifth birthday.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"We visited Disneyland Paris from the UK in Sep 2021. This was our first visit having always previously visited Disney-world Orlando.

We knew it was smaller but expectations were high with the hope of some Disney Magic to fill the gap while Orlando was off the menu.

I can only liken it to something that was created in the 1950’s and it has never changed. It was simply boring, more than 50% of rides not operating and about 75% of eating places closed. Merchandise is identical in every shop and very little choice for adults. Our very first ride was Big Thunder Mountain at 7:30 pm on 27rh Sep, it failed midway and we had to climb out and be escorted back. Magic lost and we naturally assumed being Disney we would get a free pass to return and miss the queue….. NO, just a goodnight from our escort at the gate. I have never seen that in Orlando and felt this left a bad impression.

In Orlando the cast members are always ‘ON’ in happy mode and attentive to the guests. Here they looked miserable, were constantly chatting to each other and not really offering any glimmer of the magic. It just fell woefully short of what we thought it would be.

Unless there was major investment and enough to fulfil a few days break then we wouldn’t go back, would rather spend the money where the magic really does happen.

Disneyland Paris should be avoided, overpriced for the actual entertainment available.

As an added note we thought we could at least wander in the Disney village but 90% of the is closed throughout the day.

Very disappointed.

Firstly have the attractions in the park are closed and they don’t tell you when you book. None of the characters are available to take photos like before and no characters join for breakfast/lunch/dinner in any of the restaurants. To enjoy any of the restaurants you have to book 2 months in advance. It’s crazy. We were unable to book any restaurants even thought we had a full meal plan plus. It was hot dogs and burgers only. Today it was raining and they made the little kids wait in the rain when they could easily open up the queue to be undercover. When I asked them to the said due to COVID and can’t open it in a very rude way. The other rides have no social distancing in their lines and there it’s fine but here where u had little kids they made them wait in the rain. What an embarrassment to the Disney brand to do that to little kids. At the hotels it was also impossible to get a table for dinner. We managed to find a seat only at 10:30pm with a 4yr old. Overall the experience has been terrible and we will not return to Disneyland Paris. Don’t waste your time and money coming here. So many of the staff have been so rude during our stay. Maybe stick to the US park instead of coming here.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We had a great time at Disneyland Paris this Summer. I came in 2015 and I think it has improved a lot since then. Last time it felt like the magic wasn't really there as the staff members weren't enthusiastic. This has improved a lot this time. There was no castle but this wasn't a problem and I think the scaffolding they have put over it is really good. We had good weather which was nice, not sure how well it would have faired in the rain as limited indoors places due to covid. The covid restrictions were really good and they were asking people to put masks over their noses which was good. Shame there were no fireworks though.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Let's face it! Disney is expensive. It is a very popular IP and holds dear memories close to most of our hearts. But I question if it is starting to lose it's way?

I travelled with my six year old, three year old and my wife. This was done fairly last minute due to us having to cancel the USA version due to COVID. I now am considering not bothering with WDW Florida and staying at Universal instead when borders re-open. They have got rid of the free Fast pass and replaced with the Genie app that allows you to pay around £15 per person per ride (depending on the ride) on top of what is nearly £300 worth of tickets for a family of four for the day. On top of this four cheese toasties came in at around £40. This is a lot of money!

I am ok with Disney being expensive when it is a company doing everything they can to give you the best most premium experience and escapism they can. The company that builds mountains for a rollercoaster or the world leader in animatronics in it's seeking to entertain. But everything new is just cheap, local theme park quality! Everything seems to be sold on the intellectual property rather than the experience. Take the pirate themed area. Big waterfalls, ships and rides that are world immersive. Compared to a few fibre glass statues and cheap MDF theming for the newer Toy Story area.

The Fast Pass is nothing more than another money grab! The park did not have too many people but the normal queues were massive. I question the conflict of interest brought up by the new Genie Fast Pass when it means it is in the interest of Disney to not have the normal lines move quickly as they make an uplift by charging people to skip the lines. On Thunder Mountain we were near the Fast Pass entry (whilst in the normal queue) and we were held up 20 minutes as they let continual streams of people who had paid extra onto the ride. Stuck in a queue with plastic walls on either side, merely inches wider than your shoulders! Trapped in a hot, sweaty claustrophobic hell hole is now the Disney experience set at the £300 entry point. Why solve the queue issue when you can rip more money out of your guests pocket? They may argue other parks do this but, other parks are not built on the reputation of Disney memory making magic that is severely dirtied by this nor do they charge such premium charges for their experiences. The Ratatouille ride is an OK ride that puts you in front of a few different cinema screens and acts like a simulator. It is ok but it is no Disney! It is not pushing to immerse you or do something new. These systems can be found at other much cheaper parks such as Terra Mitica in Spain.

The cost of food for the quality is now a joke that you hear guests opening mocking in the lines.

Simply, Disney as a theme park experience is turning into an over priced proposition that is relaying on past reputations to get the guest. Seems to be far more about the merchandise and up charges than transporting you to another world. Where has the old Disney Imagineering gone? I miss it and willing to pay a premium price for it! For what you get now? Save your money and go to Europa Park in Germany!

It would be completely unbearable at anything greater than 50% capacity.if you enjoy long queues aching feet expensive food then disneyland paris is the place for you. Luckily I only paid for 2 parks over 1 day. The 2nd park is small and could be easily contained in the main park. It's just a cynical way of disney to rip you off. As is typical with a lot of theme parks you pay a lot of money to enter. However to ensure you enjoy your day. You need to buy another ticket at a similar price so you can queue jump. Will not be going again. Would recommend that you attend asterix park about 30k away. Worst day of my holiday.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"After having 2 WDW trips cancelled, my husband and I thought we’d try here to get our Disney fix.

We spent 3 nights/4 days here and stayed in Newport Bay Club which gave us EMH (well worth having). Overall, we had a great break and really enjoyed ourselves. There are a couple of rides at DLP that we actually enjoyed more than Orlando, but on the whole it missed the magic for us. I’m not sure if that’s because we’ve been lucky enough to go to Orlando 4 times over the last 8 years, or if it’s because of COVID, but we won’t be in a hurry to go back (although the expansion plans look cool so never say never!)

The cast members were definitely lacking though and the lack of places open for something to eat or drink just made the days harder work than they needed to be - I understand why so many people take picnics in now. We had 5 burgers in few days we were there - I never have burgers! There was literally sod all else to eat though.

Another issue was the other guests. No one abided by the social distancing markers, people were wearing their masks incorrectly all over, and staff seemed fed up with having to keep reminding people to wear them properly (understandable when they’re being so blatantly ignore).

I didn’t really like that there were plenty of characters viewing opportunities. It felt like if you wanted to see characters then that would be easy enough to do (from a distance). Queues for rides were longer than I normally enjoy though with the lack of fast pass (big tickets were usually around 45-60 mins long) but I can imagine not having to worry about FP is a draw to some families.

So yeah. We had a great time but I would really think about what you want from your break and what you can compromise on before booking as it’s not a cheap trip and it didn’t hit the mark for us.

We stayed in a Disney hotel, so we had extra magic hours in the morning. Very much needed during busy times. A few rides (Peter Pan, Snow White, Pinocchio) were very bumpy and fast, we remembered it was smoother and slower before. Other rides were nice and our favorite character was definitely Jack Skellington this time! Unfortunately we had to leave the queue of Frozen, even though we were at Kristoff and very close to Anna & Elsa. Staff didn't even let us take a look at them. We had to leave because of our appointment for a covid test in Disney Village. Makes it hard to wait in a queue and make a reservation at a restaurant too.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Disneyland Paris

The worst Disney experience of our life.

We are disney junkies and we are lucky enough to have visited all the parks in the world with the exception of Shanghai.

I'm not going to start comparing park to park because they are really different from Anaheim to Florida, Tokyo, etc.

But what stands out at any Disney location (hotels, parks, waterparks, etc) is the service. We always get great service, people smile and treat you nicely and most of all they try to work with you if you have any problems to help you out.

This is not the case in Disneyland Paris. The people here treat you really badly.

First I made a reservation in June to pay 1050 euros for a cabin and park access. 7 days before our arrival they canceled my reservation. They told us to communicate with their phone line, after 7 tries with 50 minutes wait each time we give up. So we had to get a new reservation now costin 1390 euros. 255 euros extra for the same package we booked months before.

Contacting the disney france team on social media they told me to try at the hotel reception

After arriving at the hotel they told me they can't do anything because it is not their problem.... They gave us the cabin but told us we could get there 1 hour earlier (even though the cabin was free) , gave us the park tickets and we were on our way... we thought that was it but noooo.

Arriving at the park we got to the ticket entrance and of course the tickets didn't work. We had to go to customer service another hour until they realized they gave us the tickets from the cancel reservation instead of the new one.

Now it's 1 pm and we are finally into the park.

We arrived at the food center at Walt Disney Studios Park and we were happy to read in a sign ""food allergies ask for the special menu"" my sister is gluten intolerant.

We got to the order booth and they said...oh no no we only have salads and a dessert not hot food gluten free... nice job Disney....

As the day goes by we got back to the hotel happy to go to the pool, we got to the front desk to mention the issue we had with the new tickets and this was the conversation:

Me: Hi I wanted to change my tickets as they appear not to work
Disney Agent: Did you get to the park?
Me: Yes, but we have to wait 30 minutes for customer service to recognize the error and let us in.
Disney Agent: Then you got in so don't complain.....

And that was it.. no sorry for the trouble, it was a small error, nothing.

The next few days we just realized that the experience in Disney Paris is as different as it can be from the Disney in Florida or Anaheim so we try to enjoy as much as possible.

My takeaway is that we can mark down that we visited but we will never ever go back.

I'm a Disney lover and even though we lived abroad for most of the time we went to DisneyWorld more than 20 times in the last 10 years and we will continue to go but never again to Disney Paris.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"3 years ago I wrote a very negative review particularly due to difficult online booking system. 3 years later during post Covid environment online booking became even more difficult. Not only you book and pay your tickets but also you need to confirm the day you are visiting with a separate process. Otherwise, you face great difficulty at the gates because they do not only check the QR codes but also they check the registration QR code.

Studios were particularly very congested since significant part of the Studios and activities were
closed. They claim that they are closed as part of Covid related measures but they even created further congestion since people are given no choice but to queue up with the remaining very limited activities which are open. The queue at the toilets of Studio 1 was unacceptable since nearby facilities were closed. There were more activities open at Magic Kingdom Park, therefore, it was relatively less congested.

Given the current circumstances I do not recommend to visit Studios. I am surprised that they can still charge the full price.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"A very disappointing and frustrating stay for the children. So many services have been suspended surrounding contradictory COVID regulations:

- There are no fireworks
- Parades have been suspended
- Photos with Disney characters have to be taken at a distance, complete with masks.
- Any child over the age of 6 have to wear masks at all times around the park.
- The Disney castle is under scaffolding.
- Many of the restaurants and rides are closed, making it near impossible to get a restaurant reservation, despite having purchased a meal plan.
- Too many rides got closed on the days we visited due to technical difficulties : RC Racer, Peter Pan, Hyper Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain. Deeply upsetting for children when you have waited in the queue for over an hour only to be told to come back later. Thats if they bother to tell you at all!
- Impossible to get standby passes - do they actually exist?
- Despite all of the wonderful things such as parades and fireworks being cancelled due to COVID, you are still sardined next to hundreds of people in queues for hours on end and prices remain sky high.

The whole experience left me and my children very sad and disappointed with a bad taste in my mouth. It was nothing like what we had experienced in Disney USA. My advice would be to save your hard earned money and either wait until normal services resume or save save save for Disneyland Florida, Disneyland Paris is currently all out of magic.

Yes, the park is smaller and not as 'magical' especially during Covid times, we found it to be pleasantly delightful.

Even the castle is not visible, it is masked up with temporary coverings. Which really effects the feel and excitement for the grandchildren.

Appreciate we are still in the midst of COVID, but still, people want the best experience, and I’m afraid to say that this was absent in both parks.

This is our 5th visit in 5 Years, we won’t return now for a number of Years. When you consider the cost of tickets and food for a family for 2 days entry to the parks and a hotel etc etc, it’s a very expensive holiday

With Sars-NCOV-19 they closed all fountains in the park. Also, the bathroom water is at 35 degrees so you can only wash your hands... They want you to buy water bottles at a price of 3'30€ the 500ml ones.

This is a bit degrading to people. They could already give a couple of bottles at the entrance, because the tickets are so expensive, or indicate it explicitly before entering the parks so that people are aware of the problem that exists with water.

Also, there isn't any shadow place. People was searching it like ants under a magnifying glass... They were invading gardens and places that are supposed to not be used.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Our experience of Disneyland Paris in August 2021 was really disappointing for our family for the following reasons:

1. Many of the rides and parades were closed, without notice on the website when booking our tickets, apparently due to COVID. Even the famous castle is shrouded in scaffolding and cladding. If we had known in advance, we would not have paid 360 euros for a family of 5 including 2 children who just turned 12 and are now counted as adults. This is strange when the accepted definition of most adults is either aged 16 or 18.

2. One of the adults was a disabled senior but she still had to pay the full adult tariff even though she could only access ONE ride the entire day - the river boat. In fact she was charged 225 euros to rent a wheelchair for the day - no other venues we visited in Paris this week charged a fee and deposit in this way for disabled travelers. This on top of a 30 euro parking fee!

3. There were too few benches to sit and relax in between the 45 minute wait times for rides.

4. The restaurants and shops are all vastly over-priced but this is to be expected.

Overall I would not recommend the park for anyone other than with children between the ages of 5-9. Certainly not for seniors, people with disabilities and older children.

Lastly Disney should be transparent about their pricing in relation to the current restrictions so that consumers can make an informed decision and not end up disappointed as we are.

Planet Hollywood has happy hour between 5-7 i believe and if you have one drink there you get a free portion of large nachos - enough for a family of 4!! Take your own water bottles in and fill up in the park as the drinks are expensive, but if you do this, you'll enjoy your day so much more!

We last went in July 2020. We, like many, had been on lockdown for months, so it was a welcome break away.

Such a better time we had than when my daughter went with her French exchange family some months before ( just before covid) and spent a fortune for the day ( family live in Lille) to only go on two rides !! we were not best pleased..too many people allowed in, during normal circumstances..so make the most of the time that Disney limit the amount of people going in..how ever long that will last..have fun :)

There are a lot great attractions for all the ages, nice live concerts, beloved heroes, lot of shops and cafes. Love everything except the queues: everywhere, during all the day. What I recommend you how to use your time. There are the fast tracks nearby all the attractions. There you can take your free ticket without any queue. This fast track ticket gives you your turn after about 1-2 hours and on the defined period of time. It is very easy and comfortable to plan your time in the Disneyland. And the main idea - no queues. Unfortunately we understood the system about queues too late and use just 2 fast tracks such way. So sometime we stayed about 1 hour in the queue! Can you imagine?:) Also I would advise you to start the visit early in the morning, at the opening hours, about 11 I think. Also the bonus for the people who stayed at the Disneyland hotel is to begin the attractions a few hours before the official opening.

We were there till the end, till 23 pm. At the final of the day there was absolutely fantastic salute! Also, fewer people were starting from 6-7 pm. So take my advices and use your time effectively!

I meen, not even one of the cafees or diners we've been to offers a measly vegetable based milk option, let alone food other than popcorn that a vegan could eat. That is not acceptable.

We were there during Pride month, the whole park had rainbow themes, yet all this inclusivity does not seem to include the rough average 6% of visitors, who do not want animals on their plates. And I have not even started on the sheer number of people who are simply lactose intolerant without being vegan. Say, about 85% of people of African descent e.g.

Thanks Disney. I feel cheeted and disappointed. The rides and settings are fun, but I am really sad that for a vegan the best meal around is a plate of oily fries and perhaps a tasteless salad, if you are lucky enough to find a restaurant that has them. Don't even think of getting a proper cappuccino either.

It’s not just about the shows or rides, it’s also impossible to not notice how pretty the castle is. It’s perhaps the most beautiful of the Disney parks. The Park is fantastic for young kids and the Studio's for older kids. It’s just that wherever you go, there’s a long-ass line, which consumes a lot of time. Well, the good thing is that there are FASTPASS tickets which I used repeatedly for the Space Mountain Rollercoaster.

As for the entertainers, I have nothing but praise for them for filling the place with magic. I loved seeing every bit of their performances.

Everything is pretty expensive though – from the tickets, food, and merchandise. Still, I will come back once the pandemic is over!

It was my wife's 60th birthday on New Year's Eve 2019. Having been to Disneyworld Florida a few years ago, she wanted to go to Disneyland Paris for her birthday, so I booked a visit for us and our two teenage sons. When booking I included a ticket for Disney's New Year's Eve party so that we could be in the park that evening and watch the fireworks display to see in the New Year.

The parks, of course, were great. Disney is very good at theme parks. Good rides and generally well organised. That part we really enjoyed. The weather wasn't as good as Florida but I can't blame Disney for that!

The accommodation (Sequoia Lodge) was ok. The reception and dining areas were great and breakfast was good. The accommodation blocks were comfortable enough, but the decor was looking a bit tired.

The New Year's Eve party was a huge disappointment. We had assumed, from the way these tickets were sold, that the park would close and be cleared before re-opening for the evening. Unless they did that in the 45 minutes we stepped outside to get some food, that didn't happen. When we re-entered the park, there was a checkpoint set up on one of the routes in to ensure that people were wearing the wristband showing they had purchased New Year's Eve tickets, but it was easy to avoid this by using one of the other routes into the park. As we wandered around the park that evening, we saw many people who did not appear to have the wristband. There was no effort to prevent them going on rides, check that they had valid tickets for the party or remove them. The park was very full.

As midnight approached, we tried to make our way to the Central Plaza to watch the fireworks. It rapidly became clear that there were far too many people in the park. We found ourselves squashed like sardines in the middle of a crowd with no ability to move in any direction. In my opinion it was unsafe.

When the fireworks started, I could see some of the display but much of it was hidden by buildings or people holding their smartphones over their heads to film the fireworks. My oldest son, who is a little taller than me, saw a bit more but not much. My wife and younger son saw absolutely nothing. Remember, this was supposed to be my wife's birthday treat. She could hear the fireworks but didn't see a single one.

I came away from the evening feeling we had been scammed by DIsney - persuaded to pay extra for an event unnecessarily, and then being unable to see the main event. As far as I am concerned, the New Year's Eve Party tickets were a complete waste of money. We could have got into the park without them and they didn't entitle us to anything extra when we were in. To say we were disappointed is putting it mildly. The only reason I haven't demanded a refund is that my wife enjoyed the rest of the visit and feels that pursuing Disney on this would spoil the memories of the good bit of the trip.

If you can afford to go to Florida, go to Disneyworld. It is much better. If not, I would recommend Disneyland Paris, but don't be conned into paying extra for a New Year's Eve party or similar.

I know it's popular but the crowds are ridiculous. Just far to many people for the attractions it offers. Queues seen endless and soul sapping. Food available is bland and expensive.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Please help!! In July 2020 I booked a stay in DLP for March 2021 for a family of 5, travelling from Dublin. Flights from Ireland also included and paid 954 deposit. Now due to Covid only essential travel is recommended and my balance of over 2k is due on the 8th feb. If I cancel now I will lose 15% of the booking and 100% of flights as flights with Air France are non refundable.

The Disney agents I spoke to in the US were no help one advising that I should wait and see if Air France cancel the flights closer to the time, but to do this I would have to pay my full balance on the 8/2 and risk losing more of my money if the fights are not cancelled by the airline.

All I want is a chance to rebook later in the year, it is possible to amend or change bookings that you make now for March 2021 but not for bookings that were made last year for the same holiday period.

Can Disneyland or someone please help me, I have no email address to send this to and while the phone staff in the US are trying all the are doing is reading a script!

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,Everything about this place is so magical from the moment you step off the train. It’s super clean. Almost like there’s a magic fairy constantly waving her wand! I’m sure it’s just the maintenance people doing an excellent job but still...!,Nov 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"While it doesn't compare to Disney world, it is an incredible park. You have two options when to go:
The first one would be while there are many people; it seems as though it is part of the excitement to wait in line for 2 hours for each attraction.
The second option would be to go on a day that people are working and most of the park is empty.
Both of these options are good. If you want to go through the entire park in a minimum of time, I would advise you to go when no one is around; you can sometimes even stay at the attraction instead of going all around to do it again. AVOID WEDNESDAYS!!!
If you are more interested in the thrill of waiting around, you should go on a Wednesday on Sunday when there are many people.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Could be much better if not a money trap, everything awfully expensive and hard to get for your money as you spend your time lining up even when the Parc is only partly filled with visitors because of the Covid, plus the fact that for the regular price too many amenities/activities are closed.
What a shame because it is really the children's dream but you have to pay the big money for it.
I wonder how people can afford even only a one day pass that is the cheapest rate to access, and forget the stay at the Disneyland hotel where a 2 nights stay will cost you more than $2,000, half the price of one week luxury cruise!
For instance 2 adults plus 1 kid pay already 260 euros, plus the parking + (hard to find because lack of signs) at 45 euros then you need a trolley for the kid add 25 euros, of course you do not want to starve the kids and again it over 35 euros for hot dog junk food fries and soda, total is already 365 euros before you pass by the goodies shops, add a few more bucks you are over 400 euros just for 1 day, 2 it's a small world tours, 1 Dumbo merry go round, 1 Lancelot merry go round, 1 circular railways and 1 labyrinth.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Came from the UK, we were cautious about heading to France or abroad at all, but we saw from videos online that the parks looked to be quite safe.

Got the Euro Tunnel from UK, stayed at Newport Bay from Wednesday to Saturday. Hotel was great, everyone wearing masks at all times, the pool people kept a safe distance.

In the park it was the same, every single person wearing a mask at all times, if anyone dropped it or it wasn't covering their nose, Disney staff would tell them right away, it was like they had a team of people doing this. Plenty of space between people in queues and walking around.

So from a COVID perspective, Disney was great.

The crowd levels were lower whilst we were there and we pretty much walked on to every ride and got to see every character the children wanted, it's the best time we've been to Disney in that respect. On the Saturday it did get a lot busier, but we had planned that day to do shopping so all in all, we didn't spend more than 10 minutes in any queue for the whole trip.

Brilliant trip!

We were on the dining plan and this made our stay memorable. Each restaurant we visited was good. The food was well cooked, the staff friendly and helpful. Regularly checked that we were happy with the food.

There was sanitiser stations all over the park, both at the entrance to the rides and at the exit. The bathrooms were very clean, and tidy.

On our last visit in 2010 we found the Park very neglected but since Walt Disney have taken back control it was a pleasure to see it restored to the way it was when it opened in 1992

No height restriction. No warning signs. Even asked a staff member on the way in if it was ok for young childen AND a 6 month old baby...

Told yes - that it was a “visual experience”

I have never been more terrified in my life. I clung to our baby with one arm and the boat with the other.

Two 5 year olds crying plus a screaming baby. None of them CLEARLY old enough or tall enough for this ride.

Shocking.

The teenage ride operator laughed. Disney sent a french manger with very little English to take our complaint. On return their argument is they’ve met the European safety requirements.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I really wasn't expecting such scamming behaviour from Disneyland Paris. They are refusing to refund tickets that were advertised and sold as refundable.

We bought tickets in July from the official website. At the time they were advertising that everything is flexible, refundable in case you are unable to travel, etc. The only 1-day ticket option at the time of purchase was a ticket that gave you a 6 month window and you need to reserve your day (explained as a measure to manage the number of people in the park). We did everything as instructed, but closer to travel date new lockdown measures came into place and we are now unable to travel.

So I got in touch with Disneyland to get a refund and they told me that - because it is not a ""dated"" ticket it is non-refundable (it was the only ticket option at the time)! I went to the official website and they have changed everything there now - the type of ticket that we bought in July is no longer available, there is no T&C that I can find that at the time stated that the ticket is refundable. The ticket code doesn't even work when I enter it into ""Manage My Booking"" section. Moreover, taking a closer look at the ticket pdf there is a very small fine print that says - ticket is non-refundable!

The website and T&Cs at the time of purchase made me believe that the ticket is refundable, but Disneyland is refusing to refund and I can't even prove any more than they were sold to me as refundable.

This is really a false advertising and scammy behaviour that I was not expecting from Disneyland Paris. I am really upset about this – not only I didn’t get to travel to the park for my birthday but I also got scammed out of my money.

In case you bought tickets during Summer 2020 and now want to get a refund – Disneyland will refuse, and you will not be even able to prove anything. Now I will be taking screenshots of everything when booking tickets such as these.

There are fantastic attractions, shows and entertainment for all ages in enchanting surroundings. We found the queues to be manageable and the free fast-pass system and extra magic hours were a real bonus. 1.5 days was plenty of time to experience everything we wanted to. We especially enjoyed the spectacular fireworks in the evening, the perfect way to finish an magical day!

For a short break, I would highly recommend staying in one of the Disney hotels. The convenience of being on-site and the extra magic hours (early park entry for hotel guests) really adds to the overall experience.

The plexiglas and the stickers on the floor make sure everyone keeps a distance, but it doesn't ruin the atmosphere of the park. Some rides were closed, but nothing important (to us). We could meet various Disney characters and make pictures with them. You have to keep a distance from the characters, but it didn't bother me. You have to wear a mask all time, but that is how it is now. The only thing we missed was a map of the park. If you have an old one at home, bring it! All in all I had a perfect birthday!

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Very disappointing experience for our family of 6 - apparent COVID guidelines are not working and frankly not good enough.
COVID concerns:
- Markers on the ground for people to stand, however, these are not big enough for families to stand together and many people ignoring them completely - staff need to enforce this.
- Reduced numbers of people in the parks... I don't think so! Busier than I have ever seen it before.
- Big Thunder Mountain - the line for this was very enclosed and packed in. People were so close to me that I felt someone breathing on my back. Plastic and wooden panels around felt very very claustrophobic and uncomfortable. Perfect place for COVID to spread with very little air circulation. I wanted to turn back and leave the line but it is impossible to get out without getting close to other people waiting. This would also be very dangerous if there was a fire - I dread to think!
- Restaurants were not clean and tables were not being cleaned after each use. Yet if you have an allergy to hand sanitiser you are not even allowed to enter buildings... very discriminative

Poor value for money:
- The park hours are reduced yet ticket prices remain the same.
- Waited in long queues several times to be told there was a 'technical fault'
- The Princess Pavillion does not have any princesses.. they have put a troll in place instead lol ... I guess COVID is a good excused to pay less staff. 2 very disappointed girls as we were not aware of this when booking ticket.
- Stopping the fireworks is just another way to cut costs and increase profit - there really is no reason not to have them. If the excuse for this is 'it encourages people to gather' ... well everyone enters the park at the same time and leaves at the same time resulting in large amounts of people trying to leave at the same time in large number.
- Many restaurants are not yet open.

To conclude... if you are thinking of going I would wait until the pandemic is over as exposure to the virus is high risk here. Definitely feels very profit orientated which I find very sad when children are involved. However, Disney do not care as they know they have guaranteed custom but our family definitely won't return and will encourage others considering not to either unless the park can up their game and make health a priority!

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"The park was so busy that it was impossible to socially distance due to long queues. I could see no evidence of restricted numbers of people. There are boxes painted on the floor where you should not stand but most people just ignore them and there is no enforcement of the rules. The space where you can stand is too small for a large family.
The worst by far was the Big Thunder Mountain Ride - there are plastic boards all around the queue which causes poor ventilation. The plastic is dirty with kids touching and even licking them. Did anyone ever think of fire safety? If there was a fire people are so packed in and the walk is so long if anything happened the people would be trapped in by the plastic boards!!! Very clostraphobic! Very difficult to get out if you need to.
But yet you cannot take your mask off for an open air photo with the Disney Photographer where there is no chance of anyone standing beside you (it is cordoned off) and the photographer is far away! Good ventilation - no risk there - so really the rules do not make sense!
Plus reduced services - why no fireworks? This is open air and good ventilation and not a line where you must stand next to other people.
Reduced services and reduced opening times does not improve COVID safety - the price of tickets don't reduce though!
An uncomfortable experience with young kids.

We had to wear masks at all times (unless eating/drinking) and staff were quick to remind visitors who had moved their mask down. There were reminders on the floor to keep a distance and this was great in the queues as no one was pushing behind you (which we have experienced previously). Because of reduced visitors the queues were very minimal (in the height of summer/ school holidays) so we managed to get on lots of rides. The Lion King theatre show in Frontierland theatre was amazing - You book via Lineberty App. The character meet and greets were obviously different and were more a selfie opportunity but the queues for these were short which was great. There was unfortunately no firework show but understandable because of the situation. There were random mini parades a few times which were fun.

Although the rides we went on were good I just felt that maybe the tickets should maybe have a discount on them due to the fact not all the rides were available.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We took the chance and went over knowing that we’d be in quarantine on our return. It was 100% worth it (may not feel exactly the same after the next 2 weeks). We have 3 children; 3, 5 & 7 and they all loved it! I don’t need to write about why the liked it, it’ll be the same for every child, a mix of the “Disney” magic, the rides and the gener atmosphere.
But, in this COVID era, what’s it like? Never been in summer before, but I bet it was much, much busier than this. Maximum queue was 40mins and most were 20-30 mins any time of day. We were staying in a Disney hotel so we took advantage of the “Magic Hour” and got several goes on most of the big rides.
There are hand sanitiser machines all over the place, including just before you get on every ride and just after. The staff ask everyone to clean before they get on, so they don’t have to wipe down every surface of every ride and thus take twice as long. There are more machines dotted around the park and even in the queues.
There are also signs in every queue advising people to not stand there and maintain distance. Unfortunately, it seems maybe the more local visitors (I’m guessing this as they were generally speaking French) struggled with this, took a couple of pictures of people just standing on them. Why!? If the whole country was this poor at social distancing, it doesn’t bode well for reducing their currently high community transmission rate!!!

The queues were shorter than usual and most rides in the main park were open.
However, the studios was very disappointing. There were no shows on except Stitch and no parades. Although I accept some shows could not operate, the outdoor one certainly could have. If you can put the lion king on then you could have done better in the studios.
Or you could have reduced the price. Or made all tickets park hopper. There wasn’t enough to do in the studios to fill the day and there wasn’t any thought into making magic in other ways. Distanced photo opportunities were also limited. Felt cheated by this park.

There was social distancing in the queues with floor markers and enhanced barriers. There were a higher number of attractions or restaurants, food stalls etc closed - mainly because of the lower numbers in the park. It was very hot (32-35C) and all the water fountains were closed because of covid, but there were plenty of places to buy water- would have been good if you could get these refilled by staff.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"As a frequent visitor to DLRP, with my first visit in May 1992, we've continued to visit over the years.

Having bought Infinity Annual Passes last summer, and Covid19, we did wonder whether or not we'd ever get to use the passes again.

What smiles we had on our faces when we first entered Disneyland Paris once more in late July. We'd booked our day online, and we entered to a near empty park.

Even in the winter months of the 90's I'd never seen it so empty.

It was an utter delight to not to have to queue for rides or food. We knew that DLRP were putting a cap on visitor numbers, and we couldn't have been happier.

As a family who'd not eaten out since February 2020, we were a little apprehensive about eating in the park restaurants, but because they were so empty, and with our own hand gel, it felt fine.

We had a great day, we really did.

That said three weeks later, we returned on our way back to the UK. The park was much much busier. Perhaps they'd increased numbers allowed into the park, or perhaps it was because it was now August? Either way there were elements of our experience that didn't feel safe to us.

A particular instance, was the Ratatouille ride. It was a pretty long wait, but we stood in the queuing system. As we reached the entrance to the building, it was pretty much just our family that used the alcoholic gel on the wall. After getting out of the ride vehicle, there was no cleaning at all before the next riders got in.

Then when it came to food, again in the Cafe de Hyperion, we sat at a table that we presumed to have been recently cleaned, but it soon became evident that cleaning in there was almost none existent.

I saw multiple people leave tables, and then because it was so busy, other diners immediately sitting down at uncleaned tables.

There was a large man with cleaning materials, but he was on one level, and didn't move up or down a level to clean anything whilst we sat eating. Our kids take an age to eat anything, so in my nosiness, I sat watching a total lack of cleaning.

I'm going to say this, the week previous we'd spent time on site at Portaventura. Then cleaning there was incredibly, you genuinely couldn't do more as a theme park company.

Everytime diners left a table, immediately, and I mean immediately, cleaning teams came across, removed everything, and cleaned tables, chairs, everything. I watched in so many different areas, the theme parks, the hotels, restaurants, the most thorough of cleans.

I saw little cleaning at DLRP, the contrast was incredibly stark.

Right now we're in self quarantine because the UK government changed the rules whilst we were in Spain. The crazy thing is, is that there's probably a greater chance of us contracting Covid19 in France.

As a huge Disney fan... frankly we should've been in WDW during our holiday, but that went pear shaped because of the US flight ban, I've always had a lot of positive things to say about DLRP, but they just were not doing enough in my opinion.

Surely after each time we scanned our passes on the turnstiles, they should've been cleaned? The perspex on them is so scratched on the laser readers, that you have to rub your pass on the reader... and I never saw them cleaned.

Handrails in queuing areas... never saw them being cleaned.

All in all, both my Wife and I were very disappointed with the level of cleaning we saw firsthand.

Our passes have been extended up to January 2021 owing to the park shut down. Do I think we'll be using them again before they expire? No, most probably not. In these Covid19 times, I'd return to Portaventura in a shot, because you couldn't go a few minutes without seeing teams of people cleaning.

It was a great shame to see that despite efforts to make queues safer, and yes no one can deny what they've done, but putting alcohol gel up on rides, and then no one using it makes a total mockery. Thorough cleaning is essential at this time.

As a demonstration, in Portaventura, the staff made sure you applied gel. Then on rides where you touched surfaces, they made you wear provided disposable gloves. Overall they just seemed do everything better.

Anyway I'll leave it there... if you're going to have a very busy park, full of people from all over Europe, there's no excuses for poor hygiene standards.

Thanks for reading.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Being an Annual Pass holder I was so pleased when Disneyland Paris reopened. That I couldn’t wait to go back

And Inwas not disappointed. Lots of hand sanitiser stations throughout the parks and village , before you board a ride you are encouraged to use them. Masks are mandatory for everyone over the age of 11. If a cast member sees you without a mask on they ask you politely to put it on

Character m&g are now selfie spots these work realy well and you can have some
Fun with the characters even from a distance

There are now shows or parades at the moment but they have added the. Characters in the shows to the selfie opportunity so bows a great time to meet some of those rarer characters. The reduced capacity means social distancing is not an issue and you can do many attractions
More the. Once during the day due to the shorter queues

The characters greet you in the more nigh and wave good by from
Strategic points by the pro entrances which is lovely

The park is spotless!!!! They are taking hygiene seriously

I felt very safe though out my entire trip

Well done Disney

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"First time visiting Disneyland Paris.

Very friendly, smiling and helpful staff members once you pass the doors.

You get back to childhood in a blink of an eye.

Due to COVID the park appeared pretty empty and many attractions closed.

They do not give you any map for orientation.

You just have to download the disney app to have it on your phone.

No parade, no fireworks and the big thunder mountain closed.

I must have waited about 20min in average for each attraction I tried which was a big plus.

Many restaurants all around the park, pretty expensive, count like 15€ for a burger + fries + drink menu.

I spilled my drink before even reaching my table and they kindly served another one for free.

Very friendly.

I recommend the park but not during the COVID time as you will be missing the parade and fireworks.

I paid 79€ for a single ticket and was pretty sad to miss the parade.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Just returned from a short break and spent 2 days at disneyland. Its a long time since we last visited but we now have a 4 Yr old Minnie mouse super fan so it seemed like a good time to visit.
The first day we queued for over an hour at guest services to get our passes. This was probably more the fault of our tour operator not giving us the tickets beforehand but the queue was very slow moving and a few more staff at guest services would have been better. A 4yr old in an hour long queue and over 30 degrees heat was hard work. Having said that, this is the only criticism I would give.
The park was spotlessly clean and wasn't overcrowded at all. The disney staff did their best to remind people to socially distance and the floor was marked appropriately. Some people ignored this, but it was called out by staff where they saw this happening. We queued no longer than 20 mins for any ride. Most of the time we only queued for 5-10mins for each ride.
Food is expensive, but we expected that. Food is a bit cheaper at the disney village before you go into the main park and there is a macdonalds there. My advice would be to fill up on breakfast or food before you go into the main park if your not prepared to pay the prices in the park.
You can't hug the characters, but there are plenty of photo opportunities and they gave the children plenty of attention. Donald and Daisy were very good with my daughter by dancing with her and playing with her bubble machine. She had an absolutely amazing time and we will definitely be returning. The magic is most definitely still there!!

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"We visited the park as a desperate attempt to salvage some holiday this year.
Firstly if you’re registering to come to the park, the barcodes from the registration are not the ones you need to get in you still need your ticket too!
We only received two tickets via email as we booked with magic breaks not directly with Disney.
We had a child ticket which I had purchased separately and not printed off.....therefore I had to visit guest services to get it printed!
With a 5 year old in the baking heat in a queue with only one person serving not good!
You’re not treated like a customer in these situations with Disney. You have to prove everything and it’s an insult.
You would not have a registration barcode without a ticket????
Anyhow rant over because I felt very annoyed with it and it wasn’t magical waiting in an impossible queue.

We got into the park lots of kiosks closed and I’m glad for once we didn’t stay with a Disney hotel as the package would have been a waste of money on this occasion.
We didn’t need a photo pass as you wear a mask constantly even on rides, so no photos will show any expression. Characters are at a distance so no cuddles or photos with Disney photographers.
We only wanted one day in the park so luckily with Magic Breaks we could just do this and not pay for one night in a hotel and two days in a park.
It was mega hot and shade was limited but the queuing wasn’t too bad. No more than 35-40 mins at the most. A couple of the main rides had an hour plus but we didn’t bother with those.
The queues were spaced out and in the heat this was a bonus.
There are no water fountains turned on around the park so buying expensive bottles of water was a need. It would have been nice for Disney to do something here.
With a lack of live shows and being unable to cuddle the characters at least give back something to the crowds whom have committed to Disney to visit regardless of COVID.
All in all was a good day out, it isn’t the same but it’s ok. Would I want to be there for more than a couple of days with limitations, no.

I really enjoyed the Olaf hot chocolate they had and all the amazing rides! We went in January so it was pretty cold! Disneyland Paris is the only castle you can go inside so I recommend checking it out! There is the most beautiful sleeping beauty stained glass windows!
It does look a little out dated and there were homeless people begging outside which wasn’t the nicest atmosphere when entering the park!
The restaurants outside the park are very expensive but is expected! The bakery/sweet shop on Main Street has some lovely treats like chocolate covered mickey shaped marshmallows and mickey shaped cookies!
Watching the fireworks were magically and was such a special memory to share with my partner.
I’d definitely go back again!

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"No magic at the moment, understandably the shows etc... are cut for now but nothing has been put in there place, either cut the price or create magic in other ways,

we walked the parks in the afternoon and did not see any characters then we queued over an hour to see Mickey and Belle in a theatre for 2 mins

Avoid!! I understand during Co-Vid changes have to be made. But all precautions are just an excuse to charge you the same and cut the parades, meet the princess, the fireworks, closed attractions. You can get sick in the way out of every attraction (is control in the way in, but 0 in the way out) so this cuts are nonsense. Charge less or keep it close

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"As others have said the magic isn’t there. It was great not queuing more than 15 mins but the food was awful. Most food outlets closed which we understand but at least give us a choice of something more than burger and frites which are over priced and awful. Also wiring for food in the sun which hit 40 yesturday my partner nearly passed out.
Without the characters, the shows etc it’s not Disney and the atmosphere mon existent. It doesn’t stand on its own as a theme park for rides as it’s not designed for that. 2 long and very hot days which were ok but missing the Disney magic.
There were no park maps due to covid which we appreciate however the app was next to useless for finding your way round and signage in the main park was terrible.
We visited the village the afternoon with high expectations but again nothing was open outside the main Disney store and 2 burger joints which at 62 euros for 2 x burger and drink is more than our evening meals have costed in restaurants!!

Perhaps I’m spoilt due to having been to Florida sooo many times. I had high expectations but was sadly disappointed we won’t return.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Didn't know what to expect due to current situation. I read a previous review, the description 'over priced theme park' is a true reflection. if you want to ride without massive queues you are going to love it, we manage 5 x thunder mountain, 4 x space mountain and all the rest. Disappointed that Buzz light year ride was off.
Unfortunately most of the 'magic' was missing, no parades ,shows or character activity, the things required to make it a different experience from normal parks.
my feeling is that they have opened to early and don't have the staff to provide the usual unique experience. Face masks compulsory in all areas. If your mask should shift off your face on a ride your post ride photo will not be displayed.
Kids loved it by the way so maybe I should have got them to write this.

The Park had a low occupancy (Covid related) and therefore no waiting times. this was a huge advantage. Some of the F&B outlets were closed, which I understand.

-- the high prices
-- the lack of rides and attractions for older kids.
-- there are still so many things in French (the haunted House story for instance).",Jul 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We visited both parks with our two young children (4 and 7).

Pros: fantastic ambiance, landscaping and magical rides. Queues (even with Covid-19 measures) acceptable. We particularly loved peter pan, pirates of the carribean, swiss family robinson treehouse and thunder mountain.

Cons: food, food, food - no healthy options, €50 for an adult’s menu which is extremely basic. All smaller restaurants serve pre-made microwaved food for around €15 per person. Real shame about the food. You are not allowed to bring your own and we felt forced to eat unhealthy crap.

We knew there would be adjustments for Covid as this is the world we now live in but the day was rubbish and the price did not reflect the experience - with reduced services they should reduce the price, family of four and a toddler it was £350 for the 2 parks for the day and roughly £29 (30e) to Park.
Face masks are compulsory all round the park including the rides and in the open air.. i understand inside but outside is too much and my 14year old really struggled as it was a scorching hot day, at times she could not breath and momentarily pulled her mask down in open air to breath and was aggressively shouted at by staff. I drank water and was shouted at again.
There are no parades and shows - they had four months to work on something that could fit social distancing rules. Other than selfie spots it really is just a Very expensive theme park at the moment and not a magical experience.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"I went with family and members of all age groups, right from 1 year old to 60 yrs old. The park is definitely a heaven on earth for kids, but I am sure it can be managed in a better way. I've visited an Universal Park before and by far it was much better organized. However I would strongly suggest that if you are with family don't go for the 1 day pass and try to cover both the parks, because it will be next to impossible, if there is a long wait time. I started with Walt Disney park and was able to do just 3-4 rides by afternoon and then rushed to Disney Park, where again it took almost 90 mins waiting for one ride.

If the place is crowded and it is sunny, you are in for a mess, because you don't get any place inside the restaurant to eat or relax. The waiting time is so high that you tend to skip the ride, so that you can see the park.

I strongly recommend to visit the place but either the duration should be longer or you should have the fast pass, to skip the line.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"We went to Disneyland Paris for only one day but the experiences were just remarkable and unforgettable for me and my family. We went to different theme parks before but Disney in Paris was the best! There was an exciting, joyful, magical, and happy atmosphere from the moment we stepped in until the moment we leave the park.
We notice Christmas and New Year will be the busiest and crowdest time of the year so we chose to visit in February and got there very soon, so it was much less crowded. Although of course, we had to queue for our rides and turns, it was very much worth our time. And oh, we realized most theme parks are less clean when they are full of visitors, for example, we don't like seeing people throw tissues or leftover food into grass and flowers, it affects the environment and also the behaviors of other guests. Luckily we came at this time so it was fine, and there was always cleaning staff walk around to clean the areas.
My young sister said she loves the fact that wherever we went in the park, there was always her favorite Disney music, with beautiful decorations and colorful castles welcomed us. There was plenty of things to do and I guess we managed to play almost every most featured one, my favorite one was the Pirates of Caribbean sail while my little sis preferred the Peter Pan's flight. Overall we like all of it and my parents are happy with it too.

I want to do this review for any plus size people worried about there trip to Disneyland Paris, when I was going I spent months reading online worried I would be to big for any rides.
So I am plus size I wear a size 22/24 depending on the shop. I have a big chest. I went on every ride except - buzz light year laser blast (closed for refurb) Rock an roller coaster (also closed) the 2 rides I missed out of reading other reviews was Indiana Jones and Rc racer- this this ride has bigger seats but I didn’t want to risk the embarrassment. My husband went on with the kids and said a guy who wasn’t that big had to move to the bigger seat.
So stars wars space mountain - amazing ride over head harness and i fitted fine.
Star Wars 3d - seat belt strap very long no problems
Dumbo - long strap
Peter Pan- bar - just stops at you
Aladdin bar - just stops at you
Thunder mountain, really big seat could fit 3 people in - bar stops at you
Slinky - huge seat all 4 of us fitted -bar stops at you)
Crush coaster- I read reviews so was really worried the first time I didn’t bother getting in the que, I was guttered 2nd time I thought right I’m gonna try I will prob have to do the walk of shame but ile have to. I was so happy, the pull down bar which is also what you hold on to stopped at me. I wasn’t squashed at all, I can see you having more problems if your tall due to leg space - amazing ride
Toy soldiers parachutes - again seat belt strap, an then bar no problem
Tower of terror - long seat belt strap amazing ride
Phantom manor - wide seat bar come down
Pirates of the Caribbean - step in to boat wide seat fit the 4 of us on - no bar.
We had the best time, I don’t no why I was worried. I will definitely go back and no I will have nothing to worry about, it was so magical,
Clothes wise I don’t think I could of bought a top or jumper it was just sizes small to xl. And also people mention the bars you push round to get in the ride, ok I have to go side ways thru these bit I do in the uk so I wouldn’t really try to do it different, we done so many steps a day. One day I done 26000 so be prepared.

You run to get to the princess pavilion in the morning so dont queue long. You queue and tussle with others at the spontaneous meets and greets as there is never an organised line and the CMs try their best but everyone thinks they deserve to be the one chosen. Parades - you have to turn up minimum 20 minutes before start to get to the front and see everything. The fireworks show is a grower though. I didn't enjoy it at first but its grown.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"If you have been to America, you will be disappointed with Paris. Firstly, having tickets and trying to get in....a fiasco. The girl scanning at the booth couldn't get our tickets to scan, called someone else over who tried and then they looked at the ticket and said we were in the wrong queue. There was no information to say certain tickets had to be in certain queues. So she pointed to the queue we were supposed to be in and queued yet again for us to be told we were in the wrong queue....AGAIN! No one has a clue where you are supposed to be going!!! I stopped 3 people chatting and asked where do we have to go after being moved twice and they pointed and said round that corner. We joined that queue and it was the correct one. At last!!! Only an hour wasted!!!
Here's an idea....why not put people before the queuing area to guide visitors to the correct queue. So many people were getting annoyed.
But heres the funny part. After being in that queue to change our ticket to a card (no info we had to do that), we had to queue in the first queue we joined!!!
Sort it out Disneyland Paris....and while your at it....ask the staff to smile!!! The whole time we were there everyone looked miserable, except one girl in the food court. I wish I got her name.
Next, the rides. Sure they are great....if they are open. Yes, it was October but if I knew this I wouldn't have gone at that time of year. Plus, I love extreme rides and my friends don't. I asked every ride for single rider only to be told they don't do it at that time of year.....yet I was sat on my own as a single rider on most of the rides!!!!
Either do single rider or don't. Sort it out.
Also, seeing characters....you have to book???? Is that seasonal?
I felt very let down by this experience and I feel sorry for families who pay to go here and have these experiences.
Please Disneyland Paris, bring back the magic.
I can assure you I would never come back. I would rather save and do WDW in Florida. That place is amazing and the people smile and they do single riders and you just queue to see characters. They also cant do enough for you and having the queues so sorted you dont feel like you queue.

The Thunder Mountain was 100% the scariest ride of them all. People were loudly screaming on every drop. Young children will not enjoy this speedy ride.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"After visiting Disney Shanghai last year we knew we wanted to visit each of the Disney parks around the world. With the recent addition of Disney+ (Imagineering Ep. 2) we got to see some of the park’s history and see what rides to visit which was a good way to get us excited. The park is 45 minutes outside of Paris and can be accessed by subway. However, because of the strikes taking place the lines were less reliable so we decided to book a bus tour through @pariscityvision for 21 USD each. The bus left from their office near the Tuileries Garden at 10AM and came back at 7PM. Although they don’t stay until the park closes we still found it worth it instead of having to deal with the trains or finding an Uber ride back which cost close to 80 USD. Once inside we recommend going to Hyper-Space Mountain first and then getting fast passes for Country Thunder. Space Mountain offers a rapid start at the beginning of the ride and features a full 360 loop. Country Thunder also has a unique start because it begins on land but the entire ride sits in the middle of the lagoon so you start the ride in pitch black as you travel underwater and onto the island. The one negative we did find was in the food because all the stands were closed when we went so we were forced to eat at the restaurants.. Because of this we had a long wait of 1.5+ hours of walking around looking for food and finally eating. However, that didn’t dampen our mood and we still had a great time and look forward to the next Disneyland we get to visit!

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Family visit to Disneyland in Feb 2020. It was ok/good, definitely not great. Some great memories for the kids to take away. For the parents, just try to focus on the good bits.

Main issues were waiting times for rides. We couldn’t get the fast pass to work on several machines. My 11yo son asked a staff member at Indiana Jones ride and was told nothing could be done to help us. It wasn’t until our second (and last day) that we figured out the problem with using the machines.

TIP: If you are using paper printed tickets, put some spare paper behind it when you scan it in the machine - otherwise it won’t work.

TIP: If I was to go again - I’d definitely order a premium fast pass type option for at least one day.

TIP: Best rides at Disneyland were Hyperspace mountain and big thunder mountain.

I was expecting more engagement from costumed staff with my 7yo child. I guess I expected them to be walking around rather than in one spot with a line up.

TIP: Suggest finding a good vantage point for the afternoon parade if unwilling to wait for a character experience.

From a parent perspective, it’s pretty easy to get around. The mobile app is really useful especially with wait times. Be prepared for endless merchandise shops and your children wanting something.

TIP: Best to manage your children’s expectations before the visit with (a) waiting times and (b) what they can buy.

TIP: go into a restaurant about 1130 for an early lunch before restaurants get too busy.

Most if not all hotels in the area offer a shuttle service.

TIP: if arriving by train - best to check ahead to see if you can catch the shuttle to your hotel rather than taking an expensive taxi.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Full disclosure - this was my FIRST Disney experience. I have never been to any other Disney Park. However, I have been to various theme parks in North America and in terms of size, this is a relatively small park. Because of it's size, the lines get very busy very quickly. We were only able to get on about 5 rides the entire day because of how busy the rides were, and the park was not very busy. I can only imagine how long the wait is when the park is jam packed. We also did not have many options for lunch, as most places were by reservation only. I had no idea that is how it worked. The park was beautifully decorated for Christmas. I would not recommend this as a must-do activity while in Paris, unless you are looking for something to do with your kids. As two adults, we could have done without this day trip. However, that being said, it made me want to experience the magic of Disney at a much bigger park. Now that I have had a taste, I will surely be booking something to Orlando very soon.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"We stayed at the Cheyenne ranch, which was one of the lower end hotels they offered, but frankly if this is lower end then I can't imagine what high end is. The area was a beautifully themed wild west town, and we were impressed by the detail and scale of it all. The main area had lovely western themed statues of horses and cowboys, authentic looking furniture and other fixtures, and we even saw Woody stroll though the foyer and wave to everyone. Our hotel room was similarly pretty, with a boot-shaped lamp, some pretty paintings related to Toy Story and a comfortable bed and sofa to relax on.

We didn't stick around for long in the room though and took the convenient bus that took us straight to the park. Even at the entrance you can't help but be blown away by the care and attention that has gone into this park. The fountain, the floral decoration shaped like the famous mouse himself and the scenic buildings decorating every inch. It truly is unique in terms of the care that goes into every bit of its upkeep.

After entering the park, we were instantly greeted with the Frozen 2 parade. The music floated through the air as a magnificent float loomed over, a mountain of ice shaped like a stallion with Elsa stood atop, followed by a life-sized animatronic of Sven interacting with Christoph and an array of dancers representing the elements moving to the music. A great introduction to the park, we were dazzled already.

After eating a delicious sandwich purchased on Main Street, we headed off through Frontierland to the Phantom Manor. The twisted and gnarled trees, scattered gargoyles and Gothic architecture of the manor itself already gets you ready for a ghost story before you even step in the door. The ride itself is equally spookily brilliant, with some amazing effects and fantastic characters. It was lovely to hear the sinister tones of Vincent Price's distinct voice guide you through the experience.

Next, we headed over to Pirates of the Caribbean. Again, the skull-shaped cavern spewing water from its mouth and the fantastic full-sized ship waiting in front of the entrance instantly takes you to a different world full of piracy and plunder as soon as you step through into that area of the park. The ride itself is equally thrilling, with epic scenes of pirate battles and ransacked villages, as well as ghastly spectres of pirates who still haunt the area. I could see why these two classic rides had endured for so many years, timelessly fun and unique experiences that whisk you away with Disney magic every ride.

We finished the day with the Disney Illuminations show, which blew us both away with its stunning projection mapping, synchronised lasers and illuminating fireworks. It's truly a sight to behold, how they pull off such a show every night is beyond me. Lion King, Frozen, Star Wars, The Little Mermaid and more all in one fantastic package. We watched it both nights and were just as impressed both times.

The next day we used our magic hours to get into the park early. Honestly, for these magic hours alone it's worth staying at the park. We managed to ride Big Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Hyperspace Mountain and Autopia all in a couple of hours. My favourite being Big Thunder Mountain, there's a reason this ride is so popular. It's probably the best ride there is for thrill seekers, as you walk through the doors into a scenic mining facility you can see signs of life and history all over. Machinery and signs and buildings help tell a story as you make your way to the iconic, towering mountain. The ride itself doesn't give you a moment to catch your breath, darting around the tight corners and mine shafts of the mountain, through pitch black drops into darkness into dizzying heights as you weave through the area. Truly a ride not to be missed.

I won't go into detail on every ride we rode that day, but they were all equally expertly themed and designed. We never left an attraction feeling like it had been left to decay like some other theme parks unfortunately do.

One of the last things we did was watch Disney Stars on Parade. The sheer size of these floats is something to behold, each so detailed and littered with Disney stars dancing or waving to you. Floating fairy godmothers, the cast of Finding Nemo swimming in the air, every Disney prince and princess you could possibly imagine, the big mouse himself and much, much more. A colourful charming and spectacular thing to see.

Unfortunately during the night I fell sick and though I entered the park I eventually needed to go to the first aid area for medical help. Though this wasn't ideal for me obviously during my trip to Disney, I want to publicly thank the medical staff who went out of their way to help me and my girlfriend through this difficult situation. All of them were helpful and reassuring, guiding us through a difficult situation. The staff even allowed us to stay at the park for another night for a vastly reduced rate as we had missed our train back and paid for our taxi back from the hospital.

Frankly, I don't think they could have been more supportive in this hard time and it was very much appreciated, so I want to give them again the biggest thanks possible.

All in all we had an amazing time. We had heard mixed things on here and online which made us wary of the park. We thought we would be queuing for hours and not see much, but that couldn't have been further from the truth. I think some people should take more advantage of the Disneyland Paris app. With this we could always manage our day so we were going to the shortest queues first and could fit everything we wanted to do into our day.

The experience was wonderful, and we both hope to visit again one day when things return to normal.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"My boyfriend & I stayed in the Sequoia Lodge Hotel in the Disney Village
We arrived on Tuesday the 20th of August until Thursday the 22nd of August. We had tickets for the three days that we were here for both the Disneyland Park & Walt Disney Studios. There was sometime a lot of waiting in ques for rides due to the amount of people, but that is expected when you go in the height of summer so it didn't bother me. One of my favourite items that I purchased was a glass wand from ""Merlin l'enchantuer"" which is situated inside the Sleeping Beauty Castle on the left (I would have bought more of these beautiful collectables if I had found this shop sooner (I found it on the last day) And to finish of my review (& the way Disneyland closes the park for the night), the fireworks were magical!! I cried during them because of my love for Disney. I would recommend taking a coat or a blanket with you to sit on the floor while waiting for the fireworks to start. People started to sit in front of the castle at 9pm & the fireworks don't start until 11pm. So unless you want to stand or sit on the stone pavement I'd bring something to sit on.
Disneyland Paris was truly magical, & I can't wait to got back soon!! ✨🏰🐭

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Visited as a group including three children aged under 12 for their first Disney experience - had a Two Park Multi-Day Pass. Being at any Disney Park is great, although we found that many of the rides and attractions experienced failures and some were also totally closed (including a high volume of eating locations, like the ice cream shop on Main Street).

Fast Pass was not always available, and some queues in particular were simply too long for little ones to wait. Even using Magic Hours (from staying at a Disney property), it was very difficult to fully immerse ourselves in the Park and all it had to offer.

Luckily, as we had spread our visit across a number of days, we managed to tick off most rides and attractions, but sadly, still left with some to do. Hopefully we will be able to return and experience the full Park again in the future

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"My review is based on being here for the Halloween Soiree 2018.
I was so excited to visit my 4th Disney park after WDW, DL California and Hong Kong Disney. Based on my visit, I wouldn't make this a priority on a first Paris visit unless Disney is really your thing.

Coming in from the city center of Paris was a bit of a commute, since on that particular night the train was down to the Disney stop, we had to take a shuttle bus that took almost 40 minutes to get there. On a normal day the train runs right to the park which is so much easier.

My first thought upon entering was that the cast members here were totally over it. They kept nastily asking to see our bracelets at every moment. They didn't have the upbeat Disney attitude you get at some other parks. I was also so excited to add my Paris original cap style mouse ears to my parks collection. I finally was told after two cast members had no clue what I was talking about, that they don't sell or make them for Paris Disney. The cast member who told me this was English, and also mentioned that most of the cast there had no clue about original Disney stuff. But he got why it sucked that they don't make them, luckily.

The Halloween soiree was much more packed than we expected even in the rain. We only were able to visit the one park with limited ride openings that night. Sadly, Phantom Manor and Indiana Jones were closed. The rest of the rides had nearly a 45 minute wait each, aside from Small World. We managed to get a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain but were surprised you could only do one FP at a time vs 3 at other parks. The Space Mountain here is unlike any other in the world in that it goes upside down. It was really awesome. Make this ride a priority. We would have done it twice, but given the 45 wait even at 1:30am we couldn't.
They had the same 3 Halloween songs blasting all night on repeat, that got super annoying after about an hour.
We are not parade fans, so managed to get on some rides quickly when everyone was watching them.
The Thunder Mountain here was above and beyond any version I had ever been on. This was our favorite ride in the park by far. We did it in the dark so it was even cooler.

Pirates here has more fun drops than any other I have been on and was far creepier. I was surprised that overall, many of the rides here were scarier than in the USA.
There were dance parties with characters DJing throughout the park and also beer and cocktails for sale which was something they don't have in the USA.
Sadly because of the long ride wait times we only managed to do 5 in the course of the night with no repeats.
That would be a total fail for a Disney Day normally. I wouldn't do the Halloween party again based on the huge crowds, but I would be curious to come back to ride the renovated Phantom Manor, and the other half of the park which is a lot like MGM in Orlando.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We are lifelong Disneyland goers so our expectations were high! First the great things; very clean, not crowded, very short wait times, good food. Hyperspace Mountain was amazing - the only thing that was better when comparing to Disneyland. People were friendly and overall it was a great day! One thing that was very different was the atmosphere and vibe, very underwhelming for Disney. Didn’t feel that magical exciting feeling I usually get. Music was unrecognizable and no Disney tunes that I’m used to. Most music and shows were French but I guess that makes sense in France! There weren’t many characters out and about and many of the attractions were of much smaller scale. Indiana Jones was and outdoor coaster like the old Mulholland Madness in Disney California Adventure. Alice in Wonderful was an outdoor walk through garden with a cool little castle in the middle. It’s definitely worth a visit, happy to check it off the bucket list!

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Eurodisney is very good for young children, we have a 3.4 year old and he loved it. The site was very clean and well maintained, and the buildings and layout was very impressive. We all loved the Ratatouille experience, 3D interactive. Pirates of the Caribbean was also excellent, and not too scary for a three and a quarter year old. Peter Pan, Snow White and Pinocchio were also great rides for young kids, ditto Its A Small World. The Mickey & The Magician show is well worth a visit. Eateries on site were not great though, and badly over priced. The restaurant in the onsite hotel is too, BUT the Disney characters come in and meet the kids while you are eating, which saves having to queue up for them in the park itself! If you are not staying at the onsite hotel you might need to book the restaurant, which stays open long after the park closes.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"When your child is walking into the gates of Disneyland Paris and turns to you and says ""My life is just about to start"" you know you've made a good decision and hopefully provided memories that will last a lifetime.
We pre bought a two day fast pass family ticket before we left Australia but my first mistake was getting to the Park just after opening. Opening was 10am but even though we had tickets we still had to line up to change our e-tickets into passes that get us into either Disneyland park or Walt Disney studios.
We decided to do Walt Disney Studios on the first day which is the newer of the two parks and had all the Star Wars shows. Being a weekend (even if it was middle winter) the place was very busy.
Second mistake, just because you have a fast pass that doesn't guarantee you'll get on a popular ride. By the time we got to meet Rey and Chewbacca (1 1/2hr wait) it was well and truly lunch time and when we went to go on our first ride our fast past was useless because there were too many other fast pass uses in front of us.
Third mistake was not to take our own food and drinks. Lines for food are huge and it's extremely expensive. To top it off by the time we did get to order the eftpos was down and therefore I had to go to the ONE ATM and line up again to get money out. Make sure you do take some cash with you just in case.
The shows were good (half in French and half in English) but we did notice that after the shows when the characters choose children for photos they would only choose kids that had bought merchandise from the over priced shops.
Day 1 done and we all left tired and slightly disappointed.
Second day - arrived earlier, booked our fast pass rides earlier, didn't have to line up for food as we had brought our own and spent an amazing day exploring Disneyland Park. This place was awesome. Day two done, exhausted but disappointment turned to happiness once again. Memories to last a life time.
Remember
Get there earlier than opening
Take some money
Take your own food
Book your fast passes early
Use the Disneyland App- very useful
Go during the week if possible.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Visited Disneyland Paris for 2 days, with two parks being Disneyland Park and Disney Studios you would expect it would be quite a fun trip. However the parks are not really that big and it is always overly crowded, with loads of families with lots of kids, it is just baby strollers everywhere you go and with crowded restaurants.

Speaking of restaurants, you are required to place a booking for some of the restaurants inside Disneyland Paris and if you decide to walk-in you would be denied entry. I know right.

The rides are what you would expect from a Disneyland, fantasy oriented and mostly for kids or Disney enthusiasts. Some of the more thrilling rides such as the Pirates of the Carribean and the Star Wars are so blurry with bad effects/lightings it is just very confusing and just overall dizzy.

All and all, great place for a romantic date. A really expensive but fantasy-filled and romantic date. Oh birthday people, get a birthday badge from the customer service from within the park, it does not exactly get you offers or anything but some of the employees will wish you happy birthdays along the way.

P.S : Go to Tokyo Disneyland, everything is better there like hands down. Both Disneyland Paris and Tokyo doesn't speak English anyways but at least the japanese don't insult you for being a non-French speaker.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"but make no mistake this is an expensive outing. If you are not prepared to splash out then simply dont go. It is what it is. Enough people are prepared to go so I dont see anything changing.
That said it is all done very well. My first advice would be to plan your day(s) Check out what you want to see or do that has a fixed time and work around that.
Must see at the end of the day is the light and firework show, 20 minutes. Get your spot early especially if you have young ones, and find somewhere that young people can see if an adult is standing in front of them.
The main Parade usually at 5pm, 15 minutes. very good especially for the young ones but even us oldies enjoyed it, but again get your spot early, if you dont others will.
The show Mickey and the Magician - excellent. We were lucky enough to walk straight in. It is a half hour show. Compared to other things in the park and having seen this, it is the only thing I would be prepared to queue an hour for, full on theatre production.
Cafe Mickey- expensive dinner yes at 65 Euro per adult but the characters that appear, 5 when we were there, really work the tables and more than once. The food was actually good and the service very good. Having spent all that time with the characters it saves the queuing and possible cost of photos out in the park, you have to eat so kill two birds with one stone. The look on our Granddaughters face was worth the cost.
The park is clean, there is airport style security to get in, the shop facades are amazing and strangely perhaps the landscaping is noteworthy too.
Down side. Queues. Sometimes prohibitive, there is a limit to how long I am prepared to queue for a 2 minute ride. Try the fast pass system or single rider that is available on a couple of rides, even if two or three of you, if you dont mind being separated, but do check the waiting times it can be longer this way than the ordinary queue.
If you have young ones under about 18 months be warned they are not really catered for on any level. Buggies can not be taken onto the rides, understandably, but not even into the queues. More particularly not even for the shows. We did wait an hour for a show, suitable for 'all the family' and the young one was asleep but had to be carried for an hour, in the rain I might add, before the show started. I think you should be able to hold on to the buggy until entry if the wait is that long. The show wasn't worth that wait either, Frozen celebration, if the wait is over half an hour don't bother or come back.
Loos, not that many and not inside restaurants so use one when you see one, they were largely clean and never had to wait.
Take food in with you if you can, just not full blown picnics, to save money.
Wear comfy shoes, we walked an average of 8 miles per day!
Other do's Its a small world for everyone, Ratatouille, very good but dont queue for hours, Frozen parade, fairy boat ride by casey jones train, Mickeys PhilharMagic show, Wild west show - extra cost dinner show, good themed show, live action cowboys and indians, noisy, food better than expected.
Negatives: hanging around, lack of loos, and I am afraid some, a lot, of the staff, very officious and not at all in the Disney spirit.
Possibles, Annette's Diner, good theme and reasonable food. Princess breakfast-Good for the young ones to have a photo with a couple of princesses, they come to each table and say hello and a few other cursory words and photo then gone. Not anywhere near as good as Cafe Mickey.
If you stay in one of the Disney hotels make use of the extra hour, but if you dont get in before normal opening times there is no advantage for you, no special entrance, you queue with everyone else.
We travelled via Eurostar and it worked very well, especially the express luggage service. Luggage transported from the station to hotel (not to room) and in reverse on return so you get to spend as much time as possible in the park.
Have fun.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"We visited for a day when it was Adults for the price of a child for 1 park. That was still £59.80 each.

We visited the Disneyland park and didn't think we could have time to visit the studios all in one day.

We haven't been to Disney for a long time and was looking forward to it, although going on a february day probably wasn't ideal as it was cold and started to rain a lot.

Although we still made the most of our visit, we were rather disappointed that half of the park was closed. We logged onto the disneyland paris app and it stated only 3 rides were closed, but this was more in reality. Even the princess castle was closed for the whole visit with no explanation.

When it came to finding somewhere to eat, virtually all the restaurants were closed. over 10 of them.

We managed to find the hot dog shop on main street and the food there was just poor, not very tasty and not fulfilling.

The best part of the day was the light show at the end.

They really should just do what other parks do and close in the winter to get all their maintenance done and then open when everything is open and working so visitors get the best experience, instead of just making money and leaving visitors disappointed.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We spent three days at Disneyland Paris, the holiday was worth every penny just to see the grandchildren’s faces. We stayed off site at the explorers hotel which was great for our family of nine, easy shuttle bus into the park that only took the same amount of time to get into the park as it does if staying at a hotel on site. Some queues were quite long but we expected this as it was half term, you could get fast passes on some rides which we took advantage of. The Mickey Mouse show was great, a must see and the fireworks/laser show was amazing. The Frozen show was great for the children as the characters come to life for them but we were disappointed with the wait (1 and a half hours!) with nowhere to sit whilst queuing with little ones, we felt that the park could have a least had some Disney characters milling around and some form of benches especially as they know that this show is aimed at smaller children and that you have to stand for the show once you enter the theatre! We managed to see 3 parades which were also brilliant and did get to go on a lot of the rides. You do now have to book to see Disney characters which was a change from when we last visited, although you can catch glimpses of them when they walk through the park to their allocated spots where the bookings take place.
Our last visit to Disneyland Paris was with our own children some years ago, when they were little, they came this time with their own children and thoroughly enjoyed it. We ate at the Disney Village mostly to keep costs down as the prices of the eateries in the park itself are expensive, as are the prices of gifts etc in all of the shops, we think that Disney are outpricing themselves, a lot more would buy if the prices in these shops was lowered.
Get into the park by 9.30am, the gates open at 10am and the queues then get longer! Plan your day if you can and get fast passes straight away so that you don’t have to queue so long. You can see the parades by the ‘it’s a small world’ ride if you don’t want to stand in the main square, it is less crowded. You can also take sandwiches, drinks etc into the park. We all had a great time and will definitely re-visit.

We were here all day yesterday and honestly didn’t see one ride being cleaned, we only saw one lot of hand sanitiser in our hotel and that was it! The man who served us our hot drinks actually clasped his hand over the top of the whole cup making contact with the lid.

We tried to keep washing our hands wherever we could, but all the water was freezing cold even though the taps had a red dot on them!

We have taken precautions by washing our hands frequently and using hand gel, but we appeared to be the only people who were taking the virus into consideration at all which is concerning as this is exactly the sort of place you could contract it!

The French Government have recommended extra measures be put in place, but it appears that Disneyland Paris have not!

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"finally we did it. To start, we stayed at Davy Crockett ranch. Beautiful cabins in a forest with pool, bar and other amenities. Disneyland was 10 minutes drive if that. Wonderfull place. Lots to do and to see. You need a good three days to see everything. Plan your way around the park carefully with the app and map. You will get tired. There is queue’s for everything. That’s one let down and they are long sometimes. If u are on a tight budget, trust me, everything is expensive.
If you r not staying at a Disney hotel, car park won’t be free. €30 for the day. 🤪 There is an alternative car park to the Disney one. Just google it. Always wait for the end of the day. The fireworks are just amazing. Totally worth it.
So determine what you really want to do and mapped out. Check for times in the map and how long the queue is in the app. Do it order of location. At the end of the day you will be tired but what can you do. ? Rest ....

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"I've been to theme parks around the world. Universal Studios Hollywood was the best.
We went on a family trip to Disneyland Paris with our 5 year old niece. We were really excited about the Magic Passes, especially as they give you exclusive early access to the parks from 0830 to 0930 - the ""Magic Hour"". For us, not so much. As we wandered around in the cold with an excited 5 year old, turned away from rides, blocked by rope barriers, with attraction after attraction not yet open, the disappointment set in. Eventually we gave up - there's nothing open that's worth getting there early for. This is a corporation charging for a premium experience, promising great hospitality and under-delivering over and over again. It's disingenuous at best.
There are some really good bits of Disneyland Paris. The bad bits ruin it.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Well there are plus points - very good rides (some of them), good atmosphere, nice decor, overall clean, friendly...

And then there are the bad points. it is UNBELIEVABLY crowded. The queues are 1h+ for every ride, or worse - so then you can realistically only do 4-5 rides in one full day. That's it! Bathrooms are quite dirty, which is understandable in light of the huge amount of people in the park. Expect long queues to the bathrooms as well.

Food is expensive and not very tasty - meaning not tasty at all. What most regulars do is bring sandwiches and water with them. We've done the same and I have no regrets...

All in all, with the recent price hikes for subscriptions / anual passes, it's even less appealing... I might not even return any time soon.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"My review is mainly about the staff in the parks.
I am dual nationality English/ French and speak both languages fluently so I hear and understand what they are saying.
We found the security staff at the gates arrogant, unpleasant I constantly heard them mocking people not paying attention to their jobs where they are supposed to be looking at the security scanners etc. We had to laugh when seeing some of the security patrolling the park were walking around as if they wanted to start a fight with people they had the aggressive stare on their faces they should remember where they are working. Absolute jokers !!.
Some of the employees on the rides are very dismissive to people and not helpful at all basically HORRIBLE people.
I am afraid they have not got anything on the parks in America probably would never be employed their either as they would be well below par.
So many ARROGANT people.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Beautiful and magical Disney park, with plenty of activities for children and a few great rides for adults. The best more adult oriented rides are: Star Wars Hyperspace, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones et le Temple du Peril, Phantom Manor.
The lights and fireworks show at the end of the day (in Feb we had it at 7:30pm) is not to be missed, it is trully magical.
One negative: the food is outrageously expensive, it comes in small quantities and there is a distinct lack of healthy options. One person in our party was vegan. We found two vegan options (a wrap and a salad) but again: very small and very expensive. I would recommend bringing along some packed snacks and some water.
The souvenirs are also expensive but this is to be expected. There are preety and tempting choices on offer.
There is good transport from Paris city centre (we took a dirrect train from Arc de Triomphe - it stops in other stations too - the cost is around 8 euro per person for one way).
All is all, I would recommend Disneyland Paris. A shame it is near Paris, which I don’t personally like all that much as a city.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Visited for the day last week- I have been a couple of times previously (Years ago when it was Euro Disney & in Nov 2018).
Opted for the magic-shuttle which picked us up from Opera. We did have a bit of trouble trying to figure out where the bus stop was as it isn't very clear. Instructions on the ticket - 8 place de l’Opéra (opposite the Lancel shop bus stop #95).
The stop is not opposite Lancel, it is just in front!
Once we managed to sort the bus, the journey there was pretty straight forward.
We arrived just before opening and was to be advised to be back at the bus stop for 7:45.

The parks themselves are huge so be prepared to do lots of walking! Hyperspace Mountain & The Hollywood Tower were my favourite rides.

I would advise downloading the DLP app as this will give you ride waiting times.

Pros: Hyperspace Mountain, themed events (Season of the Force), food/snack options
Cons: No fastpass for rides like Disneyworld Florida, long waiting times for certain rides (try & get to Rattatouile & Crushes Coaster as these are the longest wait), had to leave early for the bus so missed the fireworks :(

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I am literally so upset/disappointed after returning from a 4 night break. We had originally booked Florida, but due to Thomas Cook going into liquidation and the crazy hike in prices we decided to book Disney Paris with another family holiday. I, like many others have grow up with the magic of Disney. It’s a magical experience still going into the Disney Store and seeing all the merchandise with you favourite character on. This is the only good thing I have to say about Disney Land Paris. The shops are absolutely amazing. There is loads of shops, granted selling the same items but beautifully displayed in some amazing buildings. If you are looking to eat in the park it’s full of junk food, not even guilty pleasure junk food. Literally a load of rubbish, what makes it worse is the prices! 50 Euro for two “adult fast food meals” and a kids meal. Tiny portions, thrown together and the lines are just ridiculous. You wait over 30 minutes and spend another 10 looking for a seat. The queues for the rides are terrible, over an hour and a half for some without fast pass, that’s when the machines are on for fast pass. I downloaded the Disneyland app which shows which rides are on, the wait time and location. My daughter is absolutely Stitch mad and wanted to see her favourite character. We looked on the map before we left and noticed “Stitch live” was in the studios. The only other half decent ride in that park was Tower of Terror, we paid over £160 for tickets to enter the park as stupidly I thought Stitch live would be actual Stitch. We walked towards the Haunted Mansion after we completed the rest of the park, we noticed big queues in the corner and eventually noticed it was Stitch. We didn’t check “meet and greet” on the app as we already thought Stitch would be in the Studio. We approached around 4pm to be told that an app would need to be downloaded and a ticket would need to be secured. “Lineberty” never heard of it, you search Disneyland Paris and select your meet and greet. I noticed groups of teenage boys with their girlfriends who left the line, a number of other adults left and we were still not allowed access. I explained the ticket we had bought for Studios shoes Stitch live, if he’s not live why present it like this. How confusing! My daughter dressed head to toe was clearly upset and as a parent I felt awful. The staff said to wait till 5pm and see what they could do. We hung around and the lady said that she wouldn’t be able to let us in, even though you see people leave the line. A lovely lady overheard and offered us a ticket and the staff allowed us to enter. We waited around 1.5 hours in the freezing cold, but luckily we seen him. A thank you to the staff allowing us and the kindness of a stranger that saved my guilt. Please look at the app and times, apparently as soon as the app is open tickets are booked instantly. Don’t get caught out by the Studio tickets. The majority of the rides were shut, the lines were between 60-80 minutes and we went on one ride for 160 Euro. Disappointed to say the least! The magic has totally gone compared to my last visit over 15 years ago. It all seems like a money making cash cow. Security is good, armed guards and metal detectors. The free Disney Shuttle from previous comments seems to be a disaster waiting to happen. We paid 6 Euro in an Uber which was much easier. The castle is beautiful, but we for what we paid I hate Thomas Cook even more now! People are rude and arrogant, bumping into you and pushing you along. Lots of locals trying to jump the queues and pushing you. The whole trip was an expensive disaster.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Very friendly staff at both the studio and park, used the green card system for the boys which was phenomenal.

Without exception the staff were courteous and had obviously had training for guests with special needs.

At ALL shows/attractions/rides we had no issues - the only ride off limits to guests with autism is the toy story drop due to the possible issues if it breaks down.

Food on site is expensive as most people suggest - €17.00 for a burger and chips is high - solution, walk 5 mins into Disney village and use McDonald's or Starbucks for lunch......cheaper option walk to the railway station( also 5 mins) and pay UK/Ireland prices - if you do your homework it will save you money.

Would return again as it was so positive for the boys!..... Great to see a company get it 100% right!

.....a word of caution on hotel buses, look for the yellow lines on the pavement at the bus stop - this is where the doors open. There is no etiquette when getting on the buses at the end of the day. We saw 2 shoving matches between guests in 4 days and numerous rows. It gets very very busy and with buses every 20 mins you need to be mercenary with your own family and get them on quickly!.....you have been warned!

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Having previously visited the Florida park I had been warned by multiple people that Paris would not live up to my expectations as it was run down, messy and small.
I went in with low expectations but have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The park looked great on arrival and was very clean. The staff were all polite and enthusiastic and I felt the same Disney magic as Florida. Yes Disneyland as a whole is smaller but I actually enjoyed this element of it. We stopped in a Disney hotel (separate review for this) and could easily walk to both Disneyland parks and the shopping area. The train station is also right outside the park with direct links to Paris and the airport which made travelling extremely easy. If you have young children this is a great park for these reasons... you can go back to the hotel and swim/relax before heading back out for the evening shows.
I also think the castle itself is nicer than Florida, you can go inside and walk around. The parades and evening fireworks are also really good.
Travelling during the holidays the park was busy at times and some of the ride wait times are long.. During our stay this was around the same wait times as other theme parks and something I had expected. If staying in Disney make the most of the magic hours and fast passes as the rides were much easier to access.
The food is also not fantastic. Lots of fast/junk food.. not many healthy options. I found this same issue in Florida to be honest and it is one of the most frustrating things about Disney. I am aware of some people taking in their own snacks/lunches so this may be a better option if you can.
Overall I had a lot of fun and would visit again.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I had always tried to avoid mentioning this to my children (aged 11 and 13) but they eventually found out about Disneyland Paris and were begging to go. So we booked a 2-day stay. The hotel was ok (Newport Bay) and we ended up spending time at its swimming pool rather than at the park. Admittedly we were unlucky with the weather (cold and rainy) but we were not happy at all with the park. Way overcrowded: you had to queue for everything, from food to photos with Disney characters and then for the attractions, when they were not closed for technical reasons - which in some cases we suspect were not really technical reasons but staffing/shift problems. Basically our feeling is that they stack as many people as possible, give them as little service as possible (but always with kindness and big smiles) and make them wonder around as much as possible so they spend time walking between places instead of at attractions (why is there no direct passage between Disneyland and Disney Studios - it only allowed for staff? Why can't you book your attraction-specific fastpass through the app rather than having to go to the attraction itself?). There are too many souvenir shops, but then people do go a little overboard with Mickey Mouse headbands and other ridiculous props they only dare to wear there. But strangely enough, there is no queue at the tills... that they can manage.
On the attractions side, they are mostly for younger kids with patient parents (up to 2 h queues on a cold and wet February day!) or crazy ones that even adults may prefer to avoid (in my case for instance, rollercoasters in the dark make me seasick) - but it is not even easy to have the information as to what the ride is actually about, Couldn't that be included in their app ? The queuing time is indeed in the app and is very discouraging, while the fatspass time is not in the app so when you walk to a place to get a fastpass you have no idea for when you can expect it unitl you're right there already, and then maybe it is not available at all anymore.
Basically, I will never set foot there again for sure, there are far better amusement parks where you can actually have fun and avoid the Disney scam.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Disneyland Paris is the most beautiful theme park I've ever seen. Every land in the park has a consistent theme and look. There are some great rides, like Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. There are plenty of rides for the whole family as well. The walk-through attractions are delightful - the Alice in Wonderland Maze, the Nautilus, and the play area in Adventureland are great fun. And don't miss the dragon in the cavern below the castle - it's one of the best things in the park. The night-time fireworks show is outstanding!

The food in this theme park is disappointing. A lot of the fast food options really are just burgers and fries. Also, many of the food options inside the theme park close surprisingly early. Go for the rides and theming, not the food.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"The first time we as a family of 2 adults and 4 children visited Disney Paris in May we had the most amazing time (stayed at Davey Crockett). The whole place was buzzing, clean and vibrant with very few long queues to get on the rides.

Holidaying to Disney is not a cheap affair but we felt the first time it was well worth it. Kids had multiple goes on their favourite rides, epic!

How disappointed we were with our second visit in Feb half term 2020. Unbeknown to us did we hadn't realised it was the French school holidays too. Queues were 3 hours long on some of the most popular rides. It was a dreadful experience and we all wanted to be somewhere else. OK, to be fair with the rides... they were worth the wait FOR A SPLIT SECOND afterwards but once you finished your adrenaline rush the high was well and truly over. The thought of standing bored for another couple of hours was far too much to bear. In total, we managed to get on 5 rides over TWO days. Great value for money at £300 per ride!!!!

It was mid-Feb, the sun wasn't shining but the place looked run down. In my mind I was thinking about the Florida Disney and it started to become clear why many of my friends would rave about the US version of Disney. Would we go back to Paris? We love Paris! But spend close to 3k on 4 nights accommodation and 2-day park tickets again? Probably not. We stayed at Villages Nature and that is another review on its own. Awful place, if you like the UK Centerparcs you will not like staying in the Disney version.

In a nutshell, we didn't feel we got value for money. If we had spent a few hundred pounds fair enough, it's Disney. But at 3k per family for 4 days - would rather holiday somewhere sunny abroad and have total relaxation... with no queuing!

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"This was my first time in any Disneyland park after growing up on Disney and it was everything I could have wanted. Yes, the lines are long, some moving faster than others, but that's to be expected. The rides were worth it though. We stayed from open to close (roughly) and were able to go on the major rides we wanted. Fast Pass in the future might be worth it just for the opportunity to possibly go on more. I really enjoyed my time and was sad to leave.

Also, if you're visiting Disneyland, I would suggest staying in Val d'Europe. It wasn't busy at all even though it was UK half term and there were good restaurants nearby. The trip to Disneyland was maybe 5 mins, if that!

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"We went in February half term. My advice is to go at the beginning of the week and not the end and you will need a few days in the park at least not because it is massive, but because the queue lines are very long. There’s a few rides which have a free fast pass and that’s it. You would need to pay a lot extra to queue jump on the paid fast passes making your expensive trip even more. There’s also not much in the queue lines to entertain the kids!

There are a few characters jotted around the park including a Disney princess pavilion and a Mickey house where you can queue to meet and greet them other than that all the other character meet and greets are on a first come first served App which never works and instantly runs out of time slots for the whole day within 10 seconds making it really disappointing for young children seeing the characters but never being able to cuddle them, everyone was moaning in the park about this and it was a big problem. Everyone in our group got on the app to book a time slot and never got anything.

We found 2 other options for seeing the main characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Pluto. Stay in the Disney hotels as they have a meet n greet the characters in there lobby’s from 8.15-11 every morning and tbh you can probably just walk into them without staying there! or do a character dining experience. We did all including the explorers restaurant- this restaurant was more of a fine dining Buffet and didn’t really have much for the kids and was the most expensive option. £75 per adult I think and alittle cheaper for kids so really not worth the money in my opinion. The characters did come round and do autographs and photos but only around 3 times so if you were queuing for the buffet you could actually miss them and they don’t come back. The restaurant however was smaller.

The other character dining experience we did was the Mickey cafe. This place had more of a child friendly menu and I would recommend booking the late dinner option after the fireworks in the park. This place at that time was less busy so the characters came round each table a lot more and made it more of a personal experience rather than explorers.

It was a good time of year, pretty quiet and queues not too long. Loved Space Mountain!! Whilst it was excellent, it was overpriced in the park. 3 hotdogs, 1 chicken nuggets and a Fanta to share cost €43! Pack plenty of snacks and drinks. 1x50cl Bottle of water was more than a pack of 6x1ltr bottles in Val De Europe. Frozen dress was about €80, looks the same as our £16 one from Sainsburys!!! We did have a great time and look forward to going back. Recommend a push chair if you have 3/4year old!! Other than the prices, I think there needs to be more toilets.

It's a small world was also a highlight of our trip, and thunder mountain was great as well. However, the prices are ridiculous. All shops on-site are overpriced, and the items are typically of low-quality.
Food was also an issue. Everywhere had massive queues, which shouldn't be right considering the prices of food. Vegetarian food was also difficult to find. That was certainly a disappointment, but it shouldn't ruin the trip. I'd definitely recommend bringing snacks if you are planning on spending a whole day in the parks.
Another disappointment was the haunted mansion ride. It was terrible- DO NOT GO ON THIS RIDE IF YOU HAVE CLAUSTROPHOBIA! There were too many people crammed into one small room, and it felt impossible to breathe. It felt like they were just trying to put as many people through as they possibly could at once. It wasn't good, especially if you have sensory issues.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"My party of 4 adults and 2 children have just returned from 7 days in France, we had a 4 day hopper pass for Disneyland costing over £1000. During our stay we met one character due to the queue times and reservations you now have to make to meet them. We were basically faced with a choice of paying to queue and meet the limited characters now available or go on the rides. We attempted to queue to see my daughters favourite character ‘stitch’ to be shouted at by one of the staff members because we didn’t have a reservation. When we asked how we make a reservation we were told ‘it’s finished for the day, you can’t meet him’. This left my daughter upset and us without anyway of getting to meet the character she came to see. The same staff member then shouted at us and told us he was getting security because we had walked the wrong way round to join a queue (we joined the back of the line). My children were incredibly upset and thought security would arrest us and remove us from the park. Aside from the one character we met, the staff are incredibly rude and remove all magic of the park with their miserable faces and bad attitudes. The queue times for all rides are incredibly long, averaging 100mins and we managed to get on 3-4 rides per day. We are great full we had the 4 day pass for this reason. They appear to have no maximum limit to the amount of people they allow into the park. I remember visiting when I was younger and experiencing the magic. I wanted to emulate this for my children. Unfortunately this is now just a theme park and all the magic and the joy of meeting characters has been removed. What an expensive disappointment! My children’s autograph book has one sorry looking Pluto autograph inside! Will not be returning.

The park....The queue to get in was long, between security and ticket barriers we took about 39-40 minutes, often caused by poorly printed online tickets. Once we we didn’t focus on the big rides and just wandered, it’s easy to miss some tiny magical things such as;

The man carving (taking 2 hours) watermelons into disney characters, Swiss family Robinson island and The Nautilus. All small details but what makes the park a bit special.

The bad bits...very busy and long queues, all food stalls open in the studio but half shut in the main park meaning a 30 minute queue for a drink (why not move some staff over). A lot of bits boarded off for maintenance

The exceptional bit....our son got poorly and we needed both a doctor and first aid, the staff, first aid post and hotel were wonderful, it really helped

Overall, if you want rides then expect some serious queues but just wandering was great (if expensive)

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Just come back from DLP. Having been to Orlando a couple of times the I thought the Disney banner would have more of an impact on the park. Whilst I can’t say anything is bad I can’t find one thing the made me go wow apart from the prices. They made it captive and you basically have to go to the massively overpriced restaurants. Queues are way to long due to the lack of rides/attractions. My advice would be to save the extra money needed to trip across to America and enjoy the real magic of Disney. Think the rip off prices and lack of service put a dampener on my trip. Proves a point when people are eating packed lunches whilst in the queues for the rides.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"After months of being on Facebook pages, asking questions, buying the ears, teddies and personalised hoodies and water bottles, the time came for me to take my 5 year old son on our first trip abroad together. I've tried to think of the must know Things that will help a first timer so here goes...
Got the best deal through magic breaks, even independent travel agent couldn't match it. I opted for the private transfer but although it was easy getting to the hotel they left me and my son stranded on the return journey so we had to jump on the magic shuttle which was a third of the price and almost empty. I'd definitely think about using magic shuttle next time.
Stayed at Santa Fe. Loved it. Shuttle bus to and from the park is literally minutes and never had a problem getting one, even as everyone left when the park closed.
Had standard meal plan but as my son was so overly excited and I was worried about him we didn't make full use of the all you can eat buffet which was a shame. We booked online using links. The dlp guide gives a list of where you can book with what meal plan. You can book 2 months in advance. Loved La Cantina in Santa Fe and Plaza gardens. Think carefully about timings as there are the parades and fireworks to take into consideration.
If staying in a Disney hotel you get a magic pass which has your park entry and meal/event bookings on so don't lose them.
Magic Hours are a must, hardly any queues to get in then head straight for the most popular rides before the park opens.
Our 1st day we arrived at lunch and queue to get through security was 20 minutes then another 20 minutes to get into the park which set the tone for the rest of the day...queues, queues and more queues (this is February half term, not bad in term time). Yes you can get fast passes for some rides but you have to queue for those then keep yourself busy til your time and head back to stand in a shorter queue. Made more sense to just go to the popular rides in the magic hours.
Absolute favourite things was the inventions restaurant meet and greet lunch, saw 5 characters in 30 mins, unlike the park where you have to queue for 1. Get a programme or use the app to see the frozen parade, main parade and illimuniations. Be warned, they will cancel in bad weather so don't put it off.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Negatives- If you like to queue then this is certainly the place to go. It's not just the queue for rides, but then the toilets, restaurants, shows, food, drinks and the entrance too and from each park. Also the water fountains were all turned off outside the toilets and around the park. We managed to find two which worked and we refilled our bottles there, but very poor for such an expensive day out. Don't provide any if you want to turn them off.

Positives: I was really pleased with the free fast pass for some rides offered every two hours. This helped us organise our day to go on the smaller rides first while waiting for the larger rides. We also had entry to the park 2 hours before it opened so we actually never queued more than 30 mins for any ride over the 4 days.
It was very clean and very friendly all the staff around the park. The app was accurate for times to wait for the rides too. Maybe the app should be easier to follow for things happening throughout the day like parades and times of shows.
I was shocked that the rides for 1.2m were suitable for 5 year old children. I never knew what to expect, but my son was desperate to go on the rides and hit the height, but regretted it straight after. However, my daughter at 7 years did enjoy the ride. So maybe the age needs to be addressed with the height.
Most of the fast rollercoaster were in the dark, which to be honest was scarey and has put me off travelling to Florida until the kids can go solo on the rides.

Overall the park was easy to navigate and well organised. Take plenty of water, food/snacks hats, gloves, scarfs and sunglasses as it was sunny but cold. Download the app to help you and get fast pass tickets every two hours instead of queueing.

The retail was an overkill. I know they make more money on merchandise, but shops are everywhere selling overpriced Disney stuff. Make sure you get your Disney wears Primary before you go, take dressing up clothes and Disney teddies to save your children asking for more once your there. Take cheap ponchos too if it rains.

Would I return? No, but only because I've seen it all now, nothing left to see unless they created a new whole area.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"During our recent trip to Disneyland Paris my 9 year old granddaughter (and us) were horrified at the amount of single use plastic being used throughout the park; lunch served on plastic plates, with plastic cutlery wrapped in plastic bags, plastic water and drinks bottles.... and so it went on - only one bin to dispose of waste after lunch - no recycling facilities and whilst there may have been points to refill water bottles we never found them..... could it be Disney that you're more interested in your profits than the planet?!!

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Went with 8 and 12 year old. 3rd visit. Due to refurbishment less rides so more queues. Very poorly organised. After security no discernable queing system so took an hour to get into studio. Food queues were appalling. Twice we were behind people who had problems with vouchers. Instead of taking them aside and dealing with the issues so others could be served we waited forabout half an hour to be served. Fast food?

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"The parks are lovely, close together and great to walk around, which is what you will be doing 95% of the time given the horrendous queues at the most popular rides. These are even worse at the moment as many main rides such as Studio Tour, Rock and Roll Coaster, Buzz Lightyear, are all closed for refurb and various others broke down or were closed due to the weather.

So download the app to see waiting times, then try and plan your day around the queue length. Typically 85 mins plus on main rides all day and 30 minutes on smaller rides., so expect to do 2 or 3 main rides in a day.

Twilight entry for hotel stay offers zero benefit as they don't open enough security points or turnstiles at 8.00am - 9,30am to cope, so all you do is queue at 8.30am rather than park opening time at 10.00am.

Once inside, few characters about, again large queues to meet them, and the Disney magic is trumped by Disney retail.

You'll need to go for 2-3 days to do it all, not because of size of parks but because there are so few rides open.

Still, once you get on them they are great, shows are good and nightly light and firework display is incredible

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"We were a family group of 15 which included children aged 3,4 & 7. The waits for the rides were ridiculous and that was in February! You can't possibly expect young children to wait in line for 60 minutes (as was the Dumbo ride) and then just have a few minutes on the ride. The place was very clean with staff walking around with long handled dustpans and brushes cleaning up what people had thrown down rather than put in bins. There were shops and eateries everywhere but not that many rides. We stayed in one of the on-site hotels so had a 'magic' pass which allows you into the park before it opens at 10 a.m. However, you need to go in between 8.30 and 9.30. We did that once and there were very few rides open! Those that were had a 40 minute wait, so no advantage to going early. If you can afford a 'fast pass' it might be better, but don't rely on that as some of those queues were long as well. Everything very expensive, but I expected that. Once you are in the park there is no need to spend money unless you want to (take your lunch in with you). I'm sure you will spend some though as the children will want something from the many shops. I wouldn't bother to go again. Be prepared for a great deal of walking and queuing.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"For anyone who has been to the Orlando Disney, this place is not well run and not worth the time. Our pre-purchase tickets did not register and it took 45 minutes just to get to the front of the Guest Relations line. Everyone on that line was so angry before even entering the park.

Not only that, several of the Fast Pass rides were not working properly the day we visited. With the limited options on the Fast Pass to begin with, it was not worth it.

Both parks are extremely small. There isn't much to do or see.

If you live in Europe and need to be in a Disney Park, this is your only option. For those from the U.S., it's a frustrating experience and a weak facsimile.

One of the days we spend 10 hours in the park and only got on 4 rides because of the queues. The rides are nothing special and we didn't meet micky are any other cast or princess. I will say the illmations was magical the castle coming alive at night was unbelievable but the money we spend for the under advarage experience was not worth it. The food was so bad cheep crap you wouldn't give to your dog being charged over 100euro for a family. Go on a beach holiday 4 times in 1 year for the same price as a few days at disneyland paris. Staff are friendly but you will come away feeling robed.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"First time in Disney 2 adults, 1 teen, 1 child. Arrived with no expectations however believed it to be Amazing, magical, overwhelming etc the full Disney experience however in reality it is an overpriced underwhelming money pit with a Disney stamp.
Entrance fee for 4 is over a weeks wage alone.
The rides were nothing special and have been on better in normal theme parks. The park is over ran with repetitive shops and crep stalls. Fast passes end approx 2pm so pointless and ride Qs are approx 60 mins plus so get very little done if you go on 2/3 rides. Little to no characters walking around the park where is the Disney magic?
The only real Disney feel is in the stores which were way to expensive and can buy cheaper elsewhere.
I wouldn’t return for free and can’t understand how people go for 4/5 days.
The parade obviously has had a lot of effort put into it - if I can’t actually find a space to watch it!
The hype is better than the reality.
The best part of the day was a picture infront of the castle. There really isn’t that much to do or see!

The worst being the Indiana Jones ride which quoted a 45 minute wait on the app which was actually about 75 minutes. This was completely unnecessary and was due to the fact the Disney employees insisted on allowing every person with a fast pass on before people in the regular queue. The rides themselves were thoroughly enjoyable but the queues will be my lasting impression of Disneyland Paris, I understand people pay extra for fast passes but the system definitely needs a rethink.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Day1; Disney Parc with pre purchased fast pass ;
Having wavered over the purchase of the expensive fast pass option for day 1 of our 2 day euro disney visit we were so pleased we had bought them: although you can get free fast passes at the attractions they are limited both in supply and when you can use them. Our fast passes enabled us to do everything in the Parc at our own pace and to get round comfortably. The only down side was that the purchased fast pass covered both the Parc and the studios but we had opted to purchase tickets for each separately so couldn’t use the fast pass on day 2 at the studios - something that isn’t made clear on purchase.
Our granddaughter had a brilliant time - the more terrifying the ride the better she liked it (she’s 9!) and we loved seeing her so happy. The light show at the end of the day was a wonderful finale.

Day 2. Studios
By now we’d worked out the free fast pass system so managed to get them for Ratatouille and Tower of Terror: Crush already had a 90 minute wait time when the park opened so we didn’t bother with that (no fast pass option).
Our granddaughter enjoyed meeting Mickey and the various shows (Frozen and stunt show) and again loved the scary rides.

At both the Parc and the studios there seemed to be a shortage of places to sit and have a snack or coffee break but I guess that’s deliberate to keep you moving (and spending!).

We had a good meal in the steak restaurant opposite the steam ship in the Parc - be warned, if you want to eat you need to make reservations well ahead of time for popular restaurants - don’t leave it until you get there as most places were fully booked.

Don’t expect to do Eurodisney on a budget - everything is expensive - and personally I wouldn’t take very young children as they wouldn’t get the most out of it - we saw lots of young children fast asleep in buggies - I think they need to be at least 7 to really enjoy it but that’s a personal opinion...

We had a genie pass so we could skip the queues. I personally wouldn’t recommend coming to Disney without a fast pass as some of the ride queues were 70 mins. I can’t imagine you will experience many rides in a day without fast pass. And waiting so long takes all the fun out of it. We did the buffalo bills Wild West show which was really fun and the food was nice. I felt sorry for the poor guy in the ice cream shop. A queue out the door all day and he is the only one serving. I don’t understand why there isn’t more staff to serve customers so your queuing about 40 mins just to get an ice cream. We also did the princess dinner which I would not recommend to anyone. The restaurant is dark and dingy nothing special about it at all. We had been there 1 and a half hours and had still only been served our starter. It cost 244 euros for 2 adults and 2 kids and the food was terrible and hardly any choice. Especially not for kids. And the whole time we were there only 1 princess came to our table. As this was a make a wish trip I wanted it to be really special for my girl but it was terrible and we couldn’t wait to get out of there. Other than that the place is magical and amazing :)

If ur into rollercoasters or big rides and an adult... STOP.... dont go....Alton Towers is better!

There r only 3 coster rides...Alton Towers has 8/9 (depends if u want to call oblivion a rollercoaster or not). Star wars hyper space mountain is the best ride there but that's not saying much.

Avoid the star wars port...we queued for 45mins only to find out it was a photo opp with a guy in a poor darth vader costume. There r no signs to say what it is and from the outside looks like a ride.

Go to the theatre experience round the corner instead the 4d is great.

That said if u have young children they will love it...the whole place seemed designed for younger people...not just a zone... but the whole place.. which is a shame as there were more adults then children there.

On a positive ending the closing light/music/firework show was brilliant and well worth staying for.

In short unless u have pre teen children...The €60 entrance fee and €30 parking fee are not worth the lack of rides.

It's a superb place to spend time with young children who will love the experience, we took our three year old for his birthday. I spent the four days savouring his enjoyment which will be permanently be etched into my brain.

We have now been twice with him, once in June 2019 and now this second trip. Both times we've stayed at one of the Disney hotels, they're absolutely fine and I'd say the meal plans are we worth the money as well.

The only problem is some of the adults traveling without children who seem to forget that the characters are from children's films. They'll spend a huge amount of time getting photographs with characters with numerous different poses. Get a life, it's a spotty, grumpy French kid in a suit who probably doesn't want you touching them. Leave it to the kids and grow up.

We took an elderly disabled family member that uses a wheelchair, and we had no problems with it for the first two days. On the last day we were escorted to the ‘disabled’ entrance at one of the attractions but there is no way a wheelchair could get safely into the building. My family member was severely hurt while trying to get into the building which resulted in us spending the whole day at a hospital in Paris. The wheelchair used was her own from home and through the years of her using it, nothing like this had ever happened before. It has been over two months since the accident and she is not every close to being healed, even though she has had numerous doctors and hospital appointments since. I wrote to Disneyland to tell them they need to re look at the entrance way as it is not accessible to wheelchairs, but all I got back was a letter saying ‘they are not taking any responsibility’. No apology. I think this is absolutely disgusting and not something I would associate with Disney’s customer service. I love Disneyland but I will never be returning to Disneyland Paris as it is in no way ‘real’ Disney. All we wanted was to warn them so it will not happen to everyone else, and hopefully an apology as it was their fault, but we got an arrogant letter back which upset my elderly relative.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"I have been to all Disney parks and always very much enjoy the atmosphere and the kindness from the staff unfortunately this time was not the same I was bringing my wife here, it was her first time and her birthday so I wanted to show her the magical experience that Disney has to offer

When we arrived we waited in the admissions que for a about 20mins, this was okey but when we got up to the desk the lady behind the glass kept us there for about 30 minutes looking like it was her first day she called over many other staff to help but in the end she said they couldn’t find our booking!? and now we had to go over to another desk that might be able to help (she very much didn’t seem to care and was just pawing is off to another desk as she couldn’t fix the issue)

As we went over to the area she told us to go (line 11) we were meet with another 30 minute que and another rude man behind the glass who also couldn’t find our booking for about 20mins? by the looks of things at the end he just gave up looking and printed us off to tickets making us feel like it was our faults and made sure to say we needed to leave at 7pm no later even tho we waisted nearly 2hours for them just to print out our tickets I taught he could have dealt with this a lot better

(me and my wife were pleasant though out this whole ordeal as there were families around and I didn’t want to cause a big deal even tho I was upset with the service, I think also that nor me or my wife spoke very good french they didn’t like this)

Also these tickets are deceiving as when you purchase these tickets it said on the ticket skip the line witch make make the costumer believe It entitles you to a fast pass and can skip the que for the rides this is not the case as we didn’t skip any que for the whole time we were there
(I would recommend to explain this better when purchasing your tickets and give the option of buying a fast pass also as if I had known skip the Que means nothing I would have bought fast passes for us both

Other then this and that it was a bit windy they cancelled the show on the main street and there were a few rides closed down due to maintenance it was everything else expected to be I still do love this place and will come back again but for the journey I have to give it a low rating mainly for the admissions staff thus was unfair as it was not our faults and because if that they probably should have reconciled it by just giving us the fast passes as we had to wait so long

I had work in the service industry for over 17 years and I know a bit about customer service and Disney should be the A+ of what service means! that's the only reason why I am writing this and giving this experience a low rating

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Peeling paint, the same merchandise in every store and not much to do. Other theme parks around the world are actually a lot better that I've been to, simply because they have to be better. Other theme parks can't just rely on people's emotional attachment to disney characters in order to earn money. Problems:

1) The paint is fading all over the place. The park really needed a revamp and attention to detail. I was shocked at this poor effort.

2) 200 euro deposit for a wheelchair. The staff didn't warn us that this deposit won't be returned straight away, although the money was taken straight away out of our account. If this deposit money is from your holiday funds, be careful. I didn't have documentation on me in order to get the access card to skip the queues either, so had to leave my wheelchair with the buggies out in the open. I didn't feel comfortable leaving my 200 deposit unlocked and easy to steal like that.

3) Same shops in so many locations. I was so exited for the shopping, but quickly realised pretty much all the shops sell the same things. Seemed more of a money-making focus at this park rather than an actual good experience.

4) No working water fountains despite them being everywhere.

5) Not much to do to be honest. We spent a lot of time wandering around or sitting on the floor because all the places to sit and eat/drink were constantly full. The park needs less shops and more rides/activities.

6) So expensive. The merch, the food, the drinks...I couldn't believe it. A pair of Mickey ears to wear were about 20 euors, and pretty much everyone had bought some. I couldn't fathom how much money disney makes seeing that. A keyring was 8 euros, shirts ranged from 25-65 euros....you get the picture.

7) The castle and park gives the illusion it's big and magical, but illusion is the key word here. I've been to a theme park abroad that has an actual pink castle, and it was absolutely huge compared to Disney's small scale-model castle. Lots of illusions throughout the park and little actual amazement.

8) Repetitive music around the whole park. I expected disney songs and such, but it was just some background generic music. This seemed a bit weird and not very disney. I don't feel like I saw a lot of references to the old or new disney films throughout my stay. It's all quite underwhelming.

In the end, me and my partner just tried to wait for the firework show which was pretty boring. We only watched the first 10-15 minutes because of the giant crowd there, we decided we had to leave early otherwise the metro would be an absolute herd of mayhem. We just felt uncomfortable and disappointed with the experience, and have decided other theme parks who put in more effort are so much better. We got very cheap tickets at about £40 each which I feel good about. I would never, ever pay the price that Disney ask for during normal or peak times (£100 and up.) It's not worth it. Go to another theme park that has more activities and rides for the money.

Has anyone else had a similar experience.??",Feb 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Could not recommend Disneyland Paris more! I hadn’t been to a Disney park before but I had a lot of expectations of what it would be like; Disneyland Paris exceeded them. It was such a magical day, and I would go back in and do it all over again.

Myself and a friend (both in our twenties) travelled together from central Paris. The park opened at 10am, and we took the RER A train from Châtelet–Les Halles at about 8:30am, and arrived at 9:30am. We took the same train home at approximately 11:45pm after the fireworks. We had difficulty, along with hundreds of other people, getting back into central Paris because of train maintenance on the RER A line, but after a bit of walking and swapping trains, we made it home at about 1am.

We booked our tickets in April for an August visit. We got tickets that allowed us into both Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney Studios on the same day. We spent the majority of our time in Disneyland Paris, but could come and go between the parks when we liked (just don’t lose your ticket!) Disneyland Paris had a Jungle Book and the Lion King theme while we were there, and there were performances throughout the day. We found having the Disneyland Paris app on our phones helpful because we could see what performances were on without having to wander around.

My friend and I weren’t fussed about going on all the rides and attractions at the parks, but if you were, I wouldn’t recommend doing both parks in one day. We managed to do a meet and greet with Pooh Bear, Alice’s Curious Labyrinth, the Mad Hatter’s tea cups, Phantom Manor, and Big Thunder Mountain. The main parade, Disney Stars On Parade, was amazing. We sat down on Main Street early to get a good spot and it was really worth it. The same goes for the fireworks, Disney Illuminations, at the end of the night. The fire works start at 11pm, but people were starting to sit down near the castle to get a good view at approximately 8:30-9pm. It was definitely worth the wait, and it was a highlight of the whole day.

There were plenty of places to eat and shop, and again, having the app made it helpful to see when things were closing as the park started to shut down. A lot of things close at 8pm even though the park is open until 11pm. Definitely make a plan before you go of the things you really don’t want to miss out on. If you only have a day, it would be difficult to try and do everything the park has to offer.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"WHEN your dessert sprouts horns, don’t be afraid, it’s only Halloween dinner, Disney style.

It looked like a bit of melted Angelina Jolie, but the magnificent Maleficent cake tasted lovely – squidgy and fruity – and those horns were intense, dark chocolate.

This was one of many limited-edition, quirky eats on offer durning the spooky season. There was also an immense chocolate sponge with a pumpkin centre, an Ursula vanilla doughnut with tentacled icing, and burgers in yucky black and toxic-green buns. Those bad boys were way too scary, even for me!
We were back in the Paris parks after a 10-year- gap and it was just as much fun now our girls, teens, as it was when they were toddlers. In fact, more so, because this time they could ride everything. And they did.

Yet, there was a fly in the fun ointment; it was way busier than the old days (even though we often went during half term), so the lines were long and the service slow at times. We queued a lot for just about everything, even the toilets – especially the toilets – and always an hour or more for most rides, unless we had a FastPass.

On the subject of which. We’ve been spoiled by Walt Disney World, Orlando. Here’s why.

In Paris you only have ONE FastPass at a time. To get it, you head to your chosen ride, grab the ticket (usually only offering a time slot at least an hour sometimes hours later). You can’t have another FP until that’s been used so you must queue for all other rides while we airing for your slot. Only then can you select another FP and you’ll have to trudge over to the entrance of whatever ride it’s for – often in another land/park – and by then wait times have soared.

In WDW Florida, your Magicband electronically holds THREE Fastpasses – pre-booked online at times to suit. They can be changed, cancelled, swapped on the go. Once you’ve used all three, just add more, one at a time all day, using the parks app. Easy.

DLP please take note and modernise your system!i

That said, the rest was great fun and the Disney magic is still alive and sparkling.

We stayed at Newport Bay Club, same as on our last visit, and it was beautiful. 10-minute stroll from Village and parks, nice vibe, good service and a cool theme. Our 6th-floor room was dated but comfy and spacious, it didn’t matter at all.

In the parks Halloween was in full fright mode. Pumpkins, skeletons and ghosts everywhere, some staff joined in too with sudden leap-outs, wild cackles and the odd sinister stare. The reactions (including ours) were hilarious.

All the characters at ‘meets’, parades, etc. were dressed for hallowe’en and there were lots of bad guys – green-faced Maleficent, Jack Skellington, Captain Hook and co.

The actual Ratatouille ride is so sweet. Not scary, but fun and really cute with clever effects.

The Mountains – Big Thunder and Space were better than we remembered, BTM felt longer and scarier than its Orlando cousin. Hollywood Tower (my absolute favourite) was amazing. It has more plummets than the US one and is definitely more hardcore, but the lead in is short and we missed the long build up.

Toystoryland was happy and colourful, but the rides a bit tame for us. Pirates of the Caribbean was awesome after its refurb and the animatronics looked so realistic. I swear some were real people …spooky.

Snow White, Pinocchio, Peter Pan – all as magical as ever and the teens were immediately transported back to when they were little the minute they got on board Small World.

It was butt-freezing, it was windy. And rainy. It was heaving, the queues were too long and peoples’ tempers too short, but we loved every second and tears in our eyes that blurred the fireworks on our last night.

We’ll be back ….

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,Wow what a disappointment! Not magical in the slightest and MASSIVELY over priced the park seemed dated and small sadly it was so busy you could hardly move.,Dec 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"My last visit to a Disney resort was Disneyworld (Florida) in 2016, for 9 days in January. It was great and I had a really wonderful time, but I had heard really bad stories about DLP. For years I played with the idea of maybe checking DLP out, but the idea of standing around in cold Parisian weather was frightening to me. I put a lot of stock into the bad reviews on this site and others, and things that British newspapers had said. After the park-wide refurbishment in 2017, I decided that I would visit.

My first visit was in 2019, and I bought an annual pass. I stayed for 4 days in September, and then 4 days in January. I want to write this review to help people who are maybe in my position and are looking for something less Cult of Disney.

Pros:

1. This is the most beautiful of the Disney Parks I've visited - the 4 in Florida and the 2 in Paris. It's absolutely stunning and full of tiny decorative flourishes that are easy to miss but breathtaking if you take the time to notice them. The Coca-Cola advertisement and Gibson Girl signage on Main Street, or the Captain Nemo/Nautilus 'N' on the bridge next to Space Mountain are two little examples. Sleeping Beauty Castle itself is addictive to look at. Big Thunder Mountain is the same. Space Mountain is an absolute dream come true for anyone who cares about Jules Verne or steampunk aesthetic or anything like that. It's stunning and dreamlike and whimsical. The layout of the park itself is also incredibly organic and simple to understand.

2. Some restaurants/cafes have decent food, but prices can add up for families. Cowboy Cookout served really nice barbecue food in September (half rack of ribs, smoked sausage, chicken leg and chips in barbecue sauce) at around £15 with a large fountain drink and a small dessert. Considering the nearby McDonalds is about £10 for a large meal, this was fair enough and convenient. Fuente Del Oro is also decent and serves tex-mex food, Fajitas and Rice etc. All restaurants have their menus available in the Disneyland Paris app, so if you have a look before you go you can jot down some ideas for places to eat. Victoria's Homestyle Cooking is a little tearoom overlooking the castle and next to Discovery Arcade. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's about £4.50 for a hot chocolate there, it's up to you how you feel about that price. Essentially it's possible to eat and drink nice things, and not be surrounded by chips and burgers constantly, but it can be costly. There are also water fountains everywhere, so here's a tip: bring a flask and some of those little squeeze bottles of squash.

3. Frontierland at DLP is the best and most consistently themed area of the Disney Parks I've visited. There are two key attractions that tell an interwoven storyline that fleshes out the surrounding area, and some of the merchandising reflects this story. It rewards those who pay attention to it, and the atmosphere of the area is wonderful. Big Thunder Mountain at night is in an experience you must have - and should probably be your first time on the coaster. At night when the mountain is illuminated it's stunning, and all the twists and turns feel faster and more impactful. I never appreciated this coaster until I decided to ride it at night on a whim, and it became one of my favourite experiences.

4. Several of the rides are better here than they are in Magic Kingdom (the Disneyland style park in Disneyworld). Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pan's Flight, Phantom Manor (my favourite ride - probably ever), Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Autopia, It's a Small World, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters. There are also a couple of unique rides that are great, Crush's Coaster and Le Pays des Contes de Fees are my favourite amongst those.

5. The parade is great, there's a good amount of floats and the performers have amazing timing (a real issue for some of the parks...the dancing can be horrendously offbeat). The costumes are always really nice and well constructed, and the performances are quite elaborate. There's usually also some seasonal mid-day smaller parade that's also a lot of fun if a bit shorter. The fireworks are also really good and I think the same show has also been adapted to other parks due to it's success.

6. The resort is so accessible. If you stay in Val d'Europe you can get a £4.50 uber ride, which can be cheaper than the RER (5 min walk) depending on your party size. If you stay pretty much anywhere though, you'll be able to get to the parks easily. You cannot beat the accessibility of a contemporary European city in terms of quality of life. Being able to stop by at a supermarket and pick up pastries and drinks is so convenient and not something you can really have while staying in Disneyworld. You have to drive for miles to get anywhere there, and it feels very isolated and sort of psychologically manipulative.

Cons:

1. Disney Studios. This park is awful. It's just terrible. It houses two great rides, Tower of Terror and Crush's Coaster, but even when it wasn't half closed for refurbishment it had very little going on. The design of the place is a nightmare. It's unbelievably badly concieved. If you want to go to the Ratatouille ride or the Toy Story land you have to walk through all these little ugly snakey path ways with no sightlines or anything like that. It should not be ticketed as a seperate park and probably should be connected by path to Disneyland Parc (glad it's not though, it would be a blemish on the design of that park). It is very easy to get to though, you can freely hop between both parks with a 5 minute walk. It's just ugly and shouldn't exist. The theming is also terrible - a studio? Giant bland lots with no features? Tower of Terror is themed beautifully and so is Ratatouille but really the whole place sucks. The good news is that Disney Studios is the centre of a 2 billion euro development, adding three new 'lands', a Marvel area with two rides, a Frozen area with one ride, and a Star Wars area.

2. Hyperspace Mountain. Many of you will have no problems with this, some of you will even consider it a benefit, but for a few years now Space Mountain has been overlayed with a Star Wars attraction. That means no more beautifully lit asteroids, no more passing through an asteroid, no more From the Earth to the Moon, no more Columbiad Cannon, no more Jules Verne. This makes no sense as the exterior of the ride is still the same stunning building, and is visually the least Star Wars thing ever. There are no plans to rescue the ride as far as I know.

3. You may be put off by the staff if you believe that Disney employees are obligated to possess a supernaturally happy demeanour. The staff here are all regular people, they are not constantly smiling - but they are more than happy to help you with queries. Every staff member I encountered was polite and spoke English with me. Side note - the staff in Florida are not 'always smiling!' or 'always going the extra mile for you!' this myth is absurd and confuses me - they are also normal people. Most of them are teenagers/uni students. I don't understand how this belief started but there's very little to back it up. In any case you should be happy to see people in a constant state of bemusement! It's France! It's part of the culture!

4. The weather can be nightmarish. In January I saw a little girl crying in Fantasyland because it was freezing and very windy with rain. The crowds were also at roughly the same level they were in September, so I would urge you to just go in late September to early October. The weather was literally prohibitive.

Anyway, if you've read all of this I want to thank you for your patience. Disneyland Paris is unique and beautiful, with a lot to offer to people of all ages. It cannot compete with the scale of Disneyworld, but scale is not always an indicator of the quality of your experience. It's not possible to visit Disneyworld from the UK with the same budget that it's possible to visit Disneyland Paris. You'll also find roughly the same selection of rides and entertainment for younger children at both DLP and Magic Kingdom (with shorter queues and lower attendance at DLP) so make sure you consider that. If your children are 10+ and you can afford to visit Disneyworld, I think it's definitely worth it - but not because Disneyland Paris is inferior - it's about the scale of the experience. DLP cannot compete in raw size (there are 4 parks at Disneyworld, not just Magic Kingdom), but in the details and some of the key attractions, it's superior to Magic Kingdom.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"I will address the Hotel Cheyenne in a different post. But, Disneyland Paris is not up to Disney standards, especially if your used to Disney World.

First, it’s not in Paris. If staying on property, there is a train station right there. It’s really convenient. Unless, there is a transportation strike. We ended up using Uber to go back and forth from Paris. It cost us $150 USD each way (5 people). The train would have been about $20 each way.

Going to the theme park, there is the gauntlet of beggars and knock-off merchandise sellers trying to separate you from your money on the way in. Of note is the different gauntlet on the way out. The tickets are not biometric like in the US. So, skeezy people are waiting to buy tickets from you if you leave the park a bit early. They can use them or resell them. The French military are there walking around and just ignore everything.

Once in, nothing was open. We found only one restaurant open in the Magic Kingdom. Apparently, during Christmas break there aren’t too many visitors, and they just close things.

The park itself is ok. It looks like a low budget version of Disneyland (California). But, some things are just not explainable. For example, we could not find any working water fountain. They were all turned off. Except that there was one at Phantom Mansion; but, it had a film of slime in it. So, drinking from it may actually make you a permanent resident of the mansion.

Next is the fact that it is so small that it should be only one park, not two. But, then they wouldn’t be able to change what they do for tickets.

So, we checked off going to Disneyland Paris. What a waste of time and money. The only positive I have to say is that as a retired military, I was able to get 2 day park hoppers for €75 per person.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Book your tickets earlier in order to get best price! Parking too expensive, park your car at Val d'Europe Mall where is free of charge and take bus 34 or Metro. Great experience both for kids and adults! Hyperspace not to be missed!",Feb 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Are you on the fence about going to Paris Disney? If it is on your bucket list because you absolutely have to go to every Disney park in the world then yes, please go. If your kids really want to do it because they have never been to a disney then yes, go. It was on my list because I love love love Disney. I will not ever go again. I was hugely disappointed and I have a pretty low threshold for Disney happiness. The rides are just not the same as they are in WDW and California. In my opinion they missed the mark on the pageantry and the story telling. I don’t even care so much about the cost because it is, well, Disney.
Transportation: It is difficult if you are not staying on the property. I went in the middle of the transportation strike so we had to hire a private car. The cost was about 150 Euro round trip. It was worth it for convenience. It took 75 minutes there and 21/2 hours back from Eiffel Tower area.
Rides: I think one ride was better than most and that was Pirates but I think it is because the French understand the story behind Pirates. I think they did that ride well. The rides of fantasyland were similar but the decorations just not the same. And temple of Peril which is supposed to be Indiana, was downright awful. Outdoor rollercoaster... enough said. The haunted mansion reminded me of Knotts Berry farm — western in nature.

It is a small park and food choices were just okay. The employees were accommodating but not really Disney standards. But I have no complaints. They were unable to cash a 50 at a restaurant which I thought was strange but everyone was accommodating and polite. “Downtown Disney” had a lot of eating choices which I think were better than inside. So in summary, I am glad I did it to say that I did it. But, I was so disappointed.
So if you have specific reasons to go — kids really want to or you are a disney freak, please go. But if this is way down on your list....do not make it a priority because you too will be disappointed.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"My 4th time at the park, the first being in 1992 (When new), 1996, 2006, and finally in 2020. My second visit in winter.

Winter is always a challenging time for parks, but, Disneyland has previously handled it well. This time, the disappointment is vast, and this has turned out to be a costly mistake for the family.

From the get go, things are uncomfortable. The necessary security put my hair up on my neck. Twice being shouted at by security - One for not seeing security at the hotel and going in without an x-ray of a bag, and secondly for going down a line to a scanner - which apparently wasn't open. Certainly we weren't the only to do so, but, our first experience was to be treated with suspicion and disrespect.

The Park itself is meant to be a world of magic, instead, we were greeted by a world needing maintenance. The train, not working, some rides, not working, and we can live with this - it's not peak season, things need maintenance.

The whole part had staff being upbeat and happy. The parades, choreography is fantastic, and a warming smile on the crews faces. But, there certainly are a few staff at the end of their tether.

Pirates of the Caribbean, I have a lively VHS of the crew in 1992 taking their roles so well, and playing up for the camera - it was fantastic. This time, nothing. Simply get on the ride.

This can be replicated for every ride. The cast aren't playing a role at all it seems. It just feels like something is wrong.

And it's my second time as an adult, (12yrs, 16, 26, now 39), something isn't wrong.

By Mid day (Entering at 0930) I felt I needed to leave.

Lunch - very very slow service (Not a great many people in the park), and the food was cold. Challenging to get even a coffee - all seats full, and a lot just not open.

I so want this to be the pride of Paris once more, but, it needs a whole new burst of energy, and a customer focussed experience drive.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Ok it’s Disney you expect magic at a cost, haven’t been since I was a teenager and have now taken my daughter for her birthday. The surprise was they clearly haven’t spent any money on refurbishment and have cut back on other areas. The studio park should not come as a separate ticket, this is just over changing as there isn’t enough features for the money. The main park has no characters walking around for young ones to see, on the one occasion we did see a Disney princess she was running away from kids you wanted to talk and have photos. This is a huge part of the children’s experience. The staff was plenty with constant groups of red shirts/tops just chatting in groups. With staff at entrance gates or rides were either extremely friendly or upset that you didn’t speak French. The food was absolutely shocking, I’m not gonna moan about price as I expected high costs it was how tasteless and bland everything was despite trying different restaurants thought both parks and the village. The evening shows for both parks were amazing, warning ⚠️⚠️⚠️ if you wish for a good view/front row consider getting there an hour before, it does make a difference with a great view.

Come what may, don't miss the night sparkling and be seated atleast 1-2 hours before the show starts. Though we have restaurants inside, I suggest to carry some snacks or a drink inside - that saves quite a good amount of time.",Aug 2019

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Actually, it’s not what you see in the internet. You don’t feel like a child..
Everything is too old!! You have to wait lots of time to do anything; for games, food and so on!
Bring food with you because you will not eat!!
There are lots of people, huge lines, waste and expensive food!
Personally, the only thing that worth are the shops! Shops are too nice, there you will feel child, you will remember your childhood, you will lose your mind if you are a Disney lover!!!
Okay they are expensive but one time you go so have fun with it! With my boyfriend spent about 800€ only on shops!!

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"We've flown half way across the world. From Australia, a 22 hour flight, a train ride on Eurostar, taking 9 people and 9 suitcases on the RER with 5 children and 2 prams.
$2,000 Australian dollars on Disneyland tickets. For my son to have a photo with Kylo Ren or Darth Vader.
We stood in the front row of the Star Wars show at Walt Disney Studios where they pick people to come up. We were the very first people there, waiting half an hour before the show started.
Only for Kylo Ren to pick literally Every Other Child and Adult that just walked up from the side. Only to be told to ""compose ourselves"" when my son was excited, then Kylo Ren proceeded to pick everyone else except for him.

We waited until almost everyone else had already walked off, it was embarrassing by that point. We'd been waiting the entire time, it was deliberate at that point.
My son started crying. He was so upset that he picked everyone else except for him on purpose.
A memory that will be with him forever.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We have visited for the second time as a family, ranging from OAPs to children, including a child with a disability and a wheelchair user.

When it comes to accommodating for disabilities, they are amazing! The passes we get really help, as my nephew (who has autism and LOVES roller coasters) wouldn't be able to stand in the long lines. If we didn't have the pass, we just wouldn't be able to bring him. They also stopped the buses ahead of the bus stop and let us get on first with the wheelchair, before progressing to the bus stop to let everyone else on.

I know it is a business based around attracting people, so to say it would be better without the other people is silly, I know. I just cannot understand how rude, and downright nasty, some people can be, especially when they have their children with them. People will blatantly push in, and stand straight in front of a wheelchair user (with a child on their shoulders too) when watching the parade and light show etc. The nasty responses when we have asked people to move is staggering! Everyone is in the same boat. It honestly puts me off wanting to go again. it's Disneyland people, chill out! It's meant to the happiest place on earth!

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"We (family of 4) had an awesome time! It’s really an experience worth having. I’m so glad we went.

The parades are fabulous, the firework end of day display was unforgettable. We were blown away.

If you give good spirit to the characters they will be amazing back! And good manners to the staff then they are happy and helpful in return.

We planned our days to cover specific areas, including choosing a character or so in that area. It worked really well for us. The shows are fantastic and give you a sit down and rest.

We went for 5 days. We also went in-between festivals, this meant no theme so less parades but as it was our first time we didn’t mind or notice. It also meant it wasn’t busy for our first 3 days (tues, wed, thurs), we didn’t have to queue very much at all and managed to go on every open ride. It got busier on the Friday, but we chose that day to watch many of the shows that are included. The Saturday was the first day of the Halloween festival and it was crazy busy! Fortunately we were able to just dedicate that day to enjoying the Halloween parade and Halloween shows on offer. If everyday had been like this it would have been harder to bare I think.

We did the princess breakfast, which our girls loved. The characters were attentive and kind. The breakfast was yummy. After that our girls weren’t bothered about queuing to meet more princess characters because they felt they’d had a good time and attention already.

We went to Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. It was my birthday that day. The food and drink was great, (I ate vegetarian, my husband not). We really enjoyed ourselves and are glad we went.

We chose a day to watch the firework display and camped out in a good position for it, it was a 90 minute wait! As the only real ‘queue’ we’d had it felt ok. We were prepared, we had our coats to sit on and a bag full of snacks. And it was late day 3 so taking a rest people watching was actually quite welcome. It was worth it! It was amazing, almost emotional. And our children could see it clearly stood on their own two feet.
- Although as the start time drew nearer people will literally trample your children to get to the front. We watched it again another day from way way farther back with the children on our shoulders, it was still good but cramped and hard to see.

Walt Disney Studios Park has some great attractions but the atmosphere wasn’t as pleasant. The Disney Village didn’t have much to offer.

We had standard half board and it was worth it. Most places we ate were really satisfying, we’d pre booked everywhere as recommended and it made the whole process smooth running.

Mostly I think, just being there is a great experience, to walk in wonder and enjoy your family moments.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Disney luggage service doesn't work Disneyland paris dont care

73

I was left disappointed with my disney experience.

I recently went to Disneyland paris and actually stayed in the hotels for the first time.

I paid for the express check in service at the train station so we could leave are bags at the train station and go straight to the parks.

Obviously it was difficult to get to Disney with the train strike and we arrived later than we expected but none the less the service seemed good. We went to the expresscheck in desk at the train station and left our bags got our magic pass and went to the parks.

The problem was on the way home. When we went to the hotel later that night we checked in the person at the desk told us to makes sure we take off the Express tickets we had as it would cause confusion later.

In the hotel there was a lot of confusion about how the service worked and the times of the magic bus we got. They did really seem like the service was working seamlessly with the hotels and parks.

On the day of check out I brought the bags to the luggage store and told the guy that had the express service and had to get a bus from the train station at 14.15pm and could he assure me that the bags would be at the train station on time for me to collect so I could get the bus and not have to get back to the hotel. He said yes and I said it few times to be sure and I was assured everything would ok.

We arrived at the train station Express service at 13.55 pm we were told our bags were still at the hotel and we were given the wrong tags. And the tags we had were for hotel use only and our bags were never going to get to the train station.

I was a little upset and made the final part of the trip disappointing, having had a great time we left Disney upset. The supervisor in the train was sympathetic although he had no idea of bus times. When I showed him the bus times he was able to assist me by calling the hotel with my bag number and when got the hotel the bags were ready so I was able to catch the bus at the hotel luckly ( but it was not the service I had paid for and made the situation stressful and instead of 1 bus I had to get 2.

At the hotel when we arrived although the hotel when we went to collect our bags although they were not apologetic at all. The guy at the desk who attended us told his manager who was standing be side hom that this was the 4th time the problem had happened today. He simply didnt care. Just said bye ungratefully. No thanks for staying at Disney hope you enjoyed your stay ect.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"I brought my 10 year old daughter here for her birthday. We spent 3 days at the park (although with a little bit of planning you really only need 2 days - the park is similar to Disneyland California, but smaller). We went during off season, so we prepared for the weather. It was cold and wet, but dressing in layers and wet weather gear (rain boots and rain ponchos) it was worth it because the lines were so much shorter. The weekend was the typical large crowd, long line fiasco, so thankfully we did the rides during the week and we were able to explore Disney Village while everyone else was in the park. The extra magic time that is offered by the Disneyland hotels is worth the money. We stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, which was one of the lower end Disney hotels. The accommodations were very simple, but completely functional for what we came to do. We did so much more in that extra hour than we would have been able to do if we arrived during regular hours. By the time the doors opened we were done with the rides we wanted to do. We really enjoyed ourselves. We will be back. Expect long lines, higher prices, rude visitors, but if you go in knowing that and you do a little extra planning, it will be a magical time!

You pay 100€ per ticket, additional 60€ for fast track ticket that works only for čerta in attractions!

I suggest buying tickets in advance on the Internet for diacount price. However, the servers are oftwen down.

Waiting times at the park are 30 minutes and more. It is quite common you wait more than hour for 2 minutes ride!

You even have to wait for restaurants, if not booked in advance.

This park is not suitable for children!!!! They get bored quickly while waiting and then dissapointed of short rides!

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,For how much it costs to go there it is very disappointing. The park itself is nice but they let far too many people in at once and there are queues for everything including toilets. Most queues are 80 minutes long if not longer. One of the shortest queues was 50 minutes for the teacups which lasted 30 seconds. There are alot of rude people which just bump you out of the way. Also it is too commercialised too many expensive merch shops mostly selling the same thing. The rides aren't the best either. Would never go again nearly £4000 for 3 days was a waste of money,Oct 2019

We enjoyed it very much.",Jan 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"This was our third and probably final trip to Disneyland Paris. The second time in a row space mountain was closed which was very disappointing. We stayed at the lodge themed hotel which was a ten min walk from the park. Stupidly went when the strikes were on so getting home was a nightmare. We had a half board package which included two nights, flights, park tickets for three days and breakfast and one main meal a day. You had to pay extra to get to and from the airport. Get the local train, it’s cheaper than the magic shuttle. No tea or coffee in our room and I can’t say we had a decent cup of either during our stay. We had passes which allowed us into both parks. Sadly rocking roller coaster is now shut to prep for the new avengers section and we didn’t fancy a two hour queue for the frozen performance in the freezing cold. Namely we didn’t go with kids and I felt sorry for the kids and parents queueing in the cold or queuing for food. Take money into the parks as the card machines fail a lot! Or take your own food and drink. Water fountains don’t work though. And then you have to queue for 45 mins for overpriced poor fast food. Park staff misinformed us for the time of the illuminations so we missed those but caught the two parades and the random tree lighting. As with any Disney product everything costs. Again, felt sorry for parents forking out for expensive merch for the kids. We had dinner at the Wild West show - awful food and felt uncomfortable with the white native Americans (a more modern show is needed) so left early. The second night we went to the steak house and it was ok. Glad that the German castle still has the happy hour which is a saving. We had a couple photos with characters but didn’t queue for the popular ones, best the kids get those photos first. We took full advantage of any fast pass we could get to avoid queues and it was a shame the three days we were there space mountain was not open. The park looked tired but decorated for Christmas so was merry in a way. We tried to go on any thing that didn’t have a stupid queue. Go on the crush coaster first thing and get fast pass for the thunder mountain and don’t forget the Indiana Jones ride. It’s tucked away at the back of the park but Def the best ride since space mountain was closed and the rocking rollercoaster closed. I can only hope with the new avengers rides that the park improves. We will save up and go to Florida or California next time.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"We visited during the end of the Christmas event (3rd-5th Jan 2020) and had an amazing time. The park was beautiful with the Christmas decorations up and I will admit... I do prefer this park to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. I find the attractions are more modern and the place has a more majestic feel than MK.

It is not just for kids... went as a couple and loved the parks share of thrill rides in addition to the timeless classics like Snow White and Its a small world... you’ve just started singing the tune now.

The food in the parks were what you can expect at theme parks but we’re not overpriced which was a nice surprise. We found the crowds to be very busy but we expected this due to it still being Christmas. We did find the fastpasses to be a little hit and miss but I supposed we’ve been spoilt with the Orlando version of fastpass+

Top tip... get to Crush’s coaster in Walt Disney Studios FIRST THING in the morning... you can thank me when you’re not stuck in a 2 hr queue.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,I just want to add so it can be seen somewhere that most cast members were efficient enough but about 1 per day was extremely rude and made us feel unwelcome. Worst was a girl on big thunder mountain sighing looking bored and tutting. And one of the information people in red coats told me rudely that the event happening they were roping off was a private event. Then went back and made comments about tourists to her colleagues. We speak fluent French despite being English so heard what she said. Full on bullying behaviour. Cast members need reminding that when they are visible they are on set!!,Jan 2020

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"This was a special trip that we were doing in memory of our Dad for our kids. My Dad took us here a lot in the 1990s so it was wonderful to come back with our own kids.
I just wish that we didn’t come in wintertime. Going there when I was a kid and then again in my 20s, I remember there being lots of options to sit down somewhere for a drink and a snack. We didn’t find that this time which was especially difficult when we had 4 exhausted and wet children between us and a very grumpy grandmother.
We weren’t able to find anywhere to eat or stop for a drink that was calm. The problem was, so many of their eateries were closed or just not built for the numbers trying to get out of the cold and the rain. Again, I’ve never known this before.
The restaurants don’t open until 11.30 so we were stuck for drinks until then. The water fountains don’t work anymore. We struggled to find any staff to ask for suggestions and the Disneyland App was a faff to use. We did end up finding a little cafe called the Deli cafe in one of the arcades on the Main Street but this meant going all the way back to main street whenever we wanted to rest/ get warm and dry/ eat or drink. It also involved queuing for 20 mins and hoping that there was going to be a vacant table.
The children did enjoy themselves and oddly enough, one of the highlights of theirs and our days were the parades! They are at 4.30 in the wintertime, in rain or snow! The cast were phenomenal, so professional and good at their jobs, it really lifted everyone’s spirits. But... you absolutely have to get to the parade route 30 mins before the start in order to get a good view of the street performers and not just the giant floats. We tried being 10 mins early and we ended up being 5 people deep! We got there 25 mins early the next day and managed to get the two little kids in the front and the two babies on our shoulders behind them... and stood there in the rain for 30 mins waiting for the parade to start. Thank god the parade was worth it.
The rides are great! Our kids (between 2-9) loved the pirates ride, and it’s a small world. They also loved the tea cups and the carousel. The queues for everything else seemed to be over 25 mins and so you need to use the fast pass ( it’s free for one fast pass at a time)
We made the mistake of taking our (very tall) 3 year old on the thunder mountain ride because I didn’t remember it being that scary! She hated it and I felt so bad. I loved that ride when I was a kid and didn’t remember it bring that loud, fast, dark and scary! My 6 year old loved it! I also don’t recommend that you take 3 year olds on Star Tours!
What would have been great was if there were warm cafes near all these rides so that the little kids and I could wait for the big kids to go on the rides!
People regularly say that Disneyland is expensive, well it was far more expensive than I had remembered or anticipated! ~ €4 for a drink, €8 for a sandwich €11 for a pizza or €18 for the cheapest meal deals (called Menu in France). And that was in the park, food was almost twice that price at the Disney brand hotels, which of course you are stuck at!
We had 2 days in the park and 4 nights there. It cost us £900 for travel, hotel and park tickets, plus another £1000 for travel to London for the Eurostar, hotel in London, plus eating out money and bare minimal souvenir money! For near £2000 I would consider a week somewhere warm and sunny in future! The place felt like a rip off in winter.
Also, I remember the park being less busy in July than it was this January! But as I say, that’s probably because there were minimal cafes open on site.
P.S. the light show and fireworks at the park closing time is AWESOME!

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"We spent 3 days in the parks between Christmas and New Year. It was a surprise for our Children and we had an amazing time. We've reviewed this park earlier in the year but as it was such a positive experience we felt moved to comment again.
The park was decorated beautifully with so many different scenes and decorations it was unbelievable. It was extra magical walking into the park. Note that it was the main areas that was decorated to this level though. The Christmas parade was amazing. We watched it on main street with the snow machines making it feel very seasonal indeed.
We had a picture with Stitch and Jack Skelton who were both dressed seasonally. Donald Duck and Goofy were dressed Christmasy too but apart from that the other characters seemed to be dressed normally.
With the seasonal music and all the normal Disney activities, rides and experiences this was a great time to visit. Be warned that it is very busy at this time of year. We have a child who is ASD and with the ride access pass he managed just fine. There were longer waits using this than in the summer but he didn't mind as he was overwhelmed by long noisey queues. If a member of your party is prone to melt downs this is worth looking into for everyones sake.
The other thing I noticed that was different to summer was the service in the 'quick service' restaurants. They were a little quicker and definitely more organised. However we still feel that food is the main weakness of Disneyland Paris. Having said that we have only eaten in table service restaurants in the Village. It's worth looking at the menus on the app before you go to look at what they serve. Unfortunately much of it is not to our tastes or is very samey.
Final tip - download the app to use for show and queue times as well as menus. It's very useful. If you get a chance to go at Christmas do it!

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"First, we love Disney, but the comparison between the Paris and American parks is almost beyond words. The USA have it sorted; the French absolutely do not. Paris is a rip-off at every opportunity which wouldn't be so bad if the queues were reasonable. We've Disney'ed many times before, have older children who can walk miles etc. so we know the ropes and get super-organised but even then it gets boring and stressful. Whichever you cut it, it's about 50 euros per person entrance to Paris, oh and don't forget your 30 euros parking per day (why do we let them rip us off like this?), so for well over £200 for 4 you get entrance to one big long queue: rides, food, character meets (if you can get one booked - good luck with that folks!) everything. The parades are super but folks start marking their territory an hour before. My heart goes out to families with small children - it's certainly not the promised, magical fun day which is why you see so many stressed parents dragging their sobbing kids who are tired of standing in lines and not getting to meet their favourite characters. Olaf sold out within 4 seconds on the App! America has a better, fairer system for everything. Paris doesn't care. Some rides had 2 hour waits. Even the FastPass queue for Space mountain was 60 mins at one point. I'll never return to the Paris Disneyland. It's getting tatty and the staff are rude and aloof. Even the water fountains around the park don't work (hello - climate emergency?!) Instead Paris Disney charge 3 euros for a small plastic bottle of water. A disgrace. Do you and your little family a favour - save up and get to America where they understand the importance of giving families a truly magical Disney experience.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Read numerous reviews before going so went with an open mind but cannot fault the service from the cleaners who keep everything spotless to the security/hotel staff and staff at both parks.....all brilliant. Hardly any queuing if any (although stayed beginning of school term time) and magic time is definitely worth it especially if going with young children as some of the bigger rides do not open for magic time. Food overpriced as expected but Mc Donalds and Starbucks remains fairly priced if wanting a quick cheap know what you're getting meal. Meet the characters is by appointment mainly which require you to download Lineberty and book which know one tells you about unless you read the meet and greet signs but worth it.
We travelled as 2 adults and 2 children aged 3yrs and 4yrs and stayed at the Newport Hotel half board. Food average but filled a void, hotel was lovely and will definitely stay there again, we were able to walk to the park from the hotel in under 10minutes with both children who were amazed throughout the whole holiday, the parade and illuminations are spectacular and can't be missed!
We took along our own buggy but the hire ones looked much better although not as comfy and could fit a children up to 7-8yr, for children who need a rest as during busy periods seating isn't always easy to find.
As said it was a great trip and planning to go again this year. i have never written a review before from all of my travels but this place definitely warranted a brilliant review.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Decided to take a chance and travel through to Disney by Metro, even with the transport strike, it was so efficient and quick to get there.

The que to pay and enter was not so quick, we were in the que for nearly 1,5 hours, when we got to the front, they had only two cashiers on duty.

Once through, wow, Okay its not USA, but if you need your kiddy in you to have some fun while in Paris, this is it!

I suggest you go get fast passes quickly as soon as you enter for any of the rides you really want to go on, otherwise you may not get the opportunity to go on as many rides.

Some normal ques were 1,5 hours long and for example it was 12:30pm, so we got in at 2:00 for the Big Thunder Mountain ride, but we checked if we had tried a fast pass at 12;30 the issue for it was a time slot at 18:40pm, so in effect the standing for time was quicker than the fast pass, and the ques were getting crazy at all the rides.

The parade was fun and had everyone singing along.

It was great to be a kid for the day.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We visited in November with nearly 3 year old. She loved the slower rides but found Snow White ride scared. We brought ear defenders for the fireworks and rides if required. She doesn’t like loud noises so this helped her enjoy the park. The fireworks show was fantastic, worth staying for.
Our little girl had a very special visit to Snow White. We got some great photos and memories",Jan 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"We stayed at Disneyland Paris from 30.12.19 - 1.1.2020 at Newport Bay. Hotel was ok as was the food there. The parks however were too crowded and horrible! Queues were ridiculously long for everything (rides at 60-120mins), including food (for cold burgers and chips - 45mins) and toilets. Staff were mainly rude and unhelpful. New years eve tickets cost us £300 and DEFINITELY NOT worth it, we couldn't see the fireworks as people pushed infront of us, the ride queues were still as long (60-100mins), we couldn't see any characters - wait time of 90mins, the parades were the same as in the day or very small new ones that you could hardly see as so many people lined the route. Finally staff turned up to line a route for people to walk through, otherwise people were shouting at others to get through. There were too many people there and it wasn't enjoyable, my daughter ended up in tears!! There was a free fireworks display by the lake outside the hotel and dj in the hotel and in the disney village which we wish we had saved the money and gone to that instead. It has totally changed from previous visits and we will never go back again - definitely not magical at all!!

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Such a magical place for not just children but adults. My only complaint would be they let far to many people into the park. Having to wait 1-2 or more hours to go on a ride is ridiculous. We spend two days at this park in December an yes it is a very busy month but from being there from early morning to late at night the waiting times are dreadful not just for rides but restaurants, toilets everything. Maybe Disney should limit the amount of people who can enter each day to make this experience more enjoyable for all who come. It is expensive to eat an most restaurants are booked up well in advance so be prepared to wait a long time or go elsewhere.",Dec 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,Oh the irony! Absolutely appalling to wait 90min to collect our pre booked and Pre paid fast passes. And when we finally get seen to it takes ages to get these wristbands on that none of the Disney staff know how to attach. Best of all on the rides none of the staff asked to see the wristbands but only the ticket stubs! OMG. We paid £390 for these fast passes in addition to the park entrance fee and we can’t get onto our first ride until after 10.30. What is going on? Not feeling the Disney magic guys!!,Jan 2020
France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"We booked a room at the Vienna dream castle - king which came with 2 bunk beds. reasonable, clean. unexpected bonus - there is a hotel bus that goes from the hotel to Disneyland / The Marne-la-Vallée train stop. Super east to get to Disneyland from downtown using public transit train. New Years Eve in Disneyland is the Best! We purchased NYE tix months in advance and had a great time. Food prices are as you would expect, coffee was reasonable, line ups were about 20 minutes (the longest we waited)and the fireworks/lazer show was outstanding! We would recommend you stake out your spot an hour before the fireworks start because it gets crazy crowded. A wonderful way to bring In the New Year.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"I spent 2 days visiting Disneyland Paris with my husband and 3 children aged 4, 6 and 8. I wasn’t super excited about going but the kids loved it and it essentially met my expectations.
After some time standing in the wrong queue to get in, I did feel a sense of magic walking into the Park. It was the end of the Christmas break so carols were playing and decorations were still up which was lovely and atmospheric.
We spent endless amounts of time queuing, which I expected but didn’t realise just how bad it would be. Some rides had displays to look at during the queue which made things easier.
My main complaint is that despite having checked in online, and having read the (multiple) emails we’d been sent since booking as well as speaking with friends who’d been, it still took us a few hours to work out how best to get around the park. Eg that there is a fast pass function included in our passes (presumably they keep this quiet hoping you’ll buy a super fast or an ultimate fast pass). We had downloaded the app but I didn’t find it very user friendly.
We stayed in the Villages Nature resort which suited us well. Again, the bus ride from there to Disneyland (which is a public bus, very easy to use but not quite the “shuttle” I’d imagined from its description on the website) revealed to us more accomodation options in the towns we drove through to get there. Understandably these aren’t described on the website.
So in summary, if you think you’ll love the Disney experience, you probably will, if it sounds like your worst nightmare it probably will be or if, like me, you’re moderate in your expectations, 2 days will probably be quite fun!!

This was to be a trip of a lifetime for my Children and grandchildren.
It was a miserable experience.
We had to endure long queues for rides and a 45 minute wait for the toilet with small children.
A bus ride back to our Hotel Cheyenne after the fireworks nearly ended in my 3 year old Grandaughter being crushed even though she was in her pushchair it’s seems queuing and courtesy does not exist.
Hotel Cheyenne is under staffed run down and very disappointing.
I visited this hotel in 1992 with my children and we were all looking forward to an amazing experience however it is nothing like the themed hotel it was.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"It could be that we went during the holidays but I have never had such a terrible theme park experience. People will crush you with their strollers, and are absolutely rude. We are annual pass holders at DisneyWorld so we are used to crowds and lines but this was terrible. 30-45 minute wait each time anyone has to use the restroom some. My advice to anyone going is to go at night so you avoid the completely disorganized security line which has zero order, and you can actually visit some rides. I could not believe the 2 hour queue just to get through security which was a waste, then onto a 15 minute wait to get into the park. Each ride had a minimum 60 minute wait, and 45 minute wait in the restaurants. I think one of the reasons other parks are more successful is that they hire enough staff to support the guests they invite in. This was pure Madness!

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"This park has plenty of rides to suit all ages and all levels of adventure, and the parades and shows are great too. The only disappointment is that corporate greed means that the Fast Pass lines are no longer fast at many points of the day since WD started to sell FP access at a (high) price (Fast Pass queues of 15/20 minutes to load Big Thunder Mountain and Peter Pan for example). It seems that there is no ""egalite"" any more - only shortish lines for the rich and often horribly long lines for the poor! Walt Disney will be turning in his grave. But it's still a magical place!",Dec 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Oh. My. God. At 30 I never thought I would get excited about Disney stuff again but BOY WAS I WRONG.

I was staying near Marne-le-Vallee so when I took the Disney Shuttle from CDG airport I already realised: ohhh here we goooooo.

I was very lucky to go with friends that knew the park well, so we did the best rides (of course). Well worth the queue.

My top rides?
1. Space Mountain (do this first in the day, it only gets busier and busier as the day goes on
2. Disney illuminations-- DO NOT MISS.
3. Disney Parade - DO NOT MISS
4. Indiana Jones
5. Thunder Mountain

So, this is how committed I was: I was there during the infamous strikes. So I had to pay for a taxi to get home after the illuminations, and oh my WORD it was worth it. I'm not ashamed to say I let a few tears slip down as Lion King & Little Mermaid came up. I mean, that's my childhood you know.

What suggestions do I have?
- bring your own snack food. lots and lots of pringles and bananas and juice boxes
- be prepared to queue. c'est la vie
- get a fastpass. it's totally worth it.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Honestly, I have nothing positive to say about this place. I would rate this zero stars if I could. We spent about 85% of our time here standing on a queue- absolutely no exaggeration. You have to queue (rather, stand in a giant, completely disorganized mass) for bag check. The queue for entry. Then queue for rides. We spent the entire day at the park and managed to go on 2 rides, one of which was a maximum of 2 minutes long (and a 90 minute line!). We queued even longer buy a knock off McDonalds burger at double the price. This park has absolutely no redeeming features. Nothing was enjoyable. I can only imagine the all the positive reviews are desperately lying to themselves to try and justify the complete waste of money. Consider yourself warned.

Thank you for making our visit so enjoyable and stress free. The 3 kids loved the trip and even staying in a ‘lower’ standard accommodation of the Cheyenne everything you needed was there and it was perfect.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Stayed at hotel Cheyenne for 4 nights and visited Disneyland park. Its 50/50 with the friendly staff, some were lovely, others were just plain rude. Queues were bad but we used our magic hour to do the rides we wanted to do each day before park opened. We never queued more than 30 mins for anything else although big thunder mountain did get up to 140mins at one point, but by that time we'd been on 6 times in the magic hour! We just planned our day accordingly.... went to park first thing, left at 10.30am and went back to hotel for breakfast which then doubled up as lunch, went back to park about 12pm... as people were then heading for lunch ! Also, whilst parades were on we went and did rides as wait times did reduce. You've just got to be a bit savvy and quick off the mark. When going back to park we didn't take a bag so we could use the express security lane rather than queuing to get back in. With a bag took 45 mins the first day.... hence no bag after that.
Food and drinks expensive in park so kept a water bottle and filled it up at breakfast and evening meal each day.
I think once you've been you've been, its ticked off our list.

Getting there with the strike wasn’t bad. Our hotel arranged a car for our party of 6. Getting back was definitely more challenging. The hotel could arrange a care for 180 Euros. We only paid 85 to get there. We tried to get an Uber but no luck. They kept canceling. There were over 100 private cars and taxis lined up when we left (10:30). We didn’t know there were so many and after conversing with a few drivers who were very high pressure, I panicked and paid too much. In retrospect, I would have walked down the line and negotiated with someone who wasn’t at the front of the line so would have been more reasonable. The wait lines were all less than one hour. Many much less.

Not this time. By 10am Crush’s coaster was up to 110 mins and meanwhile over in the Disney park the Peter Pan ride (which is, let’s face it, okay but not mind blowing) was at 120! Dumbo was at 45 mins. Even ones like caseys train were up at 45 mins. By 11am, we had given up and did all the non ride attractions we could before going home.
Day two we did the magic hour, by the time that ended the RC car was a 60 min wait so we knew we were in for a similar day. Thankfully we booked accommodation at centreparcs, so went back there to spend the rest of the day before heading back to Disney later in the evening.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of Disney Parks around the world, and Disneyland Paris is by far the worse. It's rides are good, and in same cases better than you would find at the Anerican parks, but it's staff and their attitude let's this park down big time.

At the Disney parks the staff are referred to as Cast Members...they are part of the entertainment package so to speak. However, I got the impression that Disneyland Paris has failed to get that message through to it's 'Cast Members' as they all appear to be very unhelpful and very unhappy. This issue then has a negative effect on what Disney is all about.

Having said the above, those cast members taking part in the brief parade late afternoon did appear to be in the Disney frame of mind.

And one other item that set this Park way below the others was the rubbish lying around. The first ride we went on was the Magic Carpet ride, and the amount of rubbish on the floor under the ride was shocking!!!

This park needs to do better!!!

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"This was our second visit to the park and there are definitely recommendations that can make your trip better which I hadn’t researched! We obviously went at one of the busiest times of the year, but I get the impression that the park is always really busy. We went for full board and stayed in the Sequoia Lodge, which although dated, was clean and comfortable - and one of the better places to eat. However - like all the restaurants, they were constantly fully booked, so book and plan in your meal times if you are full board as you will end up losing out otherwise. The park was at full capacity, and even the staff said it cannot cope with the demand when it is full. Half Board would have been fine for us and would do this again if we went again. This was the most irritating part of the trip as you feel like you have paid over the odds and then missing out on the value of the meals. There is also an air of distain from staff when you are on one of the packages. Disney and France/French in all honesty are a cultural challenge, and this was evident. The attitude of staff was hit and miss, some were lovely and helpful, and then at times the food was practically frisbeed at you! There isn’t the constant cheer you would expect from Disney! Rides were good but waits were long and fast pass was a god send, and we packed in a lot over 3 days, and the fireworks were absolutely the highlight of our trip, just brilliant! Be prepared to walk a lot especially if you are one of the Hotels in the complex but outside of the village! Brace yourself for a brilliant few days but plan plan plan!

Bought a package through the Disney website, included a stay in Hotel Santa Fe, half board, magic pass and fast pass and 15% (I think) off the total price. Flights were also booked through the Disney website
Booking was relatively easy and straight forward. However the website itself is a nightmare for information and anything else that you wish to book has to be done over the phone. For example we wanted to book the Disney princess experience for our daughter. Which cost us near 200 in phone bill due to us having to constantly ring everyday over a period of 7days instead of call handlers arranging a callback when the system was up and running again, as there were technical difficulties on the booking systems. Disney state that calls are 5p per minute however be warned that your network operator may charge a premium service charge like ours it was 50p per minute. Would have saved an awful lot of time and money if Disney had an online booking system instead of being on hold for between 40-60mins at a time to be told to ring back again tomorrow. It took me to lodge a complaint on Twitter to get it resolved on Christmas Eve (we flew out the 27th)

That said... the Disneyland experience was fantastic, stayed in the Hotel Santa Fe, whilst it is extremely basic it serves its purpose for a place to rest. Staff are friendly and the food was decent in the la cantina.
We had the magic pass which was fantastic couldn’t make use of it properly on our first day as we had the Disney breakfast however the Sunday morning it was fantastic, the likes of the peter on ride which would usually be a 2 hour wait a peak times we got to ride twice before 9 o clock with a 5 minute wait. Pirates of the Caribbean was another great ride and the Star Wars ride. We stuck to the main Disneyland park for the first day and a half and there’s a great balance of rides for all ages. My youngest who’s 5 and tall was annoyed when she couldn’t ride the Star Wars rollercoaster with her older brother and daddy but there’s good substitutions nearby that you can make use of.
Whilst the queues can be long in the Disneyland Park do not let it put you off they actually move quite quickly unlike the Disney studios queues which for some reason are a lot slower.
We flew home on Monday night and were able to leave all our luggage in the Santa Fe luggage room to make the most of our last day. The first bus was on time as usual however for some reason pulled into the Cheyenne and sat parked for 10mins the packed with families to be told to disembark and board another bus for whatever reason. This put us 10minutes behind for the park which doesn’t sound like much however it can set you back on queuing times by 40-60 minutes which happened to us in the studios for Crush’s coaster (another fantastic ride).
Staff in both parks are lovely and are brilliant in their interactions with the children. The parades are fantastic however be prepared to stand your ground for a spot. Would recommend checking the parade route before hand to ensure you stand in the right place. The lights show at night is a must also.
I read a lot of people saying that food in the park is over priced, to be honest it’s not and it’s what you would expect in a place like this.

All in all I would definitely recommend staying in a Disney hotel to get the magic pass and fast pass included, it is well worth that extra few pounds. The last bus runs at 11.30 at night so you can get back to the hotel from the lights and firework display.

Tips:
-if staying in the Santa Fe and eating breakfast there make sure you’re at la catina for 7am as within 10mins theres a queue and you have to wait on a table becoming available

-get the first bus to the park to make the most of magic time it’s usually 7:45, there are safety barriers stand near the opening of these, people don’t queue and will walk in front of you the closer you are to the opening the better chance you have of getting a seat if you need one. Usually towards the top of the waiting area.

-bring snacks for in between meals and water bottles there are water stations in the park

- we could never figure out why people were queuing for studios first during magic time, found out studios opens to public at 9am and Disneyland park opens at 10am, in hindsight we would’ve been better going to the studios first to beat queues and then still had time to make the most of the park before 10

-get a meal plan it is worth it, and saved us a good chunk of money, la cantina always had something for all our tastes, son can be fussy and he always had something he liked.

Due to only one flight from BFS we arrived late Friday night so missed the park on the Friday unfortunately. We walked in over 60,000 steps from Saturday 28th to Monday 30th whilst we didn’t fit everything in my children could not have done another early start or walk. Prams are available for rent in the park, we didn’t use them. But they are hugely popular.

Disney can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be, we spent our money on food at lunch time and present for family back home. Children had their own money from Christmas.

Son lost his Disney pass on the last day staff member kindly printed a replacement for him to keep as a souvenir

Pros
- hotel was clean and served purpose
-food was good
- rides
-staff
-magic time
- the experience itself

Cons
-website for booking extras and information
- studios queueing was a lot slower to move than what the park itself was

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,To be honest this is a fantastic place for any family with young children however be aware there are up to 140 min wait for rides we were therefore faced with paying an additional £800 for the fast track tickets one day in to our stay. Staff are extremely under pressure as well due to it being so busy. You can be faced with between 30 min and 60 min wait just for a coffee or fast food. This is a great place but hours of waiting around in queueing for anything you want is compulsory here I’m afraid. Security checks are laughable as you can simply walk through the exit the wrong way to get in which is ridiculous.,Jan 2020

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"My wife and I were not really looking forward to Paris Disneyland, but were hoping it would be a fun experience for our children (12 and 3). But overall it was better than expected. We found some fun rides and experiences, and enjoyed watching the parades. There were lots of shops of course, but it was not as commercial as we thought it might be. We visited just prior to Christmas, and were pleasantly surprised to hear some Christian carols being played.

On the negative, you can expect large crowds and therefore long waits for some rides. For example, we waited for about 30 minutes for the Pirates of the Caribbean and Its a Small World rides, and over an hour for the Buzz Lightyear ride.

Be careful of the package deals. We got a deal from the Disney website which had us staying at Villages Nature - we didn’t do enough research to realise it was about a 30 mins bus ride away from the Parks. With our package we also got meal deals for certain of the restaurants at the Parks - but because you have to book many weeks/months in advance for a place at one of those restaurants, these meal deals were worthless.

Saw the shows. Mickey's big band was by far my favourite. We managed a few meets. Jack skellington being the absolute favourite. Seen lots of negatives with people saying how busy it was. Yes it was extremely busy. But we expected it with it being Christmas time. The whole place was amazing. I agree with what others say though. More staff to stop people pushing to the front of parades, illuminations ect. We got a spot and a lady thought it was ok to near enough push my daughter out of the way. She got more than a few choice words from me. But a few signs up saying its frowned upon and staff police it a little better may make people realise its damn right rude.

In our 12 hours there, we were able to do 4 rides. The only food we could get without a reservation weeks before our visit, was from the pancake stands (even those had 30' waiting times) or the fast food places. The second one of these we did (chalet de la marionette) was able to cope with about two customers per five minutes and the food they tried to serve us were the plates that were already sitting there the 20 minutes we'd been in line, with cold and flat French fries and buns that had already started to become hard.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Price of €169 per person for two day entry to park. This is just a down payment, as the queues for most rides are 60 to 90 minutes. In order to avoid this, you can purchase 'fast passes' for your family (this could set you back up to €600 for one day!) Is this not immoral? Surely paying a fee to enter the park forms a contract where you would reasonably expect to gain access to rides within a reasonable timeframe (say 20 minutes)?? No such luck. If you dont have a fast pass you can queue for over an hour, and then stand at the point of entry, trying to explain to your children why the 'fast track' people coming from the other lane have priority over you!!
Disney admit far too many people to the park, purely for reasons of greed. If you never come back, doesn't matter, there are lots more punters out there queueing to get in. When you visit any of their food locations for luch, you queue to get your food, but now there are no tables, so you wander about for another 20 minutes until a table comes free. Unfortunately your food is now cold, and your €60 purchase is only suitable for the trash can. If you need toilets, good luck finding those, and such is the pressure and queues, that women are using the gents, and you now have to queue for these too! Save yourself time and energy. Just go stand in some dodgy part of a city, and eventually someone will come along and mug you. Yes, you have just had the Disney experience!! Never, never again.

Hotel Cheyenne 4th-7th November

I struggled a lot to eat the first day but found loads of little places you can go to;
Planet Hollywood; vegan burger, nachos without cheese and sour cream

Annettes; Soya burger (without cheese etc) and ‘Veggie’ (vegetable) burger (without cheese etc)

Chez Remy; Vegan salad to start (without cheese etc- ask for oil and vinegar so it’s not so dry) and vegan main which was tofu and boiled veg.

Vegan stall (in studios); vegan falafels, vegan chilli, vegan ice creams

Vegan kitchen Christmas stall (in studios); loads of options! (The chocolate cake is soo good!)

Christmas stall (in studios next to ratatouille gift shop); vegan soup

Deli (in Main Street); Vegan / Vegetable baguette

You can also have the popcorn as it’s cooked in oil, not butter, apparently the churros and mickey waffles are vegan but couldn’t find them anywhere / places were shut.

Unfortunately a lot of places that did vegan options were not open while we where there😔

Luckily I took snacks, porridge pots and other bits with me and requested a kettle at the hotel and got cutlery from the bar ☺️

It’s a shame Europe are behind in the vegan world but it’s great DLP are making a start at addressing different dietary requirements.

I must add that I LOVE Disney, go every year, the only disappointment is getting a good meal currently but it’s improved a lot since when I first went ☺️

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We booked this back in May 2019 and added on the Halloween party as an extra for our family group of 9. This was not cheap, running at just shy of £60 per person, but it was definitely worth it.
We were given an extra day pass because of the park closing earlier on the Saturday evening and to be honest, if you've never been, you do need the third day if you have teens and kids in the older age-brackets. You simply can't do everything you want to with a 2-day pass.
The negative to our trip was deciding to drive. Primarily we worked out the costs would be lower than taking the Eurostar with two cars, but we probably spent more and we certainly paid for it having driven/ferried over-night to get there and then spending 8 hours in the park. This meant we were later getting going on the Saturday morning, though another 7 hour stint was followed by a nice dinner back at the cabins (I'll come to those shortly) before we returned to the park for an 8pm ~ 2am stint for the Halloween Party. It was superb!
Needless to say our 2.45am bedtime meant we were (again) a bit bedraggled for the Sunday marathon of cabin cleaning, packing cars and getting breakfast before heading for a full day at the park and then making the journey back home... overnight.
The Davy Crockett Ranch cabins were excellent. We had 2, each with 5 person capacity and 2 bathrooms. They were reasonably spacious, clean and warm and very functional.
On the first morning we opted for the additional breakfast package (10 euro/person). We bought 5 and there was enough for everyone.
Being self-catering, on Saturday morning we dropped all the young-uns off at the park and went to the local Lidl for some shopping, then went back and caught up with everyone.

So...
Recommendations:-
1. Food in the park IS expensive generally. Allow for this if you are going to be getting lunch, etc.
2. Parking is VERY expensive. Make sure your pass includes parking. Ours did and it was a good job.
3. Be aware of what you want to do and plan as much as you can. It is too big a site to be going back and forward all day.
4. If you do choose to drive, perhaps plan in a rest-day. We didn't and would have benefited from it.
5. The Halloween Party night is brilliant. We were lucky with the weather being warm as a bonus, but it really was worth it.
6. Try and find out where the ""pop-up"" places are for the characters you want to meet are. They usually stick to the same ones for a few days, so you can usually time it to catch the shorter queues.
7. If you have a Magic Pass, don't forget to make use of the Fastpass options to get on the rides quicker. Fastpasses are limited, so get them on the way in for the key ride you want and plan around it.
8. Whatever you think it costs... add about 25% and you'll be close.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Having been to Disney and being such a big fan as an annual pass holder I could not believe the dissapointment of the night...

-ques for 45 - 50 minutes to get in the park with the
-overpopulated doesn't even cover it could not move.. For a ticketed event we were expecting far less people
-rides open all night my backside!.. All parks other othan discovery land closed down 2 hours before the fireworks leading everyone to the centre cold and bored waiting 1.5 hours for the fireworks
-champagne overpriced at 10 euros a tiny glass
-fastpasses closed till 8 three hours after the 'special' event opened between that and shutting the rides down it was pointless
- couldn't go into studios (not well advertised at all and even some staff thought you could leading us to walk out the park and then get back in a que after been told we couldn't) so now you have to pay over 100 euros to use both parks for the day and then an additional 90 euros for the 'special' event you can only go in from five if your even lucky enough to get in within the hour
-no special events other than a dj party that stars at 10.30
-ques over 35 minutes for a drink most unorganised, slow service
-no extra stalls or special food and half the food places shut couldn't even get a desert I waited all day for
-fireworks in all parks so even if you didn't by a ticket you could go to the lake or the studios and watch a show just as big for the normal ticket and even by the lake for free
-no extra seating for the long waits and little ones waiting stupid times
-couldn't see the parade at all as floats were short and crows rediclous
-worst of all, though the fireworks were different and they had more fireworks set out the actual display was far worse than the and lasted the same amount of time as normal nothing special at all and spent half our time trying to guess what character was being displayed!

So sad Disney you have a lot to answer for all money and no damn about your customers! The only upside was the kind staff

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Such an amazing place that adults as well as the kids can enjoy equally. It is fairly easy to find from off the ferry and the park is well sign posted on the motorway but keep to the speed limit as lot's of speed cameras. Queue times at the park where a bit long at times (Beginning Of April) but we still all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we will be back to experience it again as 2 days just wasn't enough to enjoy all of the rides and experiences on offer. Great place and I would highly recommend this even though I was not that keen on going to begin with. The rides are tamer than say Thorpe Park or Alton Towers rides but where still very enjoyable and the staff where nice and polite and helpful when called upon for help and information. Our kids are 13 & 15 so it was about the thrilling and scary rides and meeting the characters in the park, as my wife also loves the soppy cartoon experience so we had a breakfast with mickey and donald and goofy which cost a small fortune. The Grand Parade at the end of the day is amazing, but the firework display is even more so and definitely worth hanging around for. For memories and a lovely family experience filled with adventure with the family, I cannot recommend this enough if you have younger children and the wife and kids can't wait to experience it nearer to christmas time. The next time round will be in December time and although we know it will be packed out it will be magical for the family and even me too enjoy it.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Disneyland Paris is a magic place but at 30th of December that I visited the 2 parks is a waste of time and money.It was my second time, so I already have been to most shows and games and knew the place.. You can go to 4-5 games max all day as the waiting after 11 am is more than 45-60 minutes for almost all games and for the popular ones goes to 120 min... Ι could not visit the new star wars that I wanted as the waiting time was more than 120 minutes! At the same time at the entrance you can see hundreds οf people waiting to buy tickets and enter into the park so as to wait 2 hours for just one game...

Good for the business.. bad for the visitors.

Maybe they should find a way.. Deciding which is the max visitors capacity in order to maintain high standards at visitors experience.

Finally, the parade which is one of the top attractions is so crowded that you can't see it and for sure we can discuss many safety issues with thousands of people crowded in a few hundred sqm.

With all that, the nerves.. Long waiting lines.. People pushing you around..,so as to pass cause it was over crowded makes the magic go away..

I don't think that was Disney's view when he had the idea for the park.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Horrendous!!! Way too many tickets sold so we were stood at the far end of main street near entrance - only place we could get any view of the castle. Fights on the shuttle busses - no crowd control on the supplied transport - with my grandson injured by pushing and shoving. Paid over £600 - I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO DISNEYLAND PARIS!

No access to Studios - really disappointed! Not able to buy hot drinks as queues were so long.

Couldn't see parades as too many people lining the streets. Disney put Profit before Memories - Shame on you completely disgusted.

Only thing that you wait long even if you have the fast track .over all it's a super nice memory for all of us",Jun 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Not quite as big as Disneyland California (and without the new Star Wars land), but similar enough and much cheaper, which made it worth going to while we were in Paris. We live a hour away from Disneyland California and have avoided going because of the crowds and cost. It was also wonderful that the RER train was so easy to take from Paris; it drops you off at the front gates of Disneyland! I think it's a must do if you have kids and have the time to spend a full day out there.",Nov 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"We visited Disneyland Paris, probably during their busiest time of the year. When entering the park it is like entering another universe and becoming a child again. We thoroughly enjoyed the parades doing down main street and it is worth it to go and stand next to main street between 15 and 20 minutes before the parade starts to ensue that you are at the front and have a perfect view. The shops had a nice variety and the staff were very helpful and friendly. When you do your shopping, you can ask them to keep your bags for you while you enjoy the park and then come and collect it a bit later. There are a few downsides though... We couldn't get to the princess encounter as the waiting time increases rapidly and can very easily get to 120 min within an hour or two after the park opens. All the princesses are also not available at the encounter as there is only one available at a time, which does not make it worth while and is really disappointing to a small girl. The Disneyland Paris app really helped us to determine the waiting times for the different rides which helped us to plan our day. It is worthwhile to connect to Disney's wi-fi so that you can use the app as the app needs wi-fi. The downside is that we weren't told and there was no indication that you had to book a specific time if you want to meet and greet Mickey Mouse which meant that we couldn't get to him during our visit. Thus if you have small kids, I will advise to book a slot with Mickey mouse way in advance, especially if you have limited time in the park. The parks organising in terms of the New year's fireworks was out of this world. They kept the two groups separately when the park closed and those who had tickets for the fireworks were guided through clearly marked directions on where to go. If you want to be in front for the fireworks, you need to go to the castle quite early on in the evening as it gets full quite quickly. There is also a new year's eve parade, which is very long, but worth every moment, make sure you get a spot on main street early on in the evening otherwise you miss most of the parade. I will definitely go back for the fireworks as it is better organised than most events I've attended.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Visited here for 6 days over christmas. Stayed in Newport bay hotel and walked to the park every day. We had 4 children with us who found it a magical experience. Adults and children will be amazed with this place. While you wait a very long time to have a pic taken with a character or to go on a ride it’s the attention detail that keeps you going back. Why you wait in most queues there is animations or decorations that are so well made they keep you interested while the queues go down. Our children are 11,11,8 and 6 and they did find the standing round day after day boring. In the end they didn’t want to go on the rides because of the wait. We did plenty of rides tho and they were all amazing. There’s shops everywhere but all selling the same merchandise. The food is very poor for what you pay except macdonalds which is always the same. It’s impossible to get a decent cup of tea, it’s either powdered milk or they give you black tea and look at you funny if you ask for milk. France must run on coffee alone!! There’s plenty of toilets and water fountains around. The Christmas parade was so magical I can’t put it into words. It uplifted you’re soul to watch it and made it feel so Christmassy, especially when it snowed bubbles!!! You ache in places you never knew you had because it’s just walk walk walk!!! Overall a wonderful experience I’m so glad we did but not the kind of place I would want to make my regular holiday destination.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Positives: Joyful parade started shortly after we entered and made the place seem magical. This feeling was short lived.

Reality: Huge crowds, rides with wait times well over an hour, many rides out of service, restaurants with huge wait times and very poor value.

If you like standing in the queue this is the place for you.

Never ever again.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,"Disneyland Paris was just an amazing trip. Download wait time apps and check it carefully to manage your time the best. We did Walt Disney Studios first - my children weren’t too bothered about shoes but wanted to see parades and do the rides. I travelled with 17,9,7 year olds and they were tall enough to ride everything. I would recommend this time of year as it wasn’t as busy as I thought. New Year however happens to be much busier- long queues etc. I hadn’t bothered with fast passes I genuinely didn’t think it made a bit of difference for us. We got to the parks for 8:45 and stayed late into the night.
Positives:
Clean- no litter/ clean toilets
Amazing rides- plan the big ones do you limit your queue time.
Book restaurants in advance or eat in the Disney Village go as cheap or as expensive as you like there.

Negatives- go prepared with snacks and drinks (€3-4 each drink). The shops get busy whether it’s the cake/ coffees or the Disney merchandise- at times it’s impossible to get through !
All in all 2-3 days is plenty to explore and have the most magical time

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Just came back from 3 day visit with family with a 4 and 7 year old and 6 adults which included 2 x 20 year olds. Was absolutely disgusted, hardly went on any rides as queues were at least an hour or longer for rides that lasted less than 3 minutes. We split up to queue for different rides but all had same experience. We also found it hard to find anywhere to buy a drink and something to eat but no problem at all falling into the multiple carts/shops selling all the memorabilia. No Disney characters walking about like they used to, you now have to down load an app to get a ‘meet and greet’ booking. We did this first thing as soon as it came live at 0945 and was given a slot for Pluto at 1630 needless to say we were in a different area when the time came so didn’t make it also when we got to our Buzz time slot 2 hours after trying to book it, we were told Buzz was sick and Woody came instead (duh I thought they were people dressed up not the real thing 😉). Also can’t believe the ‘meet and greet’ were just to have a photo with them, what a rip off. On a good note though,it did look magical (when we weren’t getting pushed out of the way by the thousands of people there), it was spotlessly clean and the parade was great. It is our opinion they let far to many people in and they are not prepared for all the crowds. In other words Disney is just greedy. I wouldn’t rush back, I just wasted a bag load of money.

Having stayed in one of the park hotels we managed to make the most of extra magic time - if you can, do this. The rides were great, staff were helpful and polite. The entire location was beautifully clean.
The restaurants were great. Lots of little food places as well and the little shop that sold coffee and doughnuts/cakes was delicious. Food prices are slightly more than we would normally pay for such things in the UK but firstly, to be expected - you are at Disney and also the quality is far superior (it isn't even that much of a price difference).
I would happily visit again and compliment all the staff on making it a wonderful visit - thank you!

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Was expecting great things from a Christmas at Disneyland Paris but unfortunately did not live up to expectations. Spent 3 nights/4 days at the Newport Bay club which was an ok hotel with a lovely breakfast buffet- recommend that. However, as was our previous experience the concierge staff have a lot to learn in regards to customer relations- very abrupt and unfriendly, and that’s pretty common throughout the whole park actually. Maybe it’s just the ‘French’ way I don’t know. The security is way over the top- confiscated our cheese knife we bought in Paris, locked it in a safe and rudely told my husband that if we lost the key we would have to pay €100! Seriously? The other gripe we have is the completely ridiculous late time the Illuminations show was on- 10 pm??! Way to late for families with exhausted children. Also, they allow too many people into the park and the wait times for rides is completely ridiculous- upwards of 100 minutes for a 2 minute ride!! Not worth the hassle!

The parade, music, characters, decorations etc were so magical and it was made even more wonderful by the very realistic fake snow falling in Main Street! It was just beautiful.

The park is kept immaculately clean, with a great team constantly tidying begging guests.

All casts members are great, a special shout out to Julien who sold us our annual passes and then remembered us whenever he saw us around the park during our stay. He became a friend and it was like we’d always know him. Pure Disney runs through his veins.

We have no complaints at all and can’t wait for 2020 to get some more magic with our new Infinity passes.

One of the many things we loved was they make it snow on cue, MAGIC. The parades, Micky's Christmas big band in the Animagique Theatre, Studio Tram tour (behind the magic) Action stunt show spectacular, and of course the Illuminations not to be missed. The way they decorate everything for Christmas and as it gets dark it all lights up, fabulous. We enjoyed the buffalo Bill show too, worth every penny. Small negatives, the water fountains didn't all work so difficult to refill water bottles, the lighting of the paths after dark was poor. Getting a coffee/tea small is the only choice except Mcdonalds could have done with more vendors in the parks with bigger cups. Would I go again..... Of course I would.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"We visited Disneyland Paris for Christmas. The park is very pretty and has a similar layout to Disney World in Orlando. The main difference we found is that it’s very difficult to get on rides. The mobile app doesn’t help very much and the FastPass isn’t well indicated either. If you don’t study the park and schedule ahead of time you will waste a lot of time walking around. The mobile app for Disney World in Orlando helps you manage your visit much better.

On the plus side, Disneyland Paris is very pretty and well decorated. The evening light show and fireworks at Cinderella’s castle was top notch. The other positive is that the Disney Studios park is a 5 minute walk from the main park. Overall, and enjoyable visit but we were left somewhat disappointed.

Clean, friendly and people enjoying themselves. Ensure you do the Studio first then the Play park if planning to do it in one day as the play park stays open till later. Be there early as there’s many to do and see. Recommend lunch at the Lucky Nugget restaurant.",Dec 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"As theme parks go it’s impressive. Kids loved it. Rides are good and max wait for the 2 popular rides was 70 mins. The rest ranged from 10 mins to 35 mins. Kids faces was worth the entry fee.

If you are staying on site getting up and taking advantage of the first hour just for hotel guests makes a real difference. You can hit 2 or 3 rides in that time.

Downsides - you’d think disney would be able to crowd manage more effectively? Surely they are experts at this by now? As an example, the crowd at the end of the fireworks was like the worst football matches I have ever been too but with the added benefit of looking after 2 young kids.....not good. Restaurants are poor....long queues and rubbish food. Come prepared.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Notwithstanding the opportunity to sell you junk at every step of the way and a severe lack of places to sit down (and eat/drink), the staff seem uniformed and disorganised. Several parades were cancelled without notice without any form of communication, unhelpful at the entrance gates given huge queues but young staff lacking common sense to allow use of other access gates or to open gates despite a large amount of staff hanging around chatting. A severe IT failure in December 2019 meant many plastic access tickets weren’t working running up to Christmas so one had to queue (get used to that) to validate paper tickets then re-queue (seriously) back at the main entrance. Took us 1.5 hours to get through. Farcical. Our three young children were non-plussed about the whole place and seemed more adults sucked in by the whole affair (probably the only ones who can afford it). Our 5 fast pass tickets (there is an irony) we’re only valid on a few rides; unfortunately the ones our children didn’t want to go on..... Recommendation? Avoid like the plague.

We couldn't make it to Florida this year so we thought we would try Disneyland Paris which we'd only visited once when it first opened so we looked at tripadvisor to get an idea of what to expect. There were so many negative posts, it sounded dated, tired and not much fun at all..the staff are rude, nobody smiles, oh dear can it really be this bad? We deliberated for more than a week checking trip advisor daily for new posts before booking and in the end decided we should try it for ourselves, make up our own mind and not compare it to Florida. We booked the Newport Bay Club for 3 nights and off we went..Well we had the best time..it was completely magical, we simply could not believe all the negative comments, in short ,make up your own mind do not be put off by other peoples negativity, if you love Disney you will certainly find the magic here and as for the rude staff, we find if you are nice to people they will be nice back.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I booked Christmas at Disney for our young family to stay 2 nights, 28th to 30th December 2019. We flew from Australia (19hrs with two small children). I paid a deposit upfront with no option to pay in full. Since booking every time I logged in to pay the balance the website has been experiencing technical problems and errors and have been unable to view our booking. I have called multiple times, have been on the phone for hours on hold and haven’t been able to speak to a single person. Being a premier international number this has cost me a lot of money. I have also sent several request/help forms via the website as there are no direct email address online with again no response. On the 18th (2 days ago) I received an email to say please pay otherwise your booking will be canceled. I have been on the phone for 2 days non stop again with no response. I logged in to find my booking has been cancelled! After another few hours on hold I finally spoke to a real person who informed me there was nothing they can do and to make a new booking. Now there is no availability to make a new booking. Flying half way around the world to now tell our kids we can’t go to Disney and have no accomodation is devastating. This has been a dream for our family and I have never experienced such poor Customer service. Disney even apologised for their website being down and having issues but won’t help?! Disappointed and broken hearted.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"We have visited multiple Disney parks in our life and we decided to give Disneyland Paris a go despite the numerous not so good reviews and we decided to splurge on staying at the Disneyland Hotel itself. The location and decor was the only great thing in the hotel, but the price of the hotel is much doubtful when we are downright discriminated by some of the staff which pulls down the overall experience. We have never felt disappointed and unhappy and eagerly excited to leave Disneyland as a whole in our whole life being really avid fans of Disney and traveling around for all the different parks. Majority of the staff were polite but they did not carry the theme and hype of Disney.

After traveling to many parks, Disneyland Paris took away the magic and totally diminished any magic left in us.

Particularly several staff that you may have to interact with a lot such as the hotel receptionists handling the checking in and out. None of the staff were helpful with baggage, none of the staff were initiative. Particularly, Arianna, please beware that you have to be in her books or you shall be downright discriminated and treated as a fool for being a hotel guest in their most expensive hotel.

French strikes meant that staff had to arrive into work 2 hours before- but staff never seemed angry, or upset. They had a smile on their faces. The performances at disneyland were amazing.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"If you've never been to ANY Disney park, the kids will still enjoy ok.
Smoking is permitted almost everywhere outdoors, and was overwhelming.
A piece of chicken + fries was 17€.Can´t buy fries alone. I'd actually recommend getting kids' menu (chickenburger/fries/drink/ice cream) for everyone (8.99€).
Access from centre of Paris easy - use the stop in Auber, as this ensures you have a seat.
Simply doesn't compare with any park in the USA or Asia.",Dec 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"We had a great time but....
This places is an overcrowded, outdated rip-off simply cashing in on being Disney.
This is our second visit, both being at Christmas. This time we stayed at the Disneyland hotel (I’ll review separately) but needless to say that ain’t great either.

Last time we stayed at sequoia lodge but when we priced up staying there again, character lunches and wild bills it was pretty much the same price as staying at the Disneyland hotel where it was all packaged together.

The magic hours are a god send. We really made the most of these and used them to get on everything we wanted numerous times (we had 3 days of these). The average queues outside of the magic hours for any of these rides was at least an hour. (Peter pan, hyperspace mountain, buzz light year, mine train etc). Being prepared for this we instead booked in all the character meals, took in the parades and shows, generally made the most of the Disney experience.

It’s not all bad. The parades and shows are really really good. As are the character lunches and the general being Disney stuff.

The problem with this place is it’s pretty small. There’s probably as many attractions in Alton towers. The place needs updating, Disney Florida are constantly expanding and updating but when did Paris last get a new ride/park that wasn’t a rehash of a previous one. It simply isn’t big enough in terms of attractions to take the number of visitors.

It’s also a massive rip off, food and drink prices are beyond a joke. You even need a small mortgage for a coke or a bag of crisps.

Then there’s the smoking and queue jumping. Smoking is everywhere, even in the queues. Staff do not challenge it even when it’s right in front of them. I even smelt cannabis at one point.

I knew before I went this was the last time we would go. We went for the Disney Christmas experience. We loved it and the kids loved it.

Is it value for money: absolutely not. Do they care: clearly not!

One thing that stuck out to me was half the restaurants and carts were closed on both visits!

The decorations were beautiful and the rides are awesome like always. It’s a must stop for any Disney lover.",Dec 2019
France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Disneyland is great fun for all ages it really is. We were very disappointed to discover that if you have the half board dining plan, you had to book to eat at a buffet restaurant. We were not informed of this beforehand and it spoilt our day somewhat to be told by a rude french lady that we could not have a table as we hadn't booked. We then had to queue for 40 minutes for a counter service burger. The only way you can book restaurants before you go is to call the restaurant- this is no good if you are in the UK as of course you would be calling a french number.

Best to get fastpass on some of the rides (Thunder Mountain & Buzz Lightyear) but we didn't queue for any ride longer then 25 minutes.

The parades are lovely to watch and the fireworks are really good. Good idea to stay in a Disney Hotel close to the park because the shuttle buses get very busy when the fireworks are over.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"The staff at Disneyland Paris are rude and not helpful. Not a smile on anyone’s face. It is definitely a bucket list with no return.

1. Most of the rides are shorter than California. For example, the RC Races does two swings only. It’s a Small World runs only a for six minutes while California runs for over 10 minutes.

2. Buzz light year guns don’t work. They go off and on.

3. Staff are always chatting to each other and they don’t smile to the general public. This is literally throughout Disneyland Paris.

4. While I was trying to purchase an expensive glass rose from one of their shops, two staff members kept talking to each other. One of them was actually trying to complete my transaction. They seemed to be annoyed that I had a few questions to ask.

5. Audrey from Hypersapce was standing at the front entrance. She seemed to be upset about something. I asked her if the single rider is open. She scolded me and questioned why I ask. Not a smile on her face. Very rude. However, I dare you to find more than five staff members through the park who know how to smile or are genuinely wanting to help.

6. Disney charters are hidden behind closed doors with none to see. Waiting time 90 minutes plus at least.

7. The food is not too bad.

Would I have cancelled this trip if I go back in time, maybe not because I needed to experience it myself with my family.

Am I going to come back, definitely not. Especially with the rude staff, short and dated rides.

Did I enjoy the rides. Yes I did but nowhere to compare to Disneyland California.

We came amid the French strikes so I rho k quite a few of the pop up stall around the park selling popcorn, snacks and got chocolate etc were shut we assumed this was due to lack of staff, we found the quick service food to be really good, and about the right price for theme parks, we tried a couple of table service restaurants and captain Jack's was a huge dissapointment which we were gutted about as we are such big fans of the franchise, the staff could of been friendlier and appear to enjoy their jobs more than they did. We understand it isnt florida but the staff are still hired as Disney employees with the same principles although sadly only two members of staff came across as friendly and he uinely welcoming, maybe staff were stressed due to strikes?!

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"This was our first visit to Paris after visiting Orlando 3 times.... The magic is just not there.
On so many occasions over the last 4 days we have had to interact with cast members who really don't look as if they want to be there.

For instance the service we had from a few in the disney parc, shops etc and buying coffee, they also struggled to understand English when I was asking for hot chocolate and a shortbread biscuit and get quite agitated that I didn't speak French which I found very unprofessional and I noticed this in several places.

Also in my opinion there is a huge lack of manners from the majority. Even when I say thank you first.
Places to buy hot drinks were also few and far between or shut!!
It's December and it's freezing so that did bother me somewhat, we need more options for hot drink stalls.

Magis hours in fact only means half the park opens which we were not aware of, so after we had done the rides in fantasy land we the had a long boring wait for the rest to open.

The illuminations were amazing, crowds very busy, alot more pushing and shoving from adults!! Even if you have broken arm in a sling as I did and a mum on walking sticks.

Half board meal plan was great. The rides were awesome. The weather was kind. We did have an enjoyable time overall.

Although I still have to emphasize that the cast members should apply for these jobs knowing that they are about to spend their working day in what is popularly known for being the happiest place on earth.... I was not made to feel this way. Which was a let down for me. I wouldn't rush back to a place with no magic.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Disneyland itself was amazing. Everyone was polite and fluent in French and English. Hotels were clean and quiet. It lost major marks however on the closing if the park. They start moving people towards main street by shutting rides and eating establishments. This started at 16:30 when people start looking for food for dinner. By 17:00, only a hotdog restaurant remains open on main street. Take a packed lunch or prepare to queue. Huge queues at the village too as a good number decide to try outside.
There is also poor coordination just outside of the park at the bus station to the disney hotels. It's a mass exodus with overcrowding on limited buses. I saw children and wheelchair users nearly being trampled. It was disgraceful and an accident waiting to happen. Awful way to finish each day after the firework display.

Other than these two very big issues, it was nearly a perfect holiday.

There are big lines to some attractions but this is something you are aware of before you go. If I may recommend anything is that if you have 2days and budget for it stay there for two days and just enjoy the moment and don’t rush.
Now...
I’m not the one who is complaining without a real reason.
Unfortunately there was a huge disappointment and I think Disneyland manager should better take care of the crew they are hiring for security that is very important but the person that are working at the gates and their behaviour is totally unacceptable. They are so rude! I had to stay 15min only in my T-shirt in -2celcious as one of the guard was checking every single button in my jacket. The whole procedure to get there for our family took very long so you can imagine staying at the gates with kids because someone is shouting at you in French and telling you to undress.
Same rude people are working at the lockers on the main station. There were shouting at us in french and didn’t took in the end our bags in the end so we had to walk with everything.

However I do still find there should be more random characters as every day there are the exact same characters bar one or 2 surprise ones. Fir the number of guests every day there really should be a character everywhere you look.

We only visited for 3 days, and didn't manage to see everything. I suppose if you went during quieter times it would've been possible.
The rides for younger children are great and they have loads of them.

Having done Florida a few times I would definitely say this is on a smaller scale, price for price I think I would rather go to the states. The firework show was really good with various songs/movies being projected onto the castle. Prices for food and drink inside the park are of course are expensive but there is no restriction on bringing your own, also small back packs were allowed on the rides including Space Mountain.

The lines do not move fast and many rides do not accommodate many riders, so plan accordingly. Our plan was to do both parks in one day, not a reality and we missed many attractions due to this one day plan. They also repair many rides during the off season. This all said, we loved the park. The atmosphere is different from the American theme parks, the buildings are french and a multi-cultural experience. The cast members are helpful. Skip Chef Remy - big disappointment in food quality and service - plus the time and slow service. Better to grab the same or better food from quick service.

I have always been a Disney person, from watching the animated films, reading books, it's just a form of escapism for me. I have visited Disney World Orlando several times, with my son and on my own. I have made so many amazing memories at the parks and it brings me back to my childhood. I can never tire of it and guess I would be pushing a Zimmer frame in old age going around the parks.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I went to Disneyland Paris two weeks ago and I had only disappointment.
I really like the Winter Mickey show (went on it twice) but everything else was wait and no gain. The Frozen II attraction with Anna and Elsa is just awful. The waiting time was about 2.5 hours and once you are in, they created as system where everyone packs in at the very front and the little ones cannot see anything. my little one was dying to see Elsa and Anna but she kind of maybe saw part of Elsa's hand waiving.
I also think staff is rude and pretend they dont speak English (just use another language that they don't understand and they reply back in perfect English). Food from the shops is just expensive and not worth the queues and also agree that since its launch, this park has been milking from the Disney name/theme, but not doing much to stay afloat. And there is no way I am queuing over 50min to see Mickey mouse or the princesses. if these are top attractions, why not have more of those on busy days? I am looking for suggestions of other parks to go with family, as I am definitely giving Disneyland Paris a miss for the next few years, as I was left too cold from the wait and frustrated with the weak attractions to get back.

Then we left to go to Park 2 . We played Hyper-Space mountain, Star Tours and Buzz light year. Then we headed to Frontier-land to play the Big Thunder Mountain and to get on the big sailing ship. Afterwards, we played the Pirates of the Caribbean and finally at Fantasyland we played it's a small world.

The Christmas Parade was unmissable ! The songs, colors and everything was perfect. Afterwards we loved the All Characters parade followed by the greatest lighting of the Christmas tree and finally the big famous Disney Illumination Show.
