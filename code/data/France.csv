France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Every time I am in Paris, I visit it. I like all their exhibitions what they change. I take my 1,5 hours on new exhibition and 30 min to look on my impressionists highlights.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The Orsay is a wonderful museum in a beautiful old train station on the Seine. It has a light, bright calm feeling where you can enjoy the art. The Impressionist collection is the star. I suggest to start on the top floor (by the giant clock face) and work your way down). It's great to go on Thursday evenings when they are open until 9:45pm and there are less people. The audio tour was a small extra fee and had good info (plus an augmented realty view of the train station through history). Buy your tickets in advance from the museum's OFFICIAL website (others will charge you more).",Oct 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This was my favorite museum in Paris. I loved seeing my favorite impressionists—Monet, Van Gogh, Manet, Degas, and more.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"I was a little bit skeptical of this museum since i am not a big impressionist fan. I was wrong. This is a fabulous museum. It's really big so if you have limited time focus on the masters - Van goth, Monet, Renior etc,.. When we were there they had most of their paintings on the 5th floor but there was also a special exhibit on the first floor with some really cool stuff as well. Van Goth's Starry Night alone is worth the price of admission.
Go early - we had skip the line tickets for 9:30 am on Sunday and the crowd was light. By the tome we left around 1 the museum was pretty full.
This a do not miss place in Paris.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"After traveling via the red eye to Paris, we decided to push through the jetlag and use the afternoon to sightsee. The museum is open late so we decided to go there. There are works from several famous painters including Manet, Monet, Cezanne, etc. Housed in a beautiful old building along the Seine, there is plenty to see here..... perhaps too much. Wander through the gallerys that interest you and move along. There is likely too much here to see everything. Recommended",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We went early on the first Sunday of October. It was free admission. By the time we left, it was standing room only.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"d'Orsay is smaller and generally less crowded than the Louvre, but whereas the Louvre probably takes a couple of visits to completely view, Musee d'Orsay is easier to view in a few hours - this was my impression on a first time visit in September, however, I think one of the floors was closed temporarily. The works displayed here are fantastic and generally more accessible than the Louvre on a crowded day.",Sep 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"We chose to visit the Musee d'Orsay in Paris rather than one of the larger museums, like the Louvre. We spent about 3 hours wandering through the many rooms and halls of beautiful sculptures, paintings, and fascinating exhibits. The famous Monet and Van Gogh painting were absolutely gorgeous! When we left, we felt like we saw a lot, but were not totally overwhelmed. Beautiful old building as well. Amazing how the old train station was converted into an excellent space for a museum. Great experience!",Sep 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This spectacular old train station and its art collection are indeed better than Louvre. Wish I had read earlier review and started on fifth floor because by the time we got there and walked out for a magnificent view across the Seine, we were pooped from climbing, standing and listening to too much audio guide.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"1. It was my 5th time in Paris and I still think that it's the best art museum in Paris. Of course if you like impressionism ;)

2. The best pictures of impressionists and postimpressionists are here like Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Deags, Gauguin.

3. There is sculpture also, mainly on the ground floor.

4. Important for parents! Children have free entry and for you as a parent price is reduced (you pay 13 Euro, not 16 Euro).

5. Moving around is also quite easy. It's not so easy to get lost like in other museums of Paris.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This is the finest collection of Impressionist Art in the world, I believe. Buy your tickets for an early entrance as the Museum gets crowded even in Covid times. The audioguide is well done and worth the cost. But don’t try to listen to every available work or you will be exhausted before seeing all the highlights. Start at the top since that is the most popular and becomes crowded. There is an outdoor space near the coffee shop that was a good place to take a break and enjoy the Paris skyline. If you only go to one museum besides the Louvre, make it this one!",Sep 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"This museum has a truly massive collection. If you like Impressionist art this is where you want to go. Paintings by Monet and Renoir as well as a number of original Van Gogh works grace the walls everywhere you look. My personal favorite are the massive paintings that can be found on the bottom floor. I believe that the first Sunday of the month is free and there are a few other discounts that you can get. They are listed on the website. All in all, this place is worth a visit if you appreciate good art.",Sep 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"There are few iconic paintings that anyone, from anywhere, from any age and from any culture, can recognise. The Musee d'Orsay has all of them. The incredible value of this museum is all there. You saw them in postcards, school books, social meme, on TV, everywhere (!), here you'll see them for real and they're breathtaking. A thorough visit may take 2-3 hours, but to see the world-known masterpieces, one hour and a half may well be enough. Top floor, plus some paintings hidden on the lower floors... go find them ;-) Don't miss Rodin's Gates of Hell. PS: 5th visit to date.",Sep 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"2 weeks agoNEW

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,I enjoy the Musee d'Orsay so much that I've visited it multiple times. The entire collection is impressive but the impressionist collection is especially wonderful.

My tip would be to go early and start on the top floors (impressionist and post-impressionist collection) and you will have considerably fewer crowds.,Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The Orsay Gallery is a great place to enjoy impressionist works. On the first floor, there are many sculpture on display. The building of Orsay Gallery is one of the three great art treasures of nowadays.",Aug 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Make sure you get a plan and be aware that some of the good stuff is right up top! But just like IKEA, it seems, expect to have to go through everything to get where you want to go. Fantastic museum, even for just the architecture. Plenty of the impressionists' and post impressionists' work on display here. Allow plenty of time. Free cloakroom. Audio guides are good but it seems there isn't commentary on a lot in the museum - all the important ones have some commentary. Overall, a wonderful Museum.",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,I've been visiting the Musee d'Orsay for 22 years. And each visit is a privilege. Feel very fortunate to be based in London - a short train ride away from this former beautifully converted train station.,Jul 2021

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Utterly lovely collection in a gorgeous setting. Some of the escalators were out of service for our visit, but this was not a problem. I particularly loved architecture around the Art Nouveau collection - throughout the building, your eye is drawn to the details of the original train station, which adds to the whole experience. Great crowd management due to Covid-prevention rules meant that it did not get too busy while we were there.",Aug 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"Absolutely no lines here and they have some outstanding art, especially from the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, the original ""Dr. Gachet"" being probably my favorite.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"What used to be a railway station and a hotel has now turned into a museum. Such an impressive building, which was built on a golden era, where the architects surely took the extra step in designing an over the top building.

This is a must see while in Paris, not only because of the amazing art collections it features from time to time, but also as an architectural monument, a piece of art by itself! Lovely to observe from the outside at all times of the day and night throughout the year.

France,Musée d'Orsay,4.0,"Excellent museum, for sure.....
YET in this review, I'd like to nudge museum administration about the quality of toilet facilities -- the 3 women's toilets on the 6th floor (yes, only 3) were poorly equipped (all missing paper).

For a popular, top-notch Paris museum open to the public who pay for the privilege of entering,it is ""la moindre des choses"" to offer a decent standard of hygiene to those who come to the museum.

France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"If you love art, especially the Impressionist period, then this is it! Buy your tickets in advance to skip the lines (we went in 2021, so less lines due to Covid, but normally very crowded). The building itself is also beautiful which adds the experience. Lovely restaurant inside (closed for Covid, so check before you go).",Jun 2021
France,Musée d'Orsay,5.0,"The entire experience is WOW factor! The history of the building itself is amazing, it is just so spectacularly beautiful that is difficult to believe that someone actually wanted to demolish it - thank goodness it was preserved and converted to a museum. The art collection is just so impressive, there really does have to be something in here to please everyone. The collection of art nouveau furniture is greater than anything I have ever seen and the collection of impressionist work is the most impressive point for my visit. Just so overwhelmed to see some of the works I have in print at home, actually hanging here on the walls - just wonderful really. Loved every minute of it.

The church has a very interesting history and has played a prominent role in city events over the past several centuries. Steeply enmeshed in Marseille’s nautical background, people would come here to seek God’s assistance in the return of loved ones lost at sea.

As mentioned before, it's a steep trek up the mountain, but the number 60 bus from the old port leaves you at the base of the stairs.

Unless you want to go to mass, avoid mass times or be prepared to stand in line to enter. Votives and tapers can be bought at several places at the basilica and while there's a rack or two for votives in the basilica, most of them are placed outside the crypt on the 4th floor. There's a special room for tapers there as well; it's about the size of a big closet and you leave your lit candle at small window and the man inside then places it, (I had the image that he was there atoning for some sins; it was in the 30's (C) outside, so in there it must have been a sauna.)

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,5.0,"Nice interior, but it's all about the views of the city. Take the #60 city bus to get here. Only 2 euro per person - can pay in change on the bus. Or take the Petit-Train hop-on hop-off. Half the price of hop-on ColorBus, AND saves you 100 vertical feet (10 stories high) of stair and hill climbing vs the ColorBus stop at Notre Dame.
The 60 bus runs every 15 minutes or so, needs no tickets and stops at Notre Dame at the same hilltop stop as Petit-Train. The 60 bus runs from virtually the same Old Port stop (near Metro Vieux Port stop) where both Petit-Train and ColorBus also stop.
And if you take the #60 bus down from Notre Dame, it passes by (and also stops at) old port and goes right to the MUCEM museum - very handy!
PS. The Petit-Train is also called Train Touristique de Marseille.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Lovely place to go with the kids, or even as a group of adults. Be prepared for a very long walk to get into the park. Even though the car park wasn’t full, we found it extremely busy (i think it must be unbearable when it’s full!) and didn’t go on many rides because we would have had to wait for 45 to 120 minutes in a queue for a two-minute. We mostly stuck to the less popular activities (carousel, labyrinth, circus train) which was great for our 5 year old. Unfortunately, it rained heavily before the parade was due, so it was a very small parade. Still, we had a great time.
Everything is overpriced, be it food or gifts, but you know that before you go and everything is magical and special anyway, so as long as you’re prepared, it’s a nice treat.
We were a little disappointed that there was not much sign of Halloween when it was supposed to be Halloween-themed until 7 November and we were there on 1-2 November.

After many rearrangements we finally made it for October half term - even with covid you can still feel the magic & even I at 28 years old was like a child 😂 we had tickets included with our hotel stay. Getting into the park in the morning for early magic hours was a little chaotic. Getting through security and bag checks was quick it was the queue to get into the park that was large. We weren’t made aware that there was a separate entrance for hotel guests round the side that had a quicker moving queue til day 3. My daughters favourite ride was big thunder mountain and her favourite character meet was Jack Skellington, he was fantastic and engaging, he spoke to her for ages about her buzz light year costume. We were in the park all day from around 8.50 in the morning til 9 at night. We loved it so much we’re already looking at prices and dates to return. Such a magical 💫 place. The rides were well maintained. However we got on buzz light year ride at 9am and it broke down and we were stuck for about 10 mins 🙈 We had a green pass for my daughter and it was the saviour for our trip, the longest we waited in the disability queue was 35 minutes for RC racer in the studios park.

It holds a lot of love in our hearts, although the only issue is that on the second day when we went back it was crazy busy and that's one of the big issues people complain about, but otherwise it's very recommneded.

What you may also need to think about when going in is food and drinks which maybe expensive if you eat in Disney village, but i would recommend going to Planet Hollywood and Rainforest Cafe and sharing food because it is such big portions.

The park is nice, ""magic"", for children, disney, etc...

But the business machine make it detestable.

After paying the travelling, hotel and the pass to the park, you are part of the crowd, that has to spend a lot of minutes (30-45-75) even hours!, for an ""attraction"" of a park.

No seats (just to seat), no free water (many/all fountains said that are ""non-operational"", nothing to buy just for basic eating (bread, ham, cheese, salad) apart from the expensive restaurants with limited places.

Many people do not wear properly their masks (included in the attractions where we are sited close) and there is nobody to dispute them. Even worse, there are many people smoking everywhere, and also people thinking that their ""vaporised"" stuff is allowed to be breathed and smoked by the ""others"".

Despite Disneyland citing covid as to why parades and firework shows were cancelled the park was busier than ever .

The parades that did go ahead were short and “ boring “ according to my 6yr old. They were 1-4 floats long with few performers compared to 2 years ago where they 10+ floats and 100+ performers.

The place completely lacked magic and excitement with the scaffold and boarding everywhere , long ride wait times and entertainment that would struggle to amuse a new born.

The rides are old and tired and really arnt worth the wait , the food is tasteless and overpriced, the staff are miserable and under trained .

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"I have been going to Disney land Paris evey five years since they opened in April 1992. I do not want to put a spoiler on this theme park as children love disney but the shame part is disney seem to have lost sight of what it is all about and how it was first started by Walt disney. Please do not get me wrong i am as big a child as the rest of you loving disney but Its all become a money spinning project and away from the magic that he intended. I have just come back from Disney Paris as it has not long re-opened since the covid 19 take over. Firstly the queues can be unbearable most rides did not open until 10.am. So that was disappointing. There is no fast track anymore and the staff do cram you in which we found in a lot of things at the park, the places they wanted to make money otherwise they used good old covid as the excuse. Mask wearing is for most people a done thing but we did see quite a lot of people wearing the masks under their nose or chin. That said there is hand sanitisers everywhere you go. Rides its the amount of time you have to queue and then the disappointment of the shortnest of the ride these seem to have shortened over the years and the most disappointing rides for me were the train ride around the film making part where you saw items from films how they made the films etc to be replaced by CARS my grandson found this boring. There is no longer the fun film set that you see how they make moving car chases etc. there is a lot of change and i can understand but its the magic that has disappeared. Food restaurants you need to book in advance otherwise you stand for up to an hour to be told sorry you should have booked. A simple sign at the venue in the queue would have helped, so many people were being turned away unaware of this new rule. The food areas where you could get food was so expensive and it was just burgers, chips etc fast food in other words. The main parade that was at 17.30 consisted of four floats and not the whole parade that used to be so long and wonderful. Their reasoning is they do not want crowds to be gathering.... sorry i could not see the reasoning behind this. You can be crammed into the haunted house, crammed in a long line of people where 1 meter apart was not adhered to or insisted by the work force. crammed into queues for food etc. so it made no sense. The merchandise is very expensive now and also they have made some shops into food places. Again its all about money and profit and making up for lost revenue lost and caused by covid. Its mainly the queues the huge amount of people the prices and change in rides that is the real kill joy. Children crying because shows were fully booked as soon as they opened or their legs hurt because of the long queues. Our grandson was so disappointed, we bought a three day ticket so we could sustain the activities into smaller portions but even then it never helped and we left the park early. The park was very clean this i noticed with no rubbish anywhere. Pirates of the carribbeen , haunted house rides like this are really good, Pinochio was very boring and not worth the queue. Enjoy your time there but we aware of queues, prices and book if you want a decent meal..

Disney is all about the magic....
it’s true the park is packed. There are queues for everything. BUT there has always been queues! The food is pretty rubbish - so take a packed lunch if you can. We went with a young family- all under 6. For us, there was no need to go on the “proper “rollercoasters. The atmosphere was amazing , we saw so many characters ( including Mickey) and went on 4/5 kids rides each day (we had a 3 day pass ). There were 3 parades (princess/dragon and Mickey parade) and everyone really enjoyed them. It wasn’t perfect, but we really enjoyed our Disney break and the kids will have great memories forever.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"Having just returned from DLP for a 4 day trip I thought passing on a few observations, opinions etc might be worthwhile to some. So here goes. For the record, as a family with 2 kids, we had an awesome time, we managed to do everything we had planned and more, yes there are still lots of things not happening at the park due to “COVID” but still plenty to see and do and worth making the trip. Firstly, meals, MUST be pre booked if you want to eat in a restaurant, otherwise expect to wait in a queue for an eternity to be served crisps, there is zero urgency from kiosk/food outlet staff so make sure you book. We ate at the Agrabah and Billie Bobs restaurants, both of which were fantastic with huge range of foods. The App is worth downloading and using, the queue information is constantly updated and accurately reflects the queues making planning easier. Some rides, were ridiculously short for the horrendous queue times, the inside ones like Pinnichio, Snow White and Peter Pan are great but unless you are a super fan, they are not worth queuing over and hour for a 2 minute ride, just not worth it. Worse though are the outside rides like Flying Elephants, slinky dog, Aladdin carpet etc, queue times always over and hour for a ride that lasts less than 90 seconds. The magic hour for hotel guests, conscious the hotels were rammed due to HT, is pretty pointless unless you are literally first in the queue, they only open a few rides during that hour if you can even enter in time and they are already spilling out the entrance gates with maximum queue times already, we made a beeline for rides we needed to do in the magic hour only to find they didn’t open until 10am which was massively disappointing, by then the other rides queues were already horrendous. There were quite a lot of people not adhering to the smoking areas which I find annoying. Tidiness, both parks are cleanest theme parks I have ever visited, the staff are so quick to clean up rubbish and attentive to all aspects of the cleanliness of the park, really great to see. The hotel was basic but we didn't require anymore, it was clean and comfortable. Breakfast package is recommended, really convenient and you get away with taking some cake or fruit for the day. We didn't use the buses into the village at all, the walk really isn't far and quite pleasant and the buses are just something else to queue for. Sadly there were quite a few rides with technical issues that closed once you were in the queue, I know this cannot really be helped but it did make for quite a bit wasted time, unless you were in the station about to board then you are just herded out the nearest exit with no explanation as such, a bit annoying but cannot really be helped. There were lots of people that just dithered in the way, especially in the most busiest areas and choke points, it was extremely busy but people should still move to the side to look at a map or whatever but most just stop and stand right in the way oblivious to the carnage building up behind them, this happened lots! If you like a good cup of tea, take your own tea bags! Masks…..here we go. Masks are still mandatory and generally people do adhere to it. That said, as the park got more busy, the enforcement levels dropped off and more and more people began to remove them or just have them down under their chins. Sometimes in the shops and enclosed areas, you need to remove them briefly for some fresh air as the areas can become busy and hot. That leads me onto parades/fireworks etc, Disney will obviously tell you that they not on to reduce the mass build up of people in one area, that is complete rubbish. They are not on to save money, money they would have lost during the closures, which I get to some extent although the entry/hotel etc prices are not reduced etc so I felt it was a bit of a con really. They are happy to cram people into queues for rides, restaurants and shops etc but use the covid excuse for the other stuff. All of that said though, we did have a great time and all the chaos etc was worth it to see the kids faces although have no requirement to return for a long time now. To sum up our trip we both agreed it was “just on right side of unbearable”. The gross levels of consumerism and greed of Disney is there for all to see but overlooking that, the place and experience is magical even without the full package. If you are due to go soon, enjoy but go with caution, it’s absolutely mental, plan your day and expect queues....everywhere!

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Worst time ever. I've been a annual Disney pass holder since the late 1970's for the Orlando Florida Disney Parks.
Visiting Disneyland Paris over past two days has been horrible. Massive crowds with every ride from opening to closing having 45 minute to 70 minute wait times. Bathrooms were so crowded and fast pass price was outrageous.
Worst park was the extreme rudeness of far too many not only inside the Park but on the train as well.

We had grown men push and shove to get in front of me and my granddaughter to get on train first. I've never encountered so many rude people in my life.

In the several decades I have gone to Disney this Park in Paris was the worst. My five year old granddaughter never got to ride majority of rides on either day. We arrived at 9:30am and stayed until 8pm yet lines for majority of rides never shortened. Lines in restaurants were very long and again the worst part was the nasty rude people in the park and on the train. I was shoved, banged into etc yet not one person said 'sorry' for their pushing, shoving, cutting in line etc.

I also got the clear impression that far too many French do not like Americans as their rude behavior speaks volumes.
I will never return to Disneyland Paris.

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"Traveled as a family of 3 for 2 nights and 3 days during October half term. We had amazing time and we're so lucky with the weather, however there are a few oddities that I want to highlight to anyone who is planning a Disney Trip with a young family.

Firstly it appears Disney unlike other attractions has not reduced it's park capacity numbers (since covid). I checked during our stay and you could still book park tickets for the following day which felt ridiculous as the park was heaving already.

Queues on average were 60-120 mins long. With a young child these wait times are too long. The free fast past system was scrapped in July 21 so now you pay for a premier access pass at €14 per person!
You choose a time to return and then you can jump the queue. If you wanted to do all the attractions in one day this is really the only way to do it and some rides don't even have this option. Crush coaster is one of them which is always at around 80 mins plus wait.

In France currently it is obligatory to wear a face mask. Masks are enforced all around the park. Outdoors and in! The security are militant about this and I suspect this is partially due to the fact they can keep increasing park capacity. This could be a bit of a unwelcome shock to travellers from the UK who only are required to wear a mask in medical settings. On the shuttles and indoor queueing this is very uncomfortable especially when you are standing in long queues.

On to shuttles, do not leave it to the last minute to leave the park. It is like a stampede trying to board a bus back to your hotel and people behave in the most disgusting way - pushing and shoving children out of the way to get a space. It is very tempting to stay late but bear in mind if you have a pushchair or little ones this is most unpleasant after a long day and obviously dangerous.

Toilets are far and few throughout the park and you will have to queue for using the toilet. Again unfortunately with children who don't plan when they may need to go it's always too late and you will have delays getting in.

You will queue for everything. Food outlets, toilets, buses, park entry, rides, character meets, parades and snack shacks.
This is again tricky for little people considering it seems all you do is queue you won't get much done in a couple of days which is frustrating when you don't understand why you are waiting so long all the time . Personally next time I will
book 3+ days in the park to make sure we don't
miss out on things we wanted to do.

Overall it's a fantastic holiday and still magical in covid times but I would say the masses and crowds did spoil it a bit for us. It's hard to enjoy your stay when all you seem to do is queue and wait for anything.

Go out of term time if you can, otherwise try may half term as the french children do not share this half term with the UK so it should be quieter!!

Besides, if you come here, expect to wait hours and hours to do the attractions! The duration of most of them is indicated from 3 to 5 minutes, and they last 1 min!!! Try to explain to your child why we waited for 45 min for something that lasted 1 min!!!!

No characters walking around or any parades; one or two photos opps for which you had to - of course - queue. Not a single encounter of any kind with Frozen theme or characters, which left a four year old fan heartbroken. It's half term so sure, lots of people.

It's a crappy excuse for many rides being broken, almost all staff rude or surly, everything so grossly overpriced. 3 rides totaling maybe 10 mins, 6+ hours of queuing. Miserable day. So sad for my kids.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I hope that in writing this review I might save another family both emotional disappointment and a lot of money by choosing to go somewhere else.

My expertise is psychology and I work with teams in the worlds largest companies to lead innovation. The reason I highlight this is because I intend to bring teams to Disneyland to demonstrate how NOT to do things. Nearly every element needs radical innovation because eventually customers will stop coming.

My wife and I worked hard to make it a ‘positive’ experience but it was hard work - often made harder by Disney staff and poor reliability of rides.

There is plenty to illustrate but frankly I would just not bother. I have read their replies to other poor reviews and the responses are as you would expect from a team that aren’t committed to producing the best experience possible.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Staff very untrained as they coming back from Covid shut down is understandable, but the vibe here by staff is not at “Disney” standard. Rude staff, incompetent, unable to think how to make guests feel welcome.

The app for Disney Paris is terrible. It’s hard to navigate the site. We stayed at New York Marvel- sinks won’t drain, outlets don’t work in bathroom, wall paper peeling off in the hallways.

The food options are decent and they do ok serving thousands every day in the hotel - food is “average”- but kids like it

The park has many rides out of service and many breakdowns during the day. Some staff know how to manage- others don’t.

Parades every day at 5:05 are great! Kids loved it!

In the end- most decent rides you will wait in line for 45m each, I saw some wait for 70min! If you choose “fast pass” (premier access) it will cost you 14€ pp. rich kids ride, poor kids wait!

With these waiting times, you won’t ride much during the day- so the other activity is to go shopping- and they give you 1000’s of options to overspend on their merchandise and food.

They have 0 insentive to make ride queues shorter with more rides because this would not bring them as much cash.

It’s all about the money for Disney here. Cutting corners and not worth the value. If you have other considerations- I’d recommend going elsewhere right now. They are way off their beat right now here.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"It is difficult to enjoy the park given the number of visitors at any moment. The atmosphere is crowded out. This then knocks on to the length of waits for everything from the rides to getting a drink. You definitely need to book a restaurant table well in advance. It is all a 'well oiled' machine, but that hardly makes the experience magic. A number of rides seemed to keep breaking down through the day, only resulting in longer waits on other rides. Just the wait to go on Dumbo was over 30 minutes, and the bigger rides were looking at waits of 1 hour or more. Photo opportunities with the Disney characters was also very limited for those with children.
Average at best, but if you are very (very!) keen Disney fan then possibly the crowded and hectic nature of the experience will not be a put off.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"My wife was very keen to come while the children were young so they experienced the magic of Disneyland. Even on a Tuesday out of season we queued for 30min in the car before we could get into the car park. Then we had to pay €30 just for parking. Another 15min queue to check our covid pass. Another 15min queue to enter the park itself. Once inside, we see the Castle mostly wrapped up for renovation. Similar inside. Now, how do we find our way around? No maps. Occasional information signs with maps. We were advised to download the app. We did (don’t waste time trying to get a mobile phone connection - use the free wifi (and you can skip entering all the personal details)). Look on the app for “attractions”. You have a choice of list or map. Use the list and you have no idea where anything is. Use the map and it doesn’t tell you what anything is - just wait times. The wait times are wrong. Add 15mins+ to anything you see. Quite a few rides are currently closed. It is now midday and we have done no rides yet. We planned to arrive at 09:30 when the park opened. With children this inevitably became 10:00. By the time we’d arrived inside the park it was 11:15 and at 12:00 we’re queueing for our first ride. The children, with their understandable lack of patience, are not finding this magical. Almost any way I could spend £500 (tickets for 2 days) + £200 (hotels) + £50 (2 days parking) + £200+ (meals) = basically £1000 for 2 days for the children’s benefit would be better than this. If there was any magic about this I might reconsider but so far, no magic 😬

France,Disneyland Paris,4.0,"There are some very good elements to the park - the usual standard of rides and crowds are good regardless of COVID-19 and they are making a good effort to maintain the quality of the service, whilst keeping good measures in place.

This included using social distancing, enforcing the wearing of a face covering everywhere in the parks, and the use of perspex screens everywhere separating households when queueing. Unfortunately, a lot of people were not distancing or washing hands enough, but I can't blame the parks for this as it is hard to enforce this when people constantly ignore them.

Queues for the rides were generally good throughout our stay - unfortunately the EMH were a little pointless because such a high volume of people were staying at the parks, but this didn't matter because throughout the day, it was possible to only wait 30 minutes for larger rides such as Big Thunder Mountain.

Now there are quite a few drawbacks to the Paris park, including that the food is not great, the parades / fireworks currently aren't running (but scheduled to return, and also replaced by some small unscheduled cavalcades), and also the annoyance of the expensive Disney Premier access system (acting as the new Fasptass), but I strongly believe that the magical quality and level of enjoyment the park has to offer remains despite the virus, so I don't feel it is necessary to slate Disney for some drawbacks, especially considering the difficult financial period for large companies - it just means I wouldn't say it's value for money. But you can still have an excellent experience at the park!

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"Just really poor !
Park’s absolutely packed and the longest cues.
Had early hour with staying at The Newport but not many rides open. Frontier land was shut and so many rides and attractions. This pushed people together.
I expected covid rules would apply but no one cared. Masks off and standing close together was stupid.

On big rides thunder mountain or pirates everyone is rammed in together like a cattle market.

We have tickets for tomorrow also but not going. It’s too risky!

No rides were cleaned after use, hand gels everywhere but hardly anyone using them.

No park maps and no assistance around and an obvious lack of staff in the park.

Parks close early like 6 and 7.
Totally pointless.

I’m a big Disney fan but this has totally ruined it.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"We’ve just spent a few days in disney and it was all just a bit meh. Without the characters and the parades, there isn’t much left to differentiate the experience from a UK park like alton towers, just a bunch of rides, shops and crap food. My kids are young (4 and 5) so the characters and shows are the reason we came, they aren’t really old enough for rides, and certainly not for hour plus queues, so were pretty bored.

We still had a nice time but i am sympathetic that for other families in the same situation probably would have found the experience pretty ruined. The website and app seem to be deliberately unclear - the app lists a lot of meet and greets with characters which were clearly never going ahead. If you look on the website for parade times it links to various dead-end pages rather than just state the parades are cancelled. We had to be in the park and ask an attendant to find this out, people should have this information to make an informed choice when booking. I regret not checking tripadvisor before booking, i have been to disney paris before and it was fun, but it honestly hadn’t occurred to me such core elements of the park would be cancelled without it being clear to visitors or discounts offered.

For travellers from the UK, bear in mind mask wearing is absolutely mandatory, including outside, with no exemptions like in the UK. If you are exempt in the UK, perhaps get a visor or something because you won’t be allowed into the park, on rides or served in a restaurant without one on. This was fine for us as we understand these are the rules in France but travellers with some conditions which lead to exemptions in the UK may wish to be aware before travelling.
I see on here a lot of comments about food. It is definitely Icelands quality at Michelin starred prices! That said if you are aware, you can bring a packed lunch. Food at every other theme park i’ve ever been to is naff too, so not a reason not to go.
I would agree with some of the other comments on here about Disney losing its way a bit. There are rides themed on Pinnochio, Snow White and even the generally maligned Dumbo but no sign of any of the last 30 years of Disney animation. What about Beauty and the Beast? Moana? Frozen??? What about Marvel? The park management need to invest a bit in keeping up to date. Currently we have a generation of parents like me who are nostalgic about the golden age of disney, so take our kids as a treat. But this won’t last much longer, and the park won’t last another 15 years as the next generation grow up and don’t know what Snow White or Dumbo are and want a park where they can have an experience which aligns with their own Disney memories, not just films which were released before their parents were born.

France,Disneyland Paris,5.0,I am 6ft and a UK size 24 I got on all rides with no problem. I thought it would be worth writing this for other plus size women who may be nervous about fitting on rides like I was. Obviously every size is different but worth coming. As for the park itself there is scaffold on the castle but if you have been before isn’t very disappointing as there is so much to do.,Oct 2021
France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"All I can say about Disneyland Paris is what a shame. It has well and truly lost its magic. It’s a shambles from start to finish whilst costing you an absolute fortune to be there.

We had three nights in an Empire club room at the new Marvel Hotel. It cost over £2500 for the three nights and it was not worth the money. The service is poor, the staff are grumpy and rude, there is no where to eat lunch in the hotel (I was rudely told to go to Disney village). We were constantly harassed to show our vaccine certificate pass just going from one room in the hotel to another, or scanning the anti covid app. We had to wear wrist bands as well and masks at all times apart from eating or drinking. It was exhausting just for the crazy covid rules, that made no sense whatsoever.

What Disney fail to tell you when you book and pay for an extortionately priced holiday with them is that a lot of things are closed. So the Castle is closed and covered in scaffolding, over half the restaurants are closed, there are no meet and greets just the ridiculous selfie spots, no character dining, Auberge de Criilion is closed, Orbitron is covered in scaffolding, the Railroad train only goes from the main entrance. There are no parades, no fireworks, no princesses, basically No Magic At All. It’s incredibly depressing to be there and I felt completely ripped off.

What’s nuts as well is that they blame everything on covid, it’s all covid a fault, yet they are happy to pack you in to long hour long lines to access a ride. But it’s ok, wearing face masks all the time will make it ok! The are queues for everything because so much isn’t open. Just to get a drink could take 15 minutes minimum.

Then there is the fast pass replacement, which is just another money grabbing scheme from Disney for tired and emotional parents dealing with unhappy kids who can’t get on any rides. €14 per person to access Buzz Lightyear! €14 per person to access the runaway mine train!!! It’s unbelievable that Disney think this is acceptable.

Then there is the supposed extra Magic time for people paying a stupid amount of money to stay in a Disney hotel. What they don’t tell you is although you can access the park at 8.30am only two rides in each area are open! The rest don’t open till 10am! What is the point of that! There is no extra magic hours in Hollywood studios so the queue for Crush’s Cost never went below 1.5hrs.

I feel so let down by Disneyland Paris. They are not a patch on Florida. The staff are the rudest I have every come across. I speak enough French to get by and I had a least 4 occasions where people I was interacting with pretended to not understand me.

I’m sure a Disney representative will respond with some generic ‘we take everything you say on board’ but I would say, save your money and don’t bother

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Message to Disneyland Management:First of all: a lot of these Photos are not nice, because: the quality, the light and the position is not the summary of a professional photograph. for instance: The picture with the HEARTQUEEN of Alice in Wonderland: The photograph told us to pose like we have a cup in our hand, because there will be later a cup on the photo. On some photos the eyes are closed! impossible! (Stitch). The photos with Dschafar are horrible. In my opinion, it has to be possible, to create a photobook on your photopass website with the possibility, to add some stickers from Disney, edit the photos by Size, cut and color. the onliest thing we get here for our money (75€) are some photos with bad quality, whitch you can zoom.

I think that what it does have is good, but it just needs a bit of an update, as the last new attraction (not a reskin/retheme) was opened in the late 90's I believe.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Where should I start? We came for the birthday of my son. It's been a long since I don't come to Disneyland Paris, it was called Eurodisney back in the time. I had big expectations as I remember it with a lot of magic. Well.... no magic, no enjoyment, and no Disney. It seems the years have transformed my childhood into a mirage of lies.
Let's kick-off, shall we? The management doesn't care about covid when it comes to bringing people, they do care about bringing money. However, when it comes to the Disney characters or things like that, hey, they claim that ""we are in covid times we cannot do it"". However, the shops open full time and forget about social distancing.
Prices? horrendous and crazy expensive! I remember the clothes to be good quality and unique, this doesn't happen anymore. It's all something you can find in Aliexpress for 1/10 of the price. They are made in china (as seen on the tags). Apart from cheap quality t-shirts at 25 and 30 euros, hoodies at 50 and 60, and so on, I've got more to comment on as this is not all. The food prices are as well, non-sense and my wife and myself were looking at each other as ""is this a joke?"". If the quality of what you buy is worth.....you can say, ok but this???? frozen food put in the microwave and things like that and overpriced? cmon now, please, Disney Paris management, do you think that I'm stupid as a customer? yes you do. Seeing the comments here I think they have even been polite. But the last point I'm saving is the one that has blown my mind and it's 2. My wife was cold and it was chilly outside, so she wanted us to go to a restaurant: all closed. However, we found one close to the main street and the castle for 36 euros menu..... so I wanted to take my son to the toilet and change him whilst my wife was asking to get there. What has happened today Disney ladies and gentlemen, I let it go in the park today, I won't let it go here and everyone should know: they treated her like nothing literally. Why? because she is black? we are a mixed couple (I'm white) and she is black and? they replied to her: only for reservations and she asked ok, can we? waiters inside looking at her bad and they said to her no reservations. She came to me almost crying. Let me tell you something, maybe I earn more, no need to be cocky or stupid here, however, politeness and customer service are all I'm expecting of a brand like Disney. Your staff has been rude here in this place with my wife and I won't tolerate it, not from you, from anyone. This happened here and unfortunately, I just made a raincheck and calmed myself, it was the birthday of my son. The last point from the 2 is the politeness of the people: everyone, absolutely everyone was talking to you as if you owe them something. Is it a French thing to be this cocky? every single place we have been in the park, even paying for the nonsense you sell, was acting rude. This is outrageous and for me that I had you on high standards, your customer service is 0. Apart from all of this, nonsense everywhere, no Disney characters, no restaurants, rudeness in your employees, cheap quality things, and so on. Please, review the manners of your employees, being humble for me is a must, review how you treat people, your quality in food and services, the quality of goods you sell. We won't come back for sure, you ruined my day, the birthday of my son, and get me quite sad about the racism too. I'm sorry but I can't say just 1 thing that was good and I was so looking forward to it.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I thought maybe some of the other bad reviews were left by emotional parents who were unnecessarily disappointed that their kids did not melt down in a puddle of Disney Magic. However, having visited, I can honestly say myself that Disneyland Paris is rubbish.

The iconic castle is covered in scaffolding so cannot be seen. So there is no wow moment when you walk into to Disneyland.

There are no Princesses at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

There are no Parades at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

There are no Fireworks at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

Only about 25% of food vans and restaurants are open so there are huge queues for the simplest of things. It honestly takes upwards of 30 minutes to get a little snack from a van.

Now, to put it into perspective, I will end with the all important cost. Disneyland costs a lot of money so you expect them to at least make it clear on their website that the experience will be limited due to Covid. They are charging full price for a minimal service and this is simply unfair. I would say it is worth a visit if you live an hour away and have an annual pass. However, if you have to travel from another city or even another country, I would not recommend it. My daughters both enjoyed themselves but only as much as they enjoy our local attractions at home which cost less than £50 for a family of 4.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I've been to every single Disneyland now, and Paris is a skid mark on the entire franchise.

Where to even start? The castle is currently entirely boarded up. And by boarded up, I mean - a couple of metres of spire are visible at the top. The rest was either scaffolded or covered in plywood with a painting of a castle on it. We had a five year old with us (on her fifth birthday), and she innocently asked where 'the real' castle was. Sorry, sweetheart - there's a very large and crap painting of one, enjoy.

Next: no princesses. Not a single one. When we asked why, we were told 'covid'. Yup: Disney staff were everywhere, wearing face masks, but princesses apparently cannot get their asses out of bed and do the same thing. Nobody's going to mind a glittery face mask on Elsa, but no princesses at all? So we had to explain to a devastated five year old in her best princess dress that sorry, we'd be seeing no princesses. We told her they were all on holiday, when actually they were on furlough.

Obviously, because logic in Disney is dead, Maleficent was still wandering about without a mask on: maybe her evil renders her Covid resistant? Or is it just princesses that are too fragile to wear masks like everybody else? Either close the park because masks don't work, or make the princesses do it too.

Restaurants: majority closed. The ones that were open were dirty, shabby and some of the worst food we've ever eaten. Stale chips, congealed cheese, absolutely no catering for anyone with a food allergy. Oh, and charged at 400% of normal. We were charged £40 for three cokes and two small bowls of cold chips.

Staff were the rudest we'd ever come across - screaming at us for removing a face mask for thirty seconds, outside, away from people, after eight solid hours of standing in rainy queues. If the situation is that tenuous, maybe don't open the park to thousands of people?

Ahhh - but you know where the rules all went out the window? SHOPS. Yup, no princesses (because Covid) and no restaurants (covid) and no castle (covid) and no keeping things clean and modern (covid) but every single shop was open, fully staffed and packed. So apparently 'covid' is only an issue when it costs money, but not when it makes them some.

And for all of this, the tickets were full price. There's no mention on the website that you're not getting even a third of 'the Disney experience' - and it should be in HUGE LETTERS. Nope: you pay full whack, then get a half-shut park with randomly allocated closures with zero logic.

Thanks very much for the most expensive holiday we've ever taken, that ended up with a tear-stained five year old in her best dress, standing outside a shop window with a mannequin of a princess in it and bravely declaring that 'she hopes Elsa has a nice holiday'.

Screw you all for making a little girl cry on her fifth birthday.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"We visited Disneyland Paris from the UK in Sep 2021. This was our first visit having always previously visited Disney-world Orlando.

We knew it was smaller but expectations were high with the hope of some Disney Magic to fill the gap while Orlando was off the menu.

I can only liken it to something that was created in the 1950’s and it has never changed. It was simply boring, more than 50% of rides not operating and about 75% of eating places closed. Merchandise is identical in every shop and very little choice for adults. Our very first ride was Big Thunder Mountain at 7:30 pm on 27rh Sep, it failed midway and we had to climb out and be escorted back. Magic lost and we naturally assumed being Disney we would get a free pass to return and miss the queue….. NO, just a goodnight from our escort at the gate. I have never seen that in Orlando and felt this left a bad impression.

In Orlando the cast members are always ‘ON’ in happy mode and attentive to the guests. Here they looked miserable, were constantly chatting to each other and not really offering any glimmer of the magic. It just fell woefully short of what we thought it would be.

Unless there was major investment and enough to fulfil a few days break then we wouldn’t go back, would rather spend the money where the magic really does happen.

Disneyland Paris should be avoided, overpriced for the actual entertainment available.

As an added note we thought we could at least wander in the Disney village but 90% of the is closed throughout the day.

Very disappointed.

Firstly have the attractions in the park are closed and they don’t tell you when you book. None of the characters are available to take photos like before and no characters join for breakfast/lunch/dinner in any of the restaurants. To enjoy any of the restaurants you have to book 2 months in advance. It’s crazy. We were unable to book any restaurants even thought we had a full meal plan plus. It was hot dogs and burgers only. Today it was raining and they made the little kids wait in the rain when they could easily open up the queue to be undercover. When I asked them to the said due to COVID and can’t open it in a very rude way. The other rides have no social distancing in their lines and there it’s fine but here where u had little kids they made them wait in the rain. What an embarrassment to the Disney brand to do that to little kids. At the hotels it was also impossible to get a table for dinner. We managed to find a seat only at 10:30pm with a 4yr old. Overall the experience has been terrible and we will not return to Disneyland Paris. Don’t waste your time and money coming here. So many of the staff have been so rude during our stay. Maybe stick to the US park instead of coming here.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Let's face it! Disney is expensive. It is a very popular IP and holds dear memories close to most of our hearts. But I question if it is starting to lose it's way?

I travelled with my six year old, three year old and my wife. This was done fairly last minute due to us having to cancel the USA version due to COVID. I now am considering not bothering with WDW Florida and staying at Universal instead when borders re-open. They have got rid of the free Fast pass and replaced with the Genie app that allows you to pay around £15 per person per ride (depending on the ride) on top of what is nearly £300 worth of tickets for a family of four for the day. On top of this four cheese toasties came in at around £40. This is a lot of money!

I am ok with Disney being expensive when it is a company doing everything they can to give you the best most premium experience and escapism they can. The company that builds mountains for a rollercoaster or the world leader in animatronics in it's seeking to entertain. But everything new is just cheap, local theme park quality! Everything seems to be sold on the intellectual property rather than the experience. Take the pirate themed area. Big waterfalls, ships and rides that are world immersive. Compared to a few fibre glass statues and cheap MDF theming for the newer Toy Story area.

The Fast Pass is nothing more than another money grab! The park did not have too many people but the normal queues were massive. I question the conflict of interest brought up by the new Genie Fast Pass when it means it is in the interest of Disney to not have the normal lines move quickly as they make an uplift by charging people to skip the lines. On Thunder Mountain we were near the Fast Pass entry (whilst in the normal queue) and we were held up 20 minutes as they let continual streams of people who had paid extra onto the ride. Stuck in a queue with plastic walls on either side, merely inches wider than your shoulders! Trapped in a hot, sweaty claustrophobic hell hole is now the Disney experience set at the £300 entry point. Why solve the queue issue when you can rip more money out of your guests pocket? They may argue other parks do this but, other parks are not built on the reputation of Disney memory making magic that is severely dirtied by this nor do they charge such premium charges for their experiences. The Ratatouille ride is an OK ride that puts you in front of a few different cinema screens and acts like a simulator. It is ok but it is no Disney! It is not pushing to immerse you or do something new. These systems can be found at other much cheaper parks such as Terra Mitica in Spain.

The cost of food for the quality is now a joke that you hear guests opening mocking in the lines.

Simply, Disney as a theme park experience is turning into an over priced proposition that is relaying on past reputations to get the guest. Seems to be far more about the merchandise and up charges than transporting you to another world. Where has the old Disney Imagineering gone? I miss it and willing to pay a premium price for it! For what you get now? Save your money and go to Europa Park in Germany!

Went during mask wearing being mandatory which was hideous in the heat. Lots of places to eat and snack wagons were closed. Come on Disney sort it out.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"I went yo the park september 2021. There was no American or chinese tourists. The park was only at 50% capacity. Yet it still felt very rammed. It would be completely unbearable at anything greater than 50% capacity.if you enjoy long queues aching feet expensive food then disneyland paris is the place for you. Luckily I only paid for 2 parks over 1 day. The 2nd park is small and could be easily contained in the main park. It's just a cynical way of disney to rip you off. As is typical with a lot of theme parks you pay a lot of money to enter. However to ensure you enjoy your day. You need to buy another ticket at a similar price so you can queue jump. Will not be going again. Would recommend that you attend asterix park about 30k away. Worst day of my holiday.

France,Disneyland Paris,3.0,"After having 2 WDW trips cancelled, my husband and I thought we’d try here to get our Disney fix.

We spent 3 nights/4 days here and stayed in Newport Bay Club which gave us EMH (well worth having). Overall, we had a great break and really enjoyed ourselves. There are a couple of rides at DLP that we actually enjoyed more than Orlando, but on the whole it missed the magic for us. I’m not sure if that’s because we’ve been lucky enough to go to Orlando 4 times over the last 8 years, or if it’s because of COVID, but we won’t be in a hurry to go back (although the expansion plans look cool so never say never!)

The cast members were definitely lacking though and the lack of places open for something to eat or drink just made the days harder work than they needed to be - I understand why so many people take picnics in now. We had 5 burgers in few days we were there - I never have burgers! There was literally sod all else to eat though.

Another issue was the other guests. No one abided by the social distancing markers, people were wearing their masks incorrectly all over, and staff seemed fed up with having to keep reminding people to wear them properly (understandable when they’re being so blatantly ignore).

I didn’t really like that there were plenty of characters viewing opportunities. It felt like if you wanted to see characters then that would be easy enough to do (from a distance). Queues for rides were longer than I normally enjoy though with the lack of fast pass (big tickets were usually around 45-60 mins long) but I can imagine not having to worry about FP is a draw to some families.

So yeah. We had a great time but I would really think about what you want from your break and what you can compromise on before booking as it’s not a cheap trip and it didn’t hit the mark for us.

We stayed in a Disney hotel, so we had extra magic hours in the morning. Very much needed during busy times. A few rides (Peter Pan, Snow White, Pinocchio) were very bumpy and fast, we remembered it was smoother and slower before. Other rides were nice and our favorite character was definitely Jack Skellington this time! Unfortunately we had to leave the queue of Frozen, even though we were at Kristoff and very close to Anna & Elsa. Staff didn't even let us take a look at them. We had to leave because of our appointment for a covid test in Disney Village. Makes it hard to wait in a queue and make a reservation at a restaurant too.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Disneyland Paris

The worst Disney experience of our life.

We are disney junkies and we are lucky enough to have visited all the parks in the world with the exception of Shanghai.

I'm not going to start comparing park to park because they are really different from Anaheim to Florida, Tokyo, etc.

But what stands out at any Disney location (hotels, parks, waterparks, etc) is the service. We always get great service, people smile and treat you nicely and most of all they try to work with you if you have any problems to help you out.

This is not the case in Disneyland Paris. The people here treat you really badly.

First I made a reservation in June to pay 1050 euros for a cabin and park access. 7 days before our arrival they canceled my reservation. They told us to communicate with their phone line, after 7 tries with 50 minutes wait each time we give up. So we had to get a new reservation now costin 1390 euros. 255 euros extra for the same package we booked months before.

Contacting the disney france team on social media they told me to try at the hotel reception

After arriving at the hotel they told me they can't do anything because it is not their problem.... They gave us the cabin but told us we could get there 1 hour earlier (even though the cabin was free) , gave us the park tickets and we were on our way... we thought that was it but noooo.

Arriving at the park we got to the ticket entrance and of course the tickets didn't work. We had to go to customer service another hour until they realized they gave us the tickets from the cancel reservation instead of the new one.

Now it's 1 pm and we are finally into the park.

We arrived at the food center at Walt Disney Studios Park and we were happy to read in a sign ""food allergies ask for the special menu"" my sister is gluten intolerant.

We got to the order booth and they said...oh no no we only have salads and a dessert not hot food gluten free... nice job Disney....

As the day goes by we got back to the hotel happy to go to the pool, we got to the front desk to mention the issue we had with the new tickets and this was the conversation:

Me: Hi I wanted to change my tickets as they appear not to work
Disney Agent: Did you get to the park?
Me: Yes, but we have to wait 30 minutes for customer service to recognize the error and let us in.
Disney Agent: Then you got in so don't complain.....

And that was it.. no sorry for the trouble, it was a small error, nothing.

The next few days we just realized that the experience in Disney Paris is as different as it can be from the Disney in Florida or Anaheim so we try to enjoy as much as possible.

My takeaway is that we can mark down that we visited but we will never ever go back.

I'm a Disney lover and even though we lived abroad for most of the time we went to DisneyWorld more than 20 times in the last 10 years and we will continue to go but never again to Disney Paris.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"3 years ago I wrote a very negative review particularly due to difficult online booking system. 3 years later during post Covid environment online booking became even more difficult. Not only you book and pay your tickets but also you need to confirm the day you are visiting with a separate process. Otherwise, you face great difficulty at the gates because they do not only check the QR codes but also they check the registration QR code.

Studios were particularly very congested since significant part of the Studios and activities were
closed. They claim that they are closed as part of Covid related measures but they even created further congestion since people are given no choice but to queue up with the remaining very limited activities which are open. The queue at the toilets of Studio 1 was unacceptable since nearby facilities were closed. There were more activities open at Magic Kingdom Park, therefore, it was relatively less congested.

Given the current circumstances I do not recommend to visit Studios. I am surprised that they can still charge the full price.

France,Disneyland Paris,2.0,"A very disappointing and frustrating stay for the children. So many services have been suspended surrounding contradictory COVID regulations:

- There are no fireworks
- Parades have been suspended
- Photos with Disney characters have to be taken at a distance, complete with masks.
- Any child over the age of 6 have to wear masks at all times around the park.
- The Disney castle is under scaffolding.
- Many of the restaurants and rides are closed, making it near impossible to get a restaurant reservation, despite having purchased a meal plan.
- Too many rides got closed on the days we visited due to technical difficulties : RC Racer, Peter Pan, Hyper Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain. Deeply upsetting for children when you have waited in the queue for over an hour only to be told to come back later. Thats if they bother to tell you at all!
- Impossible to get standby passes - do they actually exist?
- Despite all of the wonderful things such as parades and fireworks being cancelled due to COVID, you are still sardined next to hundreds of people in queues for hours on end and prices remain sky high.

The whole experience left me and my children very sad and disappointed with a bad taste in my mouth. It was nothing like what we had experienced in Disney USA. My advice would be to save your hard earned money and either wait until normal services resume or save save save for Disneyland Florida, Disneyland Paris is currently all out of magic.

Our expectations were low because we had heard many negative things about the Paris park, from not being as 'magical' to the food being terrible. However, we had a blast. Yes, the park is smaller and not as 'magical' especially during Covid times, we found it to be pleasantly delightful.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Inform customers before entry that most of the attractions, shows and parades are closed, at least then customers can make the decision to enter, rather than be disappointed, especially in MGM studios.

Our grandson is autistic & ADHD and cannot wait in a queue, most of the attractions that were open didn’t have capacity for people with handicap green cards. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, they deserve a medal as many people are very dissatisfied.

Even the castle is not visible, it is masked up with temporary coverings. Which really effects the feel and excitement for the grandchildren.

Appreciate we are still in the midst of COVID, but still, people want the best experience, and I’m afraid to say that this was absent in both parks.

This is our 5th visit in 5 Years, we won’t return now for a number of Years. When you consider the cost of tickets and food for a family for 2 days entry to the parks and a hotel etc etc, it’s a very expensive holiday

With Sars-NCOV-19 they closed all fountains in the park. Also, the bathroom water is at 35 degrees so you can only wash your hands... They want you to buy water bottles at a price of 3'30€ the 500ml ones.

This is a bit degrading to people. They could already give a couple of bottles at the entrance, because the tickets are so expensive, or indicate it explicitly before entering the parks so that people are aware of the problem that exists with water.

Also, there isn't any shadow place. People was searching it like ants under a magnifying glass... They were invading gardens and places that are supposed to not be used.

Please, If you come to the park in summer, bring plenty of water and be careful with heat stroke in children.

France,Disneyland Paris,1.0,"Our experience of Disneyland Paris in August 2021 was really disappointing for our family for the following reasons:

1. Many of the rides and parades were closed, without notice on the website when booking our tickets, apparently due to COVID. Even the famous castle is shrouded in scaffolding and cladding. If we had known in advance, we would not have paid 360 euros for a family of 5 including 2 children who just turned 12 and are now counted as adults. This is strange when the accepted definition of most adults is either aged 16 or 18.

2. One of the adults was a disabled senior but she still had to pay the full adult tariff even though she could only access ONE ride the entire day - the river boat. In fact she was charged 225 euros to rent a wheelchair for the day - no other venues we visited in Paris this week charged a fee and deposit in this way for disabled travelers. This on top of a 30 euro parking fee!

3. There were too few benches to sit and relax in between the 45 minute wait times for rides.

4. The restaurants and shops are all vastly over-priced but this is to be expected.

Overall I would not recommend the park for anyone other than with children between the ages of 5-9. Certainly not for seniors, people with disabilities and older children.

Lastly Disney should be transparent about their pricing in relation to the current restrictions so that consumers can make an informed decision and not end up disappointed as we are.

The park is packed, i don't understand why you have to register to visit, as there is no limit to visitors, we registered the day before. For each ride we had to wait for 1 - 1,5 hours, even for a regular caroussel. We didn't even try Peter Pan, the wait seemed 2 hours there. You have to wait in endless lines for everything, food included. The attractions seemed a bit boring. There are A LOT of shops, camouflaged as attractions or fun, many more than attractions themselves. In the shops there is almost nothing that costs less than 16 euros.

There are a lot great attractions for all the ages, nice live concerts, beloved heroes, lot of shops and cafes. Love everything except the queues: everywhere, during all the day. What I recommend you how to use your time. There are the fast tracks nearby all the attractions. There you can take your free ticket without any queue. This fast track ticket gives you your turn after about 1-2 hours and on the defined period of time. It is very easy and comfortable to plan your time in the Disneyland. And the main idea - no queues. Unfortunately we understood the system about queues too late and use just 2 fast tracks such way. So sometime we stayed about 1 hour in the queue! Can you imagine?:) Also I would advise you to start the visit early in the morning, at the opening hours, about 11 I think. Also the bonus for the people who stayed at the Disneyland hotel is to begin the attractions a few hours before the official opening.

We were there till the end, till 23 pm. At the final of the day there was absolutely fantastic salute! Also, fewer people were starting from 6-7 pm. So take my advices and use your time effectively!

I meen, not even one of the cafees or diners we've been to offers a measly vegetable based milk option, let alone food other than popcorn that a vegan could eat. That is not acceptable.

We were there during Pride month, the whole park had rainbow themes, yet all this inclusivity does not seem to include the rough average 6% of visitors, who do not want animals on their plates. And I have not even started on the sheer number of people who are simply lactose intolerant without being vegan. Say, about 85% of people of African descent e.g.

Thanks Disney. I feel cheeted and disappointed. The rides and settings are fun, but I am really sad that for a vegan the best meal around is a plate of oily fries and perhaps a tasteless salad, if you are lucky enough to find a restaurant that has them.
