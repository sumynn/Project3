Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"I'm not really a fan of aquariums and so, but this one was really interesting. Nicely built on 2 levels and a lot of information, suitable for both children and adults. A must if visiting Lisbon with kids.",Nov 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Located a short drive outside Lisbon proper, Oceanário is arguably the city's premier destination. Opened in 1998, the Oceanário was the centerpiece of a World Fair and remains committed to conservation above all.

Less ""cute"" than many modern aquariums, the focus on education over cartoons admirable, much of the space wraps around an enormous central tank featuring countless fish both common and novel. From Sun Fish to Sharks the space then expands to artistic aquascaping and theaters that outpace most.

We purchased the combo ticket that gave you entrance to the aquarium as well as the gondola ride overlooking the water and the city, this was a lot of fun to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding area.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"Lovely places to watch some fish. There's a lot to see here, but if you skip the movies and other information and just go to see the animals, you will probably be done in about an hour.

It's an excellent place to go with kids as they will love to see all that variety, but when you left there it looks like something is missing.",Aug 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"I've been to more interesting aquariums in Tampa, Florida as well as in Hong Kong. Not sure how they figure this to be one of the largest in the world.

Not impressed at all.....",Aug 2021

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"1) Buy tickets online. The line for off-liners is longer and processes 5-10 times (!!!) longer. We spend 1.5 hours in the line.
2) Average oceanarium as for a Europe. Quite small, no tunnels, no huge spaces, no good panoramas. 1 hour to visit.",Aug 2021

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"We knew this aquarium was famous for being one of the best in Europe, but we were very pleasantly surprised. It was expensive, but well worth it (20 euros per ticket).
We started with two exhibits, one was a very beautiful movie (One) about the Ocean, its place in our lives. The other was a magnificent exhibit built by a Japanese master with beautiful music which gives a surreal ambiance of serenity to the place.

The rest of the aquarium was very nice too, with amazing fishes, sharks, and other wonderful creatures. The best: a couple of extremely cute otters that played around, such a treat!

Last but not least, the whole place gives a large part to ecological awareness, how to behave and consume responsibly. A big plus!

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"The design of the oceanarium is quite clever, with one very large tank in the middle that housed many larger species, and 4 corners off of it representing different types of oceans. It was fun to watch the penguins while beautiful Inca terns flew around us in the Antarctica exhibit. It was also fun to watch the otters swimming and playing in the North Pacific exhibit. The huge tank in the middle represents One Ocean and has a wide range of species. It even has a very large sunfish! I did not expect to see one of those! I have always wanted to see one in person, rather than just in photos and videos! It also had a very large tiger bull shark. It was quite impressive to see one up close and safely. The oceanarium also had a beautiful exhibit at the beginning called Forests Underwater that was simply beautiful. The place was a lovely way to spend a few hours and a nice break from seeing gorgeous churches and extensive museums.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,Our two little boys love this place. We love this place! no cueing we hopped on to the cable car after,Jun 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"Great place to see. The main tank is very big and can be seen from many angles and several floors. Some great animals I had never seen before, like a giant fish divers inside the tank were feeding by hand.

However, was a bit too busy for proper social distancing, despite booking in advance for a specific 1 hour time slot on a weekday (Monday) at 11:00. I think they are letting too many people in at each slot/hour, and also let people aggregate at specific places. I surely wouldn't go there on a weekend.

Walking outside of the building and near the riverfront was nice too.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Fantastic aquarium, one of the best I have visited anywhere in the world. Lots of fish, colourful and healthy, and tanks are clean and well cared for. Like all Portuguese people, Staff is super friendly and professional, we all speak more than one language. I highly recommend the gift shop, amazing T-shirts. If you can give a contribution to help care for the aquarium vs animals! The tickets is only €19 for adults but is well below price in comparison to smaller and less diverse aquarium I visited so is quite cost accessible. You have unique experiences packages.
I love it and highly recommend the visit.",May 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Few hours to get in but so worth it! The extra exhibition (Amano) was stunning.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,1.0,"The Lisbon Oceanarium is great.. our 4 years old son visited it 3 times already since the reopening after confinement. The price is high and yesterday we opted for the family ticket (better value) but we had a terrible experience since the place was packed with people.. the temporary exhibitions had monitors at their entrance and were crowd controlled, also they had audio announcements reminding people for COVID situation. HOWEVER the the main building was packed with people and empty of staff what made the visit very stressful and not enjoyable at all if not dangerous.",Dec 2020
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"After more than 10 years, we revisited the oceanarium in lisbon.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,Such an interesting place to visit while being in Lisbon. Quite beautiful but not mesmerizing if you have ever visited bigger aquariums.,Nov 2020
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"The building itself has an interesting modern architecture. The aesthetic shape of the building, well integrated into the space, fits perfectly into the surroundings. Also very aesthetic inside. We start our journey on the highest floor, that is on the surface, and then we go down a great spiral of stairs lower and lower, sinking into ""big blue"" in which aquatic animals, fish, crustaceans and others live. A large aquarium in the center of the building allows you to see all the big fish. In the smaller ones, you can admire the smaller and very small wonders of nature. Clear descriptions in two languages , Portuguese and English. Very polite and helpful staff. It is best to buy tickets in advance, online, because even after the season there are long queues before entering. There are two cafes in the oceanarium where you can have a lunch or just coffee and cakes.

The top floor “Forests Underwater by Takashi Amano” features tropical forests inside a smaller aquarium.
The ""ONE, the Ocean as you never felt it"" artistic installation was amazing!
And the main part - AQUARIUM! A large main aquarium, holding 5 million litres of seawater! Lots of fishes, mammals and birds that I have never seen before.
One of the interesting place.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Aquariums are always my favorites. I've never missed a single chance I had to visit aquariums. Oceanario takes the first place among all the aquariums I've visited so far.

They have organized everything in a very beautiful way. It is more than just an aquarium. I can openly call it 'AN OCEAN'. They have all kind of species according to me. And they have displayed a very good description under each species in simple English as it helps everyone to get a better knowledge about the particular species.

They have a very unique souvenir center which would definitely catch your heart. Prices also very reasonable. They have a nice collection of pens, pencils, magnets, posters, soft toys, posters and many more, Don't forget to buy a beautiful souvenir before you leave this amazing place.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"As someone that works in an aquarium, I usually have a different perspective than most visitors. The property is laid out in two separate buildings, one for their cafe, admissions, classrooms and gift shop- and another that is positioned over the water that contains their exhibits.

Their main exhibit sits in the center and you have multiple viewing windows as your make your way around the pathway. You see four different regions of the world in each corner of the building, each very unique from the other.

Everything had great interpretation making it easy to understand the animals and some fun facts about each exhibit. They had a wonderful children's area that we spent some time - they really encourage conservation through some fun interactive displays that all can enjoy.

They have a beautiful film to view before you cross the bridge into the aquarium, very immersive and impactful. One of the best gift shops that I have seen and the cafe is very reasonably priced compared to most zoos and aquariums. Great visit!

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Usually, I am not such a fan of zoos and aquariums... But this one is really great. You get a walk arround the Oceanarium, getting all kind of informatuon about the various fish that you see when walking arounf it. They have some pretty cool fishes in there, and I bet you won't take notice of the time flying by while you visit the Oceanarium.
We were lucky enough to be in Lisbon during a not so crowded period of the year... Otherwise, we would probably have liked a ""Skip the line ticket"".
Really worth it, even more with children.",Mar 2020

There was no single person waiting in the line. However, since the price of the skip the line ticket is equal to that of a regular one bought at location, it makes sense to buy it, just in case.",Mar 2020
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"The Oceanario is a world-class facility that houses numerous species which are seldom found in captivity (such as the Sea Otters and Manta Rays).

It pleases me to say that all the animals appear well looked after.

Despite its small size, the aquarium is well worth the visit and took us around an hour and a half (including a while to stop and gaze at the Sea Otters).

The temporary exhibitions are a nice touch, but, don't seem to offer much in the way of animal viewing.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"To see so many different kinds of fish swimming in such a huge tank together is quite breathtaking! You ask yourself, how is it they don’t kill each other? Well, all of this is explained in a well-documented film towards the end that talks about the Oceanario and how the fish are cared for and the programs they run... In addition to the big tank are smaller side tanks with unique species from all over and other special exhibitions in other parts of the Oceanario. The area is also very cool and right on the water near the Vasco de Gama bridge. It’s a great way to spend the day. Buying tickets in advance online are highly recommended.",Oct 2019

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"We visited here mostly because we thought it would be fun for our 11-year-old. But everyone in our group aged 11 to 79 loved it, and even a couple of the adults said the Oceanarium was the highlight of their week-long trip to Lisbon. The information provided throughout is a perfect balance between being educational but not overload or too much detail. There's a great variety of fish and other water creatures. The otters in particular were super cute and we loved watching their feeding session. The area around the Oceanarium is also fun to explore - we ate lunch at the food court-like area and also took a cable car ride and played in the fountain. Overall, I recommend the Oceanarium highly!

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"My girlfriend and I used the metro to Cabo Ruivo, from there it was a 15 min walk to the aquarium.

There were no long queues and since we had a Lisbon card we got 10% discount on our tickets.

I never saw a sunfish in my life and I was flabbergasted of the appearance of this fish. Words can’t describe this.

I loved the design of the place, you could really see from almost all angles the sea life within the tank. When I thought I had seen it all, I got surprised every time.

Overall you can easily spend a couple of hours here, just admiring all the fishes, penguins and otters.

And after the aquarium you can have fun in the cable car, just behind the aquarium.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"We visited as a couple here in February (so luckily wasn't too busy). There was no queue to wait in and we walked straight in after buying a ticket at the machines. There are posters as you walk into the main oceanarium building explaining current conservation issues and how they're using the funding to help mitigate these problems (really liked this bit!). There is a huge tank in the middle with fish, sharks, rays, sunfish and more. You follow the tank around the middle and explore different exhibits (indian, pacific, atlantic, etc.) as you go around the building. Loved watching the playful rescue otters leap around and definitely make sure you go intime for the penguin feeding (twice per day). Would maybe have liked too see more space/larger exhibits for these animals but I'm sure they put their welfare needs first. No dolphins or whales are kept here which I'm glad about as I wouldn't have visited otherwise. Definitely worth the journey and perfect if it's a bit of a drizzly day!

Whilst not technically a site specific to Lisbon or Portuguese culture it is still a remarkable place to visit with a huge central aquarium and lots of small exhibits.

What a brilliant day. Us adults particularly enjoyed the current underwater forest exhibition and The One cinematic experience; the kids loved the sea otters, sun fish and funny little garden eels.

Got the feeling that a lot of effort had gone into the animal enclosures, and the info boards on the way round were interesting.

The dreaded gift shop was actually quite pleasant, but very pricey!

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"The Oceanario is a cut above other aquariums. Part of the Lisboa 98 Expo site, it’s a striking building located in a lagoon on the east of Lisbon.

Built over two main levels, the aquarium’s centrepiece is an enormous tank, which all other exhibits are organised around. There are dozens of different vantage points to view the main tank, which houses sharks, rays and a huge array of other fish.

The other exhibits cover all the world’s Oceans and offer a diverse array of marine life, with the Magellanic penguins, sea otters and sea dragons particular highlights.

The signage and information panels are clear and engaging, and the circular layout helps the flow of people so it never felt too crowded. The shop is blissfully free from the usual plastic tat that blight many gift shops, with a clear focus on sustainable products.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"......which'll set you back about 8 - 10 euro. Entrance to the Oceanarium is €19 for adults and €13 for over-65s and children.

It's a big place and you'll do some walking before you even get in, but once there it's a fascinating place. A huge central tank has sharks, rays, and hundreds of species of other fish. The viewing windows are enormous. As you go round you're guided into each of four ""climatic"" environments where they simulate cold north European waters and the attendant wildlife (inc birds), a sub-Arctic environment with penguins and birds, plus fish, and a tropical, tidal mangrove swamp-type environment. And there are giant sea otters which amuse everyone, especially the kids, with their noisy antics. Lots of smaller tanks with unusual species of smaller creatures are placed on the way round.

The building opened in 1998 and is very good, but I suspect it's a victim of its own success at times as things can get quite congested with people at times. I suspect a 2020's replacement would handle the numbers of people much better and have better-proportioned viewing facilities - but it's still an exhibit well worth visiting.

The cafe facilities are great, and very clean. Mass catering done well; the food is good, hot (where it's supposed to be), tasty, generous and reasonably priced. Well done, Lisbon Oceanarium!

The main tank boasts an outstanding collection of fish, from some small ones to big sharks. It also includes rays, stingrays and a sunfish. The sharks are the best part of the main tank (I’m a bit biased as they’re my favourite animal).

The aquarium also has various smaller tanks (with smaller fish, octopuses and jellyfish), as well as a few “outdoors” (they’re covered) ones, where you’ll find penguins, seabirds, and the cutest sea otters!!

The aquarium itself is divided into zones, which usually represents an ocean, or a regional part of an ocean.

The aquarium is a must-do attraction to anyone visiting, or living in the city of Lisbon.
However, I strongly suggest you book your tickets in advance (online), so the price is cheaper (I paid at the entrance 19€).

The walk through video is amazing! Tip, don't walk through it. . Stay, immerse yourself. It would make a great way to get back in to the storage area is to wave your locker key at the door staff... No real issue, just poor layout design at the end.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"It's supposed to big the biggest aquarium in Europe and I will say that it is big compared to other aquariums that I have visited in other parts of the world. With that being said, I was disappointed that this place didnt have more fishes.

The main feature of this aquarium is the large tank that is located in the middle of the aqaurium which holds 4 or 5 mantas rays, a few sharks,a variety of small other fishes. And as a visitor you are guided to and around this main tank.

As you are making your way round, you will get to see the typical small fish tanks with smallet marine life and then end up being taken back to the large tank the middle of the aquarium. I guess it was nice seeing this large tank at different angels and levels, but expected to see more large marine animals for an aquarium that boasts as being the largest in Europe.

I would say the aquarium in Kuala Lumpur had more variety and quantity comparatively.

For €19 I expected more.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"I went early morning on Tuesday and it was pleasantly quiet, apart of some random tourist kids groups passing by. I booked tickets from booking.com and it was much cheaper than buying on spot. Only silly thing I thought was that I had to pick up my tickets from local information point where I had a small issue too. When they scanned my ticket code they said I haven't paid for my tickets, but I obviously did. So it took her few phone calls and approximately 10 min to approve and get my tickets. However, aquarium was very beautiful itself, could sit there for hours and watch the sharks and other amazing fish slowly passing by. Definitely worth to go!",Jan 2020
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"The Lisbon Oceanarium is frankly amazing. The sheer variety of mammals and fish is astounding.

We took a city bus and it dropped you off a very short walk to the Oceanario.

The underwater forest exhibition was beautiful, peaceful and fascinated our baby. Moving onto the main aquarium, we were all impressed by the displays. Don't worry about seeing the fish from the first viewing point (a bit crowed;lots of school trips), there are lots all the way around on both floors. Baby changing facilities we good, with plenty dotted around the exhibit. We were very impressed and glad we decided to visit on a slightly overcast day.",Jan 2020

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"Chris and I visited here on Saturday.

The line across the drawbridge was somewhat organized.

The problems started once patrons arrived at the ticket counter which is physically inside the tower on the lower level.

Only one cashier was working on a busy Saturday afternoon. Ridiculous. We could see a mob of people at the glass window with lots of unhappy faces.

The cashier spoke English and claimed the credit card device was nonfunctional and therefore everyone had to pay cash. Many patrons were tourists like us and only had euros denominations of 20, 50 or more.

The cashier claimed that he didn’t have any small denomination bills or coins. Admission was six euros per person. So if you only had a 20 euro bill then the cashier pocketed the rest for himself. It’s inexcusable for a major landmark on a busy Saturday to demand cash and then lack sufficient change.

There were a group of tourists from Spain in front of us arguing with the cashier about the lack of change and calling him out about this dishonest situation.

A group of us in line ended up negotiating amongst ourselves for correct change in order to enter without walking away from our own money.

This cashier was smirking and laughing at us and other tourists unaware that we speak Spanish and some functional Portuguese.

The tower and views are amazing.

The stairwells are narrow and have a system of red and green lights to control traffic up and down the stairs. Many of the stairs are only 19 inches wide and can only permit one person in one direction.

There weren’t any employees enforcing the red and green lights resulting in frustrating gridlock inside the stairwells.

The employees are dishonest, disorganized and need to be replaced.

Bring lots of small bills and change then take a deep breath and prepare for frustration.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,We wanted to visit the Lisbon aquarium as it was rated the best in the world. Not sure I would agree with that rating but it was impressive with a beautiful center tank that had multiple windows into it. There were a number of smaller tanks with a wide variety of creatures from otters to jellyfish all well cared for and in well maintained tanks. I especially enjoyed the birds that were in some of the exhibits as they were allowed free flight.,Dec 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Even if you already visited (as in my case) some other Aquariums in the world, you already know that each one is somehow unique. Lisbon's Oceanarium is no exception. I spent 3 hours of my last days in Lisbon almost hypnotized by all those fishes and creatures silently moving beyond a glass, so near and so far at the same time. Some of them you already know, some of them you will get to know. However you will soon realize that in the Oceanarium time slips away fast and when you most enjoy it it's already time to go. Go there, enjoy, you won't regret your visit.",Dec 2019

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,We visited on a Saturday afternoon in early January. Admission was 18 euro pp. The aquarium was quite busy.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"It took a while to get here on the metro and then another 15 minute walk but it's worth it for adults or children. You can buy tickets from a human or the automated machine if you pay by crd which is a time saver. It's incredibly well organised and you follow a set route so you don't miss anything which makes it good value. It centre's around a central oval tank with exhibits off to the sides. The penguins and the puffins were both fun to watch. There is some amazingly colourful coral and lots of sharks, rays, frogs and other fish. At the end is a nice gift shop but we didn't go to the cafe or wine bar as they seemed a bit expensive.",Nov 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,We loved the Oceanario during our trip to Lisbon. You got very close to the fish. The way it was set up was just beautiful.,Oct 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"We visited the oceanario as it was ranked amoung the best 5 aquariums in Europe. Indeed the big central aquarium where all the big fish is located and which spans 2 floors is unique and very impressive. Here I have seen my first mola mola and this was great. Unfortunately the provided Information about the animals is very rare or not existing at all which is a bit disappointing. In the amphibian corner some interesting animals are shown but absolutely no info is given what kind of animals they are. Also the staff being present did not seem to b well informed. Our emails beforehand got ignored never receiving any answer. The Restaurant was very little value for money.
Its definitely worth to visit but the place has much more potrntial than what was made out of it.

It has a good collection of marine creatures plus penguins and sea otters.

The place is not so big so not tiring to visit. Lots of kids around and everyone seem to enjoyed watching all the creatures in the aquarium.",Dec 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"For a family of three, it was cheaper to buy a family ticket of four... On the website, they promoted cheaper tickets for permanent exhibition only and available at entry but we were told after queuing instead of getting online tickets that they no longer separate this and only have one higher price for all exhibitions.

It was nevertheless a lovely experience. I expected more than one big pool and tunnels through the water but the otters and penguins made up for it.

We never made it to the temporary exhibition as it was quite tiring and long in the permanent one with all the interactive games etc so still gutted I had to pay for it.

The surrounding was beautiful though outside town so cost 10€ per direction by Uber to get there.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,Relatively small aquarium. There is just one large aquarium and it is not possible to go below (in a round half tube like in aquariums in Barcelona or in Toronto which is more impressive). The remaining parts are also not overly large or impressive.,Dec 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"Made use of the hop on hop off bus to get here and there was a rather large line waiting to get in. Credit to the ticketing staff as it’s a continual flow of visitors, but they keep everyone moving, and a queue that initially looks like it will take a lifetime to get through is fast paced. This really is a sea life lovers dream as it’s absolutely loaded up with everything sea life, see pics.
A nice restaurant / cafe area and a superb gift shop, bit pricey but hey ho. Downside was it was probably too busy inside and you felt slightly rushed through at points. A lot of people wandering aimlessly around.
All in all though a half day well spent and worth the money.

Luckily, everything went very, very smoothly! We got there around 10:00, when the Oceanario opens. There was a minor waiting line and the rest of the day there were not too many visitors. The place itself is beautiful, it is easy to roam around for 3 to 4 hours. Many beautiful sea creatures, such as Manta Rays, Sunfish, Guitar Sharks & of course sea otters!

There are also fun learn&play exhibitons available for smaller kids.

The Temporary exhibition (Forests Underwater by Takashi Amano) was very serene and beautiful. A wonderful fresh perspective on the underwater world. It could use some more variety though.

At the entrance we received two small chocolates, which is a small but kind gesture towards the visitors. Appreciated! The website clearly states it is not allowed to bring your own food. Nevertheless, we saw a lot of families and couples with backpacks which were not checked. Perhaps they do check your bags during the high season..

Even though there aren't as many fish tanks as for example Barcelona's, the tanks are clean, clear and the animals all look healthy and you get to see a lot. Overall great place to visit",Nov 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,Easy to spend hours watching the animals interact in a giant tank. Watch as sharks swim right up to the viewing spots along with hundreds of other sea creatures.,Nov 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"It was unexpectedly interesting, although initially I consider such places suitable either for children or for big nature lovers. Nevertheless, the exposition turned out to be quite modern and suitable for an elderly person. What's more, the otters and penguins were adorable. Well, we saw the feeding of the otters, the animals gave the whole idea of asking for and eating fish. The temporary exhibition dedicated to the work of the Japanese master of underwater landscape was also interesting.
By the way, on the territory of the aquarium is a very decent and relatively inexpensive cafe.",Nov 2019

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"I am not normally a zoo person and don't like to see animals in captivity but since soon that might be the only way to see many of them, this oceanarium is doing a stellar job. The fish are beautiful and amazing. I will say that some of the arctic animals did not look wonderful -- one puffin had a very damaged beak that was not explained. But other displays explained that, for example, the sea otters were rescues and could not be released into the wild again. The rays, sunfish, sharks and others are ENORMOUS. I was there for feeding time, which explains why they have not devoured each other. The displays were informative and the arrangement by ocean ecosystem is helpful -- makes you wonder how they can have all these creatures in the same uber-environment without mixing temperatures, salinity and other factors. An altogether worthwhile experience.

The variety of sea creatures from all possible environments was amazing, and they were extremely well displayed, along with plenty of information. The main aquarium is huge and can viewed on many different levels and from all the way around.
There was a temporary exhibition too, that was available to visit for an additional fee.
As well as the aquarium, there was a large gift shop, a cafe and a good restaurant inspired by Mediterranean cuisine. I can recommend the Bacalhau à Brás.",Mar 2019

The center aquarium is quite huge, with a lot of fish. Plenty of other exhibits also.",Nov 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"I spent a very enjoyable couple of hours in the Oceanarium on a rainy day whilst my wife was in a training course.

The main exhibit is accessed by a walkway which leads you to the top floor (of two).

You are guided around a couple of outdoor mini-habitats with penguins, puffins and sea otters, all grouped around a vast central tank. This is a great spectacle with big sharks, rays, sunfish and other species including schools of smaller fish. You have viewing points though glass on each side.

You then go down a level and see the main tank again from the bottom. It’s large enough and has a varied enough collection there’s always something new to look at. Again, grouped round the tank you have smaller tanks with collections from various climates, etc.

Children seem to find seeing the fish like this fascinating.

My favourite was the leafy sea dragons. They’re amazing.

Good way to break up a holiday, especially if you’re trying to avoid bad weather or in summer, be somewhere cool and dark for an hour or two.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"I went with several young kids and we had a truly wonderful time! This place is truly amazing with its huge glass walls providing lots of view points of the fish swimming. There is so much to see, from little penguins to strange sea creatures! And there are recreational areas spread around and lots of extra activities for kids (with or without their families) including overnight stays for the little ones where they sleep in sleeping bags next to one of the view points, no doubt an unforgettable experience. The oceanarium is really huge so be prepared to spend a good afternoon in there. The oceanarium shop and food areas are simply amazing, very, very stylish and with great products to be purchased. The food court attached to the shop is great and offers lots of options plus there is a chill out seating area outside with great river views. Highly recommend to others

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"An interesting place to visit if you love the sea animals and fish. We were there on Saturday so there were lots of children and parents at the time we visited it. Very educational with a lot of information provided to explain about the sea animals and their habitat, conservation issues etc. But I found that certain sections were too dark and therefore you have to be careful not to step on other people’s foot/feet or even bumped into other visitors. And if you leave your jackets or bags in the locker next to the entrance before you start your tour, at the end of the tour you’d be lead to the souvenir shop and the cafe and then the exit door. You have to exit the building and re-enter again from the main entrance to get your stuff back at the locker. It’s quite inconvenient because if it’s raining you have to run to the main entrance all over again from the outside.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"The cue to enter the Oceanarium was long. We waited for more than half an hour.
And it was well worth the wait.
The layout of the Oceanarium, the collected samples of fish, amphibians and birds are surprising. Especially because of the environment that is designed for them.

Be sure to look and experience the different species of sharks, manta rays, tropical fish in their habitat

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"This was on our list to do while in Lisbon. It's in a lovely part of the city and the building is amazing. The exhibits are fantastic built around the main tank which is just had me in awe. My only gripe was the queues. There was huge queues which I found very disorganised and no one outside controlling them. It should be noted that there are 2 queues, one for the automatic ticket machine and one for the ticket booths, but what we found when we got to the top was that the automatic ticket machine doesn't give out family tickets, which at that point it's too late to go queue for the booths as you have to go back to the end of the other queue. More signs are needed for this.",Oct 2019

There's many levels to see the huge tanks of fish. Coffee shop was reasonable, clean and friendly service. 100% recommend a visit. Walk from Oriente station straight through the big mall opposite the station, don't bother or waste time shopping, you can buy the same in any mall at home. Walk to the sea, then turn right along the board walk and in 400m you'll see the aquarium on your right. Have a great time.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,Apparently good work is performed by these folks. We mere mortals get to see lots of fish in massive aquaria with ridiculously thick glass (which does not obscure the view).

The price is a bit toppy but book online and you nearly get the temporary exhibit for free.,Oct 2019

The grounds outside are so pretty and a nice walk if the weather permits. We highly recommend.,Sep 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"We spent a great few hours at the Oceanario.

Most irritatingly you can’t buy family tickets online and therefore have to queue unless you buy kid and adult tickets separately (very odd).

The Oceanario has a wide collection of species which we enjoyed though would have preferred better signage; especially the amphibian section was a pity not to know what we were seeing.

Food provision looks good but was poor - pasta station very slow and the end result was pretty average and not cheap.

Kids enjoyed but can’t say it was the highlight of our time in Lisbon.

Once inside it can get a bit busy with the huge crowds but be patient and and you get some of best views of the massive aquarium. Try to get a good view about midday for fish feeding time as you get to see the huge schools of fish darting in all directions.

The sea otters are not to miss nor the giant king crab as well as the giant octopuses.

The cafe and restaurant sell the usual drinks and food but the Vasco Da Gama shopping centre is only a stone's throw away and plenty more choice which will please all taste buds.

All-in-all we spent three hours learning so much about conservation and also why the most dangerous species on this planet it actually is humans.

It is surrounded by four smaller spaces which represent different ecosystems (arctic, tropical, etc.), where there are penguins, otters and other animals.
It is highly pedagogical, but also very beautiful. Well worth a visit.
Also well worth a visit is the “temporary” exhibition on underwater gardens, an extraordinary set of aquarium “gardens”, which you visit in a darkened room, with new-age music playing, and spaces to sit and contemplate. A very “trippy” experience, to quote my teenage children.",Sep 2019

It's the first thing you see upon entering, and there's a huge crowd piled up there as a result. Keep walking - you will have multiple ways to access looking in that tank as you proceed through the building. The rest of the aquarium was equally enthralling.

The only probably I had throughout my whole time there was the public. It was extremely busy and there was no space to move around without people barging past. The amount of people with their pushchairs in the way was awful and I believe they shouldn't be allowed in the lower section as there is simply no room for them.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"This gem of Lisbon is worth the trip out of the old city. The aquarium is extensive with not only a huge central tank (which you keep coming back to as you walk the circuit) but tons of smaller aquariums and exhibits. Plenty to appeal to all ages.

Allow plenty of time so you don't feel rushed. Also be sure to see the ""temporary"" (it's been there several years now) exhibit. It's truly a work of art worth taking in, although you won't need tons of time for it so you can save it for the end. There's also a big gift shop that you can't miss where you can pick up all sorts of nice souvenirs.

I didn't explore the area much but it's very pretty and spread out like a park. There are restaurants as well as a shopping mall so you could combine it with a meal and shopping.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"This is a clean and very enjoyable aquarium. There are temporary exhibitions as well as a permanent aquarium, centered around a main tank. Beautifully kept. However due to its fairly small size the place is quite crowded and fairly difficult to navigate with a pram/toddler. Having been to SeaLife London in the past this was a slight let down, although we enjoyed the experience overall.

The booking process through tripadvisor was seemless; the oceanarium website is slightly confusing offering selected entrace times but the tripadvisor ticket allows entrance at any time during the selected day.

But other places in Portugal fully compensated this.",Jul 2019
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"Visited the oceanarium in Oct 19.
Good place to visit if interested in conservation and helping the planet.
Huge tank with different species of fish and around this was the amphibian section as well as a section for penguins and otters. Which were funny and kept showing off!
Location is a little further than anticipated from Lisbon centre however there are plenty of bus stops and taxi ranks nearby.
Cafe area was great and had a good selection of food and drinks.
There are cable cars near the oceanarium which are €6 for a round trip. Worth going on to take you near to the hotel which looked like a sail! Plenty of bars and restaurants near there too for a quiet drink.

Overall the oceanarium is a great place to visit. Makes you think more about preserving our beautiful planet!

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"We came up out of the Metro at Oriente and we were a bit disoriented so use you GPS for the 5 minute walk to the aquarium. Buy your ticket just get the regular ticket there is so much to see.
Go upstairs (after you use the restrooms on the ground level) start at the main tank, it will be crowded there so leave quickly following the suggested route.
The main tank is visible on your left from almost all the exhibits so you will have lots of time to see all the sea life.

This aquarium is better than most in the world so don’t miss it if you are in Lisbon more than 3 days.

On the way Bach to the Metro there is a great underground mall.

Interesting side pools themed around different continents. Highlights were the rays, sharks, sun fish and sea otters. We’ve never been so close to sea otters at other aquariums, so it was a real treat to see them up close.

Lots of viewing points for the main tank so it never felt crowded. Temporary exhibit a nice touch - see it before you head to the main aquarium. We spend 2 hours there and it was very good.",Oct 2019

The central tank is the main feature with loads of big and small windows around so you can enjoy watching the fish on your own or on a panoramic window with others.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Such an awe-inspiring gem of a place. Educational, therapeutic, inspiring and leaves you feeling you want to make a change to the natural world after walking out on behalf all the wild and wonderful species you are privileged to see. I would never have thought I would have the chance to see many of these unique creatures in person, however, Oceanario de Lisboa provided that opportunity. Go at your own pace (it took me about 3 hours), the venue is very well laid out and easy to navigate, read the placards on the various species at your leisure, about what they are, a brief description of them and whether they are vulnerable in the wild or not. I would recommend this to the young or old and everyone inbetween, if they were to come to Lisbon!

The only negative is that it is located slightly outside the main city centre, but that is only if I was actively searching for something negative. However, it is only a 25 minutes underground metro ride to the stop ""Oriente"" and 10-15 mins walk and the metro is inexpensive. The locals were happy to help.

The permanent sections contain an astounding array of sea life, designed so that you are continually circling the main feature of the sharks and rays. There is a common thread throughout about the damage we are doing to the oceans. The current temporary exhibition was a bit disappointing, although it may be that the subtlety of the work comes across more effectively if you visit it before the permanent sections. Great for families.

You can always take the hop on-hop off buses which have stops there. Entrance for adult is 16 Euros for the standard exhibition. It is well worth the visit with very interesting fishes & animals inside with aquariums featuring specific species. It was a refreshing break from the busy city. One of the best Oceanarios in the world that I have visited so far. However, mind the steps leading from the first level to the lower one. A signage or indication should be accommodated to lead you in the dark as we almost missed the first step.
You can chill at a beautiful boutique & cafeteria space at the end of the visit. Highly recommend it.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,Even though they advertise this aquarium as the biggest in Europe I have to say its pretty basic when compared to the ones in Australia and USA. The only real attraction is the big tank where we can see all kinds of fish. Since it is dark inside the aquarium you will feel like you have to watch when you walk not to bump into the pillars and black walls which we can't even see. It is definitely not worth the entrance fee I can say.,Aug 2019

I actually started by crossing Ponte Infante Dom Henrique which offers a nice side view to Ponte Dom Luis, then on my way back ended up crossing Dom Luis.

You get very pretty pictures at night, even the train crossing the bridge is a nice addition to the pictures lol

It connects the banks of the Douro River. This is a two-story steel bridge built in the 19th century. The bridge was designed by engineer Teofilo Seyrig from the Gustave Eiffel group. There are plenty of restaurants and bars near the bridge. Part of Porto's rich nightlife is concentrated here. On warm days, there is a lot of buzz around and the music is often in the air, which creates a great atmosphere. There is a wonderful view of the beautiful river and the city from the top.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"When Guy de Maupassant was asked what place in Paris he liked best, he replied-the Eiffel Tower. Because it's the only place in Paris where you can't see it. The Ponte de Dom Luís I, which was built by Eiffel's disciple Théophile Seyrig, is good when you look at it and when you look from it. It is no accident that the bridge was included in various ratings of the best bridges in the world and together with the nearby monastery was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. But the main thing is that the bridge is the best viewing platform in Porto. From here you can enjoy wonderful views of the Ribeira and Vila Nova de Gaia quays, the Douro River and the whole city. The bridge has two tiers. By the way, Eiffel lost the competition to his student and companion due to the fact that he proposed a single-tier bridge, which even then in 1886 didn`t match the demographic growth of Porto. Pedestrian paths are available on each of them. Each of them is not without its drawbacks.The path on the lower tier is separated from the traffic by a fence, but it is very narrow - the width of a person. Of course, the best views are from the upper span of the bridge. However, here the pedestrian path is not separated from the roadway in any way. Fortunately, only high-speed trams run here. You can walk freely on the bridge in both directions. Interestingly, the bridge was paid until 1944. Now selfies from the bridge are free. The main thing is not to drop the smartphone in the Douro...

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"A Beautiful Architectural Marvel

This is one of the most iconic bridges, that I have had the pleasure to observe, and even travel across. In November, we were back to Vila Nova de Gaia, and were again blessed with a view of the Ponte de Dom Luis I bridge from our room. It was gorgeous both night and day, and we awoke to it, and also went to be to it.

On this abbreviated trip (work truncated the visit on both ends), we only crossed it once, and that was to dine in Porto, across the River from us.

The structure is magnificent, and its unique structure is beautiful during the day, but it really comes to life in the evening, with the lighting, which reflect in the waters of the Douro below.

It serves three purposes, all aimed at crossing the mighty Douro River: it’s a pedestrian bridge (though we have never walked it), a railway bridge, and then an automobile traffic bridge.

This is a must do, when in Porto, or Vila Nova de Gaia, and we were blessed to be able to see it at all hours of the day.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"Dom Luis I bridge is a symbol of Porto.
You can see Gustavo Eiffel's influence when you look at the bridge but it was not designed or built by him as some people believe but by one of his most talented pupils (Théophile Seyrig).
Ponte Dom Luis I divides the city in two different sides. It links Ribeira with Gaia. You will see the river as well as the houses of Ribeira from one side and the O porto wine cellars from another. There is an upper and lower bridge. Both allow pedestrians.
You have amazing views from the top of the bridge but definitely it’s not for those with fears of heights. Walking along the top level with the trams passing beside you is a great experience but a little bit scary if you are afraid of heights.
For photographer the upper deck is a hotspot, especially in the early morning or evening.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"PhilTraveller says: this bridge dominates the Ribeira area, and spans the Douro River.

It had two levels - one connects the higher parts of the city either side of the Douro River, and is used by the city’s excellent metro trains. And you can walk into it from street level and cross to the pleasant PatK opposite Ribeira.

The second lower level is at river height and carries cars, and again you can walk it, to get between Ribeira and the port wine merchants across the river.

TIP: if you are staying uphill from the river, then a great circular walk would be to head first to the top level if the bridge ( rather than going down to the lower river level)... cross the upper level , visit the park & cathedral, and then wind your way on foot down to the port wine merchants on the riverside below (or take the cable car down ) ... then walk back across the lower level of the bridge to Ribeira.

The bridge is free to cross. It’s very safe and easy to walk ... no movement etc.

The views are phenomenal and a good few spots fro some great photos. You arrive at the other side of the river and you can access the chair lift for a few euros which,again, has great views and takes you right into the centre of the Vila Nova de Gaia where you can sample a few ports in the old lodges which house the port producers.
Alternately you can take the walkway across the bottom of the bridge accessed from the bottom end of Ribeira and arrive at the edge of Vila Nova de Gaia, walk through the market stalls which sell Portuguese goodies at a fraction of the price you would pay in Porto itself. You can walk near the rivers edge and sample the port lodges as well as sampling some of the many restaurants and bars. You can then get the local ferry across the river back to Ribera..

England should take note as we knock down and build monstrous ugly buildings in place. The only down side we found was two things, the food seemed boring, the same sort of thing in most restaurants and believe me we looked at hundreds. Several were closed, to get something different you had to pay a lot of money. The second thing was people begging and aggressively, they actually pull you or get hold of your hand, we had this happen at least once a day, but they were everywhere.
There was one man with three little dogs not far from the hotel, we went past him at 10am going out then in the evening at 7.30 he was still there but hanging one of the dogs in the air with it’s lead while kicking the other two little dogs. It was very upsetting I fact I tried to stop him. This upset me and quite a lot of people passing by.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,"Outstanding views of Porto

There are two walking sections of the bridge- the top deck & bottom deck. The top deck has better views & the sidewalks are wider. The bottom deck is so narrow two people must squeeze pass if going in opposite directions. The bottom portion of the bridge leads to all the quintas.

The top part has trams that go across it but no cars & the bottom has cars but no trams.

I think the top part has the better views & is better for walking.

Walk the top of the bridge & then continue walking one block & making two left turns going up the steep climb to the monastery for even better views.

Be careful of the tram as it doesn’t make much noise & will easily run you over if you aren’t paying attention.

We took an Uber for 3E from the top part of the bridge to the Taylor quinta so we would not have to walk up/down the steep streets & we would highly recommend this.

Wait to see the subway train emerge from the city's underground and zip over the bridge.
Next, you may want to go down to the lower level for a different perspective. You can get there by foot, on the antique stone stairs while admiring the narrow walls closing in on you, the derelict medieval ruins and the picturesque windows and balconies. Other options to descent to the water level are the Funicular dos Guindais or the Elevador Lada Ribeira.

It is so uniquely placed with historical premises intact that walking on its surface you every time admire how beautifully this engineering project was realized.
Views from it seize all your attention and permit to restore in your memory many facts you learnt some days about the very bridge and this place.

It could be advised for patient walking in the morning, just within an hour of being there you'll acquire good moods for the whole day :).

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"The bridge is insanely horrifying and up extremely high with a tiny railing that even a small baby could fall over. It is a gorgeous piece of architecture but has clearly been used in dozens of gangland style murders, pushing unsuspecting people over the railing to their untimely deaths. Walk over it in the middle and give the finger to the tram if it tries to get in your way, you are far more powerful than it, going anywhere near the edges is a recipe for sudden and instant death, your family will not mourn you for this foolishness if you get within a metre of the railing.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"One of the landmarks of the city, the iconic Ponte Dom Luis I spans the River Douro linking the wine houses of Vila Nova de Gaia with the bustling downtown Ribeira district of Porto.

The bridge has two levels, both of which were initially intended to carry road traffic.
Nowadays, the lower deck is reserved to the cars while the upper one is used by the trains of Porto metro. Moreover, each deck has a pedestrian walkway. 

I guess it is worth making the crossing on the upper level (60 metres above the river), although it might not be for everyone (not for me for sure 😀) !

Curiosity: The bridge was designed by the engineer Théophile Seyrig who took the bridge “Dona Maria Pia” , built years before by the famous Gustave Eiffel,of whom he was a disciple and later a business partner, as a model.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"We crossed the bridge multiple times on foot and a cheeky extra journey by tram on the way in from the airport. Did you know that your metro ticket lasts an hour and a half? Make sure to tap your Andante card on the reader when changing lines. Then just stay on the train (or change, depending where you are staying) and turn around at Jardim do Morro.

It was fun to be able to take this scenic route and have an immediate overview of Porto on the way in, but the main reason I'm writing is to update people on the crime situation I'd read about on this forum before our trip. I'm happy to report that we didn't see anything like what others have described. Perhaps we were lucky, or perhaps police have cracked down on criminals preying on tourists, but all we saw, day and night, was other tourists on the bridge. The only dangers were trams on the top level and cars on the lower. The footpaths have ample space, but many pedestrians are distracted. I am grateful for the warnings provided by other Trip Advisor reviewers, and thankful that they proved unnecessary.

One should always be vigilant, but on the basis of personal experience, I'm happy to recommend dinner on the Villa Nova de Gaia side, as its restaurants are empty in the evenings. I've already written a review of the Casa Dias, and I'd be surprised if reservations were required anywhere on that side of the riverfront. Then it's a lovely romantic walk back across the bridge, which is lit up at night.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"It’s fun to cross the Douro on this amazing bridge. Pedestrians can cross at the lower level span of the road bridge deck or above adjacent to the railway track between the hilly area either side of the river. It links the busy Ribeira riverside with the town Nova Vila de Gaia. From either bank there’s a great view of the bridge sitting between the cliff like sides. It’s definitely worth crossing the river by the bridge or by river taxi to reach Gaia where the port houses are located and this side not only has many little restaurants and bars including cafe/bars serving a large variety of port styles and producers by the glass, it has the benefit of looking over to the south facing colourful buildings on the Ribeira side and up the hills of Porto.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,"This attraction is very much the tourist centre of Porto. The bridge is very impressive and photogenic. We walked across the lower level, seeing the boys trying to raise money by offering to jump off then on to the Gaia side. The prices on the market stalls on the other side visibly fell the further you got from the bridge. It was much quieter and less frenzied on the Gaia side and we preferred it. We found small cafes that were much cheaper than the right bank of the Duoro. We wanted to walk back across the top level but were too exhausted to climb to the top so got the cable car. This was expensive but gave us free entry to one fo the Port tasting warehouses, which was very interesting and turned me on to Port. Walking back across the bridge at the top level was more difficult as it is high and the path is narrow - slow elderly tourists made it take a long time. Also some people stopped to take photos, causing jams.

Thousands cross this bridge daily usually back and forth. You get a fantastic view of Porto from the bridge especially the height section.
A must when visiting.",Sep 2019

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"Wow! is the word that first came to mind when i saw this bridge. It is magnificent, both viewed from the river side (river Douro) and looking down from the cathedral on the opposite side. It links the cities of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia.... There were a couple of people standing on the side of the bridge saying they were attempting to jump off it. They keep people watching for as long as possible, attracting more viewers and, I guess, more money.... never stayed long enough to see if any of them actually jumped. Far better things to see in the districts both sides of the bridge.",Aug 2019
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,1.0,"This bridge is without doubt a spectacular tourist attraction. I have been in Porto many times and used this bridge often but on 27/9/19, I assisted a person in a wheelchair to cross the lower section. Never again. We followed the signs which are in poor condition and used the correct narrow metal pathway to cross. The reality is people cross and walk in both directions on both sides of the bridge. This could be avoided if the signs were better. We were confronted by people with pushchairs and small children crossing in the wrong direction. Impossible to pass. Mums and dads had to lift pushchairs down onto the road surface when drivers were prepared to stop. Totally unacceptable and dangerous. Also footpaths at both sides of the bridge were heavily congested mainly because people gathered to watch the bridge jumpers. Why do the authorities allow this. If it is dangerous for people with limited mobility and children in pushchairs at busy times I suggest proper signage should advise this. I don't know the bridges safety record but this a disaster waiting to happen. Not all tourists are able bodied and have full mobility. There are alternative ways to cross the river safely but at extra cost.

We first walked over the bridge on the lower part that took us to Vila Nova de Gaia with all the wine cellars. This part is used by cars so the air could have been better. There was a steady stream of pedestrians crossing with patience since all allowed stops for taking the photos. On the other side we decided to take the cable car to reach the upper part of the bridge to walk back to the Porto side. The view is spectacular and there was even more people since only one walkway of the bridge was open for pedestrians, still patient to allow for each and everyone to take the pictures. If in Porto the walk over the Luis bridge is a must.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"After touring the city of Porto which I recommend, we crossed one of the three bridges on the way back and caught a Gazebo down to our river cruise boat. To get to Porto from the opposite side of the river we walked the lower bridge and I feel this is more dangerous than the high bridge as cars are traveling and the walkway is narrow for two way traffic. The upper bridge was a train bridge and had a seven foot barrier. My wife is afraid of heights but challenged herself. It is a long trek and people stop for selfies which created problems as you want to keep moving. The left side of the bridges barrier is not high enough and with the crazy people we read about today, nothing is from keeping some nut case from throwing you off the bridge. We made it over and glad we did.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"As we entered Porto on the train from Lisbon this beautiful bridge spanning the Douro River suddenly came into view and was a spectacular sight. The train track was along the ridge so you could see the bridge and city of Porto from this high point. Later, we traveled across the bridge by foot along the top as well as below. The walkways are narrow and there can be traffic on the lower level. The upper walkway was sectioned off by temporary fencing for some reason. The views from the bridge are awesome and we saw many boats crossing underneath. If you are planning on taking photos go in the early morning or before sunset to have the buildings along the river illuminated in beautiful light.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,Highly recommend crossing the bridge from Porto to Gaia. The views are amazing and there is still so much to do/look at in Gaia. Don’t just hit Porto.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,"You have to cross the Luís Bridge if you are in Porto. Lower level is for cars and pedestrians and upper level the metro and pedestrians means you can walk both ways. It is a lovely bridge but also connects Gaia and the port houses with Ribeira. Great views from upper level but hard to get snaps with so many folks about. Lower level brings the kids jumping into the Douro for money.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"This bridge is so gorgeous. If I had a better word I would use it but gorgeous will have to do. My husband and two sons wanted to walk across the top to go over to Gaia for our Port tour at Cockburns. I couldn't really think of a valid reason to object, except for my fear of heights, so off we went. We took the funicular up to the top on the Porto side and walked around the block to the beginning of the bridge. It is really high up there, but once I was on the bridge, it wasn't really a problem anymore. The trains run up there, but slowly and not very often, so you can walk away from the edge. But that wasn't even necessary for very long. I really wanted to see what was happening on either side of the river. It is such an amazing view. Ferries and other boats coming and going, kids playing along the shore, restaurants and shops, just so much happening. And the views of the city in either direction were great. Loads of places to stop and take pics. Great for sunset views as well. Highly recommend.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,"Bridging old-town Porto and Gaia, the Dom Luis stretches across the river Douro and is arguably Porto's best known landmark.

A double-decker bridge where cars can transit on the bottom tier, the Porto Metro the top and pedestrians welcome on both, the bridge was seen as something of an engineering marvel at the time of its construction, and despite its tourist-centric status remains a highly practical structure to this day.

While a bridge may seem an odd thing for a tourist attraction, the reason the Dom Luis attracts such a constant crowd is the spectacular views it offers on the upper tier.

While I'm not sure I would call it a must see in the grand scheme of things, I would call Porto a city everyone should visit, and you can't really take it in without at least strolling across this mighty structure once.

It's a nice place, the only beach eatery seemed pretty good value but we couldn't get in as you have to book and we didn't know, it was packed. The queue for a drink took 30 minutes and the prices for water are a bit more than Albufeira, after all, we kept getting told it was an 'exclusive beach'. Got a good spot near the rocks and enjoyed the baking heat and the cool sea water, stayed 4 hours and then met a great bloke who runs the surf school shack in the car park who kindly called us an UBER taxi to get us back, it arrived in 5 minutes and cost 9 Euros, well-pleased!, lovely place but God only knows how much it is to stay here.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"For being a portuguese beach it’s so easy to access.
Free car parking but you have to go early in the morning.
Nice restaurant with wide assortment of dishes (even with fresh fish).
It’s an amazing beach with cliffs and caves and you can also go to some other exclusive beaches by the sea (kayaks, paddle surf, boats ...)

There is a lively bar/restaurant which serves good food and the stunning scenery and safe swimming tops it off. Great beach.,Jul 2019
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,"Rating any place is usually based on where else one has been. The beaches we've visited in Portugal have either been full of tourists (the nice sandy beaches) or with difficult access and laden with seaweed and rocks. We usually choose the latter to avoid droves of humanity. There were various spots one could sit/lie or, if one desired to pay 18 euro, one could get a recliner with an umbrella or sun shade. The water is quite cold and not the welcoming temperature of the Mediterranean. There was a nonstop passage of cruise and tour boats as well as kayaks and paddle boats. Easily accessible by walking (from the marina), uber/bolt, or private car, it's an easy place to get to.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"Top class accommodation in a quiet attractive area. The complex has a pool area accessible only to pass holders (passes obtained from central office for qualifying residents). Photos show a small selection of of some of the items I particularly liked in the spacious airy apartment.

There is no air conditioning, however, the apartment block is a concrete structure keeping the internal temperature low, with balconies to front and rear allowing for throughput of air.

There are a variety of hotels and restaurants in the surrounding area, but not on the “doorstep”, so take good walking shoes.

Albufeira town is a short taxi ride away (approx 10 mins) at a cost of 8 euros each way and well worth a visit - bars, restaurants, leather goods, clothes, grocery stores etc.

I would not recommend this type of holiday to disabled people (particularly wheelchair users) as the local terrain is extremely hilly and walkways are of cobblestone construction.

Speaking from a personal perspective I benefitted from my stay as my exercise levels increased significantly.

The beach is surrounded by some stunning and grand rock faces which along with the great weather, nice sand and brilliant restaurant makes this one of the best beaches I’ve visited. The only downside is how cold the water is but that can’t be helped. Regardless it is great for swimming and the cold temperature is actually refreshing in the heat.
From the beach you go on paddle board and kayaking trips and also hire surf gear.
The restaurant directly off the beach also served some of the best meals we had all holiday.
There is a large car park just a couple of minutes from the beach if you need to drive.
This beach isn’t suitable for wheelchairs or anyone unstable on their feet as there is a very steep slope to get down to the beach. It was quite challenging with a push chair.

Cons. Sunbeds. A complete rip off. 6 adults at a cost of 16 Euros a couple. 3 couples in our group which equates to 48 Euros!!!!! Told the vendor he should check out sunbed prices on Greek Islands where they are half the price. Needless to say we only spent one day at São Rafael beach.",Sep 2018

What’s most important about this review is beware of unbelievable rip tides that I’ve never experienced before (to the left hand side of the beach if facing out to sea).

My teenage son nearly lost his life here if it wasn’t for the expert quick thinking of the life guards and other beach visitors. Which I thank them dearly for.

Difficult to swim in even for experienced swimmers.

I wouldn’t allow small children in the water so please be careful.

Dont use the restaurant on the beech, the staff had no personality and we were kept waiting. If you walk up to the car park and go left you will come to an amazing restaurant with an amazing view and food.

Just be warned, there are a lot of jagged rock formation under the water on parts of the beach.

On the western end is a little cave which we dubbed crab cave. I've never seen so many crabs in my life.

Quite a strong current/waves on stony area on the way into the water which my 12 year old son loved, but something you'd need to be aware of with young children or someone with mobility/balance problems.
There is a walkway/steps leading down/up so this is also something to be aware of again with mobility issues.
You can hire single/dual/triple canoes (between 15 and 25 Euro) for an hour, also paddle boards too.

Water sports available on the beach.
Only negative point is the water, the waves and shelf very near the shoreline make it unsafe for small kids. Witnessed lots of adults getting knocked over by the waves, fine if you stay with the kids and can get past the waves breaking on the shore. However we still managed a dip with the older kids.",Jun 2017

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"São Rafael is a beautiful soft sandy beach, with dramatic cliffs forming a picturesque backdrop. It is a Blue Flag Beach, the top accolade for safety (there is a lifeguard), water quality, etc. There is a ramp and graded steps for getting down, which is not too steep. There is a restaurant on the beach, quite expensive, which many beach restaurants are but you can choose carefully, or simply relax and indulge. If ordering fish from the display, please make sure that you ask them to weigh it and tell you the price first, or you might get a nasty shock at the end of your meal. Ordering from the menu, if the price is given, you at least know exactly what you are paying. A beautiful beach and the perfect spot for taking photos. Please don't sit under any of the cliffs, as they can be unsafe. There are stunning cliff-top walks but again, don't walk too close to the edge.

It's really fun. There is a decent sized car park but can get filled up very quickly. This is highly recommended beach if you are in Albufeira and looking for a quiet beach. Have fun.,Oct 2016

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,We love this beach as it's not too big but quite intersting with big rock formations to add interest. There is a beach bar but we went for lunch at 2pm and it was full. We didn't think youd need a reservation at a beach bar but it was choc a bloc. It was pretty expensive for lunch though. They sell ice lollies too though which is good for the kids. We would recommend taking a picnic with you.There is plenty parking and the sand is very clean.,Oct 2016

Sunbeds are €15 for 2 per day

Sea is lovely and clear sand is soft and clean, well worth a visit.",Oct 2016
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"Nice sized beach and tucked away a little. The beach off the strip from Albufeira is very much a stag and hen do beach, but this one in Sao Rafael is lovely.

It has a more family feel to it and is very clean and big enough for everything you would want. There are coastal walks and caving available, along with the usual pedalo hire.

There is a nice little bar/restaurant there as well. This is a little expensive as it's the only thing around unless a resident at the hotel overlooking the beach.

Two sunbeds and an umbrella hire was €15, which is not bad for the day, but if only going for a couple of hours, I would recommend you bring your own umbrella and lie on towels on the sand.

Water lovely and clear and lots of rocks around to look for crabs when the tide is right.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"Sao Rafael is a very nice beach, not very big with nice cliffs on the both sides. We've been really impressed with it and if you go there, you must have the diving googles with you as in the water, not far, so not in deep water you can have a chance to see thousands of little fish and a few big ones, within the hand reach, also nice see bed with rocks and sand.
Go up on the cliffs as well, the views are stunning.",Sep 2016
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"32 of us arrived just after lunch having arrived from the UK that day. This is absolutely the best thing to do once you've checked in to your hotel and dumped your bags. Sun, sea, smiling faces at the bar and great banter! What else is there to say?",Sep 2016
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"Visited here in Sept 2016, took our own parasol and towels and stayed all day in the sun. Beautiful beach with rocky cliffs and outcrops that spill into the sea. Can get quite wavey at times but we found it fine to paddle and swim in. Gets busy but not overly so and you can walk the length of the beach in about 5 minutes.

The swimming was the main attraction for me, spent most of the day in the sea!

Was just a 15 min walk from our apartment, we will definitely return the next time we visit the area.

It's great for children as there are shady parts near the rocks. It also has toilets. I would recommend taking your own snacks as the restaurant can be expensive.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,Good mix of sand and rocks to explore. The beach does get busy but we were always able to get beds for 15 euros a set with an umbrella.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,We took a cab here from Albufeira and spent a day on this very popular beach. We were told it was good fro snorkelling but my husband didn't see any fish.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"Great beach for shelter, some shade, rock formations, nice sea temp and waves. Nearby bar and restaurant are popular and tasty.",Aug 2016
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"We had read reviews about this beach being busy before arriving. It's very true that you need to be there and parked around 10:00 as the car park fills up really quickly. But we did find a space just after 10:00. It's a short steep descent to the beach, so would not advise for anyone less able bodied. Despite previous reviews stating that you can't get a sun bed, at around 80% were vacant. It's 15 euros a day for 2 sunbeds and a parasol. The beach it's self is spectacular with a lot of rocks at the shore line, so be careful when you go in to paddle and the area that is safe for swimming is quite small therefore busy. Had lots of fun riding the strong waves, which were powerful, so you need to be very water confident to enjoy this water experience. We would not recommend this beach for small children. There is a lovely cafe/restaurant there, with excellent, good humoured staff. There is plenty of choice on the menu which encludes sandwiches, salads, burgers and if your feeling extravagant there is a good range of local speciality fish which looked delicious and costs 60 euros per a kilo! We there for stuck with a sandwich which by the way was divine. Before we knew it six blissfull hours had passes us by and we returned to our accommodation happy and relaxed. We definitely recommend this beach!

We found a space at the far end and managed to stay for a couple of hours after which we had to get out of the sun!,Aug 2016
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,A GREAT little beach with fresh fish restaurant and wonderful views.Great when tide is out and you need your camera for stunning shots.Recommend for food and drink overlooking the sea. Kids had fun. A little bit rocky but this makes for the ambience of the location. AT LOW TIDE lots of beach. Very friendly location and worth a visit if you like exploring and getting away from the main strips.,Aug 2016
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,There is a carpark at the top of the cliffs if you need it. Don't know where the bus stop is. Sandy beach. parasol hire is 15 euros/ day.

No showers beachside to clean off the sand when you leave.,Aug 2016

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,"We went on a Sunday morning and by lunch it was pretty busy but not so that you were squashed or hemmed in. A nice beach with lifeguards but other than that there's nothing there; great if you're looking for something quieter then! There is a restaurant which served good range of foods for lunch. There are also public toilets at the entrance to the beach. The car park was full when we came to leave after having lunch. Wished we'd bought some of those mini beach parasols - there is no shelter! Saw a man selling cold drinks and snacks from his cooler box but we didn't try so can't say how reputable this is! You can get an ice-cream from the take-away bit of the restaurant. Beach appeared clean; sea was a bit rough that day but you could still go in. Beach shelves off quickly and steeply so you don't go too far off. All in all a lovely morning on the beach.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,"As the beach located closest to the strip and many prime resorts, this beach can be crowded with loud tourists (read: the Dutch). However, some quiet spots can be found. The rocky area is also great fun to explore; there are many caves and places to climb where not many people go to.

As we were mostly looking for a quiet beach to calm down, this beach was not our favorite. However, it is great if you have been partying all night and need a place to recooperate and prepare for your next night out on the strip.",Jul 2016

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"We tried a few beaches in the surrounding of Albufeira and this one was our favourite. We went back 4 times in this vacation which says it all. Free parking, but you must come early until 10:00, sun chairs for rent and very nice restaurant but expensive for lunch, drinks and snacks. The beach is beautiful just have a look at the photos. You can rent water sport gear or even book a tour to the caves wirh a kayak or sup. The beach get very crowded from August, locals are in holiday and they storm the beach, so again get here early.
To get here you need a car or taxi. If you are driving from Albufeira head direction Marina and continue south until the first round about, take left and the first right. On the secons sign of the beach take left and continue until the parking.

They are renovating or building a new building on the beach. I assume it will be ready to welcome visitors once the next season starts.
There is a parking place next to the beach so accessing the beach by car is easy. I don't know about public transport, but I assume such is available during the tourist season.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,One of the nicest beaches we found. We spent the afternoon here with our two year old. We also had a lovely meal in the restaurant.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"This is a really nice beach, surrounded by burnt orange cliffs it is more peaceful and relaxing than fishermans beach which is overlooked by many bars and restaurants. There is one casual restaurant and toilet facilities so its comfortable to spend the day here. Its also cleaner than Fishermans beach, which like many beaches in the area is littered with cigarette butts. Would be my preferred beach in Albufeira",Jul 2015
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"Early February - warm (not hot) day - we are in the area for a couple of months with our caravan and had a visit from our grandchildren who live over the border in Spain. This beach was perfect - quiet, unspolit and beautiful.

The kids (12 and 8) especially enjoyed finding fossils in the sandstone rocks.

The sand beach was perfect for playing.

There are excellent clifftop walks accessible from the car park.

The beach restaurant was closed - but no problem because Carlos Beach bar a few miles away was open for lunch..... I've reviewed that separately.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"We have been staying in the Sao Rafael area for the last five years during February and March. This beautiful cove and beach has clean shelving sand backed by ochre/orange cliffs and is easily reached from the adjoining car park down a somewhat steep ramp/stairs combination. The rugged cliffs reflect the heat of the sun making sun bathing quite pleasant even in 18-22 degrees Celsius weather i.e most days in winter. The clifftop paths are quite rugged in places but extensive, linking Sao Rafael to a number of other cove beaches which are smaller and rockier. The beach is adjacent to a five star hotel, five minutes drive from Albufeira Marina with its restaurants and ten minutes to the centre of Albufeira. The beach restaurant is closed in the winter. TAfterwards, treat your family to the most delicious,largest, least expensive slice of Black Forest cake in Europe(!) at the Florenca restaurant on the main road through Albufeira, just beside the Pinge Doce supermarket at the Watches roundabout.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"We were staying close by during the spring season in the Algarve and this was a stunning beach to walk to. Golden sand, beautiful coastline with little rock islands. The Restuarant on the beach wasn't open as its low tourist season but that made it even better to be able to walk around with very few tourists around. There are little dirt pathways leading off the main road on the way down that you ca follow to get to the cliffs. Be careful at the cliffs as there's no barrier to the edge but it's an absolutely amazing view, definitely visit if you are in the area.",Jan 2016

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"At first I was hesitant about visiting this place. Its location is rather remote and we weren't able to find any way of getting there using a public transportation. Having stayed in the centre of Albufeira we were fairly satisfied with the beach there (Praia do Peneco). Thankfully we ended up taking a taxi there.

The first thing stands out are the breathtaking views of the beach and the cliffs to its right from the hill. After taking a few pictures you'll feel a strong urge to getting into a postcard business!

The beach itself is really close to being perfect. The sand is golden and fine, there is little stones there. The water is quite clear. It's not overcrowded, though if you're looking for a secluded beach that's not a great place to go.

However the thing making the greatest impression are the rock formations scattered around along the coastline. As far as I know such rocks can be found only in Algarve and Sao Rafael is definitely one of the best places there you can see them.

Another great suprise is the sea cave embedded in the cliff on the right-hand side. As far as I remember, to access it you need to crawl through a small gap, but it's totally worth it. If it's your first time in a sea cave you'll be amazed and feel a bit like Indiana Jones while discovering its passages. However be careful as the rocks are very sharp. Also do not attempt to enter it while a high tide as the gap and partially the cave will be filled with water thus entering and leaving it could be a real trouble.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"This World class beach was considered one of the most beautiful in the world in 2012. With some great and nice scarps, nice golden sand, you find a clean, crystal water to bath.

Parking is hard if you go after 10h30AM.",Sep 2015
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"This beach has beautiful sand, as does most of the beaches in the Algarve. It does get really busy even out of season, as many locals come down at the weekend to 'soak up the sun' The sea is a little rough (the Atlantic) and usually cold, but if that doesn't bother you there's plenty of other bathers in there to keep you company! There is a beach bar for drinks and meals. Just a warning the diners are given priority to sit inside the beach bar, so if you just want a drink you may be disappointed as the seating is very limited around the edges of the bar. The toilets of a majority of the bars here are quite clean considering they are on the beach itself. The waiters are mostly polite, but their main service is for the diners. The meals are a little expensive, as I suppose you expect at a beach-side bar. You get the usual things like sardines, pizzas, chips etc. /There is always a breeze on all the beaches so remember to use plenty of sun cream and protection as the sea breeze will easily burn you without you realizing it.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,"We were staying at the hotel next to the beach, Sao Rafael Atlantico so the beach was easy to get to, just a 5 minute walk and no worries about parking! The beach is quite small, but the sand and sea are very clean (I even saw lots of little fish swimming in the shallow water!). The sea's nice to swim in, but you have to be careful of the big rocks in the water which are very close to the shoreline. I can imagine that if you stubbed your toe on one of those things you'd know about it!!
One side of the beach is dedicated to sun loungers and the other half to umbrellas. There is a charge for using the sun loungers (not sure how much because we were never asked to pay strangely enough!) Get there early to get a good spot as it's very popular in summer and fills up quickly.
Nice restaurant and bar but quite expensive - and you have to have a strong stomach for the toilet - be warned!!

Great little bar / restaurant as well so do yourself a favour and have a day here. 15 Euros a day for 2 sun protected if needed sun beds.",Sep 2015
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"A great beach with plenty of space and shade. The view is breathtaking in its beauty and sheer dramatic presence. I found myself mouth open for the 1st 10 minutes!!

Rentals of sun loungers are available for 15 euros per day.

A great bar/ restaurant located at one side of the beach. We didn't eat here but it was packed with long queues for take out food so assume good food.

You can rent pedalo's and kayaks for 1 hour. We hired the pedalo as large enough for a family of 5, with a slide built in.

Only downside is that the tide is very strong trying and does tend to pull you towards the cliffs.

All in all, a great place to play safely with family whilst enjoying one of the best beaches I've ever visited.

It is frequented by Portuguese people and tourists alike. Tow sun beds could be purchased for 15 Euros before 4pm and 10 Euros there after. The position of these beds are high up from the sea but the life guards ensure that no body puts up parasols in front of you which would potentially interrupt you view of the sea. If you don't want to pay for a sunbed there is ample space for you to lay your towel down. There is a bar and restaurant which serves the beach, I didn't get anything but it looked good.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,"We have just travelled back from a week in Portugal in a Villa. We stayed in Sao Rafeal in a James Villa. The first issue was the hire car. I paid to upgrade to an estate car as we had 5 passengers and 5 suitcases. However Hertz tried to give us a small car and we had to go back in and tell them an estate car although this was clearly on our booking details. Then the sat nav was in German and noone helped us to change it to English- over all they gave the impression they weren't bothered. Once we managed to get to out villa it was nice . However no air conditioning so hot and metal shutters over the windows that made one hell of a noise each night at it was windy. Weather was disappointing as only 3 days of sun with cloud and some rain on other days. There was an old woman living under our vailla whom i assume was the owner as 1 night as we were outside talking sh apperaed around the pool which scared our children. WE also asked the James villa rep to check our luggae allowance as there was an issue on the way out with my daughter's luggage allowance not being recognised and she promised to ring us on the Monday but we never heard from her again. Finally the location wasn't great as there wasn't any real shops for food or gifts in walking distance and trying to drive anywhere was a bit mad- the drivers are crazy. Both supermarkets we visited were really busy and not an enjoyable experience. Food at the restaurants was slow - 4 hours one night and the food was hit and miss.

Wander around the cliffs, there are some great places to take photos as well. But what makes the beach even more perfect is the paddleboard hiring service on the left of the beach, owned by an amazingly friendly guy who will make sure you stand on a paddleboard in the ocean quicker than you would have thought you could.

You can also walk above the cliffs on numerous pathways (be max. careful = slippery on dust, sometimes on the edges of the cliff ! ) with excellent views . We were also swimming through some brilliant caves
( direction west), but this is only suitable for GOOD swimmers with stamina. It is also quite RISKY due to the waves /sea currents near the sharp rocks and excursion boats passing sometimes very close to swimmers.
Never go alone into it !!!, but at least in 3, the best with some inflatable /cork rescue thing - in case of problem - as there is NO other possible help around.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"In short, this is a small beach with a beautiful view. Would assume though that during nice weather weekends it will get crowded.

We came here on a mixed weather day, bit of sun, bit of clouds, here and there a drop. So the beaches we visited, were all quiet and secluded. Like most, basically your only option is to go by car.
Praia Sao Rafael is a small beach, with small parking and can be reached as most via stairs.
There is one restaurant located at the staircase, which is open already from April.

As with most others, you can also decide to take a walk about and follow some of the paths. There are some stunning views of eroded cliffs.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"When you come down to the beach, you only see half of it. You have to go past a big rock (between the waves and the rock.. easier when the tide is low) to go to the far (Western) end and see cave formations there. Beautiful.",Apr 2015
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,3.0,"Nice beach, not that big, but with a very pretty scenery.
It is indeed crowded and a lot of (young) kids are there, which can be quite anoying, because parents don't find it necessary to control their kids. Most of the visitors are Portuguese. Take a sun umbrella with you because there are hardly spots with shade.
There is 1 restaurant right on the beach, didn't try it.
There is a parking lot in front and the parking is for free.
Unfortunately there are no bus stops nearby. This is an overall problem in Albufeira, buses are super expensive, unreliable and they don't stop at beaches. So you always need a car. But the beach with the big rocks looked very nice, and when we were there it was clean.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"There are a number of rocky beaches spread along the Algarve but this must be one of the best. It is situated close to the west of Albufeira, about 15 minutes drive from the town centre. Apart from the wide stretch of soft sand and the rolling surf, there are the amazing sandstone rocks and cliffs carved out by the wind and sea to form spectacular shapes. Very peaceful when we went (in early March) and although the car park is large, parking might be a struggle at peak times so get there early. There is an attractive restaurant which was closed when we were there, but other reviewers have praised the food and service. The restaurant is due to open late March/early April",Mar 2015

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,Sao Rafael is a hidden beach behind cliffs/rocks that is a must visit. The lounge chairs are 10Euros and comes with two chairs and a sun umbrella. Very worth it since the sun is super hot. The sand is soft and hot to the touch of your feet. Spend the morning tanning and then grab lunch at the snack bar. Be sure to try the clams bulhao style and the deep fried octopus. Simply delicious. By far my fav beach in the Albufeira area.,Sep 2014

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"Tucked away in a little cove just to the west of Albufeira Marina, Sao Rafael beach is a little gem surrounded by rocks. Those rocks (cliffs) were very welcome when we wanted a little shade out of the Portuguese sun. We were told about Sao Rafael by a restaurant, it seems to be a well kept secret of the locals. We walked to Albufeira Marina and took in some refreshments and then sought out a taxi to the beach as it is over a hill top. We arranged for the taxi driver to come back for us at an agreed time and he did much to my surprise. We then visited 3 more times before we came home so I guess it became a bit of a family favourite.",Sep 2014

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,The beach had both chairs to hire or places to sit free of charge. Either way the scenery is breath taking. There were lots of people in swimming but the water seemed to drop down quite quickly and as I am not a strong swimmer I decided to give it a miss,Oct 2014
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"The beach is great. Be aware of the waves, sometimes out of nowhere a big wave hits the beach. If you know that and look out for it it's great fun, but could be dangerous for small kids, watch them.

Did have diner in the beach restaurant. Diner was nice. They guy of the restaurant did keep the restaurant open longer for my girlfriend and me, very nice. Diner and cocktails were great.

But WARNING, I paid in cash and directly walked to the bathroom after that. When I came back the guy from the restaurant said I paid not enough. He must have switched my 50 euro bill for a 20 euro bill. At the moment I was dazzled and didn't want an argument. Later on I realized I was fooled for sure. So count your money well and count it with the guy watching you. Leave no room for mistakes.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"This is a lovely beach a few km from Albufeira. The main beach has a restaurant and there are changing and toilet facilities also. This part is often quite busy but a relaxed atmosphere compared to fishermans or the other main resort beaches.

The water is nice and clear although be careful of the sharp rocks which are dotted about closer to the edges and cliffsides.

There are also a couple of smaller beaches to the right as you look out to sea, which are only reachable by climbing or wading around the rocks. If you take care and be wary of the tide, it is well worth a look, especially the smallest and furthest little cove, which if you get their first (or are bravest) you will have to yourself. The cliff paths from above will reveal these also and provide a great view.

To walk it is maybe an hour from Albufeira, past the marina and left up the hill. Taxi takes minutes and only a few euros.

The road is sometimes a bit narrow and step, but take it easy you will make it for sure. At the parking lot is a shop and toilets, check your provision and go. The hike to the Pico Ruivo is amazing. The path is accessible but sometimes very steep-the view is Worth all efforts. You will pass a few tunnels, some are longer and you will need the light from your smartphone or a torch. For the whole hike we needed about 5 hours with stoppage at the top and taking plenty of photos. As mentioned there is a good path all the time but do not underestimate the physical challenge of this hike as it is very steep- we tracked an equivalent of 300 levels at the end of the day.
Highly recommend this hike if you are at Madeira- one of the best we‘ve ever did.

We found this arrangement fit us the most as we did not want to join any guided tour. We wanted to hike at our own pace and we had rented a car and did not want to waste the money of not using the car on the day. We found a couple via TA Forum to share the taxi fee with us. The total taxi fare was EUR 60. So it was EUR15 for each of us. It took us one hour going back to Pico do Arieiro from Achada Teixeria. Relatively economical in this way. The taxi driver was very kind to offer us some banana after the hike. If you want to know the contact of the taxi arrangement, you can message me and I can share with you the travel agent's phone no.

The cafe serves good soup.
Toilets are dirty and charge you 50 cents .

We did another walk by getting a taxi to drop us off at Pico do Arieiro and walked to Pico Ruivo. This is the walk most people do. The views are great. This walk is worth doing but I wouldn’t do again due to the amount of people in big groups.

After Pico Areiro we took the encumaeda pass then took the fork off down to nuns valley. Great views looking back up at the mountains. This is a great walk if you are a walker. We then caught the bus back to Funchal on the road where the path comes out. This is a 5.5 hrs at a good pace with a couple of short stops.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Thursday 24th June and we drove from Caniço to the interior of the Island to visit this amazing place. Our route took us along steep winding roads via Joao Frino, Poiso and finally here.

The flora and fauna along the roadside on the way was an experience in itself. There were a wide variety of all types colourful plants and blooms lining the roadside, beautiful.

On the way we did encounter large patches of low cloud, it resembled a rolling mist with poor visibility. At on stage we thought there is no point continuing with our journey.

Thankfully we persevered and were rewarded with the most incredible scenery when we arrived here as we were actually above the cloud.

Pico do Arieiro, is Madeira's third highest peak at 1,818 metres above sea level.

There are a number of hiking routes around here for seasoned walkers.

At the base of the steps, which go to the peak, there is a stone marker which informs visitors that at that point they are 1,810 metres above sea level. So need to climb the  steps to the concrete marker to reach the summit, standing on top of the marker is a popular photo opportunity.

Also located here is a radar installation, a large ball like structure, think it has Naval connections.

There is a cafe and a souvenir shop.

There are toilets here for which there is a charge of €0.50.

It is very popular here and parking can be a bit of a nightmare, so be prepared to park down the road a bit and walk up to the peak.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We went on a cloudy day and had really low expectations... until we kept driving up the mountain and eventually left the clouds behind! What an incredible feeling to be above the clouds - it feels like you are in the heavens with Zeus on Mount Olympus. This place is just incredibly beautiful, with plunging cliffs and lush rainforests below. The drive up here can be quite scary if you're not accustomed to winding mountain roads, but it is well-paved and a very safe road. Highly recommend!",May 2021

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"I've hiked all over the world, and this is truly magnificent and stunning. Above the clouds, walking along ridges (not for too long.. just breath through it! its worth it on the other side) I'm not great with heights, so there were times I had to push myself - only 3 / 4 times... but each time I was really glad I did. And also sometimes going back the other way wasn't as bad as the first time. Overall you'll feel so pleasure with yourself for pushing you self through, if you are a little nervous. I had a stick with me, more for the step down, rather than up - just to protect my knees because there is a lot of steps! At times it felt very LOTR! Great caves you have to go through en route. Fantastic experience. Stunning Views.

Alternatively take a windproof jacket (it gets windy) and walk as far as you fancy along the trail to Pico Ruivo.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,4.0,"This review is meant as a help to people who are considering the walk between Pico de Arieiro and Pico Ruivo, and might have questions, before going.

First You should know that I'm 53 years old and fit. So now You have a reference and can take that into consideration whether You are 25 and fit or 65 and unfit.

In most info about this walk that I have seen, it says ""Difficult"" and 3:30 - 4 hours.
I would say ""Moderate"" and I did it in 1:45, but I like to walk fast and challenge myself.

Unless You have heart or knee issues I would say anyone can do it. Just adapt to tempo to your liking.

How to get here?

If You go by car, then You need to do a return walk, to get back to your car, that I think most people would find extreme. If You have someone how can drive the car for You, and wait for You at the destination, reading a good book, it could be an option.

Take a taxi or even Uber is expensive unless You are 4. Then the cheapest option would be to take bus 20, 21 or 22 to Monte (1,90€) and take the taxi from there (around 60 € one way would be my guess).

Public transport is not an option unless You add a considerable distance and time.

I found the best option to be to book ""a guided"" walk. Not because You need a guide, but because it's a comfortable and cheap way. For 30 € I was picked up at the hotel at 9 o'clock and returned 8 hours later. What's not to like?

You don't need a guide. I would say it is almost impossible to get lost unless You leave the trail on your own adventure... There is plenty of people doing the walk so You often meet others. The path is clearly marked and signs with the number of the path apear whenever the path divides, which is very few places. I told my guide that I would wait for her at Pico Ruivo, where she appeared 1:30 later...

Food / drink?

I found a big 1 1/2 l water bottle to be sufficient (I carried 2 which was an overkill). A sandwich and some snacks / chocolate is fine. This is one of the most tourist friendly walks You can do, as You can come pretty much unprepared regarding food/drinks as You can buy it in the store at Pico do Arieiro and also have the option to something to eat and drink at Pico Ruivo.

Footwear?

I used tracking sandals but even running shoes will do the job. I would for sure not bring the big hiking boots as this will be a lot of extra weight to carry up all those stairs...

What to wear?

Normally in the ""Standard Atmosphere"" a rule of thumb is that the temperature decreases 2 degrees for every 300 m (1000 feet), so with 23 degrees in Funchal I expected around 11 degrees at the peak, but it was luckily somehow warmer, around 16 degrees I would guess.
I used loose long comfortable outdoor trousers, and I would recommend that as weather can change and it can suddenly get windy or You might run into a shower, but shorts would do the job if You are lucky with the weather and bu the walk in the sumer.
My shot sleved shirt was a bit on the cold side standing still, but fine when I started walking.

A wind and rain prof thin jacket is a must. Don't fool yourself looking at the sunny blue sky in Funchal and think ""no, weather's fine"". Weather can change rapidly.

Cap / sun lotion if You are lucky with the weather.

There are a handful of tunnels but only one where headlamp or torch was required as there was water puddles. Most tunnels You can use the torch in your phone or the ""LED torch"" that is handed to You by the guide (I found it pretty much useless).

From Pico do Ruivo we proceeded to Achada do Teixeira, where the bus waited. That walk only took aprox. half an hour, but I found it a bit boring (downhill).

Unfortunately weather was grey and overcast, perfect for walking but not ideal for the good photos , but why I only rate the experience 4 *. I would like to return in the spring for a hopefully better experience regarding the photos...

As I said in the beginning, unless You have heart or knee issues don't miss out on this nice walk - good luck!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,Stunning views and a precipitous walk which can take you all the way to Pico Ruivo. Watch the local Madeira forecast like a hawk. You want to go up there when there are clear skies and not much wind. You will not enjoy the trail if you are terrified of heights but the path is well constructed and the rewards of the stunning scenery is worth it. Lotsnof people go for sunrise which does look nice but the vallies are still in shadow. An hour after sunrise and before the tourist buses arrive gives great photographic light.,Sep 2020
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,This is a must. Even if you just visit the summit for a look around. If you want to do the hike to Pico Ruvio you are in for a real treat. It is absolutly stunning and the views are both scary and wonderous. Sheer drops make this more exciting than any roller coaster on earth! I stuggle with heights but managed to get through the walk.,Sep 2020
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"I got there with a small rented Peugeot 108 (cat. A) from Machico, and the road was totally manageable if you are a bit used to drive in non-European countries. The view is stunning and is definitely a must see in Madeira. You can find two spots to take pictures, one next to the parking and the cafeteria, and another one next to a roundabout which is worth to see.
Small advice : check the weather before getting there as the perfect view is kinda sunny but cloudy. You can check the weather with a cam from the madeira islands website (a quick search on google would help you).",Sep 2020
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Nice people. Tony picked us up from the hotel doorsteps and returned us there. Dorinne is a very skilled leader. She explained every secret of the trail and provided useful infos on flora and fauna of the central mountain range.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"This was the most difficult levada(trail) I’ve ever had. Levada goes from Pico do Arieiro to Puco Ruivo. And lots of people have 1 way trip, because at the end there is a possibility to take a bus in Santana city. Even somebody come from Santana to see Puco Ruivo. During whole trail you will see breathtaking views of mounts and mother nature. You will go up and down almost for whole you trip. My phone counted 278 floors and 12.6km(according to official data trail has 7km in one way).
So, if you’d like to really challenge yourself take this levada from Pico do Arieiro to Pico Ruivo and all way back. The main thing is to take enough water and some food. At the end near Pico Ruivo there is a toilet and some bar, also possibility to fill up your water tank. Not less important is to pick right weather. Sunny day will improve your expectation, view and pleasure.
Definitely recommend, but please consider your strength before choosing it. As this is extremely hard.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"The PR1 Vereda do Arieiro Hike starts at the top of the Pico Arieiro and 6.2 km and 3 hours later you arrive at the top of the Pico Ruivo. The highest peek of the Madeira Island. It is a moderate hike which consists of 3 parts.
The first part you walk in the wind at height in the clouds (wear warm clothes in layers).
The second part is mostly flat and here are the tunnels (bring a flashlight, water is present in some tunnels).
The last part of the hike starts with the stairs and you climb to the top of the Pico Ruivo. (lose some of your layers). 500m before the top there is a small cafe (bring your own food).
The hike is a one way hike. It is very easy to do yourself. You can hike to Achada do Teixeira 2.8km from Pico Ruivo, but this is an hour from Pico do Arieiro and there is no public transport. Retrieving 6.2 km (total hike 12,4km) is really not a punishment.

The cable car ride itself was a long, smooth adventure with stunning views all around you plus you could spend the whole day in the palace gardens when you get up there, loads to see and do, there’s an African art museum to wander around plus a fascinating collection of minerals and crystals in another museum, ferns the size of trees, Japanese style bridges, gorgeous well kept flowers, shrubs and trees everywhere, we loved it not to mention the climate being so lovely and cool on such a hot day, make a day of it and you’ll find it money well spent, great scenic photos too.

There's a small cafe & toilets. You have to purchase something & then ask for the keys to the toilet. They were clean but sadly with no tap water or soap! In times of covid19, I was surprised about this.

The drive up was along the roads set by the SatNav and so missed the off roading on our previous visit with Hit the Road tours. However I am sure my wife, who is not so adventurous, appreciated the more sedate journey.
Unfortunately we did not set out as early as we had hoped due to having to collect the car that morning and so the car park was pretty full, but we each still managed to find a quiet spot to have a coffee and Pastel de Nata sat in glorious sunshine, looking down on the clouds.

Advantage being collection from hotel to start of walk and return on completion. Our group consisted of 14 people of mixed ages and ability. My wife decided that she wouldn't complete the walk after about 30 minutes due to a bad cold - after discussion with our guide she returned to the start and was transported to Teixeira and met me at Pico Ruivo (no charge) The walk had some stunning views and our guide Emilka was excellent, we started with jackets an ended in t-shirts The walk was fairly straightforward if you're reasonably fit but the 440 steep steps in the middle were a challenge for both lungs and legs. The pace was steady and allowed for slower members of the group, we all got along well and had great fun. My legs were still aching two days later! A memorable experience:-)

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"This hike is exceptional and a must do. It’s worth a special trip to Madeira for this hike alone. I’ve hiked in Switzerland, Peru, Patagonia and Oregon and I think this is a special, scenic and memorable hike. A few key points:

- You can start at Pico Arieiro or Pico Ruivo and do the hike. It’s about 2 hours each way so 4-4.5 hours total. There are other trails that branch off so you could add distance/time if you really want more.

- If you start at Ruivo, it will add about an hour (2.3 km each way) because you will need to park in Achada do Texeira and hike up to Ruivo to begin the hike. If you start at Ariero, you can park at the peak and hike right away.

- I drove, which at times was a bit stressful, but you’ll be fine if you have driven stick on very steep hills before. If not, this is not the place to learn. There are also organized tours so it’s still doable if you don’t have a car.

- I wore a t-shirt and shorts in February and got sunburned. Others were wearing pants, sweaters and I even saw one gentleman in a sports coat with a dress shirt. So, wear what makes you happy and don’t stress.

- The hike is challenging. It wasn’t crazy hard, but this is not a gentle hike either. I would not recommend it to my mom. I thought it was perfect. My girlfriend thought it was slightly dangerous at times. But the trail is in great shape with safety cables.

- There is a snack bar at Ruivo and Ariero so you don’t need to pack much. Maybe just water and a few snacks.

- You can’t easily do this one way, so plan for round trip.

- It took about 45 minutes to drive from Funchal to the Ariero trailhead.

- We also did the hike 25 Fontes. It was nice, but not in the same league. Do Ariero to Ruivo.

Hmmm...what else? Enjoy Madeira. It’s a magical place and just 1:40 flight from Lisbon. The Portuguese are just so wonderful and the food is fantastic. Limpets, fish, banana, wine, steak skewers.

Have fun!!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"This trek was the highlight of our trip. Hard work but an incredible adventure! We parked at Pico do Arieiro (free parking) and caught the amazing sunrise just before 8am. At this time nothing was open at Pico do Arieiro. Then about 8.15, we began the trek to Ruivo. At first there are lots of downhill steps, then the track levels out as you start going through the tunnels. About 2 hours in there are some steep steps which is the most strenuous part of the trek. We reached the 'cafe' at Ruivo at about 3 hours - it's very basic with just a few drinks and a toilet which you need at 50c coin for. Then there is a 500m uphill steps to reach the peak. This feels quite long but the views are incredible once you reach the top! Once we ate our packed lunch, we headed back about 12pm and got back to the car about 3.30pm (stopping for lots of photos on route as the light is much better on the return). Make sure you take your own food and water as there is no where on route! It was cold in the morning but warmed up once the sun was out. I only wore gym leggings and a t-shirt for most of the trek.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Get there early to avoid bus loads of tourists. You can walk miles from here, across the tops of the mountains... amazing experience, especially for our 11 and 13 year old boys. The weather changes quickly but on a clear day you can see for miles.

Well worth the visit.,Jan 2020

You can go part of the way to the Pico do Ruivo and return back. We did so. The trail was all in fog, only a small section of the path was visible. Perhaps, in clear weather, the view from here is even more impressive. The route is not easy...",Aug 2019
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We identified a walk for about 7km.
As a novice walker it was very hard. But totally worth the challenge.
It requires some degree of fitness as the stairs and climbs seem endless, it took all the energy out of me.

Now the good bit;
It is the most beautiful walk I have ever undertaken and will be in my memory forever.

There is a great cafeteria and gift shop and a toilet on pico ruivo...

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"It was strenuous but me and my girlfriend loved it. Must go if you are in Madeira and are into some hiking! Bring good shoes and warm clothes. It can also get hot in lower parts of the trail that are exposed to sun especially if there's no wind. Also take a hat for cover or put on some sunscreen lotion. I didn't and my face is red now. :D Start the walk at dawn if you can to avoid traffic at the trail. And bring water too.

My gf is also quite scared of heights but she thought the safety measures were OK and felt that route was quite safe.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Probably the most magnificent hiking trail besides the levada tours in Madeira. The starting point is at Pico do Arieiro (1818 m), which could not be reached by public transport, only by car. But if you drive there you have to do a circle tour coming back on the same path to reach your vehicle. It is a long and exhausting walk, so we choose an organized tour with a guide. The guide is not necessary, but we got a ride to the starting point, made the tour in one way (about 7 km) to the highest point on the island Pico do Ruivo (1862 m) and after a 2.5 km walking we reached the parking lot where the van was waiting for us. The weather could be challenging on these heights, but we had a beautiful sunny day even in late November. The trail itself is not easy, with a lot of steps and climbings, but it's worth every drop of sweat. The views are spectacular, you often walk above the clouds and through the most beautiful nature of the island. Don't miss this adventure.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Did this hike (to/from Pico Ruivo) yesterday. It’s unbelievably gorgeous; stunning views around every corner. You don’t need a guide. It’s not that hard to drive to (40 min from Funchal), though steep, and very well marked. There are a ton of stairs, of course: it’s definitely a workout at a number of points. And there are a few slightly scary moments on ledges and staircases. But it’s so, so worth it for the stupendous views, throughout the hike but esp at the top of Pico Ruivo if the sun is shining. Best hike we did here.",Nov 2019
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,4.0,"The peak is accessible by car, and the view is fantastic; it is definetely one of the highlights of the island.

It's just a short walk up from the car park to the actual peak for stunning views all around - to the coast, to the highest peak (which can be reached by footpath - but it takes about 5 hours apparently) and into the stunning scenery of the valleys. There's even a cafe and sovenir shops (and toilets). The cup of hot chocolate was very welcome as it was only 12 C - but it was late Navember!

When we were coming up the forest the trees were lush and green! The temperature started to drop then. It is great being in the clouds and it was certainly different to other places in Madeira! At the top there is a look out point with a cafe and souvenir shop. There’s a toilet you pay for and car parking. Unfortunately the clouds for us didn’t quite shift but it was still super. The temperature went to 4 degrees!!! It was cold and rainy so take a jacket!

Used to British weather so met with expectations!
Many would have aborted any attempt...but persevered!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,3.0,"I was interested to see this place and our tour of the East of the island took us right there. It's a bone-shaking ride up miles of narrow roads and when you get there, you find half of Funchal has parked its cars on every square inch of space to the extent that some of the bigger buses have trouble picking their way through.

So, you finally get there and stumble, broken, from your tour minibus and admire the Pico do Arieiro; fair enough, it's an impressive sight against the blue sky but kind of shoved rudely into second place by the military radome installation. There are queues of people everywhere walking up to the summit (only a few metres walk, don't even think about it if you're less than able on rough tracks or need a stick).

The views are, though, quite spectacular; you can see for miles as Roger Daltrey once sang. Bare rock up high, but dense vegetation at lower levels and walking trails everywhere. The cafe is OK, there's the usual tacky souvenir shops, the loos are good (but you'll need 50 cents to find out!).

For me, to be truthful, the best part of the ride up to Pico do Arieiro was driving through the heavily protected and entirely natural forest at the beginning of the climb. The sunlight dappling through the trees was delightful and - given the choice - I would have happily stayed there and tried to get some decent arty-crafty photos.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,4.0,"Great views if you beat the clouds (although the radardome blocks off 90 deg of view). Parking is limited if you don’t get there early, and we found the park rangers to be keen on checking cars parked blocking the road.

We only went 100m along the trail but it looks like excellent views if you do it.

Let down however by the toilets (dirty and you paid for it) and the cafe which is basic and, unlike everywhere else on Madeira, not particularly friendly.

If you do not want to do long hike you can just go to the nearest viewpoint on the way to Pico Ruivo.

If you decide to do the whole walk to Pico Ruivo, that will take probably 6-7 hours and it is quite hard with lot of steps.

Dramatic scenery above the clouds with deep valleys adding to the spectacle.

Weather plays and important element to this trip and when I visited it was windy. Always best to wear outdoor clothing here getting a weather report previously.

Facilities wise there are the usual café and gift shop with toilets, .50¢.

We proceeded to do the hike to Pico Ruivo which is grueling - I would definitely say difficult hike. You need good hiking boots, lots of water and snacks.

It is important to carry 50 cents for the toilet in both pico's and your own water and snacks (Pico Ruivo's cafeteria was running out of water and snack selection was very limited because they have to carry all items to the cafeteria).

Nice cafe and gift shop.",Sep 2019
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"While this is not the highest peak I've been to, the vista makes you feel like you're at the edge of the world--and I didn't even take the trail!

You can drive almost all the way to the top, where you'll find a free parking lot, washrooms (pay), a gift shop, and a comfortable albeit somewhat noisy cafe.

We went twice in the same week in early June 2019, first time in the afternoon and it was calm and clear, the second time in mid-morning to allow time to hike but it was cloudy and so windy we felt like we'd be swept right off the mountain, had to turn back after 15 minutes.

Note that even guided tours may cancel the hike at the last minute due to weather, but they will take you on an alternative hike, so you really can't go wrong. Levada hikes are all worth the time and effort. Madeira is small and it's easy to go back to Pico Areiro another day when weather does cooperate.

We have arrived at around 9am, and the car park was already half full. Going to the top we followed Google maps, and it took as on a ‘good’ road (leaving junction 12 of the motorway and driving near Monte Palace gardens, then following signs). Coming back, we decided to take another route that our GPS was suggesting. It was more interesting with better views on a way, but felt very dangerous. Also, check the weather before going there, you might need a jumper…",Aug 2019

The blue flowers where beautifull. I also loved the small ridges which you had to walk over and the natural formed walls that you see when you stop looking at your feet once in a while :).

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"On our Santana tour of our last day on Madeira, we were treated to this incredible place, 1810 metres above sea level.

What made it incredible was not the place per se, but how we approached it. After stopping at Ribiero Frio, we were in clouds and mist and our driver was having to proceed very slowly and with the utmost attention to the road. At around 1750 metres above sea level the clouds parted and we were rewarded with the most spectacular views. I shall let my pictures say the rest.

I will review the tour separately since they (Windsor) deserve their own credit.

The tour also included a lavada walk and a stop in Santo da Serra on the way back to our hotel. The views from the mountain (which is some 6,000 feet) are, truly, breathtaking. We were lucky in that it was a clear and sunny day; we could see some peaks adjacent which were above the clouds.

Once you've parked up the walk to the best views is short and easy. We took some photos, but they don't do the views justice. If we found ourselves in Madeira again, we would definitely revisit. There's a shop, cafe and toilets.

There is a path to Pico do Ruvio described as challenging, but it wasn’t too challenging from the top of Pico do Areiro.

Make sure to have a hat, wear suncream, and take lots of water and snacks for energy. Well-fitting walking boots are also a must. On arrival at the base of the peak there are toilet facilities (€0.50) and a small place selling drinks (hours unreliable). Don’t hang around though as you’ve got to walk all the way back again!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"This is one of the top things on Madeira. The walk from Pico do Arieiro to Pico do Ruivo offers amazing views and landscapes on the way. Generally it is advised that this walk takes 3,5 hours each way. There are no scheduled transfers between the two peaks but if you park your car in one of the car parks and if you are a good hiker, you can manage to walk from Pico do Arieiro to Pico do Ruivo and back again in 5 hours total. However, there are many steps and ups and downs on the way so it depends on your level of fitness if this is doable or not. Also this route is hard on the knees.

It is a bit confusing finding the Pico do Ruivo peak. When you are coming from Pico do Arieiro, or the car park in Achada do Teixeira, there is no sign indicating exactly where the Pico do Ruivo peak is but when you get to the signpost and the map then take a left and head up to the house. Once you get up to the house take the path on the left of the toilets.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,4.0,This was one of the stop offs on the Eastern tour of the island. Take the path going away from the cafe from the roundabout for some extra views to the east but the stunning mountains and valleys can be best seen from the viewpoint just up from the souvenir shops. Make sure your camera batteries are charged in your camera. Watch the prices in the shop/s they are certainly not cheap.,Jan 2019

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,4.0,The views are amazing. Our first visit was to see the clouds climbing up the mountains and we weren't disappointed. Our second visit gave us a completely different view as there were no clouds and we could see right back to the coast. Our only complaint is that the cafe closes at 6 p.m. so if you want to wait for the sunset (as we did) there is nowhere to get a cup of tea (or get warm) while you're waiting.,Mar 2019

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We like to do a round trip by car, needs a good clear day don't bother otherwise.
Start by driving up towards Curral das Freiras (Nun's Valley) and stop at the viewpoint at Eira do Serrado. Then turn back and turn left up the new tourist road which branches off just before the tunnel down to the Curral. This spectacular road takes you up through some remote scenery to join the Poiso to Pico d'Areiro road. There is another excellent viewpoint you can walk to on the way and a number of other pull offs for viewing. Once up at the Pico you can take in the amazing volcanic mountain scenery. There is a nice cafe with a a terrace for a lunch or coffee.
To return there are various choices, but the road which takes you down past terrier da Luta and Monte is interesting.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We took part in a guided walk from Pico de Arieiro to Pico Riuva and then on to Achada do Teixeira. As someone who can experience vertigo, I approached this with some trepidation. However, the authorities in Madeira have done a superb job of establishing and maintaining some superb paths, and with either foliage, rocks or fencing in the way, I found that I was able to overcome my fear of falling and simply enjoy the walk. It goes above the clouds and gives views out over Nun's valley and the Atlantic as you go along. Undeniably, it is fairly tough going and appropriate footwear is needed. Also, I would recommend going on a guided tour as (like us) you can then be driven to a starting point and collected from a different end-point, rather than having to retrace your steps. Also, as the roads in Madeira are quite unlike anything we have in the UK, driving on them is pretty challenging in its own right. This was a fantastic day out - one of the best walks I have ever done.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Get a good day and the views are breathtaking. Although thought to be the highest viewpoint in Madeira, this is not so. However it is much easier to access and the scenery here is much more dramatic. Get a bad day with the cloud down, and the best thing is the Poncha drink in the cafe. Also, take care if visiting in the winter as it can be icy and the road is treacherous. Don't come to Madeira and miss this trip.",Jan 2019
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"What a beautiful view! One of the most amazing things I’ve seen in my life! Just above the clouds at 1810 meters high.

Tips:
- The air is a bit thin, so be careful not to exert yourself too much. Everything is a bit tougher.
- Walk a bit of the walkway towards the rocks on the left side for some more beautiful views
- You can park in front so it’s accessibel for families and ederly as well.
- There is a souvenir shop and restaurant on site
- Driving to get there means going on very small steep mountain roads. Not so much fun if you’re afraid of heights. It was a challenge with our 1.0 liter engine but we got there OK.
- Be sure to use sunscreen, the UV factor is very high up on the mountain.

It is accessible by transport of all sorts, and there is a paved walk for all ages, although after 30 years of visits, my knees aren’t what they were! We have to leave the lovely walk from here to Pico Ruivo to the youngsters,",Feb 2019
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"You can get to the Pico Arieiro with normal car however roads are pretty steep, curly and narrow. Pretty often you can experience fog or clouds so drive carefully. Most used access road is from Funchal via Monte 21 km, .ca. 30-40 minutes. Other option is directly from Nuns Valley, 15 km, .ca. 20 - 30 minutes. There is very nice view point Paredao on this road.This road from Nuns Valley is open only during the day. In winter from 9.30 till 17.30. In summer from 9.30 till 19.00. At Pico Arieiro if you cannot make full treck to Pico Ruvio I would suggest to do at least first 1 km to the view point Pedra Rija.Last few hundred meters before Pedra Rija are pretty spectacular. This round trip should take you around 60 -70 minutes. With few pretty steep steps section and height exposition. At the parking there is restaurant, shops and WC, parking is free and usually pretty full. If this review helped you, pls like :) . I just want to check if this kind of reviews works.

Join one of the groups where you get a guide (you'll hear about the mountains, wildlife, island etc) and you get taken to Pico do Areiro to start the walk and finish on Pico Ruivo where you get picked up.

No its not. We walked from Pico do Arieiro to Pico Ruivo and back. The first walk is less difficult than walking back. I would not recommend this to families with kids under the age of 8. We started with a lot of people but in the end, we nearly walked alone because a lot of people give up on the halfway. The View you have from the Pico Ruivo is stunning. The Restaurant on top was closed that day we walked up there, luckily we had some food in our backpacks. Walking back was hard for me going up all the stairs but with a few breaks you will do it!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Four of us shared a taxi from Funchal to Pico do Arieiro and we arranged for the driver to pick us up at Achada do Teixeira. It's just as well, there are no buses or taxis waiting at the other end. We met 3 people who found this out to their cost. It took us 6 hours to do the walk; we like to soak up the atmosphere, have lunch, take photos etc. But it's another 3 hours walk to Santana so make sure you have transport booked or face another long walk.
We had breathtaking views on good signposted paths which included steep steps, tunnels and paths clinging to the edges. It's challenging and you need a good level of fitness, hiking boots, warm clothing, food and water. It's not for those who dislike heights but for those who do it's well worth the effort. The whole cost of the taxi was 120 euros, so 30 each. You could hire a car and walk from Pico do Arieriro to Pico Ruivo but then you have to retrace your steps to get back to the car.. In November it gets dark earlier so you'd need to start earlier :-)

Choose a sunny day even though you may still be caught out by the sneaky clouds. If heading for the heights take a coat as it can get quite chilly. Magnificent views. We travelled with True Spirit Jeep tours. Great experience.",Nov 2018
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"For me this is one of the most beautiful places in Madeira. It's easily accessible by car and can be the starting point of one of the best walking paths of the island. The views are incredible and may inspire that photographic creative feeling that most of us know. Throughout the year you may experience this place in many different ways, as the temperature and light will dramatically change (from the freezing snow of the winter to the burning sun of the summer). I would recommend that you safely explore the surroundings (make sure you dress appropriately for the season, including the shoes). There are some good areas for a photo shoot, to read a book, to meditate or simply to sit down and contemplate the landscape. Just make the most out of it.

Fabulous experience.",Oct 2018
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Ok so the tour guide screwed the booking and so I never did the Pico walk. It’s a rocky walk and scramble between two high mountain peaks. Long story. But a lesson - if you book a walk with ANYONE they will be more interested in getting you to attend a time share yawn meeting then the walk.

The idiot I was booking the Pico walk with managed to book me on a Levada walk instead ... and I only found out on the minibus !!

Make sure you check what they hv booked you on ! Honestly the best person was Marion at the Pestana Grand hotel - very honest and helpful.

Back to Pico do Arieiro.. you can drive or get taxi or tour trip to the top and take a look without climbing an inch .

But it’s weather dependent - spoke to a couple who drove up in hire car last week (late Oct) and it was so foggy they cd not see anything and so windy it was like below zero with the windchill, and they only spent 90 seconds out if the car.

The walks are only for experienced hikers who are ok with heights and some exposure - and yes you need decent shoes (trainers ok) and warm clothes as it San be very cold.

But it’s a must do if you can cope with the height & rocky paths .

Go early, avoid the crowds and Cruise Liner junkees and be prepared for a relatively short hike away from the crowds and you will be rewarded with some spectacular views and pictures taking opportunities !

We booked an activity here and had a great guide with us who has been doing this walk all the way to the top for like 10 years and he was very motivating. The walk we joined was around 12km so make sure you eat a good breakfast and get a bag with water cuz you’ll get thirsty, specially if the weather is hot as well. Just before the walk starts there is a place to buy water but the price is a little higher than normal. Make sure you have a camera and a powerbank cuz you’ll take plenty of pictures and it’s good if you wear comfortable shoes and not heavy clothes as well because of it starts raining your clothes will get wet and heavy. Very fun, motivating and amazing walk that really confirms that anything is possible.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"I had completed this hike a number of times in previous years and thought I would try it again before old age prevented me.
I climbed in the company of about 16 others marshalled by a guide.
Since my prior walks the route has been altered by storms making certain paths impossible to navigate. This has led to the construction of metal ladders at key points to enable a couple of ridges to be climbed. They were tough but in the end passable. It is a very tiring hike with a lot of descents followed by ascents until you reach the house below Pico Ruivo, it is then a further 300+ metre zigzag to the summit. We were above the clouds for the majority of the climb which made the whole experience breathtaking in every sense.

A wonderful adventure to be encouraged BUT you must be fit and fairly agile to contemplate tackling it.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Pretty crowded and a lot of steps.
The two tunnels closest to Pico Ruivo are still closed with a detour that has many ladders going first down and then back up.
Views are fantastic.
Mind your step and make all passing or meeting one another safe. There have been some fatal falls on other trecks this summer.

Please take others into consideration when having a need for a loobreak - There are tissues in so many places!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Reviews about the PR1 trail from Pico do Arieiro to Pico Ruivo (and back, ~10 km) differ wildy: some advise you to go by bus/taxi, others by rental car; some say it is very doable without much training, others say it is only for the very fit. Let me share you our experience.

We are two nature lovers that also enjoy hiking, but our physical condition is somewhat... average. Swayed by the amazing images that roam the internet, we decided to give it a shot. We rented a car, and I must emphasise that this was a perfect choice for us. You can experience a lot of extra views while driving through Madeira's beautiful roads (they are not very scary, almost nothing can go wrong if you are careful) and, perhaps more importantly, you are mobile. This allows you to visit all the different trails the island offers easily, and you don't have to depend on the bus schedule. The only reasons I can think of why you should not rent a car, are if you are i) extremely scared by driving, ii) you are walking from town to town across the island, or iii) you are just very aware of your environmental footprint. Either way, we started the trail quite late (~11:00, do not start later!) and set off full of enthusiasm into the first descent (yes, first you go down before going up...), which went without problems. The scenery? Absolutely fantastic! I have rarely seen such rough nature, complemented with the pride of Madeira flowers, other vegetation, low clouds and spectacular views. Just wow. Fear of heights? Then this walk might be troublesome for you (you can try the Ponta de São Lourenço or 25 Fontes trails first to see if you can handle the drops). We continued onwards over hundreds upon hundreds of steps, to Pico Ruivo. We even saw some red partridges on our way! We took a long (1 hour) break at the top to revitalise ourselves before returning the way we had come. In the end, we were utterly exhausted. The steps on the way back to Pico do Arieiro were particularly nasty. We sat down at the small restaurant there, ordered a refreshing Brisa apple and pastel de nata, 7.5 hours after starting. The result? Sore leg muscles for like four days, but some marvellous memories. Definitely worth it! Although we were happy that we saved this trail until the end of our vacation, since we probably couldn't have done another hike immediately after this one.
I hope this will help you decide whether you want to attempt this trail!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,Included as part of the East Island Tour with Happy Tours. It's the 3rd highest one in Madeira and the climb up the winding roads goes on and on until you rise above the clouds. Amazing views on a clear day from 1800 feet up!,Aug 2018
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We hired a car and drove up the winding hillsides to 1818 metres above sea level. Some might find the drive daunting but if you are composed and steady, it’s not too taxing.
It was weird to reach 1500m and see very little through the clouds you end up driving through. It seemed to be more like a foggy Dartmoor than an island off the coast of Portugal! However, once we broke through the cloud base and arrived at the car park, the views were amazing. Neither my wife or I realised what we were in store for- but it truly rivalled some of the views we saw in the Doubtful Sound of New Zealand, albeit on a smaller scale overall. Unlike New Zealand, we could access the mountains and walk the trails. Ours went for 6km which is pretty hard work and time meant I could only venture halfway. But every twist and turn through the mountain trail- aided by guide ropes & viewing platform gave some spectacular breath taking views.
Mystical, magical & mesmerising scenery- and it’s free!!

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,1.0,"We drove to Curral das Freiras today and loved the road and scenery. So many blogs and comments warned us about the scary roads, but it wasnt a problem at all! We highly recommend driving. After a coffee in town, a local advised us to drive up to Poiso via Miradouros do Paredao and Pico do Arieiro. Stunning and very little traffic! Coming from South Africa, we felt right at home in the open spaces! We really loved this drive and hope you can experience it also. We stopped at Miradouros do Paredao and only about 5 other cars there. There is a viewpoint about 2minutes walk from there. What happenend next, we only realised a bit later...our car's signal was jammed when we locked it with the remote and all our cash was stolen out of our wallets...clever, because no one would think of carrying all your belongings with you on such a short route and you think its very safe because there is practically no one. We are very used to crime...but this was clever! I hope they enjoy a good bottle of Madeira with out 200 euro!

Stunning scenery though. We wrote it off to bad luck, but will surely be back...and just make sure the car is locked and keep our valuables with us!

My husband and I drove through the CRAZY uphill narrow roads from Funchal in the dark up to the parking lot of Pico Do Arieiro to try and catch the sunrise. We were the 2nd car in the parking lot! That moment when the sun comes over the clouds is breathtaking- worth every moment of sleeplessness! We then proceeded to hike all the way to Pico do Ruivo... and then BACK to the car. We found very little reviews of people hiking both ways but it CAN BE DONE! It took us about 6 hours- with MANY MANY photos along the way. Starting at dawn meant we missed most of the huge groups of people, and the very hot sunshine mid -day. Bring: lots of water, snacks, jacket, sunglasses, sunscreen and your energy. It's a tough hike both ways- but worth every second. The changes in the mountains with the clouds and the sun make the way home just as interesting as the hike over. We watched the web cam from the top to decide on the best day to do this hike- spending the rest of the week at the different levada hikes. Many of the visitors that joined us for that sunrise also hiked to the peak and back. Amazing time.

There are ramps almost all the way to the very top - the most accessible mountain top we've come across! Give it a go. The views are amazing - looking down on the clouds, the harbour at Funchal looks good from this height too (a bit farther down the road though).

Go on a sunny day or you will be in cloud cuckoo land and see nothing. It's really breathtaking and all free (apart from the coffee that is!). There are a couple of walks from the top to the edges which wheelchair users won't make and if you are tottery on your feet you probably need to avoid,

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"The highest point you can reach by car in Madeira, Pico do Arieiro is a must see. From here you can see the rouged mountain tops of the mountain range that makes up the centre of the island never loosing sight of the beautiful sea that surrounds it.
Also the starting point of a breathtaking foot path that takes to the highest point in the island.",Jan 2018
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,The views were insane and definitely worth the journey up to the top of the mountain.

A couple of places to eat on way up or down.",Aug 2018
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We recently visited Madeira and on our first trip to Pico do Arieiro we were disappointed as the weather suddenly turned bad just as we arrived so we didn't get a chance to see it. Luckily we were able to come back and I am so happy we did. What an extremely wonderful place. It makes you feel so small and unimportant (but in a good way).

The views are stunning and I wish I was in better shape so that I could actually do the walk as I can only imagine how jaw dropping it must be.

My only complaint - which has nothing to do with the place itself - is all the idiots taking selfies and pictures. Dont get me wrong we took selfies and photos of each other too...but we didn't completely block the path for everyone else, nor think that others wanted to watch our 20 minute photoshot (seriously, please have some consideration for others. If you feel the need for that many photos of yourself, at least take a break every now and then so others can enjoy it too)

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"I suppose it depends on getting the right conditions, but for us it was fantastic. We were above the clouds and the views were stunning. There's a walk of 6km along the tops to the highest mountain, which we chose to follow for 20 minutes or so, before turning back. One word of caution - at 6,000 ft you certainly feel that the air is a bit thin on oxygen ! For us it was sunny and warm, but would be cold if covered in cloud.",Jul 2018

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"This is definitely worth going to. There are stunning views.
When you arrive you have really nice views even before you start your hike.
If you want to do a short hike probably 15 to 20 minuites each way you can go to a view point that gives wonderful that make you feel you ate on top of the world.
If you ate fairly fit then you can do the complete hike which is around 3 hours each way. It's definatly worth doing as you will all remember this trip. There are so many breathtaking views so take your camera.
The walk is all steps that go up and down and around. Of your not a big hiker but reasonably fit then give it a go.
I would suggest hiking sticks as it takes so e of the pressure off your legs. Also make sure you have water and ideally hiking boots or at least trainers.
I know there are some companies offering excursions but my family and many others just went by ourselves.
The really excellent thing about this trip apart from excellent vies is its FREE.
If you only do 1 trip make this the one as we all really enjoyed.
Also there is no danger as the steps and paths are well layed with metal wires to aid you and stop you falling.
There is a cafe with good selection of food and drinks at reasonable prices and probably the cafe with o e of the best views ever.
The only problem you may have with this trip apart from feeling achy the next day is parking. There is Limited parking so arrive early if you are the 6 hour walk or arrive after 3pm if you want do the short stroll.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"From Calheta we get to Pico de Ariero by car which we rented for all our stay in Madeira Island.From the parking area just 5m walk and you are on the top of the 1816m high vulcanic pike. But the challenge is starting from this point when you are starting your hiking adventure to the other pike of these mountains called Pico Ruvio. To get there you need at least 3 hours on the 7,5 km path which I would recommend even it is longer, because the shorter path is much harder to do. On this path first you go down on several stairs, really nicely made for tourists in the deep of the valley. The level different is around 600 meters and several times you walk on deep stairs down and up. You need hiking shoos, and proper clothes to perform this route, facing also 2 completely dark tunnels where you need headlamp to have a clear visibility. IF you left your car at Pico do Ariero then you need to do the same path back, so go there at least to 1ö am in the morning to have the needed time to be back from Pico Ruvio in time. Even it is a bit hard to perform this route you will leave with an unforgettable experience which is not reachable anywhere else in the world.

There is path to other views from the car park, unless you are some kind of fitness maniac or a mountain goat you will be exhausted on your way back up to the car park, don't go further than you can cope with! We strongly recommend hiring a car (Express car rentals are best and cheap) over using the coach trips, there is so much more to see if you simply drive around the old roads in the area and north coast - quite magnificent and almost deserted.",Jun 2018
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,4.0,"We went to the Pico do Ariero by Bus (first mistake, because from the bus stop you either hitchhike or walk 2 hours what we did, so go by car!). The view is stunning an really worth it to go! We tried to hike to the Pico Ruivo (7km because only one path is open) but we had to go back before reaching it. The path is really difficult (even for approved swiss hikers) because you climb really steep stairs and its an up and down all the time and really steep up and down. For example: 300 meters down and 600 meters up and so on. There is a lot of sun because its over 1818 meters over sea and not much shade, as well as there are a lot of bees on the way. So if you want to hike the path, make sure you dress properly (hiking boots recommended)

I expected Ponta da Piedade to be something so spectacular because of these reviews but is nothing more than the typical tourist trap. You go down some stairs to take a boat to see the typical rock formations that you can see in any point of Algarve.

It was hard to move around because there was no type of control of people going down. People arrive in boats too, which just adds more traffic and takes away from any good views.

Would recommend going here very early in the morning before boat rides begin or people set about their day. You’ll most likely get the sun shining there and uninterrupted crystal clear waters.

Alternatively, we took a kayak excursion the next day and viewed it from there and was much better (pictured).

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"If passing through the area and certainly if staying in Lagos, Ponta da Piedade is a must-stop if your tastes gravitate to the outdoors and national parks. A winding path takes you along the ridges of the limestone peaks, overlooking the rocks, caves and water. For a photographer, it is extremely photogenic. A path of concrete steps takes you down to the water level, as well, for a more intimate view.

For photographic purposes, go in mid-day when the sun is high and illuminates the cove. Early in the morning and later in the day, expect shadows.

Start off at the bottom end with access to the beach and some stunning caves ,nooks and crannies. Make sure you have suitable footwear, flip flops at the beach may be order of the day . Thereafter follow sat navs to the ponta de piedale. Swap to walking boots or trainers . Park the car at the top and witness the rugged landscape and brooding ocean splash across jagged rock faces.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Our hike from Praia da Luz ended here and it is really wonderful. From the lighthouse, you can see a great view of the cliffs, sea and grotto. The climb down the steps is worth it to see the grotto and cliff nearer and from a different angle. It may not be an easy climb back up the cliff but definitely worth it.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Ponte de Piedade is one of my favourite places. Not only does it have a boardwalk where you can enjoy a brisk walk on top of the cliffs but it offers an unhindered view of the sunset. Here you can get some workout with a brisk hike on the boardwalk, or enjoy the end of the day in silence, or take photos of the sunset moods.

For those who are more adventurous, there are many hiking trails that lead to the different cliffs, but be very careful. These cliffs have been slowly eroding over centuries and there could be instability in some places.

Ponte da Piedad is a magical place.

Was kind of surprised that there are no safety ropes or rails. Some of the more adventurous types were going a little close to the edge or on jutting narrow paths for selfies. To be clear, death would be a real possibility as the frop is easily 50 ft. down to sharp pointed rocks and sea. But, I guess (I hope) this hasn't happened.

Great place to catch the sunset over the Atlantic.

During the high tide only the kayakers can maneuver there! but you can also enjoy the spectacular view. The colour of the water is amazing with its turquoise shades looks fabulously.

Numerous Tourists are killed every year falling off cliffs. There is a beautiful spot where they have made a staircase down to the ocean. there are several landings where you can stop & take a photo. Please take your photo and move along--there are others waiting. If you want a couple or family photo just ask the person behind you. Everyone is friendly and usually willing to take a few photos for you. Then Offer to take a photo for them. It's a great positive international connection. No matter where you stand or sit be considerate of fellow visitors. Now if you tired or hungry or need to use a clean bathroom there is a café there with beer and reasonable food & ice cream prices. Usually, the blackboard with the day's specials is worth a photo too. The owner is a super guy and he will sit with you if he is not busy and answer questions. If you want to visit the beaches below the cliffs you are going to have to drive back into town and pay one of the accommodating fishermen to take you in his boat. Beaches are only accessed by boat.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"The Ponta Da Piedade is the beautiful rock formations on the coast of Lagos. You can access this area by catching the tourist train for €3.50 for an all day ticket and you get off at stop 3 - this location. The views are amazing and this is clearly a natural wonder for Portugal. With bus loads of tourists arriving every day it is a shame that there aren’t regulations to exploring or a few for maintenance. Our main concerns when visiting this beautiful place was, what will be be like in 20years.
The Praia de Camilo beach is a 10min walk away from this location, perfect for a swim after exploring. You can then walk back and catch the tourist train back into town.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,2.0,"As every one has said, the Algarve coastline is very scenic with its deep blue waters and sea carved limestone cave formations and grottos.
How to see the coast? If you wish to take a short boat tour, which is really the only way to access the scenic shoreline, then you need a boat tour. There are many tour operators that you can book in advance. Some seem to be more crammed into larger boats which are not able to go into some of the caves, while some are paddle your own kayak options, but I noted the waves in the more open waters can make it a rough go. If you come unplanned, you can walk down the 200 on so steep steps to where the rock meets water and there is a man under an umbrella who will organize small boat tours on the spot which last about 15 minutes. Cash only at 20 euro a person with a maximum of 5 per boat (per the law).
The warning? Your experience will depend upon your boat driver. They are local and can certainly pilot the boat, but there ability to either communicate with you or their demeanour will be different person to person. We took two boats. One pilot could give the cave names and features in English, but either than that it were bored responses of 'yes, yes'. In fact, he spent a lot of time on his mobile phone. The second pilot was worse as he seemed to be making racist jokes, in his female only boat, and even hit my wife in the back of the head to simulate a boat crash during a tight fit. Yeah you read that right. Disgusting conduct in this modern age.
Overall: It appears that you should not leave your boat tour to chance or to amateurs who lack respect for your experience. Good luck.

We went down the steps near the lighthouse. Where we found a man with a clipboard and he takes down your name and you wait for one of the small boats to pick you up. These are the original fisherman that provide the boat rides and it was truly the BEST! It was our 4 family members (only us!) and he was knowledgeable, thoughtful and it was local! So much fun I highly recommend this as opposed to those big impersonal tours. Also, the larger boats can't take you into the caves.

We had ""Goody Goody"" (his nickname) and he knew all of the cave names and had names for all of the rock formations.

They don't have a website as it is very local, nor a phone number that I know of but if you go to the end of the road and climb down the steps to the left of the lighthouse you will find them!

The highlight is the boat launch area where there are a number of small boats that you can board that will take you on tours of the grottoes and to other coastal spots. Our one regret from Portugal was not taking a kayak tour to the grottoes and along the coast. If you have time you must do it!

Great tour of the cliffs and these guys are the real deal. Long flight of steps down so be careful with small kids or older folk. Beautiful board walk (or cliff edge for those without toddlers as quite treacherous) from Porto mos side to the ponta da piedale. Walk through the cascade wellness resort behind the driving range.,Jul 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Ponta da Piedale is a stunning area of the Algarve, Portugal. My husband and I walked around the area for hours while taking pictures of the amazing cliffs. We also did a boat ride with Blue Fleet. The ride takes an hour and 15 min from the Lagos Marina and it takes you to the wonderful caves of Ponta da Piedale. If you are staying in Lagos, this area is a must do!",Jun 2019

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,"This area is stunning, you already know that no doubt. My review is for the small water taxi service based at the Ponta Da Piedale at the bottom of the steps leading from the Miradouro. Firstly they are half the price (€20), they are on top of the Grotto's so you do not have to put up with the long sea journey from Lagos, you don't have to queue, you don't have to wait, we had the boat to ourselves and obviously the skipper who was a more senior seafaring gentleman. His boat being smaller could get in closer, get under and into some caves easier and he did not stand for any nonsense from any of the younger 'Look how big mine is' boat skippers from the town. The other advantage is, you will no doubt go here anyway as the views are totally different to those from the boat, so you get to do both in one go. Be aware there are also Chameleons in the flora at this location.

Great experience to kayak into the caves, plenty of opportunities to explore.
The tour also provided waterproof camera/ phone covers so you can take them with you which was a great touch.
Also chance to buy beers and drinks on the boat, & time to have a dip in the ocean, or chill on the boat.
Highly recommended!

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,"The walk from Lagos to Ponta da Piedade can take anywhere between 1 and 3 hours, depending on which path you take. You can either walk along the regular road (which does have boardwalks in some stretches but is basically for the cars) or hike/climb across the rocks from beach to beach (which I found very dangerous in some places because there are no delimitations or marked paths).

Once you get there it looks very underwhelming at first sight. A fenced off lighthouse and an unimpressive bar with touristy food. You need to climb down the steep stairs to get to the entrance of the caves (or rather to the spot where you must pay 20€ for a boat to take you there). Going into the water or swimming is strictly forbidden.

I skipped the boat tour and just enjoyed the view by myself. If you manage to ignore the crowds and kayaks and party boats and touts it is actually a very beautiful place.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"I am not sure which company it was but we (four 25y+ women) had an excellent tour with captain Jack in a green boat. We took off in the marina of Lagos and the tour lasted 1:15min for 15€ per person (they often tell you 20€ but will do it for 15€). However as we had so much fun with our guide Jack who was the kindest person we met during our holiday. He told us many stories about the cliffs and we had so much fun as he did some cool tricks with the boat like pretend to collide with the cliffs. He showed us videos of the dolphins and took a lot of photos free of charge with our smartphones so that everyone had a great shot to remember. The were a lot of guys doing the kayak tour but I can imagine we had more fun as he turned up the speed and let us enjoy the waves..

We did this tour with a professional company",Jun 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"I came to Lagos for three reasons: calm vacation, calm beaches and mindful hikes. The view and the hikes at Ponta Da Piedale was all in one. You can walk the paths on top of the caves, go down and relax while you have the most amazing peaceful view. Wear hiking shoes/boots please. You will be going up and down and wearing sandals is not optimal. You can walk from Lagos to this area and if you feel tired after your hike you can take the little local train that works as a city bus. On your way here you will run into three beaches. Feel welcome to stop by. They are gorgeous (take it from a guy who is not a beach person). Lagos in indeed very affordable and not as busy as other beaches in Portugal.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Ponta da Piedale is by far our favorite attraction of the Algarve region. You can have a stunning views from the top by starting at the parking lots of the lighthouse. But it's even better to have a closer view and access to some grottoes on a boat-trip. Ideally you are doing both like we did.
For the boat-trip you can start underneath the lighthouse. As we didn't like to climb down the steep stairs we booked our boattrip starting from Lagos marina and enjoyed the additional view on the beaches on our way to Ponta da Piedale.",May 2019

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,"Just a few kms. from Lagos...to the Point and a Lighthouse. The Lighthouse in disappointing....just a bunker style building where you can park and walk. However, the wooden boardwalks are excellent for folks with mobility issues and allow some nice views and photo/selfie opportunities.
For those seeking more adventure, you can wander off the boardwalks and explore on your own. But beware of the cliff edges as they are unstable with crumbly rock and without any fencing or warning signs.
There are some trails that take you down to more secretive beaches. Be wary in high surf conditions....strong tides and cold water.
If you stick to the boardwalks....and watch your kids closely...they will enjoy the exiting views.
Portugal's exciting history should be displayed here...at least in a pamphlet in several languages.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,Loved the boardwalk along the cliff. Made it very accessible for everyone. A pace for beautiful pictures! There isn’t public transport to get to here. I would suggest you Uber which only costs us 6 euros from Lagos train station.,Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,Coastal view with great scenery but in the Algarve there are plenty of places like this. Access not good for those with mobility problems but very pleasant if the wind isn't too strong.,Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Outstanding, breathtaking scenery. I have been over a dozen times and each time I am overwhelmed with the incredible beauty of the dramatic multicolored cliffs overhanging the clear turquoise sea below.
As if that wasnt enough, Lush green meadows and flowers carpet the tops of the cliffs. One of Lagos' best restaurants(O Camillo) is just a few steps away. Safe and scenic cliffside walking/bike paths lead to the next seaside town of Luz about 7 km away.",Jan 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Well worth a visit if you're in the area and not far from Lagos..
Lovely view from clifftop but there is some steep steps down to the water but the view is worth it !
There is also boat trips available at the bottom.",Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,We walked to this view of the water from our apartment. Awesome views and walking trails. You can walk down to the water using a steep staircase. Down at the water we found someone waiting to sell us a boat trip if we wanted it.,Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"I loved it! seeing the grottos and rock formation from the sea was amazing.
I wish I had spent more time there to really enjoy and take in the scenery",Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"The boardwalk along the cliffs at Piety Point near the Lagos lighthouse is very well constructed, easy walking for everyone. The views of the ocean are extraordinary and the surrounding fields are full of wonderful flowers and songbirds. Loved it on a sunny day as well as on a cloudy, windy day! Spectacular setting, not to be missed!",Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"The trip to Lagos cannot be complete unless you visit Ponta Da Piedale. We decided to walk a little and then take a taxi but unfortunately it was holiday season and we could not find a taxi so we walked all the way to the top which was not easy but not difficult either! Some parts were steep for my bad knees but it was definitely worth all the effort. The views that you get from the top are very different from down and really memorable. We reached there around mid-day and a couple of restaurants which were present were closed. So there is no place is to eat or drink there, so do carry a bottle of water. We visited on 31st December and was pleasant and NOT cold by any chance. Going back was down the slope and easy. The entire route is well sign posted and also the google maps works well. We did not go down the staircase as we were planning to take a boat ride on the next day. During our stay in Lagos, it was very windy and being new year period, all stalls selling tickets for the boat ride were closed. But we decided to take a walk along the Marina on the new years’ day and found one stall open and we quickly bought the tickest. There was another family of 4 who joined my husband and me on the boat ride. The sea was slightly rough but our expert captain navigated the boat skilfully. Ours was the only trip on that day and were indeed very lucky! The boat trip is really worth taking as the views are exhilarating and the ride very exciting. I highly recommend to visit this place by boat as well as from the top.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,I spend some hours in this place just to reflecting about some topics. I think is a perfect place for meditation. I will come back here.,Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,"We sometimes start our treks from Ponta da Piedad (we are a goup of walkers/hikers) and the only regret is that we do so at times when the sun is already high in the (usually deep blue) sky.
That said, more dedication and persistence can be very rewarding: sunrises and sunsets are often spectacular, especially when there is a scattering of 'cottonwool clouds'. Wear sensible shoes, mind: flip-flops can invite grazes and discomfort.",Feb 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"About 30 minute walk from Lagos along a main road but quite pleasant. The views are spectacular and if you can do it on a clear day then all the better. There are toilets, a shop and cafe. A set of steep steps takes you down to see the holes in the rocks. There is also fabulous board walks for more views along the coast and you can eventually walk to Porta de Mos beach which is lovely then walk inland back to the centre of Lagos. A fabulous day out.",Mar 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"ANOTHER AMAZING seaside in the Algarve. Very rugged and scenic, but to really appreciate it, my suggestion is to walk down ALL the steps to the bottom...
We questioned whether we would bother, but well worth it.",Feb 2019

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,Beautiful spot that a walkable distance from the centre of Lagos that gets west facing sunset. The boardwalk looks newly built and makes for a lovely stroll up top.,Feb 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Ponta da Piedade is well worth a visit if you are in the Lagos area of the Algarve. There are meandering pathways all over this rocky promontory and a sturdy cliff top boardwalk which affords far-reaching views along the coastline and out to sea. The rock formations are as fascinating as they are beautiful. If you make your way to the bottom of the stone steps, to the rocks by the water, there are boat trips available to view the caves. You need plenty of energy to climb back up though!",Feb 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Wow, so beautiful and unique. You can climb down the stairs or stay above and they both have spectacular views. There is also a long boardwalk along the top.",Feb 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"We parked at the top of cliff in the car park and wandered along the cliff top and various viewpoints taking loads of photos - then we walked down the stone steps to the small cove and took a boat trip. There were several small boats taking 2-4 people, cost was €20 per person but so worth it to see the sea caves and sea arches from the water. It lasted 30-40 mins and with the blue sky and turquoise water incredibly beautiful. Our boatman told us that this area is packed with numerous boats in summer so visit in low season to get the best experience. At low tide there was quite a wash coming into the cove so we needed to be quite agile to get onto the boat. Check my profile for articles from our trip and our stay at Quinta do Lago Country Club

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,Definately a must-see. Take a 1-hour boat trip at low tide to see this area south-west of Lagos. I highly recommend using the services of Costa D'Oiro. We had the pleasure to have Bruno as our captain/guide. He maneuvred us in to all the caves. Exceptional views!,Feb 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,The entire Algarve region of southern Portugal is worth anyone's time even if you do not walk and hike the trails along the cliffs and rugged coastline. Be sure to also take a boat tour that goes into the many grottos between Lagos and Portimao. In addition to the Lagos area take a day trip north to the rugged side along the Atlantic which is a totally different view and experience.,Sep 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"This is a beautiful area for walking around and taking pictures. Taking a small boat in and out of small areas along the coast was really fun! We did not have to make an arrangement in advance but our host was not sure if there were boats operating that day or not. We were lucky they were! There were not signs, but our host had been there before. We just walked down the stairs and boats would pull up to take small groups of people on a great ride! I think it is best to have cash for this as they seem like independent operators versus a tour company. This is a must do!",May 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"A 30 minute walk from downtown is this beautiful area. The arches, the rugged points are just beautiful. I like that it’s not roped off ( yet) and you can really stand close to the edge for a great view.",Jan 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,3.0,The board walk we needed to walk on seems to be new.Obviously done for safety but it did mean we didn't get quite as close as we wanted to be to really see.we felt that I walk around the Praia da Marinha was alot more enjoyable.Could be great here tho to watch the sunset,Jan 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Of the cliffs and beaches in the Lagos area we went to (Camilo, Dona Ana, Canavial, etc) this was the most scenic of all! If you are exploring any of the coastline area around Lagos this should be #1 on your list. It's very scenic and worth seeing!",Dec 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Ponte Piedade is a must when visiting Lagos. The views are fantastic, it is an easy walk on top of the cliffs.

If you are lucky you will see some small fish.",Jan 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"The most beautiful beach and cliff formations I have ever seen!

This is absolutely the best sight in Algarve! A must!",Dec 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,We took the stairs down to the ocean and found a local fisherman with his boat to take us thru the caves...small boat but easy to get into the tight caves...amazing experience- and our fisherman spoke English and was very funny...good way to view the caves...(also saw Dolphins!!!),Jan 2019
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,Visited Algarve region for the Christmas break. Great place with beautiful beaches and gorgeous rock formations. During december refreshing breezes will keep you cool on the coast. Being a low tourist season you could take advantage of the thinner crowds but most of the activities are closed. Very few tours and restaurants operate during this period. Getting around algarve region with public transportation was challenging and difficult.,Dec 2018

Our guide was fabulous, got us into some tiny spots and did this trick where he revved the engine going back and forth and making the water almost disappear and you dropped about a foot (hard to describe, a bit like when you go through the locks on a canal) was very cool, can't say enough good things about him, was very impressed",Oct 2018

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"This is a once in a lifetime kind of place to visit. Simply stunning rock formations with crashing waves. Just imagine the women coming here to pray for their seafaring spouses seeing this as an example of potential shorelines would cause anyone to pray

After walking along the cliff paths I decided to take the stairs as far down as they went. Very exciting as the previous evening rais made the San covered steps a little slippery

The views from the bottom of the steps were fantastic well worth the effort.

This whole experience was one of the highlights of our trip.

Lots of steps down the cliff to the water where you can jump on a small boat for 20 euros each, 30 minute trip into the caves and caverns. Very picturesque scenery. Well worth a visit. You don't need to book the boats at the bottom of the cliff, just turn up and pay on the boat. Recommended.",Oct 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Definitely worth visiting. Not even worth. It is a MUST: While going down the stairs you see some amazing views, but when you get to the lowest point you simply stay speechless for a while.

The astonishing rock formations, with the gorgeous colour of the ocean will leave you in awe.",Aug 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Sunday 14th October and we visited this most amazing rock formations just along the coast from the Town of Lagos.

There is a small car park nearly there is also parking along the roadside. Maybe it was the time of the year that we visited but the restaurant was closed and there were no stalls around the place.

All that was there was a lighthouse and stunning dramatic scenery and landscape, breathtaking beautiful.

There were a number of walks along the headland so that visitors could enjoy the views and surroundings. For those visitors feeling brave of energetic it was possible to climb down to near the water's edge, this involved a climb down over 200 steps, they also had to be climbed back up.

It was so worth the effort to climb down the steps to get up close to the rocks and the sea. This is a place that has to be seen, words in this review and photograph do not do it justice.

We visited Cape Saint Vincent(reviewd seperately) earlier in the week and thought that was spectacular, here was simply awesome.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,This is an amazing natural phenomenon that is a must see. Best to see the rock formations from the top of the cliffs first. Then see the sea caves and the erosion made rooms at sea level. Either a boat or kayak will work but you better hope for a calm sea if you’re kayaking because you’re in the Atlantic Ocean after all. Don’t forget that you’re not in calmer waters. Absolutely an experience not to be missed though.,Oct 2018

My wife noticed a beautiful rock formation w/ wave crashing in on a post card in a gift shop of all things. So we googled it and were lucky to be in the general area. It was amazing. You can walk down to ocean level (maybe 200 stairs) or enjoy the views from above. Definite must see!!!",Sep 2018

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"We had really wanted to do a boat tour of the grotto but everything was sold out. So we decided to drive to the grotto and see whatever we could from afar. First, bypass the area where the boat tours depart from! Its crazy and traffic is insane. Keep driving directly to Praia da Piedana. The road in is long and appears to be hard to park - KEEP GOING - there is a parking lot at the end of the road. You can walk a block or two away and down a lot of steps to the grotto. There you will find local fishing boats who will take you through the grottos for about 20E per person (4 to boat). It was wonderful!! If you don't want to boat you can jump in the water at the base of the steps. The water is magnificent. Wear sensible shows to walk the steps. Swim suits are recommended.

Enjoy the views.",Aug 2018

Able to walk to the edge (and I mean EDGE) of the cliffs in numerous spots all take photos of the spectacular scenery. But beware its a long way to fall and it would be fatal! On a happy note (!) it is possible to walk down to a grotto but there are a lots of steps and at 30C in the shade we declined the offer! There is an extensive board walk which we did in part - it goes on as far as the eye could see, so quite a commitment, as you have to come back! But overall, a 'must do' attraction.",Sep 2018

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"It's the southwest tip of Portugal. You know you have arrived when you see a lighthouse. You can either walk here from Lagos or drive here - they have a small parking area. The lighthouse is being painted right now, and is not open to visitation. No sweat. For there are numerous pathways along the cliffs, and staircases which take you on cliffs for better views. This area is well worth the hike for a couple hours. You will never see vistas such as these anywhere else in the world! A set us stairs takes you down to a grotto. You may opt take a 30 minutes boat tour of the caves for 15 euros per person if you choose. To get to Ponta de Piedade, it takes 20 minutes of walking from Camilo Beach, or 40 minutes if you start from Old Town.

A group of 9 walked here from the Center of town and it took about an hour just strolling along with a group aged 29 to 64. The directions were well marked on signs and the kids used there phone gps. Looking to the east you can see beaches for miles and to the west beautiful cliffs with some beaches and the grottos directly below. It was a warm day and while waiting for the group the local tourist road train arrived and we all agreed to take this back to town, I don’t remember the exact cost but it was reasonable and enjoyable.

We spent most of the time in the kayaks with a short time to swim at the end.",Jun 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"This is the end point of Lagos. There is free parking here and always a spot at least when we went 3 times simply to look out and get amazing photographs. There are no railings so be very careful and as the ground can be slippery with the dirt. So if you have young children , do not lose site of them. Walk out to the dozens of end points on the cliffs and your heart will stop with the amazing, nature beauty. Try to go early in the morning as the sun rises or around 7 pm when the sun is setting. The views will blow you away. There are a bunch of trails that take you further down but be very careful as if you dont know what you are doing, you can easily slip and kiss yourself goodbye.

Well worth the trip.",May 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"This place is beautiful and offers great views, but if you are going to visit in summer you should probably plan to go there at the end of the afternoon if you are just planning to have a walk around and not chill at the beach. First it will be less scorching and most of the numerous tourist buses will be gone making the area a bit less crowded. If you are wondering wether you should get a boat tour there, you should. The best views are from the sea, and again, going around 5pm might get you a discount on those tours, we paid 10 euros less than during peak time. It is cheaper if you book online!
And finally I would advise all tourists to stick to the path and not go too far out on the the high rocks as people literally die every year taking selfies and slipping on those rocks.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,Best boat trip ever. Short 40 min. ride into caves and grottos. Up close to the cliffs. You can also rent kayaks here. Really a great boat ride with lots to see. Go when the water is calm and the ride is not rough at all.,May 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"This is definitely a must see, take the boat tour at bottom of stairs well worth the experience. The water is spectacular, most beautiful color of water I have ever seen. The experience of going in the caves by boat is amazing and rather refreshing as well",Jul 2017
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"We visited this beach on a whim, and boy were we stunned! Loved the views. I would definitely say do not miss visiting the beach and explore every nook and corner at your own pace and leisure.",Mar 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,"Very nice and beautiful area.

I’ve done it in a kayak and it was nice but the group was to big and it was to many other boats so it was hard to be relaxed even with relaxing surroundings.

I’ve done it with a small SUP tour (4 + guide). It was brilliant. Check with Algarve water sports centre.

I’ve done it by the sea by foot. If you walk in low tide you get about half way to the point. My recommendation would be to stop at the beach after the wave breaker (man made rock wall, you’ll know when you see it). We made it one beach further but you will get wet and probably reef cut. We tried further but gave up and walked back but we will bring better gear and try even further next time.

I’ve done it walking on the cliffs. Not danger free but not to bad. Second half accessible by a bit of a hill climb before the fence start. A few exit holes available on the other side. Very enjoyable, highly recommended.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,3.0,"We did the cliff walk not the boat trip. On reflection the boats out of Lagos would have been the better option. Stunning erosion creates great views and the walk was enjoyable. Total lack of interpretation of erosion, wild life, flora and fauna makes it a dullish walk . Some conservation is taking place but there’s no explanation of what or why? Nice flowers, crested grebes, tethered horses, and huge ants!",Jun 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Had I known the boats were small and not covered, I would not have gone, but ignorance is bliss, and I'm so glad I took this amazing tour. We had a perfect day with some real waves, but our boat driver was very good at his job and loved sharing these gorgeous waters with us. This is a must do if you are in Lagos!",May 2018

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,4.0,"Great place! A must visit while in Lagos- the views are absolutely breathtaking. It is not far from the centre of town. Once you decent the stairs, there are boat tours of the caves and cliffs of the “golden coast” being offered. Myself, my sister and my parents thoroughly enjoyed. The only reason for 4 stars is that it is insanely busy. I would recommend going as early as possible.",May 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"Walked along the coastal path to here and what a treat. Took loads of wonderful photos and in the neverending sunshine it was a wonderful walk which we won't forget in a hurry. You can take a bus, town train or taxi there if you don't want to walk. A worthwhile trip.",May 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"My friends and I had perfect February (mid-60s F) weather to hike Ponta da Piedade, and the views were incredible. We started mid-morning, packed water and a lunch, and spent the entire day hiking around the cliffs. I'd suggest making your way to the lower beaches if possible (there is one ""secret"" beach that has a rope and makes it easier to climb down and up), it makes the experience that much better. It helps that it's free to hike! It's great for people traveling on a budget, that still want to enjoy the incredible views and Lagos itself. I would have liked to take a boat tour in addition to hiking, but the dates we were there didn't quite allow for it.",Feb 2018

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,My husband and I enjoyed a lovely relaxing day at the beach. We originally viewed this beach by boat on a grotto trip and decided we must visit by foot. We were certainly not disappointed. A good selection and reasonably priced drinks at the beach bar.,May 2018
Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"This spectacular point of view is just right outside the city of Lagos. It's about 15 minute drive. The views here are breathtaking with high rocky coastlines allowing you to see far out over the Atlantic ocean.

Local boat tours for 15€ per person might seem like a rip off but the boat tour is actually very nice between the small cliffs and hidden caves in the water. Check high and low tide schedule especially if there's a low tide where you'll be able to see more caves when doing the boat tour.

You can easily spend about one hour here just walking from one end to another but bring some good sneakers to wear and some water if going on a longer hike. Following the coastlines you can easily hike 10-20 km back and forth.

Bring your long lense camera if not ising your mobile camera! Also bring swim wear if going to the nearby beaches. It's not recommended to swim to close to the rocks and cliffs when high tide. The water wawes can get quite heavy pushing you towards the rocks in the water!

Although the lighthouse was off limits and the gates closed there are pathways to the cliffs as well as a very sturdy staircase to the water below.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"First off - you must visit here, it is incredible and not to be missed on a visit to Sintra.
The house is around 100 years old and was built by a millionaire business man who also happened to be a Freemason and member of the Illuminati. It is thought that the grounds of this property hosted initiations into the society and events for the Freemasons.
The grounds are stunning and the perfect place to get lost, with twists and turns, hidden underground tunnels and a 27m deep well.
The house itself is incredibly grand and well maintained.
It is €10 to enter but I would recommend going on a guided tour to here so that someone can take you and show you around while telling you about the history of the place. I would recommend “keep it local” tours.

The gardens and the well were amazing to see, and truly blew my mind. The house was amazing, although they still appear to be renovating several other areas, so this is only going to get better. A complete enjoyable experience. I can’t wait to g back and see what more work they have done and continue to open new rooms in the house.",Oct 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"This place is a must see while in Sintra. The grounds and gardens are other-worldly. I saw the well and tunnel online, and knew I had to see it. It turned out to be even cooler than I imagined. The rest of the grounds are equally impressive and grand, in a quirky sort of way that was just fun. Only downside is the limited access to the main palace house, and the insanely authoritarian approach of security involving masking while outdoors on the grounds. One of our group put her mask on while walking up to the entry turnstile, and the tiny little excuse for a security guard insisted she go back to the door, take the mask off, and put it back on before walking back! People like this have no place in tourism. Hopefully once Covid passes, his kind will be stripped of this shred of power they try to wield. Regardless of security and their issues, this tour is worth every Euro!

Having a guided tour of the grounds is extremely helpful to understand this place. Very responsible price to enter",Sep 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,2.0,"I visited mainly for the palace.
I queued for twenty minutes and was back out in under five minutes, most of which was spent waiting for my turn to peer into a room briefly.
You pass through one room, look at the lobby, look at the recital room, look into another, pass through a second room and you’re out. (The rest of the place is being renovated).
I stood at the entrance of the chapel and looked in.
After that, I simply couldn’t be bothered to wander round the rest of the grounds.
Is anything else open? Even if it is, are you restricted to peering in from the door? Who knows?
To cap it all, the lady in the bookshop did her best to prevent me buying some of the books I wanted (picture souvenir books, but in Portuguese), then insisted on putting them all into separate paper bags. I had to fight to avoid her giving me a plastic carrier bag. So much for reducing waste.

Booking is easy at the main door €10 and you can get the listening guide in various languages. This provides interesting information on a specific viewpoint or building.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,3.0,"This is a spectacular villa and garden at the north end of Sintra old town. It is about a 12 min walk from town, mostly flat although the actual entrance is up a hill. It is poorly signposted but you have to walk on the road round the corner of the main villa and 100m or so up hill to the entrance.

The cost is EUR10 per person and you get a map. We headed straight to the main attraction which is the initiation well. At first there are a few signs but then the disappear. We walked for 15 mins around the upper garden looking for it amongst dozens of others. It should not be difficult to put up more signs as clearly everyone was having issues. Once there the well is truly something special to see. You enter at the top, spiral about 60m down and then exit through a long underground tunnel.

The other attractions (house, lake labyrinth, etc) are nice but not spectacular in my view. Overall we were happy we went to see the initiation well, but did not spend more than about an hour in the gardens.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"A short walk from the centre of contra along a flat road is this wonderful attraction. At €10 per adult it’s very reasonably priced and plenty to see for a few hours.
The main attraction is the initiation well, we queued for about 20-25 minutes as they are restricting entry to limited numbers at a time with the pandemic. This meant it was quieter inside with plenty of opportunity to take the attraction in.
After making our way to the well (keep an eye out for small paths and stairs as they are shortcuts to the main track) we headed down the hill to explore the rest.
Make sure you find the hidden labyrinth behind the lake at the bottom left, it’s dark so bring a torch but incredible!

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Honestly, I did not know anything in advance about this place but the famous staircase.

The area is simply amazing, perfect to get lost, full of small paths that actually can lead the visitor everywhere.

The staircase is the most interesting in my opinion. As the visitor goes down, there's a feeling to access in a completely new world. It is really a magic place.

The entrance is 10€, however it is worth the effort. This was my favourite attraction in Sintra.

It was a truly spectacular sight, and we were the only ones there which is very uncommon compared to the busy lines you normally see! We walked around the gardens but missed the palace.

It was magical!!!

The gardens were just splendid. It was very green, dark green especially and the fact that it had just rained a bit before made it even more magical. I did get some flash backs of English and Welsh woodlands haha.

The Quinta itself is small, but just as magical.

A must do!!

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Definitely the coolest place to visit in Sintra and I think it's also one of the most interesting places in Portugal. A magnificent mansion full of secrets and riddles. An amazing place that brings back childhood memories , fantasies about mysterious castles and gardens. The creator of this place had an unbridled fantasy, which he put into practice with great panache. Numerous pits and underground passages, shortcuts hidden between paths, mysterious buildings and a system of underground corridors carved into the rock. A place a bit like a fairy tale, a huge garden with amazing greenery and even more interesting architecture. Unusual architectural creations woven into the beautiful nature of the gardens provide several hours of fun for the visitors. The 27 m descent to the Initiation Well is very impressive, from where you exit through a rock tunnel in another part of the garden. The dark system of rock tunnels called the Labyrinth and the Waterfall are the greatest attractions of the garden. It's a perfect place to take photos. It is worth spending more time than on other attractions of Sintra. Interesting place worth visiting.

It's good if you're there early in the morning (less crowded) and take your time to explore the place.

It is totally intriguing, and well maintained.

This is my second trip to Sintra, a place I love, but my first time to the Quinta.

There is an app that can be downloaded to use as a guide, we only found out about it when we arrived at the site and for technical reasons, we lost a lot of time trying to download it. The place looks like a maze, countless possibilities on how to follow the route, and all the time you will find an interesting thing to see.

My suggestion is to bring a headlamp or a flashlight even though we had two cellphones with us.

We didn't explore the rest of the place so can't comment on that.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"During the 1840’s, Dona Ermelinda, Baroness of Regaleira, built this castle as a summer residence. It became a landmark on the elegant route to the Royal Palace and Palacio. During the summer, the presence of the royal family and court made Sintra elegant and cosmopolitan, so bourgeois estates were built alongside aristocratic ones, and it became fashionable to party along this circuit. We walked along the street, lined with ancient walled gardens, secret niches, and towering trees, to reach the entrance to the gardens. From there we began our mystical journey up the hill, winding our way through forests and gardens with massive walls, towers, and turrets, to the secret staircase. We entered what looked like a hobbit hole, overgrown with moss and plants, to find a stone staircase spiraling downward to a tiled circle six stories below. Then the trail led through a cave to a maze of pathways ending in waterfalls, stepping stones across a stream, and finally to a bridge that took us out of the maze. We continued down the mountain, past more forests and gardens, and a lovely yellow, red, and gray stone mosaic wall and fountain, until we caught a glimpse of the castle to which we were headed, with its massive stone walls, towers, and spires. Further down the path, we came upon the lovely chapel with gothic spires on top and baroque decoration within. At last we arrived at the main house. The second owner, Monteiro, wanted to recreate the Manueline style in the house and gardens to revive the art and architecture associated with the epic “age of discoveries” and the reign of King Manuel I—the period of greatest splendor and creativity of Portuguese culture. He definitely succeeded. The first room we visited was sunny yellow and had the most beautiful white plaster fireplace and ceiling with delicate carving and statues—like icing on a huge wedding cake. Mosaics in lovely pastels—yellow, pink, green, and blue—appeared above and below the fireplace, and even on the floor. Next, the large hall was paneled with rich, red-brown wood and the walls were dotted with “CM” monograms of the Carvalho/Monteiro family, interlaced with ribbons. Rooms continued with fanciful pastel-colorful paintings of 18th-century garden scenes in baroque/rococo style and elaborately-carved wooden doors and ceilings, compete with cherubs. Exploring the castle and grounds was like something out of a Tolkein novel--a magical experience!

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"My wife and I visited Quinta da Regaleira and I must say that if you visit Sintra it is not to be missed.

Firstly, getting there. We made the mistake of driving, but there is no parking and so we had to park about a mile away on the road and walk back along narrow steep roads. So, I would recommend getting an Uber which are cheap and easy to get in Sintra, or even a bus.

Secondly, getting in. There were huge queues for tickets - so I advise getting your tickets online at blueticket.pt (or any other ticket site). You can do this on your mobile when you get there and it simply show the online ticket as you go in and you avoid all the queues. The price is €10 er adult, €5 for seniors and children and children under 5 are free,

Once inside, we first walked around the gardens, and then he house.

The place it a UNESCO World Heritage site and was built at the turn of the 20th Century by millionaire Antonio Monteiro and designed by Italian architect Luigi Manini. The park feature a variety of wells, grottoes, lakes, fountains etc and has a real fairytale feel. Apparently the designs feature symbols related to Alchemy, Masonry, The Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians.

We started near the top of the gardens where you can find the unique ""Initiation Well"" which is not really a well but a deep hole with a galleried staircase that you can take don to the bottom. The moss covered structure is both beautiful and unusual.

We then snaked our way down the gardens, past many strange and unusual structures like towers and fountains. Sadly the waterfalls were undergoing maintenance and not functioning but you could see they would be quite spectacular if operating.

Finally, we explored the house, which is a beautiful gothic style palace with stunning views of the Moorish Palace and glimpses of Pena Palace.

Though we visited at the end of February, the weather was amazing (20C) and the gardens were splendidly green and beautiful. So this can be a great time to visit as I imagine there could be huge crowds in summer.

Overall Quinta da Regaleira was, in my opinion, one of the high spots of Sintra, which should not be missed.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Do not come to Sintra as a day trip. Stay at least one night. We stayed two nights & were glad we did. We really enjoyed the town after the tourists left around 5pm.

My suggestion is to arrive for two nights. See the Palace & Castelo one day. The next day arrive at the Quinta at opening time.

Note the tourist office does not sell tickets to the Quinta since its private. I think you can buy the tickets online, but we arrived at opening time & there was no line to buy them.

Walking directions: with your back to the tourist office in the center of town, & not the tourist office at the train station, make a right turn & walk down the street for about 15 minutes following the sign & you will see it.

Note: to buy tickets, pass the gate of the quinta & make a left turn up the steep street for about 10 minutes. You will see the entrance on your left to the quinta.

Go see the initiation well first as that is the most crowded. We absolutely loved it & it was a highlight of the quinta.

Continue to walk around the gardens. Note: the gardens are among steep uphill climbs. We loved the gardens & there are surprise tunnels throughout it. Very serene & peaceful if you go early in the am. Gorgeous landscaping.

Note the signs are confusing & the map is hard to understand.

After the gardens continue into the house. We did not find the palace as ornate as the palace, but we still really enjoyed it.

We loved the quinta & it was one of our highlights on our trip to Portugal.

We spend about 3 hours touring the house & gardens & taking loads of pictures.

We ate lunch at INcommun (see my reviews) near the train station & heading back to Lisbon in the early afternoon.

Extensive grounds feature footpaths that lead you into dimly lit labyrinths, inverted towers, balustrades and circular stairways. Fantastic imagination brought to life throughout.

Palace of Pena was awesome, but the day was gorgeous and the grounds around Quinta da Regaleira were so enjoyable to walk around.

Quinta da Regaleira is easily visited from the city centre of Lisbon, about 10 minutes walking uphill.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Not much to see in the palace but the gardens are wonderful, especially the wells and underground tunnels.

My main comments are really about getting between the different palaces in Sintra. I don't regard the €15 hop on hop off bus as particularly good value for money as it will be very, very difficult to visit and do justice to more than two of these stunning palaces in a day, especially with the amount of time spent queuing in the popular seasons. I used route 434 to visit Mouros and Pena and route 435 for Regaleira and Montserrrate for much less cost. Regaleira is accessible by a scenic but fairly steep walk from the town centre. Avoid the tuk-tuks as they are extremely expensive and the person who touts their tickets dresses like an official from the public transport company.

You can exit via stepping stones across the water or find another tunnel that takes you out further down the hill.

However, in mid-November, on a weekday, there was a very dangerous number of people in The Well. It is extremely narrow, steep, slippery and a potential deathtrap if one person falls down.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,Quinta da Regaleira was recommended by a new friend in Lisbon. I am so glad she recommended it. The castle and the grounds are extremely beautiful. The grounds are fun and creative to explore. You start in one part of the grounds and end up in caves etc.. Hard to explain but a lot of fun to wander around. It makes you feel like a kid again. You really need to be able to walk steep steps and walkways to enjoy the full experience. this was one more reason to love Sintra. I recommend the city and this attraction.,Oct 2019

It is a great story of how the castle was built & by who & why he built the different areas & what they were used for. Was sad to find out thay it was never a really old castle.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Regaleria palace can be reached by taking the bus 434 from the Sintra station and is right after the Pena Palace, though you have to get down at the Sintra historic center to reach regaleria palace,which is about 10 minutes walk from the center. Though to be warned although it is fun and adventurous to cover the regaleria grounds, there is a lot of steep climbing involved throughout the property. Set aside at least two to three hours to explore regaleria palace with a lot of climbing involved. The map provided is a but confusing and you tend to get lost. The main attraction of Regaleria is the ""initiatic well"" written in Portuguese as ""Poco Iniciatico"". Pictures of this well is widely seen in the Internet and first place to visit at Regaleria. Though its a very steep and tiring route to take to ml and let's out to a little waterfall. Actually if you have someone who would not be able to do the climbing, they can actually use the exit of this point to just enter to see the "" initiatic well"" , as this entry point is at lower grounds and does not require steep climbing. Though you can only examine it from the bottom, at least you can see it, without having to stress yourself. This particular entry point is called ""Lake of Waterfall"" and in Portuguese it is ""Lago de Cascata"". On the whole worth a visit and indeed a fascinating place to visit.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Highly recommended, you can easily spend a fruitful 5+ hours exploring the park and mansion. The park especially feels like a sprawling expanse to explore of interesting vistas and out of the way paths that had me feel like I was exploring rather than sightseeing. Even though no single thing is particularly spectacular, it was my favorite place in Sintra.",Nov 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"I wish gardens and domains were still built that way. What a magical place. The park is not as big as it seems on the map you receive at the reception and underground tunnels and caves take you suddenly to a completely different part of the garden. It was splendid, never seen a thing like that. We visited with three young boys and they totally enjoyed the caves, the spiral staircase of the Initiation well and wanted to have photos taken in or in front of every construction.

Best is to go there relatively early in the morning – as we did – to avoid long queues to the ticket office and some crowd on the site. The park is big enough to accommodate many people without the sensation of it being a crowded place but there can be occasional queues to get atop a tower or walk down the Initiation well.

Don’t drive there. The parking is tiny and if you don’t find a spot before you get there, there is no street parking after the domain! Since you’ll be on a one way street, you will be obliged to do a c. 10km detour to get back there! By all means, park in Sintra, nowhere in the town center will be too far from the Quinta, a max of 1.5 km. Just walk up the hill, visit the place and stroll back down...

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"We walked up from town, not far, but gradually uphill; some people had a difficult time of it. There will be plenty of walking inside the park.

Throngs of people were there on a sunny late October morning 90 minutes after opening. The mansion itself was completely unpleasant with that many people (at the end of our visit after the grounds), and we were dying do get out, but once in the mansion, you are trapped. Take water. it is not available except at the cafe at the end.

The map of the grounds can be confusing. It is best to just go and wander and enjoy it at your leisure. Some people can manage the small paths between major ones, and some cannot, but there is plenty to opportunity to enjoy the garden. If you can catch an explanation of the two wells, it is interesting, but only the most nimble and least claustrophobic will enjoy those tunnels. No way I would do a guided tour unless you have a private one.

Bottom line is avoid the heaviest tourist times which make this a marred experience: Stay overnight in Sintra a couple of nights if you can. Go to this place and wait to enter first thing in the morning. Do the Pena Palace at the last entry time of the day (or maybe exactly at lunch time).

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"We visited Quinta da Regaleira just after Halloween, and the weather was misty and foggy. It actually gave the whole site a spooky feeling, which made it all the more beautiful! I thought this attraction was well worth the visit while in Sintra, and maybe my favorite place in Portugal that we visited! The architecture is amazing, and I love how nature has taken over a bit. Go as early as possible for the best views without people. And be careful on the Initiation Well - it's very narrow and people are very pushy! We got there when it opened and that was the first thing we did. We got to enjoy it with a few others for a couple minutes before it was completely overwhelmed...just keep that in mind!

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"This place is beyond beautiful, with flora from all over the world, co-existing in the unique gardens. I would have loved to spend half a day here just leisurely walking around the gardens. Unfortunately we only have ~60 minutes here, so we bought tickets early via moblie en-route (skipped the lines, which didn't seem too long) and hoofed it up to the initiation well. It was beautiful and impressive. I hear in the spring time the moss will sometimes be flowering and provide even more beautiful views in the well. But even without that it was still breathtaking. The ushers will push you along at the beginning of the well descent, but don't worry too much - they just want to keep things moving and you'll have time a couple flights down to take some awesome photos.

The rest of the grounds are just as impressive, with cavernous tunnels (now with LED lighting!) and plenty of hidden benches and rest stops. For less than 10 euros it's well worth a visit. If you have kids or a stroller it may be a bit more effort/seem less interesting for the kids, but what tourist attraction isn't? (aside from Disneyland/world)

The steep slope is incorporated into an exotic design with caves, statues, waterfalls, streams and large scultures. The foliage is beatufil all over.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Some logistics at end.
Grounds are beautiful and fun to explore. We spent 4 hours at a leisurely pace, doing the Well early helped as there was no line at 10am.
Building is pretty but at the moment only first floor is open, so half an hour is all that is needed.
Cafe is sufficient, although their credit card reader charged more in dollars than any other restaurant in Lisbon. Beware.
We took bus 435, which does a big loop, from Sintra main train station. It is hop on hop off for 5€, no single trip option. Drops you at exit of grounds, 3 min walk uphill to entrance if you need to buy tickets. E- ticket holders may be able to enter here.
At ticket office be sure to get a map, and optional 3€ audioguide. 1 per couple is sufficient, not critical info and you can re-play. Activates at listening posts spread throughout grounds.
Regalera website has downloadable map which is copy of pages from Insight travel book. On that map it is suggested that guided tours are available hourly. They are, with reservations, for groups >10. So call ahead if you want one.
Also on map are routes of the tunnels leading away from the Initiation Well. If you want to be able to explore all without going down the well, take a look.
A note on busses. Bus 434 is the most popular bus (doesn't go to Regaleira), and the stop near the national palace is jammed with people and busses in the afternoon. If you are looking for any other bus stopping there, stay sharp as busses may not stop if nobody is waving from the crowd, or stop briefly in the street if pull-out is full.
Bus 433 stop near main station is down the street past the cafes, around the corner, near the gorge.
We took bus 467 (Scotturb) from Oeiras to Portela stn, 4.80€, then train, then bus 433 to Regaleira. Less than 90 min door to door.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Lovely place to walk around in the gardens and nature we enjoyed it thoroughly. Absolutely mindblowing place, probably the place we loved the most in Sintra.",Nov 2018
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Having stayed overnight at the Tivoli Palace, a 5 min walk away from the entrance to Quinta de Regaleira , not surprisingly I was one of the first to enter when the gates opened. Maybe because it was early October ...but during my 2 hr visit there were nowhere near as many tourists as there were at Pena Palace. And yet, I found Regaleira so much more interesting to tour.

One should note, as of early October only the first floor of the estate was open. There was a sign indicating that the other floors were undergoing renovation. You do get to see the dining room and a few other rooms.... which were surprisingly modest in size ...maybe because this is not a Palace but more of a residence . The more humanistic size of the rooms made it all the more interesting to me.

Upon entering the property I immediately started to walk up hill toward the Initiation Well ... the walk takes 5-10 minutes but if you are one of the first to enter the property you will have the well all to yourself...for at least 5 minutes that is. Be mindful of the few signs that point the way up hill.

After visiting the well, the walk is all downhill. There are numerous little passage ways, grottos to explore and wonderful architectural structures to accent the landscape. One can only imagine what these gardens were like after they were first installed back in the early 1900s. The park at Regaleira far exceeds the park at Pena Palace in terms of visual interest and ease of finding your way around using the map that was provided. But both parks have a sense that time and nature are taking their toll.

I just wish the organization operating Regaleira had the funds to restore the park to what it would have looked like when it was first constructed.

For example.... the park has one feature that must have been a very amazing site for those house guests staying at Regaleira....an outdoor aquarium ! This was perhaps one of the most interesting structures for me . Yes, today it no longer functions and in fact you have to look closely to see that it was actually an aquarium. But there is this large stone structure.. the size of 2 - 3 cars that served as a fish tank. The tank is carved out of what appears to be stone with glass inserts / portholes allowing guests to Look at the sea life within. In today’s world an aquarium probably seems very ordinary but back in the early 1900s , at a private residence no less, it must have been very futuristic.

There are 3-4 park features that represent a maze of tunnels carved into the mountain...and at least one of them was fairly long and you definitely needed a flashlight to explore it. Again, for children I could see these passage ways being great fun... but as for myself it was rather ordinary.

I would still invest time in touring Quinta da Regaleira only to imagine what visitors back 100 years ago first thought when entering the gardens for the first time.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,We had so much fun at this place! So many hidden alleys and mini-labirynts. The architect must have been a genius.,Oct 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,No crowds. Lovely. Beautiful tiles. Convenient and easy to get to right in the heart of old town city center.,Oct 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"We love to hike/run/bike so we skipped the bus and hiked up the road to the mansion. It’s a fun walk and if you head out early (aiming to arrive at opening) quiet and possible to beat the tour buses. The grounds are spectacular! A great place to get lost. While there isn’t the royal history here that Pena Palace has, the architecture and whimsy are aesthetically great. There’s something almost Gaudi-esque about this place. Only take one star off because it does get busy with tourists as the day goes on.",Oct 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"We chose to spend the day here - it looked very interesting on paper and didn't disappoint in reality. Endless nooks and crannies. We loved it. Six hours later, we'd walked around most of it. No flowers of note at this time of year but the landscaping scheme blended beautifully into the hillside. Probably the best garden we've ever visited, due to the quality and extent of the landscaping.",Oct 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,1.0,"After seeing great reviews, our expectations were high but our experience yesterday at Quinta da Regaleira was a huge disappointment. Long lines for tickets, inefficiently run ticket desk, only to find two of three floors of the mansion to be closed; was hugely disappointing.
Won’t be back. Can’t recommend it.",Oct 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,Stunning place absolutely loved it. Very spacious so even at peak time it didnt feel too crowded. Make sure you go to the initiation well its easy to overlook but was a highpoint of the visit. The pancakes in the cafe are lovely 😀 there was a bit of a queue to get in which was slow but bear with as once your in no better place to visit,Sep 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"The Quinta da Regaleira greatly exceeded our expectations. So many places to explore. Beautiful gardens, grottos, waterfalls, viewing towers, tunnels, and architecture.

""Quinta de Regaleira is a UNESCO World Heritage site designed by the wealthy Portuguese businessman Carvalho Monteiro Carvalho Monteiro in 1904.

Italian architect Luigi Manini designed the four-hectare estate with its enigmatic buildings, believed to hide symbols related to alchemy, Masonry, the Knights Templar, and the Rosicrucians. The architecture of the palace, split over five floors and has an ornate gothic façade that evokes Roman, Gothic, Renaissance and Manueline architectural styles. The construction of the current estate commenced in 1904 and most of it was concluded by 1910. The outside façade of the grand house is decorated with gothic turrets, carved gargoyles and other ornate features. Inside, the building spreads over five floors, but it’s very sparse in actual original details. The true wonder of the Quinta da Regaleira are the grounds, which cover 4 hectares and were inspired by the owner’s mystic ideologies.

The gardens are incredibly ornate. Set on a hillside, a multitude of fountains, grottoes, statues, caves, and ponds are connected both above ground via lovely paths and by a series of underground tunnels lit today by strings of Christmas lights. The grounds also include a chapel and an aquarium, built to look as if it naturally existed amongst the rock.""

If you have time, I would recommend the following 5 sites while in Sintra. This is my order of personal enjoyment, although I liked all of them a lot.
- Quinta da Regaleria
- National Palace of Pena
- Castelo dos Mouros
- Palacio de Monserrate
- National Palace of Sintra

We stayed one and a half days, arriving in the late afternoon we hit the National Palace of Sintra first before it closed and then went right on to the Quinta da Regaleira by foot. This really worked out well. The Quinta da Regaleira came in way above expectations for me and the National Palace of Sintra, as well.

The second day we started at Pena, then the Moorish Castle, followed by Monserrate on our way out of town. We wanted to swing by Cabo da Roca and didn't want to drive through the center of Sintra on our way to Lisbon via rental car.

The gardens and Palace of Monserrate are beautiful. I would definitely recommend visiting. But I have to say that each one of the 5 really complement each other. We are glad we structured our itinerary to have enough time at each one.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"My teenage son wanted to visit here as he'd heard of the initiants' wells. I was a bit doubtful & thought it might be a long trip for not much. However the gardens were wonderful, with so many hidden grottoes, waterfalls, tunnels & mini castles you could climb up. ""Like Disney but real"" was my son's comment. And the wells were very atmospheric.

I'd have loved more information on the history & symbolism of the place, & no chance of a book in the gift shop, which must rate as one of the worst. However the terrace restaurant was really nice.

We drove there & I'd not recommend this, as navigation & parking are very difficult. We missed the entrance, but managed to park about a mile up the road, otherwise there was a 20km one way loop to get back. There's a train to Sintra station then hop on buses, which might be less stressful!

It is a long uphill walk from where the bus drops you. Then it’s more uphill in the gardens. They don’t look real and the caves were closed. After walking through the Pena palace gardens these were a disappointment. Then we picked up the bus at the same spot.

Once you find the Initiation Well and go down, you're in a well lit labyrinth of tunnels which lead to the waterfall, pond and stepping stones (note: you aren't obligated to do the stepping stones). The rest of the garden has beautiful fountains, look out points and smaller structures. Mobility is key but this garden is relatively flat with little inclines here and there.",Sep 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"A fantasy garden of grottoes, fountains, statues and buildings. There is a large network of underground walkways and tunnels links structures and buildings of the estate.

The garden, palace and most of the structures are filled with symbols, which are linked to Tarot mysticism, Masonry, the Knights Templar, and the Rosicrucians.

The guide book said that the Initiation Well might be related to Masonic rituals. Other articles mentioned that the Quinta da Regaleira is a land filled with mysteries and secrets, ...... Okey,...... What secret? How come??

Racking my brain, I could not uncover any secret in the estate.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Quinta da Regaleirabe was our favourite and much preferred to Pena and Mores! Short walk from Sintra town (5-10mins) on a quiet, mostly flat and easy road. Very easy to navigate with big signs.

The grounds really are beautiful. Make sure you pick up a map (for free) when you enter as without this you could miss things. The grounds are smaller than Pena (although still vast) and therefore you can work your way around most of the areas without having to pick and choose what you have time to see.

A very romantic, peaceful, intriguing grounds to explore. Lots of little hidden gems. One of the best and most enjoyable I have been to. Also makes for some amazing photo opportunities.

The palace, the grottos, the towers, the well, the stepping stones, the grounds; it’s all fabulous! The audio tour was also very informative and worthwhile to give that extra info/context. I’d definitely put this at the top of your list in a trip to Sintra!",Sep 2019

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"We decided to go to Sintra in the park, about which we read on the way, the history of the park and individual objects there is very impressive. To get to the entrance, you need to climb the hill, there is also a line, but relatively not big. Tickets cost 8 € per person, if you are under 17 years old and over 65 years old, a ticket will cost 5 €.
The park itself is very large and beautiful, the day was hot, but due to the many trees and the shade from them, the heat was not felt so much. On the territory of the park there is a palace, a well of initiation and many more not big constructions.
I recommend to visit.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"What a magical place!!!! Just explore and get lost into your own little wonderland.
Enjoy the street guitar as ambience to this incredible experience. Be sure to check out the initiation well.

I feel ignorant because I didn’t read about the history and just wandered blindly so I’m sure knowledge only increases the experience but even as a stupid gringo, I have to say this place blew me away.

Also, and this goes for all of Sintra, be prepared to walk uphill. A lot. I’m sure there is a lazy way to bus around but even so, there is a lot of hiking. It’s glorious and great exercise but i kept wondering how my mom would do with all the inclined walking.

And I was lucky, it wasn’t very crowded the day i went to Sintra (probably because of the fire warnings) but you should try to avoid the crowds. Google has a great feature that shows you how crowded places are expected to be. Just google the attraction and scroll down to the bar chart

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"This was an interesting visit- they didn’t have any headsets when we were there which was disappointing (I would have liked to hear about more of the history). We walked around and tried to get to the initiation well but the line was at least an hour long. We saw another well so went down there and were shocked to find the tunnel network. I saw pictures of the well online but didn’t know where it led. Definitely a cool surprise to come out to the waterfall area. We went down a couple of times and backtracked to the main well from the tunnels since the line was still really long. The inside of the house is nothing special, the grounds and tunnels are really the selling point here. Worth a visit (we went late in the afternoon and didn’t have much of a wait).

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"I'm so glad my family squeezed in a visit to Quinta da Regaleira before leaving Sintra. It's not as famous as some of the other palaces in the area, so it's tempting to skip it, but this was our favorite attraction in Sintra. As others have noted, this is a whimsical, mysterious garden full of inverted towers, wells, tunnels, grottos and castle walls. It is unlike any place we've ever visited. The photography opportunities are endless. It is also a wonderful spot for escaping the world with a book or a sketch pad. Children will enjoy exploring the hidden wonders, but it's worth noting that it is easy to slip on the pebbled paths and take a nasty spill down a hill or over a low stone wall. So families with small children should explore the gardens as a group, rather than letting children run off on their own. After a full day of sightseeing, we opted to skip the tour of the Quinta da Regaleira manor house, but the grounds themselves easily justify the admission price.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"What an incredible wonder of a place!

We had planned to come to Quinta da Regaleira as i was really intrigued by the initiation well and the look of the manor house itself. These are just the tip of the iceburg of what is just the most fantastical and mysterious place i think i have ever visited.

Around every corner you will find something hidden that you didnt know was there so explore, explore explore! Climb every flight of stairs, go through every tunnel, peep round every corner and keep on searching!

You can easily spend the whole day here and get lost in imagination and i highly recommend that you do :-)

A couple of pointers;

The queue will most likely be long. This is easily rectified by buying your tickets in advance, or like we did, quickly purchasing them on our phone once we there so we could go through the quick way!

The Labyrinth. Absolutely spectacular, my favourite part of the grounds but it is dark and has lots of entrances to the water that you wouldn't see unless you use a torch (or light from phone) We warned one family as they entered but the didn't listen. 5 minutes later we heard a scream and a splash and then appeared a wet lady. I have to admit, it was very funny - although she didnt think so ha!

Parking. A problem. There isnt a lot of it, but just keep going past the entrance until you find a spot on the side of the road. It will probably be a fair walk, but, there are always tuk tuks about so if your not up for the hilly walk, you have a saviour :-)

She (and we) were so utterly enthralled by the underground lakes & tunnels, secret passages, amazing follies, hidden leafy trails, weird & wacky wells and holes in the ground. You name it, it was there.

The house took us less than an hour to wander round but you can spend hours in the garden, it's hard to comprend the amount of planning & design that must have gone into this and the kind of mind necessary to conceive of such amazing ideas.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"You could spend the whole day here wandering all the different paths and caves and tunnels and never get bored. We came here with our daughter and she was always eager to go into the wells, the cave tunnels, the snaking paths through the garden and over the bridges and shortcuts. The gardens in this Quinta are truely remarkable as well as the architectural pieces throughout. Even though there are a lot of people coming, as it is quite big, they spread out quite a bit. Only the wells, the towers, the waterfall and the palace get a bit packed at times. We recommend investing 3 euros on the rental audio guides, which gives you the chance to learn some more about what you’re seeing. The palace is also a fine representation of the amazing art located here; only a shame that the upper floors are not open for visits. You can bring your own snacks and take a pause on one of the many benches around the place to extend your visit some more. The gift shop is very small and lacks a wide offering but you can go down in the old town, just 5-10 minutes from the quinta and find plenty of souvenir and gift options.

We only walked the grounds, not being interested in another building tour. The grounds were designed/laid out by a genius. Paths darting left and right, up and down, twisting and turning through acres of land. Lushly landscaped with hidden alcoves and surprises along the way.

Highlights were the wells. Spiraling staircases leading deep into the earth leading from one to the other and ending up at a waterfall with stepping stones crossing the water.
It was a delightful few hours discovering what lay around the next corner.

The former owner charismatic millionaire Antonio Monteiro was interested in mythology, mysticism, alchemy and is believed to be a Freemason, so there are a lot of symbols around the park.

But in the end the better things you can see here are the trees and the bushes, the gardens and the woods.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"We visited as a family, put kids are 12 and 10 and we also had our parents with us.
Some tips first: buy tickets online, and show them on your phone (no need to print). We only visited the Quinta that day and having one grandparent who could not walk too much we drove to the Quinta.
Once there we didn’t find parking as there is none. We continue the road and after a while it widens and people mark on the side. It was 15min relatively easy walk back to the gate. I wish we would have taken the audio guide (3 eur extra) as you are given a map of the garden with the main sites but there isn’t any explanation on it.
We started with the gardens, from bottom to top and then back down.
Important to note you can only walk down the well and not upwards so it is best to walk down the well and then through the tunnels rather than go through the tunnels first. Also the tunnels are easy walk, relatively well lit. It wasn’t a problem for our grandma. The gardens however are all on a hill so that can be harder.
The house itself is relatively small and we could only visit the ground floor at this time due to restauration work.
On site there is a cafe which serves some sandwiches, salads, soup, dish of day, hot drinks, ice creams etc. It is quite dear at 8eur a small sandwich or salad.
There are also two toilets and be prepared to queue.
Finally there is an app which makes the visit a little more interactive, but it’s better to not only download it when connected to WiFi but also download the itineraries.

It was a neat experience to walk around, we didn't realize that if you walked all the way down you could access the other more rustic well, Poco Imperfeito. Both of these come out to the bottom of the cave/lagoon area Lago da Cascata. We were short on time while we were here because we were on a tour but it is well worth an afternoon here.

The initiation well/cave/stepping stones (all attached together) were the highlight for us. There was a cafe on the grounds at which we sat to enjoy an espresso and people watch for awhile.

We came here by car and parking was very limited, but we managed to find street parking about a 15 minute walk away.",Jul 2019

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"My favorite of the two castles we visited in Sintra on an unusually cold and foggy July day. Because it was at lower elevation, Quinta da Regaleira offered the opportunity to stroll through its gardens and wonderful sacrificial well without becoming lost in fog. The castle ramparts were storybook in nature and offered a variety of exceptional photo opportunities. The gardens could have been better indicated, as several times we were led up to and alongside the wall as if we had all day to wander aimlessly.

The steep staircase inside the well was worth the trek as were the series of tunnels at the bottom leading to very pretty waterfall and brook areas accessible by elevated stone paths.

There was a teacher’s discount on the garden admission, and we didn’t bother visiting the interior to avoid the lines.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"On a visit to Sintra every 'attraction ' is , for a family of 4, about 30 Euros. So , do you want to everything, or be selective ?

We couldn't face the queues for the palaces/castle and the kids (15 and 12) didn't fancy rooms and rooms of furniture etc. so plumped to just go to the gardens and smaller palace at QdR, well worth a visit.

Quirky exciting grottoes, tunnels (use your torch phone !) , wells , follies and then lovely gardens, a quick whiz around the palace and a very good lunch in the cafe. I had the best octopus salad ever in there !

From here (about 3 Hours with a lazy lunch) we climbed up the road/path for a view of the Pena castle and the Moorish castle-all very impressive from a distance-enough in our opinion . We then took a lovely walk downhill from the Moorish Castle ticket office thro the gardens that lead down to the historic centre The Palace at the historic centre we also avoided though viewed from outside. The centre is worth a wander around and the shops and cafes worth a look.

This was a good plan for us and worked well-you could do everything, each at 30 E and end up worn out and tired of stately homes , with 2 kids this was just right .

BTW take some layers it can get very chilly and misty up on the tops. Consider a taxi to sintra and get dropped off at the historic centre, then walk everywhere. driving looked complete nightmare and driving/taxiing or taking the bus up to the tops was one huge traffic jam best avoided.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"We arrived here at 11am having walked uphill, it's a fair trek and busy as there are cars and tuk tuks passing by. You could use the various busses from the station.

On arrival the queue was short, we got a ticket easily. Headed into the park with a map and made use of the toilets. There is a cafe here too.

We followed the map and headed away from the crowds, this gave us peace and quite, much better as we could stop and look.

There are beautiful flowers here, plenty of places to stop and relax.

The underground grottoes and walkways are dangerous, for unsupervised young children. Hold their hands and know where they are. I had a 20 year old, with us and he nearly fell down a hole! Healthy and safety is not the same as the UK. There are open expenses of algae water, with steps down. Our son stepped onto it and ended up with one wet foot.

The well is busy as everyone goes down, taking photos, along the way. Again there is very little health and safety, you can learn right over, should you wish too!!

It was busy around the wells, but apart from that freedom to move. Lots of shade, though our first day 1st July was chilly. Plenty of places to sit and a pleasant cafe at the top of the palace steps.

Definitely reccomend this as a place to spend several hours.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"Went to visit the initiation well and palace, two families with teenagers and two under tens. Was well worth it and while we had the usual groans and moans from teenagers they enjoyed it and eventually got into it.
The well itself was the highlight and gardens through the walk around was lovely. Everyone enjoyed it but it was hard work to get there as we were recommended to get the bus. We travelled on the 403 from Malviera Da Serra and the the 423 bus around Sintra. The bus journey wasn’t great especially the overcrowded 423, which was also like a rollercoaster ride, and left everyone of us ill for the rest of the day.

In my opinion though, Pena palace (and gardens) and the Moorish castle are far more spectacular. If I was pushed for time I would give this one a miss.

TIP: Make sure to wear sensible footwear. Please note that some of the stone spiral staircases are quite narrow with many visitors trying to get past. Underground there were some dark-ish areas and some small puddles of water.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,I didn’t have a guided tour and I wish I had. All the tour guides knew super cool info and how to get around this giant area,Jul 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"This is quite a Mystical place littered with mystic cultic symbolism. I would describe the garden as a cult playground. An idea verified by the ceremonies conducted in the initiation well combined with Tarot rights and the symbology of the well construction itself in number of steps to landings, and star/pentagrams. Many of the statues, fountains and gargoyles depict a goat’s head. The statues at the base leveI are all from Greek Mythology. I found it odd that such a mysticism place would have a chapel, but the chapel’s secret is that it holds the seal of the all-seeing eye at its entry. The cave at the base of the tower has a chandelier in shape of a hexagram or 6 pointed star. I’m sure the property is riddled with many more I did not have time to explore. Pay attention to detail as there is a lot and it's easily missed. Even small simple things like the fountain in the cafe has a different sea shell in each hand..

Further research shows that the owner Monterio in 1904-1910 built the establishment to house symbols that he took interest and curiosity in which range from Alchemy, Masonry, Knights Templar, and Rosicrucians. I would say Monterio the Millionaire as was his nickname, succeeded in hiding his symbolic ideologies in plain sight amongst the beautiful smokescreen of a peaceful garden with flowers, water features, and architecture that gives birth to excitement and wonderment.

Currently I would believe this site still attracts those interested in occult ideals. My private guide explained to me that Madonna herself has seen the gardens; and that she had a 6-month trial purchase of the villa adjacent to the garden. After the 6-month trial period she did not complete the sale, realizing living so close to a tourist location, not to mention UNESCO as a celebrity was probably not the best idea. Madonna is into Kabbala and it’s mysticism, so it’s possible there’s a connection, and a quick internet search does confirm her Lisbon home purchase.

If you visit the gardens do so with plenty of time! I recommend NOT going with a tour group as you’d be surrounded and held up by the groups. The earlier you arrive the better. Large groups of tour busses were arriving as I left and the population inside easily tripled. Even prior to so many buses at the initiation well was the largest haggle of people and que to walk down it’s abbys. Make us of the map given to you at entry. The garden is vast with many levels, steep hills to walk, dark tunnels to explore, towers to climb, and waters to traverse. The point here is to get lost, so guard your soul, and schedule enough time here to find yourself.

Finding parking here is hard. Taking the train or taxi here is more ideal as vehicle parking is scarce, highly observed, and ticketed.

Easy walks in hillside gardens with mature trees, turrets to walk up & stone wells. Only negative was the red city sightseeing Sintra hop on hop off bus. Long waits, full bus leaving us behind several times and promises of a bus soon but not arriving at all meant we saw less and were frustrated.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"We visited Quinta da Regaleira first on our day in Sintra, because I wanted to see the famous Initiation Well before the biggest crowds of the day (although it was busy even by mid-morning). I had heard descriptors like ""masonic"" and ""secret"" to describe the Initiation Well, and I had incorrectly envisioned an ancient place. In fact, the house and gardens were built in the early 1900s, finished about 1910. They were designed by an Italian who was also known for designing sets for the opera in Milan. Hence, the house and gardens are highly romantic and decorative, with hidden staircases, towers and tunnels. It's very beautiful and we enjoyed our visit a lot, although I preferred both the national palace and the Pena palace in Sintra because they have more history than Quinta da Regaleira does.

We got to Pena Palace at 9:30 right before the crowds. We did the park ticket because we heard from many others that the inside of the place was not worth it and a long line. We then
walked down the road to Castelo dos Mouros. Its a 5 minute walk and well worth the visit. From there you can walk downhill using the historic centrico path. Its a relatively easy downhill walk (much harder if you opted to walk uphill to Pena palace which I would not have done). Once you are at the bottom you veer left and head to
Quinta da Regaleira. Every aspect of this place was amazing and I would take at least a couple hours to wander the gardens. The audio tour was well worth the extra 4 euro.

The palace was interesting, but the gardens, passageways are unbelievably well made and fun. Make sure your phone has battery - you might need the flashlight!

Suggested sintra itinerary (Pena Palace+Quinta da Regaleira): We came to Sintra around 10.30 from Lisbon, directly took the bus up to Pena Palace (so a oneway ticket), visited the palace, took a 40 min walk around the gardens and exited through the 'valley of the lakes', then did a 30-40 min downhill walk through an easy and well marked path below the castelo dos mouros and through the gardens of the villa sasseti to reach quinta de regaleira. Some people were doing this the opposite way (so uphill - no idea why they did that to themselves )
From there, after going around the castle, its just 10 mins downhill to sintra where you can also spend some time and a further 5 minutes to the train station.

Quinta's coffeeshop is pleasant for a coffee if you find a shady spot:)

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"We visited Quinta da Regaleira as part of our tour with Portuguese for a Day, which was an excellent tour. It's worth mentioning that this once private estate is located in the hills surrounding Sintra on a narrow road with virtually no parking or stopping. As we arrived with a guide he drove around while we visited. Tickets were included with our tour so we didn't have to queue or purchase tickets when we arrived.

The house and surrounding park are fascinating - our guide gave us a detailed briefing before we went in (tickets were included in our tour) with explicit directions on where to start, how to walk and what to see which made our visit very efficient and interesting. Our guide also gave us a detailed summary of the property, the owner, the symbolism (there's a lot) which made the visit much more interesting as well as maps.

As with the park and palace of Pena, there was little signage and less staff. This is a self-explore type of destination. Having said that, we felt in many ways it was much more interesting and a more detailed reflection of the history of the property and the owner. The curation is better and provided us with an understanding of how the property was developed and what the buildings were used for - it was very interesting.

We spent two hours here and we kept moving the entire time. Again there's a lot of walking, hills and exposure to the weather - bring a jacket and a hat and wear comfortable shoes. Steps can be quite small and steep in some parts of the buildings and slippery in the caves, along the ponds and descending into the 'well' -which was fascinating and well worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the architecture and construction.

The Quinta da Regaleira is not included in all tours so check first before you book - you should definitely visit this estate. With some small improvements (better signage, a bit more curation outside of the main house, etc. this destination would be even better).

I was disappointed they didn't have the guided tour the day I went but it worked out fine as I enjoyed putting away the map & getting lost over and over again & at the same time discovering the amazing parts of Quinta.

Got here on a Friday around 1:30 and line wasn't long (about 20 in front of me) but when I left at 4:30 about 100 in line for a ticket. So looks like earlier is better.

They suggest 1.5 - 2 hours but I would say take the time and spend at least 3 hours.

Enter this Palace and go back in time. Stroll in a garden, enjoy the view from a few towers, walk in a cave or two, step into the spiral staircase Well (initiation Well) & of course there is a Waterfall. The photo opportunities are endless.

This is the hidden gem of the ""Discover Sintra"" line (take the 435). Definitely worth prioritizing!

One of the highlights is the Initiation Well (the cool spiral staircase that you see in all the pictures). There was a line to enter but it moved quickly and the unique experience was worth the wait. Don't be put off if you have to wait at the various towers and other structures, in a few minutes the crowds will move on and it will be your turn. In the process you will have no problem finding your own personal secret spot at Quinta da Regaleira.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Very pretty mansion + gardens in the beautiful city of Sintra. It has it’s own, Gaudi-like style. As part of the freemasons, the place was designed by italian architect Luigi Manini. The best known previous owner was a Rio born Antonia Augusto Carvalho Monteiro, who got rich in Brazilian coffee trade and studied in Coimbra, Portugal in the 19th century. The place is interesting for it’s history, but even more for its design. There are countless staircases, tunnels, squares and viewpoints. Best to take 2 hours and explore all the details of this ground.",Jun 2019

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,Highly recommended stop in Sintra - our whole family enjoyed every little corner of this fairy tail estate.,Jun 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"I'm not sure if this place qualifies as a castle because it boasts many features like a castle but spread out over zigzagging paths as if pieces of the castle were erected along the mountain or a hillside making it for a very unique design.

This place has many hidden walkways and stairways that can cut your climb in half avoiding zigzagging up or down or they might take you absolutely nowhere so if you have the time and the curiosity to explore without getting upset by hitting a dead end once in awhile then go for it if your on a timed schedule then follow the path that way you will get to see what you want to see without the risk of losing precious minutes backtracking.

The main attraction here without a doubt is the Initiation Well.

As you approach it and you stare directly down to its Abyss you can almost envision the ceremonies that might have been held here with knights and probably members of the church filling the spaces in the spiraling staircase as they'd look down towards the center as the ceremony is about to begin oh, it really feels like with every step you are traveling just a bit further back in time

There is also another caves with lake, but without light inside :)

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Sintra was the royal playground when they wanted to escape the hot city. The palace and gardens are stunning. Learn about the free masons who helped build the palace and grounds. Worth a half day visit (that's all the time you really need) especially to escape the heat of Lisbon.
The town of Sintra has many restaurants and pastelerias to entice you. Try the famous quesadas made here. Delicious with a cafe com leite as a morning snack or afternoon pick me up.
Sintra is a 40 minute bus ride from Lisbon. Do it! You won't be sorry.",May 2019
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"This place is magical, you can just walk around, get lost and even go back in time. Trip to Sintra is generally classified as a day trip. But, if you are visiting Quinta da Regaleira, you must must have enough time to explore the green spaces, the castle area and the surroundings (half a day at least).

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"After a full day of climbing up the mountain to the Castle of the Moors and the Pena Palace we finished our day in Sintra with a trip to the Quinta. You can only purchase the ticket at the Quinta itself so no need to pre-buy. After grabbing our tickets we proceeded to the cafe to get a latte to amp up some energy to explore the regaleria. It was the right decision, as soon as you start exploring the property you are transported to a giant play area with secret paths, tunnels, castles and just about anything to bring the kid out in anyone and everyone. Although there were lots of people all throughout, it is so spread out that you often find yourself as the only people in a miniature turret looking out over the grounds or an underground gave with dripping stalactites. We went at the end of day so that may have also helped.

Allow plenty of time to explore, my wife wanted to explore all the nooks and crannies and see where all the paths and tunnels led. Like a child at the playground, it was great fun.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"This is an ornate palace with gorgeous gardens and secrets grottoes. We walked from the center of the village and it was about 20 minutes along a main road.

This building is SEPARATE from the main 3 (Pena, Moorish and the intown palace) so you pay at the building but we enjoyed this building much more than the others which we toured the next day.

The building is the final stop after a self guided walk through gardens and secret grottoes and a charming waterfall. Take a map so you do not miss anything, especially those amazing grottoes and wells. The building itself is the final thing to see and each room is amazing. There are also great views from this property.

They offer a senior discount and if you cannot walk from the train station (which I estimate to be 30 to 35 minutes), take a Tuk Tuk or cab---forget the busses which are really designed for the other sites and which seemed to travel in clusters with long waits in between.

Make this a definite on your visit to Sintra.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Absolutely enjoyed it. Who in his right mind would ever design a garden like this. Kids love it, adults love it. Don't forget to pick up a map when you come in. You'll absolutely need it. Do the gardens first and follow the paths. My favorite parts were the grotto, underground dimly lifted tunnels and the cascade and ponds with the stepping stones (I almost lost my balance) from here you can walk to the bottom of the Initiation Well. You can climb down coming from above but you can't climb up from here. Another favorite is the Ziggurat. From the top you you have a wonderful view of the Moorish Castle above. The ""Portal of the Guardians"" is also quite impressive. Apart from this and many other interesting objects the park is very well laid out with some very interesting plants.
The Mansion itself is beautiful from the inside, but I didn't find it awe inspiring on the inside, but still interesting. You'll easily spend 2 hours here and luckily it was sunny and not crowded at all. We enjoyed this as much, if not more, than Pena Palace.

The gardens and mansion were beautiful but found the Initiation Well a little bit disappointing as it was extremely crowded and a lot smaller than expected. Still a wonderful visit though!
We walked from the Sintra train station which was quite manageable (about 25 mins) but if you are planning on visiting Pena Palace in the same day it will be best value to buy a return/all day hop on hop off ticket for bus 434 at the train station (6.90 Euros) and get off at the first stop in town then walk from there which is much shorter and will take you past the National Palace as well.

I have seen a lot of reviews saying that it’s a 5minute walk from town, believe me, it is not 5minutes it’s around 12minutes with a few hills and ticket access is on the far back side of the castle. The Initiatic well is amazing!! Try to beat the tours, if you see a tour ahead try to go in front of them or wait behind. Lots of great sights!

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"The house is fine. They are refurbishing so it's not the best yet.
The gardens are quite fanciful.
Use bathrooms at entry.
We did Monserrat in the morning and Regaleira starting at 1.
Long line at Regaleira but it was worth the wait, and the gardens are so large that it doesn't feel crowded once you are in. (Well, we were there in April, so I can't vouch for summer)
The well gets a lot of press. There are many, many fanciful features here.

If traveling with children and you want to attempt 2 palaces in one day I would recommend the Monserrat first and this one second. The gardens and house at the first are enough to amuse a fresh child. The gardens at Regaleira have more things to peep into, climb on and laugh about. Would bring a hefty dose of motivating foods/drinks to get them to walk uphill (to the well). After that should be ok.
Restaurant here looked /smelled like fast food and was crazy busy with a dirty small bathroom.

The Initiation well which is where everyone wants to visit is a bit of a nightmare with even the smallest of crowds given the tight stairwell that serves two-way traffic flow.

Portugal,Seven Hanging Valleys Trail,4.0,"We started at Praia de Centeanes and got as far as Praia de Carvalho in 2 hours at a leisurely pace, with a short picnic stop. Turned round and went back because we didn't want to be on the trail after dark. Return journey took 1 hr 30 min.
The scenery is beautiful and intriguing: cliffs, stacks, sinkholes.
The path is quite rough, sometimes sand, sometimes clay, sometimes rock. A few places have well-made wooden steps. I would say not suitable for children under age 5, because of some steep bits, and because in some places you are walking quite close to the cliff edge. No toilets seen on the half we walked. I wouldn't recommend it when wet because some bits would be slippery. Probably best avoided in the heat of the summer sun, as there is not much shade!
But another day we will drive to Carvalho and walk the other half of the trail.

Portugal,Seven Hanging Valleys Trail,5.0,"Very pleasant and easy hike with breathtaking views. We parked our car at Praia da Marinha. Starting early, we were able to catch the magical morning light.

The trail splits here and there, but mostly rejoins a bit further on. Simply look out for the red-yellow signs, and respect the red-yellow crosses as no-go areas. Given the low season, there were no facilities along the way, so we carried our own drinks and snacks.

At Benagil beach we made an intermediate stop to rent a kayak. We hoped to visit the cave and have it all to ourselves (yes, that is very well possible in winter), but unfortunately the sea was just a bit too rough for that. Instead, we jumped on a 30 minute boat tour to visit this and several other caves. Mind that new regulations do not allow any boats to drop you off at the Benagil cave beach.

We continued on to the Alfanzina lighthouse. The actual trail continues on a bit further, but haven taken plenty of time we were fully satisfied. From the lighthouse, we walked into the village and called an Uber taxi to take us back to our car at Marinha.

They have a playground and a kart place where older kids can ride around I saw. My child not older enough for that yet next time when we come back. We had the chance to feed birds and the tortoise which is a good experience and great that you don’t have to pay extra most places you go to will charge you. The swimming pool was nice a good size baby pool and 2 adult size pools. So enough room for everyone. They also have a little slide you can go down. The restaurant was good great choice of options for everybody and decent prices as well. They also have mini golf. We didn’t try out not with our young child so that’s another thing to do when we return. Highly recommend this place and it’s not expensive for ticket.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"Highly recommended day out for kids of all ages! Animals appeared healthy and well cared for. The staff had good knowledge of the animals and the animal interaction show was lovely. Food was good and not at all expensive. Pool is gorgeous but not heated, so was too cold in February but a couple of people were brave enough! Still fine for a paddle though. As it was off season the flume wasn't open all the time but you could ask in the restaurant and someone would open it. There are a few sunbeds around the pool, but plenty of lawn if they're full. There isn't much shade, especially around the restaurant and pool area so I imagine it would be scorching in the summer. Worth bearing in mind if bring little ones. We enjoyed a pony ride for just €2 but this is only for younger kids. 10 year old was too big for the pony! She did the high ropes course instead and the man assisting was excellent. She has autism and was very anxious about the zip wire. The man was incredibly patient with her and very encouraging and reasurring without being pushy. He spent ages with her and in the end she decided not to do the zip wire (she did the rest of the course though) but he really was lovely with her. The ladies on the ticket desk/gift shop were really nice too. So cheerful and helpful and effortlessly switching between Portugese, French, English and probably others! In terms of getting there, it is absolutely in the middle of nowhere so you'll need a taxi if you haven't got a car. I think I paid about €17 from Albufeira.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We loved our trip to Krazy world.
We arrived at 10:30 & stayed until 15:30.
The park was very quiet and we loved it. Our 2 year old spent a long time in the nature garden and we felt very relaxed knowing we could sit back and let him play without watching for different exits etc.
The petting zoo is small but the animals are very friendly and will happily come to the sound of rustling animal feed (€1 a bag)
The lemur and animal experience talks were good too and all the staff seemed friendly.
Food at the cafe was a reasonable price and there was ample space to sit & eat.
Some families were in the pool which looked lovely but it was too cold for us (in February!)
The added touch of mini golf & bouncy castle being included in the price was good too as it was another way to fill the day without dipping into our pockets.

Overall I would highly recommend this place as somewhere to spend the day...but possibly only families with young children (>5)

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We visited in January and spent a full day here and had an absolutely fantastic day.

We arrived at 10am as it is shorter hours during the winter months. The lady who served us at the entrance was lovely and very informative. There is also an option to buy food for the animals at the Petting Zoo area. There is also a small gift shop.

We visited the animals first and saw everything from Prevot Squirrels, birds, Lemurs and reptiles.

2 of the male staff were brilliant and very informative and were absolutely amazing with our youngest son who is autistic.

There are opportunities to interact and feed the birds at 2 times as well as lizard and lemurs feeding and presentations which give you a chance to hold a snake and get your photo taken (there is an option to purchase these photos if you wish). The Lemur interaction is an additional cost but for €29.95 for max of 4 people, you can't complain. I should note that children have to be 8 years and older before they can interact with the lemurs, much to my youngest's dismay.

There is a restaurant there which is also cost effective and good food options as well.

There is plenty to do for the full day for all ages including bouncy castle, mini golf and play areas for younger children which were included in the entry fee. There are pedal carts, treetop trail and pony/donkey rides for an additional cost but again, not on the expensive side.

An absolutely lovely little gem of a place that we would all visit again and hopefully sooner rather than later. You will not be disappointed, even the teenagers had a great time.

The layout was poorly thought out and the signage was not enough.

I would say the pool area was more for locals who seemed to have season tickets and probably pays for the rest of the park.

It is a shame as there are some good animals although you can see most within an hour.

However because a lot of the feeding/petting times are spread throughout the day you may not be around long enough to experience them all.

If your family is younger, like ours, then this is the place to visit! It was a charming mixture of Zoo, children’s activities and Swimming Pool with Flume. It was excellent.

Our little adventurer loved the exotic animals. One of the kind zoo keepers even gave him a cast feather from a Macaw. He enjoyed seeing the dinosaur display - something he is obsessed with! Then he was delighted by feeding some very friendly Llamas. Rounding off his trip with a good swim and some lunch.

The facilities were good overall. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The animals were most certainly cared for!

Perhaps the only downside was maybe a lack of changing facilities for the pool.

The park is quite small and I was sceptical about the amount of time we would spend without boredom setting in but there was so much to do for their age as well as older kids (& without walking miles!)

There is a playground on-site as well as the various shows & a small pool area.

It offers great value for money-under 4s are free & we received 2 free entries for the next time we visit.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,3.0,"We had an enjoyable morning here with my 16month old, but even at push we only managed to make it last 4hours. The website and broucher are very misleading in the way it portrays the size of the zoo ect.

You can walk the whole zoo part in 20min easily. This is drawn out of your present for things such as going in with the birds (but this is only at set times) and animal talks... But despite them printing a daily timetable (therefore not effected by season) some talks didn't run dispite lots of people gathering - rather annoying.

The petting zoo is a let down, its a small circle path round lemurs and goats. They are fenced off so not really a petting zoo... You can feed them through purpose built small holes though if you buy bags of feed for 1 euro. You can pet rabbits but only open for 15min twice a day.

The pony ride is 2 euro for a 2min ride which is two laps of a very small field...

There is a bouncy castle inside which my little one loved to run off some steam but they only inflate it if weather is not great (we had mixed weather today).

The food is poor quality even with low standards of fast food you expect from these places, but it is edible! Reasonably priced.

You can get photos with snake or baby goat after the main animal talk... This is 9euro per photo of you choose to purchase it afterwards.

The water park is nothing like its bogged up to be in advertising... There's one water slide and a medium sized shallow paddling pool.

The whole place was clean, good hygiene and friendly staff.

I think older children would not be entertained for long but you can do a good half day with younger children.

For a small deposit, we hired golf clubs and really enjoyed the crazy golf course. My 10yr old also really enjoyed the small tree top trail and zip wire which was a small additional cost but worth the money.
Had it been a bit warmer we may have tried out the pool and water slide, there were people using it and having fun but we weren't brave enough!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"If you have been to zoos or parks in UK, do not expect much from here. We are an animal mad family and were all bored within about 30minutes. It really isn't worth the expensive entry fee. For a fairly small venue, the map is poor in its detail and the signage is virtually non-existant to tell you much about the animals or where to go. You have to pay extra for pony rides, extra for feed, extra for other activities. The lemur feeding listed should be down as a 'lemur talk'. To be honest, much of the advertisement of this venue is borderline false. There wasn't an obvious option to hold the snake, you cannot go in with the lemurs, if you miss the short alloted time to interact with certain animals, you have to wait until late afternoon for another chance and the food quality is very poor - presented without plates or cuttlery and the 'chicken' nuggets were brown/grey inside! I could mention the animal welfare side of things, but realise this is Portugal and different from home. Feeding the guinea pigs and goats was fun for our 1 and 2 year olds, but that was about the only highlight sadly. If the entry fee was lower, i'd say this venue is ok to pass a couple of hours.

The food is also really nice and very reasonably priced too and the staff are lovely and welcoming. It is a lovely safe place for families to enjoy their holiday.",Aug 2018
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Visited here with my partner and 7 year old daughter. As others have mentioned it is mostly Portuguese families here as I don't think it's advertised that much for tourists. My daughter loved it and wanted to go back again the next day. Theres a petting farm, reptile area, Lemurs, birds and more. To cool off there is a couple of swimming pools and big slide which she found great fun. The place is mostly suited to younger kids I would think. We arrived around 10.30 and all the animals were running around their enclosures, when we went back around 2 o clock a lot of them were hiding in the shade so harder to see. Just one issue, the glass on the tanks for the snakes could do with a cleaning as it was very hard to see them!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Great day out, kids were happy all day with the animals, pools minigolf, did not want to leave at the end of the day! Would definitely return if back to the Algarve. The animal keepers that did the interactions were really great and very knowledgeable about the animals.",Aug 2018
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,"The staff here is great and the activities okay. But it’s too busy during the summer months which ruins the experience.

Don’t count on a bed at the pool or a chair in the shade unless you are there when the park opens. The pool area is too small and too busy. The water slide that was promised to our kid only opened a few times. The mini golf is okay the animals are good too see for kids.

For our experience it was overpriced and we will never go back.

My advice: stay at the beach.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,3.0,"Visited here with my 4 year old daughter. 70% of people were Portuguese the rest were tourists. This was fine.

Cheapest entry fee is on their website. A bit confusing was you pay extra for pony ride, animal feed & quad bikes. All 3 can be got in the shop. Only a few Euro’s & I didn’t mind but it was a bit confusing going over & back & this was never explained.

My daughter loved feeding the animals. The manner of the person who we dealt with when organising the quad bike was not good. Not very child or adult friendly & English not great. Also when we went for the pony ride the person organising it did not speak to us at all & just called for my daughter when the pony was ready. A more friendly nature would be appreciated when dealing with tourists.

A nice day out that could have been better.

They still got excited about the zoo, multiple animal shows and crazy golf. Food was great and very reasonable. Very clean pools with a new water slide this time. An enjoyable day all round.",Jul 2018
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,"Awful place, the staff are as miserable as the poor animals that are kept in abysmal conditions and very small pens.

Quad bikes hardly work, pool is murky, the staff don’t look at you when they talk to you which I found incredibly rude especially as we have different languages. The catering staff went out of there way to serve locals before tourists.

Yes it’s cheap but it’s cheap for a reason, steer clear of this vile place.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"Visited here two years ago and had a great time returned today and had an even better time. Some people slate this place but I honestly think there is something wrong with them not to love it here. The pools have been upgraded and are set out really well lovely temperature and huge it has a water slide that my seven year old loved as he could go on by himself and we could watch him from the pool. We enjoyed looking at all the animals some new additions to last time. People have complained about dirty windows and other silly things but it didn't spoil it for us. Food was lovely good variety good prices. Lots of places to sit and eat or have a drink. A bouncy castle small petting zoo. Go karts and pony rides which need to be asked for in the shop. Toilets were clean there are lockers you can hire for €10 which you get back and sunbeds for the day two beds with umbrella €5 which is very reasonable. Gift shop is small but plenty of things to buy. All in all my 3 and 7yr old loved it

The zoo itself had a wide range of animals and yes glass is dirty on some of them but frankly would you go in a cage with an 8 foot snake to clean glass!! Harry had a great time feeding the rabbits.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,Was a great way to spend a few hours with kids. Feeding animals and seeing them up close. Getting hands on with snakes was a definite highpoint. Food is available at the restaurant area and its relatively well priced. There's a pool area too and mini golf so a whole day could be spent here quite easily. Some of the installations are in a little bit of disrepair but the animals seem quite happy and are clearly well looked after. 8/10 definitely worth a visit if you have kids that need to be entertained,May 2018
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Having read several of the other reviews we were a little apprehensive about this visit. We really shouldn’t have been. Sure - it’s not the greatest zoo in the world but it isn’t trying to be and it is a great day out for young kids.

My 3 year old fed the rabbits, held snakes, fed the tropical birds, rode a pony (2 euros extra) and was transfixed by the lunchtime animal show.

The cafe was fine and the animals appeared well cared for. We didn’t use the pool but it looked clean.

I suspect that older kids would find it rather limited but for toddlers it really is a good day out and pretty good value. We’d go back happily.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We went to Krazy World with our 2 year old daughter in March this year. The zoo was around 30mins tax ride from our resort in Santa Eulalia. The taxi fare was around Eur24 one way. The zoo is in a nice setting with lots of farms and green spaces around. There are lots of orange farms on the way to the zoo and I highly recommend buying some local oranges which are amazing. Due to the storm emma in March the zoo was a bit quite, which turned out to be good as it was relaxing atmosphere and we managed to see all the animals without queuing up.

We were given a chance to feed the birds which was a one of a kind experience. Our little one was a bit nervous but soon started liking the activity. We were given coconut shells filled with seeds and experience different kinds of parrots sitting on our hands eating the seeds off the shell.

Then we were given a chance to feed the guinea pigs and rabbits. I would advise to be very careful as these little beings can munch through carrot and if not careful your fingers in no time. Again it was a good experience for our little one who just loved it.

There are other animals like lamas, different species of goats, monkeys etc. The zoo is good size and things are kept as natural as possible. It does make sense as the animals feel closure to nature than having hi-tech enclosures with lots of signage etc. around it. There was also construction work going on to build what looked like water slides and a massive swimming pool. I am sure something like that would even appeal to more people.

Overall it was a good day out and I would recommend anyone with kids to visit.

No real large animals apart from the lamas in the petting zoo which you get to feed along with goats and sheep and was funny as they eat out of your hands.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,Obviously hit be the slump a few years ago. This once excellent reptile park has declined quite drastically. All the croc's and alligators the iguanas and other reptiles have gone. Only the big reticulated python remains and the crate it was delivered in is still in the vivarium after almost 10 years. Replaced by run of the mill mammals you can find in any land based college in the UK. They say you should never go back to places. I was so disappointed when I did two years ago. Date shown was well after my actual visit. Cant imaging it has improved much.,May 2017
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"We weren't quite sure what to expect, but I must say we were pleasantly surprised. All the staff were very nice, and the area itself was also fun. A little expensive for the entrance fee, although it is understandable with the animals they have to care for. The fee also includes the mini golf, for which in some places, you would pay nearly the same, so that's good. You must leave a ""bond"" for the clubs and balls however, which is returned when you return the equipment. We were there just before Easter, but were lucky to have brilliant weather. My 12 year old also did the arborismo (small climb and zipline) which cost €5. After the animal show the pool and new slide was opened, and both kids (12 and 5) absolutely loved it, going around and around the slide more than 30 times each! Food available was typical fare from these kinds of places/parks, which unfortunately we have all come to accept as pretty terrible, although some tourists appeared to be enjoying it. It is possible that you are allowed to take your own picnic/food, although on this occasion we didn't check. All in all a nice experience, and something different, as we have done aquashow and zoomarine in past years.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,3.0,"We went here with not too much expectation really. Brought an excited 3 Year-Old. It was extremely quiet when we arrived, but it was late in the season. When we looked on the website we saw Pony rides, cycle buggies, zip-lines and a dinosaur exhibition. Was very disappointed to find out, after paying almost €20 to enter, that most of those mentioned were extra! While our daughter did want to do everything, we felt that the entry fee should have included everything.

In saying that, we enjoyed the animals and the dinosaurs, and our daughter loved the bouncy crocodile but as others mentioned it’s not overly bouncy! Food was great, no issues there at all. The staff were lovely, all very pleasing and knowledgable. The animals were well looked after and healthy.

Yes, it’s not overly modern but we spent 5 hours there, having thought when we arrived that we’d be leaving in less than an hour, and on a very pleasant day have to say it was ok.

The animal presentation was really good. The pools are well kept but the water is very cold. We got picked up from our hotel (quinta pedra dos bicos) by a very nice lady from krazy world, on returning to our hotel we realised we had lost the babies jacket. We called the next day but it had not been handed in. The following day we woke up to a note from hotel reception saying krazy world had found the jacket and handed it to our hotel reception. So i would like to say a big thank you to the person that drove all that way to bring our babies jacket back. You are amazing.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"This is an “old school” type of zoo/ activity park and was perfect for our grandchildren aged five and twenty months. Small, clean, well maintained and easy to get around, with enough to keep the kids occupied for the whole day.
The animals are all used to people and are also very healthy and clean. The staff are lovely with children and ours fed birds, giant tortoises, rabbits and guinea pigs and came up close and personal with all sorts of reptiles.
Tired of animals? Try the fun 18 hole crazy golf, included in the entry fee, or maybe dip your feet in the lovely pool area. A donkey ride or go kart experience will cost a few euros extra but the food in the cafeteria was inexpensive so we didn’t feel at all ripped off.
This was as far from a Disney type experience as you will find, maybe not suitable for older children but perfect for young ones.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"I took my 2 year old daughter to Krazy World. I wanted her to pet a rabbit and see the lemurs, other than that I did’t have too high expectations.
We went on a rainy day which was good because there was not too many people there so we got some proper time with some of the animals.
We started with the turtle and my 2yo got to feed it some leaves which she really loved. The wonderful Marta took very good care of us and also let us go visit the guinea pigs and rabbits that we fed some carrots.
The lemur feeding was our next stop and it was nice watching them being active and interactive with the visitors. My daughter was a bit scared when they came flying towards the fence in front if us but it was all good fun.

We also saw the monkeys and birds and a goat. A nice experience for small kids but probably not too exciting for anyone over 7 years.

After lunch at the restaurant there was an animal presentation led by Marta that had showed us the turtle and rabbits. She was fantastic. There was a snake on show and a turtle and a big lizard and Marta interacted with all the kids remembering every kids name that she had met before the show. It was such a nice touch to what could have been mediocre, but Marta really took it a step above and made the kids feel part of the presentation asking them questions about the animals she showed.

After that we took a photo with the goat and jumped on the bouncy castle. My daughter had the best of days!

The place looks a bit run down, but what was important to me was that the animals seemed to be well looked after and their habitats looked properly cared for. I give Marta 5 stars and Krazy World 3 stars. I will come back though! :)

Well, we are all so glad that we decided to go!

Upon arrival we booked to do the lemur interaction; at €30 for 4 people you get to feed the lemurs, a printed photo, a USB with all other photos on and a free return ticket! It was an amazing experience, 100% recommend!

Yes there are extra costs throughout, such as feed for the petting farm... but for €1 you get a big bag and the pleasure of interacting with animals.

There is a big variety of animals to see and the zoos scheduled was planned well so you could definitely witness all the different animals being fed. There was no point of the day in which we got bored or felt there was nothing to do.The staff were lovely, any questions we had they tried their best to answer, and if they did not know they found someone who did!

The food was lovely and priced well! We sat and ate our lunch watching the reptile show!

I would 100% recommend this place for any family of any ages! And we will be returning again before flying back to England!

Myself and my wife and 4 year old son was pleasantly surprised. Entrance was around €45 which was a little pricey but everything is nowadays.

Lunch and drinks came to €21 which was decent. Even 3 ice creams was only €5.

It has animals, swimming pools and a cool crazy golf course as well as a small petting farm (mainly goats)

Yes it's a little run down and if I was to spend 8 hours there it may be a tad boring. But we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 hour time there.

Here I see people talk about bad shape and indoor stuff ..
The indoor has gone , they did improve maintainance , everything seemed in good shape now .
Entrance fee of 16,95 pp adult , can't remember kids price, is too steep for what you get , and then pay extra for a few little rounds on a pony , extra for mini electric quad bikes , pay extra to feed the rabbits and guiney pigs , on top of the entrance .
When we were there , the pool was open, but no option at just 20℃.
The rest is just not worth it .
We DID enjoy the live animal presentation, which was very good actually . Both portugese and English , and they had new born goats which were really cute !

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,3.0,"We visited here after looking at a glossy brochure and it sounded fab. We paid just shy of 90euros for a family of 5 of us for entrance and transfer there (€16.95 per adult €9.95 per child entrance then €8 each for 4 people in transfers and €4 for our 1 year old) some bits were fantastic but be aware of hidden charges. Feeding the birds was an additional one euro each then feeding the bunnies.... etc this was all after buying bags of food to feed the animals in the ""petting zoo"" part, so the cost soon added up. The pedal go karts were €2.50 each too. So the only thing actually included in the cost was looking at the animals and a closed pool area with slides. Which when your paying the equivalent to what you would at Chester zoo it just didn't seem like good value. When we arrived we were told our transfer was at 3:30pm after only having arrived just after 11am. We assumed we would get longer there but in the end we were almost grateful we didn't get until closing time as we were searching for things to do by 1pm. It seemed to us as though they just weren't quite ready for the season to start. The pool area appeared closed. The go karts we enquired about were chained up away from the track. The animals were good and we did enjoy feeding them/interacting with them. If you go be prepared to spend a lot of money over and above entrance costs. And maybe go later in the season.

Pony rides, go karts, quads, animal interaction all paid for separately. Children over ten charged as an adult so an expensive dip in the pool and round of crazy golf. Zip line and tree course too small for ours (don't expect Go Ape.) Ok if children are younger but then pool probably too cold for them at this time of year. Animal shows were entertaining. Cafe and food are nice and not expensive.",Apr 2017
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Having a 2 young young children (3&6) we have visited many places like this in the U.K.
This came out pretty well in comparison.
It isn't huge, but there's plenty to do, lots of animals to feed, pony ride, the show we saw was good, the play area is pretty naff, crazy golf is good ( the rickety bridge is a bit ropey though don't think health and safety has reached Portugal! Seriously hold onto them over this!!) and the pool area including a toddler Slide and big slide is great. The zip wire is good fun as well.
We didn't eat their food as we took a picnic so can't comment on that, all the staff we met were very friendly and everything was clean.
I read a few reviews on here before we went so lowered my expectations somewhat and was pleasantly surprised.
A nice way to spend an afternoon if they're getting bored of the beach!
If you're sat nav won't find the address (ours didn't) just set it for algoz and it's signposted from there.

All the pools were closed as it was only 19C and rainy but plenty to fill your day otherwise.

fresh lemons from the trees, surrounded by orange trees and extremely helpful and friendly staff who could not do enough. A great day out with our three kids aged 5, 2 and 2.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"I will start by saying that first impression was it had seen better days, but 'do not judge a book by its cover' and all that... it turned out to be a really good day out and not very expensive either. We spent the whole afternoon and brought a picnic. There were lots of things to do and the kids never got bored. Their favourite bit was feeding the animals, the mini golf and the big water slide (even though the water was freezing at this time of the year). There was also a bouncy croc, bird feeding, reptiles, poney ride (€2), mini quads (€2.50). All in all I would recommend a visit.",Oct 2016
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"Well, the staf was friendly, the animal farms was not very well treat, everything felt old, a bit lack of money to make it like the pictures on the webb!!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We came here for the first time this year with 3 young children (4, 5 and 7) and great for a day out. There are animals to see (and various shows during the day), a petting area (where you can feed goats, deer and llamas), a pool with a water slide (although slide was closed when we visited), pony rides (2€ a go), pedal karts, a bouncy castle and mini golf (included in price). Our kids loved it and worked out around 40€ for all of us so a great value day out. Tired in places and pool unheated so quite cold but ok for a quick dip. Food was basically snack bar food but was good value and did the job.

In summary a great, and wallet friendly, day out for families with young kids. Not as good as Zoomarine but less than half the price and we would certainly return.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,"I must question how this place gets reviews even remotely positive. Petting zoo is fine (couple goats and llamas) but that's about it.

Dinosaur exhibit with plastic dinosaurs on 'roaring' sound effects in the back ground. A turtle and a few snakes. Poor turtle could feel our pain.

Feed the birds time from 11:15-11:45 yet when we get their at 11:40 the girl grumpily exits with 3 kids and proclaims feeding time is over disappointing our little one. It's not like she was busy or overran with kids. Here's a bit of advice, if you are going to run a child based attraction at least have staff with some basic interest in kids.

Bouncy castle that doesn't bounce, terrible food and €1 amusement rides that you'd find outside any supermarket in the world. As for the crazy golf you'd have to be certified crazy to even bother with it. A blind donkey would make a better job of constructing the crazy golf course.

Thank goodness we had a hire car and didn't have to pay for a taxi to and from this place.

A pure racket. Save your money by not going here and instead bring the family to Zoo Marine or Slide n' Splash, even for a 2nd day if you've already been.

Worst attraction ever.

The pool and slide were bigger than expected and seemed to be used by mainly locals, and although we did not use the pool, I would say that you could make a day of it if you use the pool.

Petting zoo part was fun as we purchased a few bags of food for the goats, sheep, etc.

Worthwhile, especially for younger kids.

I was unsure regarding the welfare of the animals as enclosures are very small and water was not evident for the animals or adequate shelter from the extremely hot weather; some of the furry animals looked distressed trying to shelter from the heat.

been there this year for the first time with my 4 year old and 5 year old niece and they absolutely loved it. will go there again for sure.
in Algoz, not far from Albufeira the chicken roundabout :) and you will find a rural Krazy world. entrances can be bought online for 15% cheaper than on the counter, if you buy online do print it otherwise you get charged at the entrance for the printing ticket. as you go in you can buy food to fed the animals on the quintinha, a mix of bambis, goats, lamas. the girls loved the experience of feading and touching and seeing the animals live.
then we gone to the pool , rented 2 chairs and 1 umbrella for 5 eur a day, great value. we had lunch here and were really surprised with the quality and value of food, they definaltey do not over charge and in many water parks around the algarve.
in the afternoon we gone to see the cobras, pitton, the Cangurus and we actually were very lucky to see the baby canguru on his mum lap :) best of the day.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"This is great fun for kids under 12, and probably fun for those over 12 as well. At first, we thought that there was very little to do, and yet as the day went on we found time flying past, still with a list of things that needed completing. There are snakes and alligators, goats and deer, turtles and lemurs. There are opportunities to feed some animals and also the chance to hold a python, which thrilled my little girl. The food was reasonably priced and was tasty. There is mini golf and also pony rides. The main centre of entertainment seemed to be the pool. Most people turned up with swimwear and dived in, or at least set up a beach towel up alongside the pool. There is a slide and a bouncy castle. It appears that the attraction is to come for the bathing and then take breaks to go and view the animals etc... When viewed that way, it's an ideal place to take the kids on a hot summer's day. I'm giving it a 4 because my 6 year old daughter had a great time.

Kids enjoyed the treetop/zip wire experience and although they didn't go into the pool it was very popular.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,"I find it hard to believe that this place can advertise itself as a Zoo. We went here 10 years or so ago - and re-visited with our 4 year old grandson in August 2016. We thought - it cannot be as bad as it was all that time ago. We were wrong - it is pretty Naf. Very few animals, the animal show was very poor - consisted of 2 goats that were in no way trained, a couple of dogs that were in no way pudsey (this show was really poor), and they wheeled out a bird that flew from glove to glove and a boa constrictor where the guy explained the attributes of a snakes body. Believe me this was not entertaining at all - and our grandson was just plain bored. We also stupidly bought some food on entry to feed the animals and then found no animals that could be fed. Think there was a petting animal area at one part of the place but by the time we had seen the show and looked at the very few animals on display, we had lost the will to traipse around to find this. Animal food went in the bin and we headed for the pool area. This is actually not too bad and can say we spent 70% of our time (as it seems did everyone else) around the pool area. I am normally pretty positive about my reviews on trip advisor but this time around I cannot find anything to positive to say. The visit coupled with poor quality food at pretty high prices for lunch makes me advise people to better spend their euros on a different event! If you want a Zoo - try Lagos. If you want a pool then slide and splash, zoomarime or even aqualand.

My 4 year old like the moving rides like you see outside of Tesco and there was 2 of these there that caught her eye and at a euro each was fine. However the grinding and wirring sounds they made where not that of music and pretty tunes but of mechanical failure and wear and tear. So we went to look for/at the animals. I have seen more animals in my back garden, and I live in a maisonette..!! 30 goats does not make a zoo nor does the new plastic dinosaur 'attraction'. The inflatables (one dragon) wasn't working.

The park itself is very small, the crazy golf wasn't that crazy at all! There are animals, the ""feed the wallabys"" event where you can't actually feed them just go in the cage and stand next to them eating from a bucket. Then into the reptile house where most of the enclosures were steamed up you couldn't see them! The petting zoo turned out to be some deer, goats and rabbits that you could feed from holes in the rotted fence (which had rusty nails sticking out)

A leamur had a baby which it appeared none of the staff new about and there were two dead baby chipmunk type animals in the cage next door which I found a big shock that they had not been removed, they were covered in ants so obviously been a there a while.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"Just returned from a few hours at Krazy world. Ok I know it's low season but it shouldn't matter; if it's open it should be functioning to its best ability. It looks scruffy and tired, for example the cafe seating, the mini golf had hole 14 missing and hole 15 just wrecked and unusable. The whole golf course didn't make sense had to wonder round looking for the next hole! Pathways broken, uneven and scruffy. Reptiles looked uncared for in dirty tanks. The wallabies just stared at the wall for ages not even moving when me and my 2 noisy boys approached. The pens for the owl and buzzard were only 5-6 ft high and couldn't actually see the buzzard anywhere! One of the goats had given birth and the mess was all over the floor of the pen with no one watching over them, which I know we shouldn't interfere with but as a customer it's not something I really want to see? The llamas and goats looked ok. The cafe only had a reduced menu available, no pizzas. If that is what Krazy World are offering in February the entrance price should reflect this and I definitely feel like it wasn't worth what we paid (42€ about £33 ish for a family of 4) when you compare it to similar days out in the UK.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"i attended a children's birthday party at the weekend for 12 children and all parents. The staff couldn't be more attentive and the food was very good. Usual burgers, fish fingers, pizzas and a dish of the day, chicken and chips but to a good standard.
Many attractions close by, crazy golf, pony rides (although not at the heat of the day for the pony's sake), swimming pool and tube slide.
Animals to look at and a low key display of a snapping turtle and snakes and opportunity to have photos taken with the snake.
We arrived at midday and we're all entertained and relaxed in Krazy world until closing time at 8pm.
Well done and thank you to all the staff.
I have visited here with my family over the last 12 years regularly and have always enjoyed our time, it's not a huge place and I hope it never grows bigger, that is part of its charm. The staff really make it a pleasant experience with excellent customer service.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,"There is no animals in there! Some goats only.. Small size of a place! One swimming pool shared with both kids and adults! It was like 50 people around one pool! Very high price for a place like this! Last unpleasant thing was a ""home like pizza"" one an ad. Board! Worse than from supermarket! Normally I find good in bad situation, but here nothing good to point! Definitely not advisable!",Jun 2015

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Brought our three young kids to this today. A bit hard to find but well worth it. Tonnes for them to do throughout the day. Go early and enjoy all the activities. It's simplistic and feels far less slick or professional compared to zoo marine etc... But this is its charm. It's more like a family run pet farm with traditional and exotic animals, a decent pool and bouncy castles. However u wouldn't get the up close feel in the larger places - pony rides or a birds of prey show just for u. Overall I would highly recommend but don't expect Disney world.",Jun 2015
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"Algarve it has so many fantastic thematic parks, that this one is completely dispensable.
If you want to go to this park, go before to go to the others, because this one is a disappointment.
It’s basic, with few animals (reptiles). So, do not have very much to see, and it is little care.
Not worth the money , even though is the cheaper park in the Algarve.",May 2015
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,Pools were great. Cafe was great. But meeting the animals and getting photos with them in there enclosere was even better. You got to feed to farm animals and the birds .

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,3.0,"Visited Krazy World on the last day of our holiday and was quite disappointed. The park was very unkept, very dated and in places dirty. The animal enclosures were small and again not looked after. A few of the reptile tanks were starting to green. Pool area was the nicest thing about the park with sun loungers (again dirty) but available to hire. Staff quite helpful but on the whole, wouldn't recommend a visit.",May 2015
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,We have been to the Algarve about 20 times but never visited before. In April we decided to go and had a great time. My children are 12 and 4 and there was plenty for both of them. My youngest enjoyed going on the pony and feeding the animals. My eldest played mini golf and did the tree top walk. Staff very helpful and friendly. As an animal lover I felt the zoo cared for animals and their welfare.,Apr 2015
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We visited this zoo because the other attraction closeby (Zoomarine) was closed on Sundays (disappointing really!). But what looked like a smallish petting/feeding zoo at first turned out to be quite a great experience for our family of 3. My son loves turtles so he was very excited when he was able to feed a whole army of them before we even walked into the zoo. We paid a very reasonable price for entry into an Algarve tourist attraction and to be honest, didn't expect much for that money. After walking one round through the feeding area, feeding goats, lamas and chickens, we thought this was it. There was also an animal presentation area where nothing was going on at the time we were there and a crazy golf course that we didn't feel like playing on.

Almost by chance we then discovered a sign pointing us to a ""Exotic Animals Area"". We expected a small room with some snakes but went to check it out anyway. We were mistaken. The Exotic Animals area was huge with such a great variety of animals. We fed wallabys and exotic birds and my son was able to watch huge turtles in a nice and big enclosure. The animals looked like they were well taken care of and the staff made sure that not only the visitors were safe, but the animals as well.

Would gladly go there again! Definitely a low budget gem in the usually very expensive tourist area of the Algarve!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We had a lovely family day out at Krazy World, we've been to the area a few times before we had our daughter and were uncertain what to do to keep her entertained, and this was the perfect answer. It's not like a zoo you may visit in the UK, so go expecting a farm and you will be very pleased. There was enough there to keep us busy from 11am-3pm and if it had of been warmer so we could have enjoyed the pool we could easily have spent all day there. My toddler is at the stage where she wants to walk everywhere but is still a bit unstable, she loved running around the paths and getting up close to the animals. It was quiet so she could roam free without us worrying. She had her photo taken with a snake, a baby goat and a wallabie and fed some birds. Highly entertaining for her and us. We really had a great time and I'd reconmend it for families (we would have thought differently if we had come as a couple last year I think).

There were so many things to do, we loved feeding the animals, pony riding, go karting, tree climbing and enjoying a nice lunch together in the sunshine!

Staff were friendly and helpful, the animals looked well cared for and it was good value for money!

We will be back again to enjoy another lovely day I'm sure!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We loved this small zoo. When we arrived we decided to go the petting zoo area, for just 1 euro you can purchase food to feed the goats, llamas, deers and wallabies. There were plenty animals to see apart from the once I mentioned and there were baby goats which were really quite. Be warned the some goats can be a bit aggressive when try to feed them but none of the bite. We then walked to the Zoo part and we were amazed at the amount animals there was. There was some we had never seen or even heard of. There have scheduled interaction at the park and we got feed the wallabies which was really nice experience. The staff member that did that with us very kindly translated everything she said into English for us. They take picture of you which you can purchase at reception area. As we walked back to restaurant the same staff member from the wallaby stopped and told information about the lemurs which we though was nice of her to do. She also informed us of the animal exhibit show they have on lunch tome so we decided to watch that before we left. We ate at the park and food was reasonable the kind of stuff you expect. The show was really good and entertaining. It was done in Portuguese but the staff was aware we were English to translated the fact for us which we thought was very kind of him. Overall we loved this place and would recommend it, the level customer services from all staff was exceptional .

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We visited this attraction as nothing else was open due to it being the end of the season-so glad we did. We spend two consecutive days here.

We had the pool and the water slides to ourselves as the locals thought it was a bit cold.

There's a high role course, pool, slide, bouncy castles, crazy golf, as well as the animals. We held snakes and a crocodile, which the children loved.

The animal enclosures are a bit tired, however we thought it added to the charm. The staff were really friendly and the guy who does the talks and handles the animals was great! Spent lots of time teaching us about all his animals and showing us his scars to boot!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"Although the website advertises with price cuts during the winter season we had to pay the full price, even though we couldn't use the waterslides, pool. The offer only seemed to apply if you are a local resident. Two adults and one child paid €33,95 to enter a small and scruffy pet zoo with loads and loads of maintenance to be done. The place looks very old and worn down and the selection of animals is poor. To do the tree trail you are being charged an additional €4,95.
Last year we visited another zoo in the Algarve which was so much better than this one. Can't say anything else then this was our first and only visit to Krazy World.",Dec 2014

There are 2 pools free to use, with a simple but nice water slide.

There are family shows all be it small scale, as in parrot show petting zoo etc etc.

The cafe food for a family of 5 to eat lunch was 50 E total.

Have a walk round the mini zoo won't take long but go as many times as you like.

Age of kids in my opinion is geared up to age 10 max.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We found a leaflet for this place in our hotel. And I'm very glad we did. It's a small park but lot's of fun. I thought it was a very interactive park, they have a petting zoo where you can feed goats, llama's, deers and pony's. They also have certain times where you can go and help feed other animals. They have a cage where you can go an feed the birds, they will fly over and land on your hand. While the giant turtle was being fed my kids were allowed to go in the enclosure to help.

They also have tree climbing and pony rides that are very reasonably priced. They also have a swimming pool with a water slide for the kids.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"This great place kept a hard to please granddaughter soo..... busy. The staff go to great lengths to help, speaking in Portuguese and English. The feeding of the birds is a must. With a pot of seed, the budgies and parakeets flock round, and are really tame. A good photo opportunity. The prairie dogs are amusing, popping up all over their enclosure. All the animals we saw were in good condition, especially the petting farm, where the goats fed from the hand. The llamas were something a 6 yr old had never seen before, and also fed from the hand. We had to sidestep to avoid two hens and their brood. The pools are clean and well supervised with sun beds for weary grannies to rest. The water tube into the pool was very popular judging from the screams of laughter. Food was cheap and good, with a meal of the day for under €7, eaten in front of the animal presentation show, featuring a huge python which the kids could stroke, and a goat agility feature. Although quite tricky to find, it is well signposted. A really good place, we left with a load of photos and a resolve to visit again. Well done Krazy World, you have an amazing set up, or as my granddaughter would say - awesome.

First is in the middle of no where, and worth as a alternative against the crowd well known spots on sea side. But doesn´t mean is cheap.

It´s ok to spend the day on swimming pool, there´s a restaurant, nothing special about it, and beside that there´s a chance to visit the mini-zoo, to me is difficult to call that a mini-zoo, in fact is not well kept and to me was just a ramdom sample of animals, with no sense at all. Some of them not well kept as well!

If you around and and without high expectations, maybe worth the visit mostly for the swimming pool. But hardly will be a memorable experience for good reason...

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We have been going to Krazy World for about 4 years. Each summer we spend in Portugal some of our best holiday memories have been made there!! The place is a fabulous Zoo with the cleanest and most amazing amenities around. It has great shows which you are totally involved in and sometimes even get to participate in our dear friend Lucy got pulled onto the stage to have a snake warpped around her neck this summer which was totally memorable!! The petting zoo is full up with well taken care of animals that my 6 year old daughter absolutley adores!!! The bird feeding is extraordinary and the snkae and reptile house is great!!! My son loved the Zip line which is available all day for a small amount of money. There are pony rides and Quads and this year we had the pleasure of going down the greatest slide into the cleanest and loveliest pool!!! The food is fabulous and reasonable, the bar is chilled and as an adult on holiday going to a zoo you couldn't be more relaxed. It is sfae and clean and the staff are exceptional. The service is 100% and to top it off the Mini Krazy Golf is wonderful the layout and location of the Zoo is fantastic!! To be honest I could not rave about this place enough. I would recommend Krazy World to everyone IT IS A MUST if you have kids from any age!! I only wish I could visit it all year long roll on next summer so we can hurry back!!!!!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Great time had by all the family. Entry prices were good value €12 per adult, €6 per child although we got buy one child get one free and children under 3 go free so even better. They also give discounts for AFPOP members too so if you have a card don't forget to take it.
We were invited to go into the tortoise enclosure to have our photo taken with them which was a lovely opportunity but obviously there is a charge for the photos €8.95 each which we thought could've been a little more reasonable
There are plenty of different animals to see, especially reptiles, with an informative performance at 1pm and 3pm
Bags of animal food are for sale at €1 each for the petting zoo area and you can also pay €1 to stand in the bird enclosure and feed the birds
Food in the outdoor cafe is very reasonably priced and palatable.
The Treetops challenge was great, me and my 8 yr old both tried it and had a great time, again very reasonable at €5 each. 2 laps of the 'course' including 2 zip wires - what a rush!
There are a couple of pools, a small, shallow one with little slides for the younger children and a bigger fresh water pool for everyone else. And now there's a fairly big slide for anyone over 1.10 metres I think. You just need to be able to swim out of the splash pool area when you get to the bottom.
The Crazy golf course is getting a bit tired but still good old-fashioned family fun. It is extra again - €5 per person plus €5 deposit per club/ball but you get this back as long as you return the Club&ball
All in all a really good day out. I would definitely recommend a visit.

It didn't break the bank to get here and it has 2 pools, bouncy castle, quad rides(at a small charge) petting zoo, reptile zoo and a enclosure were you can go feed the budgies and parakeets.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"The only animals to see are goats, limas and a camel at the entrance, Hardly a 'zoo'. The place overall is very run down and in desperate need of tidying up. The mini golf was the only activity to do unless you wanted to cram yourself into a small pool predominantly full of locals enjoying a day out. The mini golf itself was very poorly maintained with a section unusable. With a 40€ entrance fee (2 adults, 2 children) we certainly expected to be there for more than an hour. Such a shame as we've visited so many fantastic places in Portugal.",Aug 2013
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We had a great day at Krazy World. It was fantastic.

Had a meal in the restaurant, pizzas were home maid and delicious! Will be returning next year.
Excellent value for money",Aug 2013
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,1.0,"Not worth the entrance money at all since the park is not well kept and you need to pay extra for the attractions inside, like a small pedal cars, going inside birds area, little train ride. Not a cheerful atmosphere, just a small busy pool and some animals.
We felt ripped off and will never come back, but may be it depends of what you expect.",Aug 2013
Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"After reading the mixed reviews on here we went anyway because it only cost 12ish euros for us (2 under 3's free and a bogof leaflet from continental supermarket).

We found it a good day out with the little ones. The animals weren't in tip top spotless enclosures but this is because they are wild animals! They was a good variety. Our little ones enjoyed the swimming pools and slides.

We didn't eat there so cant comment and took our own sun tent (else there wouldn't have been much shade).

Enjoyable day

Lunch was great
Pool was nice and they were building a slide.
Nice inflatable for the kids.
My three year old enjoyed feeding the goats sheep and deer.
The older kids weren't as impressed (11 and 14) but young ones had fun.
Wasn't expensive really so got what we paid for and was alright for a shorter day out. If we'd have gone there before zoo marine it would've been better but we were spoilt by then! Zoo marine is 5* in comparison but obviously more expensive.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"We were transferred from our hotel in Quarteria which took around 45 minutes. When we initially walked through the door and down to the exotic animals we were a little dissappointed and thought what are we going to do for a full day!

However, there are lots of things to do and for the price you pay to get in everything is very resonable, including the price of food!

My little girl had a go on the pedal carts and on the quad bikes, which were €2 a go, we paid for her to go on the pony ride (again €2) but she decided at the last minute that she did not want to go on it! The guy was very nice and told us to hold on to the ticket and if she changed her mind then she could go on later in the day!!

We bought food for the farm animals (€1) which she loved feeding!!!!

There is a bouncy castle there too, which she had the time of her life on!!

At around 1pm there is the animal talk, which is very informative, interesting and most of all fun!! The goats make the talker look silly (which I think is part of the act, but the kids loved it)!!! It is then followed by photo's, either with a goat or a snake. The price of one photo is €8.95 and the more you buy the cheaper per photo it gets.

We spent the afternoon in the swimming pool, there are three pools, one of which was closed while we were there (I think they were putting in a new slide or something) but my little girl is only 3 so we stuck to the little pool)!

All in all we had a fantastic day, please don't let the initial walk around put you off and go with an open mind!!

€9.95 for an adult for entry is a bargain for a full day of fun, I think they start charging for children when they get to 5 years.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"This place is a real gem with the feel of a petting farm with lots of activity benefits! Many of the animals are rescued and looked very happy and well cared for. When we went (April, price was worth it, EUR 9.95 adult, EUR 6 child over 5, plus you can get ""one person free"" discount vouchers in some supermarkets) they were re-doing the crocodile enclosure and reading an old review it looks as if improvements have definitely been made because the whole experience was very relaxing and such a refreshing change from the bigger theme parks. The fenced in pool was perfect with a separate shallow section for younger children, a deeper swimming section and a larger area where they are in the process of building a big water slide. There is also a bouncy castle, tree climbing, mini golf, go carts, small pony ride (go carts and pony ride were around EUR 2.00/2.50 extra), feeding the animals, wandering around the reptile house, strolling around past the camel, goats, sheep, lemur's, ponies and other animals, seeing one of the animal shows (more ""intimate"" than usual presentations with the focus on kindness and knowledge - the goat presentation was a classic and had all the children really laughing) and as it's fairly small everything is very handy with the atmosphere to just relax and enjoy while your children play...we have a boy of 2 and a girl of 8 and both loved it - there are also small coin rides for EUR1 like a helicoptor that goes up and down, Bob the Builder digger, a train and maybe one or two others that I can't remember. We took a pic nic but they have a cafe there. We actually went twice as we enjoyed it so much!

They have a few events during the day including animal feeding and a small show involving a harris hawk, snapping turtle, boa constrictor and a couple of goats (not at the same time - although that would have been more interesting!!)

In the warmer months they open up a small swimming area too.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"As always it is difficult to go to a park/zoo when you have smaller children in your group, however when we went shopping in the continente Algarve shopping during our first Algarve holiday, we grabbed some promo leaflets at the checkout(which gave us a 50%dicount) and Krazy world seemed to be one of the places we would like to go. Two days later we got into our hire car and drove to the Krazy world park. It was a nice drive looking at orange groves until we got to the entry. I had read some reviews on the park some good some bad and was curious how it would be. At the entry we got all the info about the animal presentations of the day and also additional information about activities which were not included in the price. Obviously the first thing we did was to get a nice place at the pool to have a base. We then went to the petting farm where we probably spent an hour as my kids could not get enough of feeding the pigmee goats. After that we went to the terra exotica where we had a look at the turtles ,snakes and also the enormous snake in the reptile house. The animals looked well cared for and the zone in which they were housed looked well kept. Now it was time to see the show and have some pizzas, the receptionist at the hotel had told us that the food at Krazy world was really great especially the pizzas which seem to be homemade. My wife and I had the dish of the day and the girls pizza with chips and it was lovely, I particulary liked the fact that when you ask a glass of house wine you actually get really decent wine. The show was educational and funny at the same time. It featured various elements as some reptiles and the pigmee goats which they called the lions,ha ha! The show guy also later did the pony rides and seems to be a real animal lover. We then decided to hang around the pool and the girls went to the inflatables , the pool water was pristine and the pool area was clean, could maybe need some more rubbish bins. To finish of the day we went for a round of minigolf and the girls also did the tree climbing(around 5 euros extra per child). We left the park around 5 o’clock . All in all we had a great day out will definitely come back next time we go the Algarve.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"We visited Krazyworld in May 2012 with our 3 children ages 6, 3 & 2 and they loved it. I read some very bad reviews about this place, in particular in relation to the care of the animals and I have to say I really disagree with what people said. The enclosures appear to be overgrown and muddy in places but in my opinion are more of a natural habitat compared to the ""clean"" zoos people are talking about. I think people tend to forget that animals in the wild actually live in the ""wild"" hence overgrown, muddy places.

They were talking about the care of the animals and how their coats were matted and the conditions were awful... what I witnessed was that their coats had mud on them and therefore looked a little dirty but overall in my opinion the animals looked very healthy and well kept and most importantly ""happy"" which is a lot more than I can say about most bigger zoos across Europe.

The whole place looked a bit simple compared to larger parks and therefore older kids might get bored but definitely for young children (under 8) I would highly recommend this place.

The snack bar was nice and the staff were very friendly. The crazy golf was basic but our 6 year old loved it. For the little ones they really enjoyed the bouncy castles.

The place was a little remote but I think this added to the character of the park and if you're like me and like the countryside, you'd say it was in a perfect setting. It is signposted from Algoz and was not difficult to find at all despite some of the comments in some of the previous bad reviews.

If you have small children, this is a perfect day out and I have no doubt they would really enjoy it. For older kids and in particular, teenagers, then to be honest maybe it wouldn't be for them.

Overall, I give krazy world 5 stars and will definitely be going back in May 2013 when we are visiting the area again.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,5.0,"Went there recently with a few friends to kill some time on holiday. At first we were not impressed as the place looked a bit run down and we were the only visitors (keep in mind this is mid january and it was raining hard!). Sat it the bar and had a few beers and something to eat, the staff were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. We were then told that as it was quiet one of the zoo staff would give us a tour of the zoo and explain a bit about the animals. This is where the place really shines, we were shown all the exhibits - the reptile house (crocodile numerous turtles and terrapins, komodo dragon, a 8 meter python, giant iguana etc) exotic animals (lemurs, parakeets, piranhas, squirrels). The man who gave us the tour of the zoo had an incredible passion for his job and knew A LOT about all the animals. Every exhibit was explained in detail and with a good bit of humour too which kept things interesting. Lastly we were shown a hawk and given a chance to handle the amazing animal and the keeper showed us a few tricks, giving us a handling glove, placing a piece of food on it and calling the hawk to fly over and land on the glove! Overall a great experience and not as fake and clinical as a lot of bigger zoos. With that being said i've noticed there are a few other reviews that mention the cleanliness of the enclosures - i think people forget that these animals do not live the the sterile plastic enclosures you see at larger zoos, in nature they live and survive in the mud and dirt so a hyper clean environment may look nicer for the zoos attendees but really doen't affect the animals at all. Overall a great zoo run by kind and attentive staff, Highly recommended!

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,2.0,"Our 3 year old had a great time. I think the play area, the pool, the pony ride, the food area etc are all great. There was an animal/ reptile show. The employee was friendly and knowledgable.

I wouldn't go back however....and most likely I won't recommend it to anyone.
I don't agree with their care of many of the animals- mostly the reptiles.
Today there was a plastic water bottle in the large turtle enclosure. Not really what I expect to see when visiting a zoo that 'cares for animals' (plastic garbage)
The snap turtles and alligator are kept in pretty dismal conditions. I understand that they live in a swamp when wild and can be quite sedentary, but at Krazy World it really came across as stagnant dirty water in a dismal cement pen.

What was most upsetting was the ostrich that was alone in a small enclosure. At this time there is very loud construction going on behind the fence that the ostrich is kept in.(Drilling etc) The bird appeared quite distressed. Again, I am not an expert by any means, but general welfare seems pretty basic.
Lastly, as we were leaving, I saw an employee dragging a screaming goat down a path, pick it up by the scruff of it's neck and throw is over a fence about 4 feet high. I did speak with management about this who assured me that care of animals is their first concern. Again, I have no experience with goats, but just viewing the handling of this animal was quite unsettling.

Many of the animals seem very happy and from what I saw, the staff seem to love working with them. But a good clean up of this park is needed- and perhaps a downsize of the animals kept?

I think Krazy world would be a lot better if they could eliminate alot of their animal 'issues' and focus on just having fun with an amusement style park and a small petting zoo.

There seem to be a lot of unhappy customers that find the animal care unsatisfactory. I live in the area and I know that KrazyWorld does not have a good name...I was hoping to see otherwise but unfortunately this didn't happen.

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"Hi everybody, after having read some good and some bad reviews about the park ,we, me and my family(wife and 2kids) decided to check it out ourselves. After a 15 min drive from Albufeira we arived at the park. After having checked in the boys saw the zipwire circuit and ofcourse I could not no they had to go on it and they really loved it. In the begining I was a bit worried but the guy who was putting the kids in the ropes told me that the lifeline was continuous and it was imposible for the kids to fall I was more relaxed. We then installed ourselves at the main big pool near the poolbar(chair rental 1.50) and went for a swim. Suddenly, looking at my watch, it was 12.30 so time for a bite to eat. It was actually a good idea to grab a table in front of the stage as the show with the animals was done on the main terrace and to be fair the show was quite funny with jumping goats and reptiles, also very educative. After having filled ourselves up with some jummy pizzas and megaburgers, we decided to visit the animal zones ,we first went to the petting farm where we fed the lamas and goats with some food we bought in the shop of the park, and then went to see the reptiles the other animal zone. I think I have never seen such a big snake in my life, according to the park around 7.50 m? Great stuff. Time for another swim and then on for a bit of fun on the minigolf circuits. After all this we left the park around six o´clock.

All of us together around 25 euros to get in as I had a free ticket from a local supermarket. The prices in the restaurant were very reasonable and the food was good. The zipwire I think was 5 euros per person for 2 rounds but the guy at the wire let us go more times.

The only downside of the park is that it is a bit rough around the edges,not extremely manicured
but then I personally like this unsterile look better, anyways the kids had a blast.

The staff was wonderfull, the homemade pizzas are to die for. The show with reptiles, falcon and goats was very funny and educational also. I could hold the snake and take a nice pic that includes a free entrance for the next time. Fortunately there are swimming pools as it was very hot. The entrance prices were good value for money, We will definately be going back next year.

Finding it is easy, finding anything good to say about it is much more difficuly. The car park is uneven unmarked and looking back should have been a measure of what lay ahead. The cost to enter was reasonable (if it had lived up to its billing!) Sadly it didn't. It was unkept, untidy, most of the animal pens were empty or desolate. The walks around were a waste of time as there was nothing of any interest to see. It was an amateur attempt to fullfill a professional image. It was described as a theme park, zoo, mini golf etc. DO NOT GO!! Waste of time and money.",Jun 2012

It was clearly signposted and we arrived at 10am when it opened. Entrance prices were good .We started off with a game of crazy golf which was good but could be revamped . We then saw the feeding of some animals and our kids were allowed into the giant turtle enclosure to feed them which they loved. The petting zoo was good to walk around and all the animals looked well cared for. The animal show was fun -the children could hold a snake, falcoln and a baby goat .The guy was very good and could answer questions. We didnt use the pool as the weather was too cold but this looked lovely and clean.
We ate lunch there , which was perfect and good value for money. There was a bouncey castle inside and one outside and moto bikes as well .

it was....tatty, cracked and brocken concrete paths; the reptile area was hideous, turtles and alliators living in stinking filth.
there were llamas, goats, peacocks living in tiny areas with no grass or shade which contrasted with the human areas which were spacious and green
The outside area was a mass of people sunbathing and splashing in a pool, fine except we had driven 30kms fromour own pool and garden and had really been looking forward to seeing the animals that were promised

Portugal,Krazy World Zoo,4.0,"We headed off to Krazy World filled with trepidation having read the reviews on Trip Advisor. However the weather was poor today and we needed something to keep our 6 and 3 yr olds amused. The lure of crazy golf and Europe's largest snake was too strong!

Alton Towers it is not. Windsor Safari Park it is not. Twycross Zoo it is not. But we all really enjoyed our day there. There are a few animals ""missing"" but the enclosures were tidy and relatively spacious. The golf course has clearly been refurbished over the last year or so. The food was reasonably priced and pretty good (pizzas and salads good, burgers not so inspiring). Eat outside if you can as the smell of cooking food inside is overpowering. Everything was very clean (cleanest loos I've seen on The Algarve!) and the bouncy castles (indoor and outdoor) were much appreciated by our kids. I daresay they do get hot in the summer but common sense would tell you to avoid them in the blazing sun. We didn't go in the pools but they were sparklingly clean.

I've no idea what the place is like in the middle of summer but at this time of year it made a change from the usual tour of beaches. The setting is very pretty too.

Final word on the staff - we had great service all day. The staff in the restaurant couldn't do enough for us.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"The Rabacal area is definitely worth a visit although it's very popular so don't expect to be hiking in solitude and it's a real pain when you get stuck behind a group on the nartow levada paths!

The drive up from Funchal is pretty steep and takes about an hour (rather quicker 45 mins back down). Reasonable amount of car parking but toilets only available by the cafe.

All the trails are well signposted so you really don't need a guide. Expect the temperature to be around 8 degrees cooler than the coast.

Most of the trails are pretty easy and vertigo free although there are plenty of steps. We walked for around 4.5 hours total, covering 12 miles and took in 25 Fontes, Risco and Lagos da Vento. The Risco waterfall is the most impressive and the shortest trail if you are time limited.

There is a very nice cafe with sandwiches, great cake and coffee options as well as some hot dishes. If you don't want to walk down (or back up both around 30 mins) there is a minibus service for 3 euro or 5 euro return.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"The carpark at the beginning of this walk is quite high and so we started in the clouds and rain, but on descent, the drizzle cleared up and it got warmer. Some of the path can become slippery in the wet, there are a lot of steps, but also a lot of flat sections. The waterfalls at the end of the path were worth the walk, but definitely worth going early before it gets too busy as the paths are quite narrow and the end point is not a large area.",Oct 2020
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"It’s a linear path that takes about 2 hours down, 1 hour back. The first (and last) 2 kilometers is a steep paved narrow road with nothing much to see. It’s hard on the knees to make the very long decent down to the waterfalls that are pretty but not that impressive. I’ve been on better trails and this one is highly touristed. The scenery in a couple of points was lovely, though.",Sep 2020
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"The 25 fontes hike and the hike to the cascada da Risco are two different hiking trails. You can combine them very easily as they are linked together.
Go very early in the morning here. Then you have the trail to yourself, including the waterfalls. And it's not that hot yet. After 11AM the day tourist will come and the trail will get more crowded, especially in the summer.
This hiking trail you can easily do yourself. There is a parking space at the start of the hiking trail.",Sep 2020
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"I was doubting if we would do this walk because I read it could be busy but I also read everywhere that you should do this so we did :)
It was a nice walk and when you come in the morning it is less crowded.
We walked to the Cascada first and then 25 fontes.
It’s a lot of stairs and when we visit (August ‘20) they where working at the road to 25 fontes.

We walked down and took the bus up to the parking lot, would recommend that :)

It is an easy walk only lots of stairs. (When you go to 25 fontes)

Booked through Book-it-here! Good price and guide, Danilo, was friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be planning another trip to Maderia as well as another levada walk 😊",Mar 2020
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,Rout along levada is joyful. It is nice way how to spend some time in nature. You had better avoid group trips.,Jul 2019
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Beautiful hike which both an 8 year old and a 6 year old enjoyed.
First it is 1,5 km walk (possible with a bus for 3 euro) downhill on a road before the hike starts. 5 km return to 25 Fuentes (steep stairs here and there), and then it is possible to make a quick easy 1,6 km return to the waterfall.

The cafe by the bus stop is great!",Feb 2020
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"Easy and leisurely walk where you can enjoy nice scenery. I went on a guided tour, and there was a lot of breaks where the group got to learn a lot about the history of the Levadas and different species we passed along the way. It was quite interesting, and nice to share the experience with other random travelers from around the world. The highlight of this walk was the surprisingly beautiful waterfall, where we had our lunch. I would have stayed here longer if I could, but since this was a guided tour we had to move on after halv an hour. If you want to walk fast without breaks, or enjoy the waterfalls as long as you want, I recommend walking by yourself. Bring food and good clothes, it was pretty cold to walk there at this time of year.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"First of all, most of the walk is not even beside a levada. If you start at the large parking lot, the first 1.5 kms are all downhill on a paved road. Then there’s a set of steep, rock stairs that takes you to Rabacal. Here there’s a restaurant with outdoor patio & cheesy outdoor washrooms. Next you walk on a narrow dirt road then a long descent down more steep stairs into the canyon. You still have not reached the levada though. Somewhere here the trail splits and you can choose to go to 25 Fontes or Risco. My suggestion is head to Risco. It’s shorter and the falls are more interesting.

However if you continue onto the 25 Fontes, you will have more stairs, both up and down, with only a few viewing points as most of the trail is brushed in with native Heather. Once you reach the end there is a disappointing trickle of a waterfall (Jan 2020) within a pretty box canyon. This is an in and out trail so now it’s time to head back and it’s up, up, up lots of stairs and after Rabacal all uphill along the 1.5 km paved road back to the parking lot. No gov’t bus appeared the day we hiked although others have referred to one in their posts.

Contrary to what others have said, there is no steep drop off on this walk. Perhaps it’s because they have a detour which may be around the part that was dangerous.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"Very nice walk, but there is many more beautiful Levadas in Madeira. This one is very easy, with a rewarding waterfall (if its rain season). Its totally crowded with tourists even in off-season, we visited in november and there were very big groups of people from tour-buses, wich are hard to pass by. The path is narrow, that mean you will spend half of the time waiting for people from other direction to pass by. Its propably because its easily accesible by car. We visited many other Levadas wich were more calm, with beautiful views and we had much better experiences in Madeira than this. Feel free to skip this.",Nov 2019
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This is amongst my top favourite walks in madeira, because it's short and has a little secret at the end ( the end as far as I'm concerned is the waterfall)

Yes you will need to walk down on the tarmac road to get there.

Yes there is a mini bus that will take you back and forth for a price. Kinda spoils it all tho.

Yes there can be a ton of tourists, so choose wisely when to go, early morning. Or do like I've done and go when its raining (you will be the only one there )

Make sure you have walking shoes and bring a picnic, once you arrive at the waterfall it's a great spot to get a bite and soak in the surroundings.

The path is easy on the foot, safe and sturdy. Like every walk in Madeira, dont be stupid and just take your time .

Now.....once you get to the waterfall you will be amongst one hell of a secret!

At the base of the fall there is a natural pool, jump in and stay still .....(it will be cold but it's worth every second of possible hypothermia ) besides feeling feral and extremly invigorating you will feel a little nibble on your feet.

Dont freak out, its Trout as in the fish. I estimate there are over 30 living there no idea how they arrived but they are thriving in this forgotten ecosystem.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We loved this hike, it is well signposted as long as you have a hire car to get to the start point you do not need a guide. The car park is easy to find & free, there is an option to get a bus from the carpark to the start, but we walked it. It was steep but enjoyable down al road. The start point is obvious if you are walking to the start you will see other trails, ignore these and keep heading down. At the start there is a cafe and toilets. The walk is lovely, beautiful and green you walk along the levada and the entire route is signposted. We started early and I would recommend this as the path is narrow and would be annoying to be stuck behind others, we saw a lot of people on the way back and the car park was full. We were the only ones when we reached the end and managed to get a quick swim in the water, it was cold! But a great experience!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"We visited the trail in low season, yet there were still many tourist groups walking. If you wanted to enjoy the nature you should try to surpass the crowds and first visit the 25 fontes and cascada da risco later (groups do it the other way). There is also an option to make the first 2 kilometers in some kind of a minibus for a fee. There was lot's of water and mud on the road, so good schooes that do not slip on wet rocks is a must. The trail itself was very enjoyable, though the crowds can make it a bit less so.",Nov 2019

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This was a beautiful levada walk for myself, my boyfriend and my mother. If you don’t want to walk to the starting point there is a minibus shuttle (we walked down to the start, and two of us shuttled it back up the 2km of uphill at the end).
The walk is all well marked and there seemed little need for a guide. Start early to miss the coach loads of people as the levadas and adjacent paths are narrow in parts. The waterfalls themselves were still picturesque even if they were not gushing (none however were completely dry). We really enjoyed the different views, the vegetation enclosed levadas and the ones open to the hillsides.",Nov 2019
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,".......but don't hold your breath in anticipation of waterfalls, even in November.

In fairness we undertook this mainly for the walk, which was moderate difficulty and length.

You can knock off 1.5 of the 4.5km by getting the minibus return from the carpark area - we didn't

Also in fairness, our experience is very fortunate to include waterfalls and fountains from the Brecon Beacons to Morocco and from Sri Lanka to Vietnam and so the end result (mid point really as you have to walk back, obviously) was not impressive.

If you want a good medium walk (no boots reqd when we went) with some pretty scenery then I wouldn't want to put you off

If you want breathtaking waterfalls, don't bother.

For 3€ a van will take you to the start of the trail or you walk the 2km. No real walking gear necessary but a good physical condition for the long stairs leading to the actual path.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We started and ended the hike from a different point than all of the excursions, as well being different from most of the tourism literature. After taking this route, I am certain this is the best way to take this trial as well. We started at the Wanderparkplatz /Parque estacionamento levafa do Risco parking lot on ER211. Definitely start your hike at 07:30 for the best experience. From this point you walk through cloud forest for a short distance, then along an open space on the side of a very scenic valley. The best part (if you have an adventurous heart), is when you pass by a Levada maintenance shed, and straight into a tunnel through the mountain about two kilometers long (you can’t see the light at either end for the middle third of the tunnel). This definitely a trek that requires bringing a flashlight, we brought headlamps, and had a blast. You are treated to a wonderful waterfall configuration upon exiting the tunnel. This trail is relatively flat all the way to the 25 Fontes waterfall, with the exception being an amazing water stair bridge system just before the falls that has a short set of stairs, and is very beautiful. We were the first visitors that day to the 25 Fontes falls by starting early, with a few folks showing up as we left. Along the way to 25 Fontes there is a trail that climbs 300 meters up stairs to another flat Levada that leads to the even more dramatic Risco Falls, and the Rabacal house which is a restaurant and gift shop, as well as a trailhead hub for other places. We did this part after leaving 25 Fontes, and were able to see this part and get the climb part over with in the middle of the hike rather than the end like everyone else who usually start at the Rabacal house area. This ends up being a non strenuous 6 mile hike through a wonderful area of Madeira.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We really enjoyed this hike. The walk down from the parking lot is about 2kms and all downhill (there is a shuttle you can catch back up). It's not a long hike at all and also relatively easy; generally it's flat as you walk next to the levadas and where there are drops next to you, there's rope to keep you on the path. We got there early; there was only one other couple, which was lovely. When we were walking back, we passed many, many tourists. Our time at the waterfall would have been crowded and much less enjoyable had we arrived any later. So, top tip - arrive early!",Jul 2019
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,Difficult hilly terrain in parts and narrow ledges to walk along. Strongly recommend doing as part of a guided tour. Its a long walk and has steep steps in short stretches between the levels. There are some really great views and picture opportunities. Much cooler than rest of the island so should take appropriate footwear and layers.,Aug 2019
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"Maybe since we our coming from Switzerland, were disappointed when we reached the fountains. We espected much more.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We had the pleasure to have the carring, fun and informative Rubina as our guide at this 11 kilometers walk.
We started on the top ( on a mountain - I can´t remember its name ) in a cloud and could not see anything. The first thought was - hmm, am I going to see anything in this fog?
But slowly we descended through the fog and magic did happen right infront of our eyes. It is hard to describe the nature on the Levadas in general. Sometimes it is like something straight out of a The Lord Of The Rings scenario.
You need to eperience it.

Remember good footwear, remember to pick up your trash, watch your steps and remember a jacket. It can get a bit chilly at times. And remember to enjoy the silence.
On our trip, there was a girl (with heer parents) at the age of 10 or 12 and she could manage this walk.

I can only recommend this trip and the guide.

Beautiful scenery and the waterfall at the end is simply marvellous. In contrast to others on here I wouldnt say you need to have done any sort of regular hiking to do this walk, so long as you are steady on your feet. That said, a lot of steps and a bit tiring. Think it was about 5k in total there and back - you walk mostly back up the same track you came down. Most importantly GET THERE EARLY! Thankfully we did, and was so lovely and peaceful. Honestly would have been completely ruined if bus loads of tourists were in the way the whole time - a lot of the tracks were very narrow so there would have been a lot of waiting too. To give you an idea the first wave of people seemed to arrive at 10.30ish so I'd say aim to get there before 9!

The walk is hard and takes a good 2 hours from and to Rabacal. At Rabacal there is a lovely restaurant with delicious food and a nice bathroom.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"This trek is one of the most advertised ones on the island! However it is not as great as we expected. It is nice if you have the time but both the walk and the waterfalls were relatively mundane compared to other sites on the island. The walk to the waterfalls is basically the same views the whole way, i.e. trees and waterways, and you are basically staring at the back of the tourist in front of you the whole way as this trek is popular. Once you get there the waterfalls are nice but not really worth the time and effort to get there. Unless you need to spend some hours outdoors.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Two of us completed this walk on a March afternoon, we had a guide book and didn’t use an organised tour.

You can use a mini bus at the start to take you down the hill but we decided to walk. €3 one way or €5 return. To see the Levadas up close was wonderful and the engineering involved very clever. It was busy in places and we had to squeeze past people on the narrow paths holding onto a handrail. I wouldn’t recommend this walk if you suffer from vertigo as some of the drops were very steep and the path narrow. The 25 waterfalls weren’t really dramatic but the whole experience was worth doing to see the stunning views from the path. Some of the pathways are uneven and slippery when wet so good walking shoes are a must. We finished the walk back to the car park by walking up the long road. I’d recommend taking the bus !

Shortly - levada is a kind of stream running horizontally in an artificial stream bed, designed by engineers to distribute water across the island. You need to experience this irrigation system, which now creates long paths across all Madeira. Some of levadas lead to such amazing places, like 25 fonts, where you see a lot of small streams trickling down on volcanic rocks. It is quiet (at least in Jan and Feb) and beautiful place.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This was absolutely the best trail we took in Madeira. This is how I understand llevada - walking by the stream, beautiful views, moderate exercise. Arrive early in the morning, so can avoid big tourist groups. There's a shuttle bus for 5 EUR return to the bistro where you can join llevada. It's not really necessary to take the ride down the valley, as you still have energy and can enjoy the views around. On the other hand, ride back to the parking might be a good choice. I recommend to start with llevada 25 Fontes, because it's longer and for some reason tourist groups go to Risco waterfall first, therefore it'll be easier to actually walk the llevada. The paths are very narrow in some places and in some spots you might need to walk in the water. Good sturdy shoes are a must! On the other hand, Risco waterfall is only less than 1 km away from the bistro and the access is much less demanding than 25 Fontes.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"One of the many Levada Walks you can do in Maderia. But 25 Fontes, or the so called Rabacal, is one of the few things that worth booking for a guide in Madeira. That's because going there is a bit complicated if you are new to the island.

It is a nice 5-6 hour walk with no great denivelation and once you visit this place you can easily said that you have been in the paradise. The views you will see are the same as what is advertised on the brochure and even better. It is fascinating how they managed to make tourism out of simple irrigation system.

It's nice to have hiking/trecking boots for this one, but a pair of sport nikes or something like will help you too. You won't really need walking stick, but I managed to find a good piece of wood that can help my walking. In my opinion a must do trip while in Madeira.

The walk itself is rather easy; the trail is mostly flat, but some steps are required. Including the initial decent from the parking at Rabaçal, it took us about 1.5 hours to reach the Risco waterfall (at 13:00). We were very lucky, as the entire viewpoint was vacated! This in contrast to the descent to the 25 Fontes levada, which was overcrowded. In fact, the trail along the levada includes some very narrow, slippery spots, and we were all queued up... To add to that, people constantly needed to pass us on these very narrow places, requiring us to jump over the levada/lean back into the somewhat deteriorated safety fencing. While this does not make the levada dangerous, we were appalled by the sheer amount of people on flip-flops, taking pictures while walking and messing with each other. This, unfortunately, is what makes the levada perilous. Therefore, we strongly advise to start early and avoid the masses to experience a quiet and safe walk. Including our breaks, it took us about 5 hours from start to finish (as we did not take the mini-bus).

They have far superior grip to runners, but not as cumbersome as hiking boots. I wore them hiking for 7 days in Madeira and was happy I did! WE were alone at the waterfalls which was priceless... and a perfect spot for a picnic. Always worth getting up early to avoid the crowds! (we drove here in a rental car). The way back was quite a bit more congested and felt more touristy. Lovely hike (especially if you grab the shuttle!)

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"I have to admit I am biased... I love lush green vegetation a lot and this hike has lots and lots of it. The clifs are not as scary as the ones on Pico Ruivo, but the levadas and the vegetation really makes up for it. The walk itself is not that hard, just mind your step. Also keep in mind the weather might be moody. We ended up in an annoying drizzle and we were dressed a light bit to light. Maybe keep a pair of long shorts with you just in case you feel cold. As for the waterfall... it is spectacular, but it gets pretty crowded which spoils some of the charm. Bottom line - this is my nr. 1 trail to do in Madeira.",Aug 2018
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"Reviews are fair, tad busy although if you have a rental car you can try and be ahead of the crowds by getting their for 9am so avoid the “queues”. I was a little nervous about driving there but it was absolutely fine, we parked in the car park and walked down and back up which was a nice little exercise - do make sure you were trainers or hiking boots! Beautiful hike and both the big waterfall and the 25 are worth it.",Aug 2018
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Perhaps the most popular levada hike on the island. You walk along the levada for a while, generally in the shade. It's a narrow path with a pretty steep drop off on the side, and it can be a little tricky when you come across others going the opposite direction. So, at times can feel slightly perilous, but nothing too bad, and the hike is not difficult. The waterfalls themselves are nice, but the real highlight is just walking along the levada though the rainforest.

It's crucial to go early and beat the crowd. Seems like if you get there when everyone else does it can turn into essentially just a long line. We went on a hike with Hit the Road Tours and that was great.

Steep stepped descent to the levada, then more steps up to a straightforward but surprisingly rough walk to the ‘fountains’. Worth it, my son had a swim. I saw people in flip-flops and lots of kids, but really more of a hill-walk than an afternoon stroll.",Jul 2018
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,2.0,"Booked this walk through DG Travel in Funchal - me and my wife are 67 and brought no walking boots just trainers - we were assured these would be fine and the walk was classed as easy. This was O.K. up to the point where you can view the waterfall which I must say is amazing. Then you descend down some very steep uneven steeps, where my wife tripped jagging her right ankle into a crevice and breaking her right ankle in 3 places and severely spraining her left ankle. Now can I say the tour guide and rescue team were amazingly good that is not my point. This incident as you can imagine made our Holiday a nightmare and I think more information should be given at the time of booking, this is a dangerous walk where several people have lost their lives. Don't just take a booking to make the numbers be honest about the walk.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This “Levada das 25 fontes” is amazing; I would consider it difficult due to how much you need to go downhill and then uphill. I recommend to use the bus for only 5€ both ways. You save a lot of time and a lot of effort - this way all of your effort goes to the good part, where you can really appreciate the nature!
Another thing, go earlier to enjoy it more due to less people.",Jun 2018

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,Stunning scenery along this walk but much care is needed along the latter sections as very narrow and wet paths with sheer drops - there was an accident whilst we were there and rescuers rushed by us with stretchers (a lady had fractured her arm). The downside to this walk is that it is very popular and so very busy.,Jun 2018
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Oh yeah, another hike, this time to see the famous waterfalls. Thought we might go whale watching today, but the whales have been shy this week. So instead we drive up roads so steep it creeped me out, arriving in the clouds with perhaps 10ft visibility at times. Down into the valley, very wet and chilly, we walked the 25 Fontes Levada. Levadas are like a webs of water channels covering the island for irrigation and erosion control. They make perfect hiking trails. This one is through tunnels of heather - tree heather. Who knew? We were continually surrounded by sounds of rushing water and lovely song birds, and occasional Brits with their great sense of humor. So many water falls! A local guide with a small group spotted us- “I saw you yesterday on the picos hike!” He was a pistol. Taunting us to go further he sent us up through a “shortcut.” We literally climbed up a ridic steep slope by grabbing and stepping on tree roots almost like a ladder. Behind us the whole way he was yacking- “...let’s go! It’s easy!” We got to the big falls, the big Risco falls, and his group finally shows up. That rascal. Worth the adventure though. Yesterday the fitness tracker showed we climbed 149 flights 😣. Today was only 33 flights, helped my legs from locking up from yesterday ya know? Had a great lunch complete with lemon meringue pie at a cute cabin at the trailhead. And suddenly we hear, “Wut!? You guys are haunting me!” It's the guide. So we spent some time getting to know him while he corrected my Portuguese pronunciations. Back down the mountain and there was the sun, having a good laugh at us. Beautiful ocean evening. But the best was dessert. The waiter asked if he could give us a special Madeiran wine with dessert because he heard that at the signing of the American Constitution they cheered it with a salúd of Madeiran wine! Why yes, Madeira is a special part of American history 🤗! It’s always about who you know - connecting.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Get there as early as possible to avoid the crowds. The hike was beautiful, you have to start at the top and walk down a windy steep paved road (that a tour bus will go down if you choose to do that) and then it turns into a trail where you are walking next to a levada for most of it. Lots of beautiful views and waterfalls along the way and then a big one at the end, and then you have to come back up. It's a little slippery walking next to the levada, so much better without the crowds. The trail head was in a cloud when we started so it seemed really rainy and gross, but as we descended it got a lot more pleasant and the weather kept some of the crowds away. Definitely worth doing just get there early!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,The trail gets very crowded and requires patience and good balance. We did it on Monday morning and it was busy. The viewd are breathtaking and the experience is very much like a jungle/mountain hike. Great for body and mind. The sound of waterfalls and rivers surrounds you. Get ready to climb stoney stairs on the way to 25fontes and don't get scared for vertigo. In some parts the trail is very narrow but there are protective rails along the way.,May 2018

From the car park at the ER110 the return walk is approximately 6.4 km but, as others have described, it is possible to truncate the walk by taking a taxi shuttle at the start. We did not do this and the walk was still easy. The 25 Springs walk was listed separately in our walking book, is signed separately, and is described in our guide as being a little more demanding. The Cascata do Risco was relaxing, undemanding and a sight worth seeing. As others have cautioned, this is a popular spot so don't expect to be alone!",Apr 2018
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"The walk was lovely, not too strenuous until the end when you have to walk up a hill for about 1km. But the 2 waterfalls are well worth it. There is also a steep long road at the start of the walk but you can get a taxi back to the car park which cost €3 and the last taxi is at 6pm.

Do not expect to see 25 big waterfalls. In train no there is one big massive waterfall but is worth the walk.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"It was a cloudy/misty day when we took this walk, but the weather turned out to be perfect for a day of hiking. It was not too warm, even though the view could have been better if the sky was clear. Would not recommend to take this hike when it's raining since the path is a little wet and slippery already. Wear good shoes and proper clothes! Also bring a torch, you have to go through a dark tunnel at the end of the path.

We went on a guided walk since there's no public transport and the roads are quite bad. The driver picked up us at the hotel and drove us there and back home. A very easy and comfortable way to get to the levada. He picked up us around 9 am and we were back at the hotel around 5 pm. The walk takes around 3 hours, with some pauses and photos. The drive is about 1 hour each way + a stop at the local café where you can use the bathroom or buy something to eat.

The views are beautiful and breathtaking, especially the huge water falls and the lagoon. What's great with this trip is that you walk one way down and another way back, so you don't have to walk the steep and heavy path back up to where you started. It's also OK to know that there's a lot of people at this levada and we often had to walk in a long queue.

Every 20 minutes a shuttle bus takes you down to the restaurant and trail head. Just wait by the gate and the bus will show up. We paid 5 euros for the round trip and were glad we did. It saved us several hours, we could spend more time at the falls and go on and do something else in the day. ( continued on to Porto Moniz- from Porto Moniz the road is very good all the way back to Funchal mostly through tunnels) the walk is very pretty, mostly level and is 1.2 km to the falls the trail ends at the falls. It used to continue but part of it collapsed on the other side so now it is closed off. The falls are worth the walk. Afterwards a new restaurant has opened at the trail head. Prices are expensive but it is a very nice place for a pastry or a drink with very polite staff. There are great washrooms inside for clients and public washrooms just under the restaurant for hikers. ( no toilet paper there).

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"Did this walk with 'walkwithemmanuel.com a great local guide. please see other review.
To avoid confusion.. there are not 25 waterfalls along the walk, but two main great spectacular falls....Risco and the 25 waterfalls which is actually one main waterfall and 24 other little ones around it (try and count them!)
11Km in all with some good long downhill and straight lengths, incorporating a 1Km long tunnel. Vertigo people may have difficulty as may also those with knee and hip probs due to a 300m section of step irregular stony steps.
DO visit during/after rains as that's when the falls are more powerfull.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"The 25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco walks are well worth doing. Of the 3 levada walks we did in Madeira (the other two being the Caldeirao Verde and the Ribeira da Janela) this had the most impressive waterfalls.

The 25 Fontes walk is considerably longer than the Risco, with more up and down but it is well worth doing both as Risco has the larger falls.

Some points to note:
1. There is no public transport up to the walk so you will need a car or to take a tour.
2. Whatever you do, do not drive up the ""ER211"" road. It is not a road, more of a badly paved track full of potholes, up a steep mountain (1st gear required in our hire car!).
3. To get to the start of the walk there is a half hour walk from the car park off the ER110.
4. During this walk we had to cross quite a strong stream. This involved removing shoes and socks and rolling up trousers and was probably half a dozen rather cold steps! I don't know if this is just because there had been a lot of rain or whether it's always like that.
5. There is a shuttle bus from the car park down to the start of the walk which is much quicker (it overtook us a few times) and avoids the need to take your shoes off. It's €3 one way or €5 return
6. The walk was surprisingly busy with large groups even in January.
7. You will likely be mobbed by some incredibly confident/cute/annoying finches (depending on your point of view - I thought they were great!) especially if you get out any food.
8. Wear walking shoes! The more waterproof the better.
9. Go to the Rabacal Nature Spot Café after the walks for some excellent cakes.
10. It took us approx 2-3 hours to do both walks at a reasonable pace, including stopping for lunch and to take photos regularly

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"As all Levadas we walked this was also a great trail. It's fairly short (2,5km to the 25 Fuentes) but as it's really narrow most of the way, it takes much longer than you would guessed. Impossible to get lost :) We walked in the rain/clouds when the levada was running over its edge at several points so reaching the pond at the end was more of ""ahhh, more water"" than ""wow"" :)) must be amazing during sunny day although to walk this path with more tourists spoils the experience a bit I guess. If you are too lazy to walk the waterfall first, don't worry, you can see it on the way to the pond as well.

In winter good waterproof shoes are essential as the path gets VERY wet and slippery. The vertigo effect is not so serious I would say.

You start the walk at the parking place - either walk or take a minibus down to Rascal (minibus is 5Eur two ways, 3 Eur single). We walked down and had to even take the shoes off to cross the river running over the road. It's down hill tarmac road, fun in sun, not so much fun in rain (we took the bus back, it goes every 15 - 20 min, the driver was just hanging around in the cafe and took us when we were ready).

There is also access through a long tunnel which is situated down a minor road not far from the main car park - definitely need a torch for this but it completely avoids the 200m descent/ascent from the other access.

Previous reviews recommend walking boots and no WHITE TRAINERS!!!! I wore exactly white saucing running trainers. Lots of people walking in trainers, blue, grey, green, pink not a problem, but I’m sure this depends on time of year and weather.
We walked to the 25 fontes only.
The waterfall is what you find it, I found it quite nice, very cold, but It didn’t have the wow factor for me. Husband says it was alright. But the walk we both enjoyed, seeing Flora and fauna along the way. The paths can be narrow in places, but we felt safe, people need to be patient and allow others to pass, even the big groups, use your common sense.
We are in our early fifties and found the downward trip quite easy, the up hill is another story unless you are super fit. Pace yourself as it is steep and lots of steps at different heights to encounter. Take drink with you, also we took a sandwich to eat at the waterfall.
The cafe we didn’t use at Rabacal, but free toilets are available, they are not the usual toilet!!! But ok. Worth the trip if you enjoy a walk with a difference.

We arrived about 9:30am in low cloud and set off down the long tarmac road with only another couple of cars parked at that time. We decided to do the waterfall walk first to see how fit we felt! The waterfall is amazing and it is a beautiful spot that we had all to ourselves.
On the way back we saw the sign for the 25 fonts and decided to do that walk too. This walk takes you down a zig zag of steps and then along the Levada, which was full to the brim and overflowing in places. After crossing the bridge you go up to the levada again and follow a narrow path with is very uneven alongside the levada. Again because we were early there were not too many people on the way there. It was further than we thought but keep going as it is worth it. The path was busier on the way back with some groups starting to appear.
We stopped at the cafe for a drink and a snack before starting to walk back up to the car. The building has been well renovated and the food was tasty with big portions. We had lemon tart, lemon cake and banana cake (this was a bit dry). There are really nice toilets inside the cafe and some more basic ones outside at the back. It takes about 30 minutes to walk back up to the car afterwards. By the time we arrived back at the car, the car park was busy and we passed many people walking down the road to do the walk.

We recommend to use the hiking shoes, as there is a lot of water all around and the path is slippery on some places. Some parts of the paths are quite narrow, so you need to coordinate it on some places with people walking in the opposite site.

It is the walk that is so beautiful rather than the destination!",Sep 2017
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,Cascada da Risco is an easy walk ending at the interesting waterfall. You have to park just of the road and then walk through a tunnel for about 10 minutes. Would recommend taking a torch for this. Very level then all round to the water fall. I would recommend this way to pick up the 25 fonts walk too as you don't have allot of elevation change. Unfortunately I did the Cascada da Risco walk second after taking the usual long down hill route to the 25 fonts from the parking spot ontop of the hill. The fonts is not a pretty as the waterfall but that's my personal opinion. The fonts can get very crowded very quickly with the organised walkers.,Sep 2017
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"It was a great afternoon in nature, where we parked we had to walk 10 min through a pitch black tunnel but it's okay if you've been warned and got a flashlight ready! The view was amazing and the path nice to walk.",Sep 2017
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This walk down the levadas is a fantastic experience and definitely something on the list of things you can only do in Madeira. The views are stunning and the waterfalls make the walks truely spectacular.
It definitely gives you a new found respect for the people who built the levadas, this is due to the narrowness of the paths and the steep drops. With this in mind make sure you wear sensible footwear (i.e. walking boots or sturdy trainers) and also you need to be steady on your feet as there are someplaces where the barriers have fallen away and it feels a little precarious.
But if you do take on the walk you will not be disappointed.
The walk can be quite busy and it took us approximately took us about 3 and a half hours and we walk quite quickly so make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to do the full walk, there is also no cafes enroute so go prepared with water and food.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Truly stunning and natural environment. Very easy on the eyes and not too difficult a walk (the end bit is all uphill).

The levada is accessed from a hilltop car park at PR6 25 Fontes. The tarmac road you come up at the end is also the one you walk down from at the beginning to the access point.

There is a minibus service to exfil you should it be required. I walked up in about 25 minutes.

The walk is in 2 main bits. The flatter part taking you to the waterfall at Risco then the 25 Fontes accessed from a steep set of stairs (a bit of a climb) to the 25 Fontes.

Both elements truly stunning. I did the Risco falls first in case of laziness or tiredness set in.

About 3-4 hours in total should suffice. I set off at 10.45 and was back at the car at 14.05.

A few people made a big deal of the visitor numbers. I personally thought it was okay. Not crowded or spoiled as some had suggested - genuinely not. Visitors - yes. Too many - no.

All in all a great walk - not too difficult. Only hard bit at the end and a regular shuttle can mitigate that as well.

Enjoy a great walk.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"In the middle of valey there is a gem, amazing nature creation: rock wall with 25 tiny waterfalls. Plants and surround rocks create beatiful place to visit. Is long and hard trail, but is worth of each sweat drop and hard breath! Must see!",Sep 2017
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"Bit of a disappointment this walk. The walk is along a levada (water channel) much of which is a stone ledge you need to concentrate on your feet. This place is crowded. We went in mid September and had to wait for other parties, often of 15-10 people) as the access is often restricted in width. When we reached the famed 25 Fontes (25 fountains) it was simply a nice pool into which lots of trickles of waterfalls cascade. It was no better than many areas we had seen on other walks and we didn't need to dodge lots of people taking selfies, eating their lunch and being noisy. For a total of 6 days of walking this was the least favourite for all of us as it was a) not as spectacular as the hype and b) crowded. Not worth the effort there are far better places to walk.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Having been up on the Paul da Serra plateau a few times in a hire car we were ready for a good long levada walk and we chose this as a first one.

Firstly, note that although our guide book says this is about a 3 hour walk, it took us nearly 6 hours. This was in part because every step is a viewpoint but also because the levada is very thin and there are multiple people going back and forth so you have to give way to oncoming walkers (or vice versa). This is certainly not for those who suffer from vertigo because the levado runs along a short path several hundred metres above the valley below. However, it is an amazing walk and if you do it, first take the levado towards 25 Fontes then come back to the path junction towards the much easier walk to the huge waterfall.

A point worth mentioning is that the car park is at the top of the plateau so you have to walk into the valley before the walk begins. However, on your way back, stop at the ranger lodge and there is a minibus to the car park about every 30 minutes. this saves a 45 minute walk back to your car. Take plenty of water because it is a long walk but not particularly hot as you are shaded for much of it.

Take a start on Rabacal ( asphalt road takes only a beginning part, leave left side of the road when mini bus comes), then move towards levadas surrounded by trees to beautiful Risco waterfall (be ready for pictures ;). Then a even more demanding and thrilling walk to the lake of 25 streams. If you are keen to have a cold refreshing shower tak your swimming suit with you. Afterwards head for the tunnel that will shorten the way if you have anyone to pick you up. Otherwise make a long walk up back to Rabacal.
Remember to have sufficient reserve of water and food \ snacks as there is nothing available on route.

From Rabacal there is a hiking track to the waterfall - super nice, easy walk. We went also to 25 fontes - this walk was a bit longer and there were more ups and downs.

The route itself is not that long as 3 km of it is serpentine downhill car road, still the journey feels longer as the rest of the path is difficult and slow to travel and there are so many people, lot of waiting. There is not really much to see on this path either. A waterfall can be seen at a great distance at one point. The route ends at a pool, a real disappointment as there is no real fountain but rather a few small drips from the surrounding rocks. Can't really recommend the place to anyone. Disappointment.",Aug 2017
Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"We did an extended version of the standard walk: 16 km with 620 m ascent
Rating: 4 out of 5 for the scenery. However, the trail is so crowded that it takes away some of the beauty of the place.

From the big parking next to the ER105, you find the Levada do Alecrim almost directly after the gate. Most people will follow the asphalt road down to the Rabacal shelter directly to the 25 fountains and the Risco watervall. Following the Levada do Alecrim FIRST to another huge waterfall (that feeds the Risco waterfall) was actually the best part of this hike (quiet, with nice views and a small watervall/chute in the Levada do Alecrim itself included).

After about 5 km we reached the asphalt road again that leads to the trails PR6.1 Levada do Risco waterfall and PR6 (Levada das 25 Fontes). The trail to the 25 fountains was extremely crowded, with people moving in both directions over a very small path along the levada, so you continuously had to wait for people to pass. Not the most serene place to hike! Also the 25 fountains themselves where a bit of a disappointment because there were so many people blocking all the good photo opportunities. Instead of walking back the same way that we came, we followed the trail along the Levada da Rocha Vermelha back to the PR6 and Rabacal. Note that some parts of this trail were steep and partly overgrown, but still do-able. At least it was completely quiet because of this! The asphalt road took us back to the parking. There’s also the option to do these last kilometers uphill with a little bus, but where’s the fun in that??

Naturally to make the most of the experience, throw off your sweaty clothes and jump in to swim under the waterfall. Don't spend too long though as it really is cold!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"First, we have 3 travel buddies with ages 13, 7 and 1 years and we did this as a DIY trip. We have rented a car during the whole trip so it was just a matter of making sure that the return is counted for the walking trips we consider. Lastly, I still have some of the baby weight I gained during my last one. Just so you know, we are just an ordinary family making the most of our summer vacation. Having said that, the first challenge is to find a parking lot so you have to slow down as you approach the parking area so you can grab that vacant space quickly. There is approximately 2 kilometers of asphalted road that you have to walk through before you reach the actual trail. We were confused at first, but it is just like that. There is a van servicing this road for those who would rather just hike the trail itself. But we liked it especially when we reached the stream which overflows to the road. Our kids gladly took off their shoes and splash in the water! The reviews are correct, this trail is very popular and so you have to ""share"" nature with tons of them. We don't mind, we have a realistic expectation about this trip that if we know about a certain destination, then so thousands of other tourists too. Anyway, nature here does not disappoint. Some of the trails are too narrow for sharing so you have to take turns with that of the ones walking on the opposite direction. The trail is so safe --- most areas are secured with rails, basic signs and markings -- and if you observe prudence with your shoes and apparel, food & water and behavior while in nature, you will be fine. The waterfalls at the end of the trail does not have that strong water anymore but it still amazing. Our kids played all sorts of fantasies while we were seated in one of the rocks, eating our lunches and resting for the walk back. The walk is not flat, but it is not big differences in inclination either. Start the walk early and do it in your own pace, make strategic stops, take pictures and admire the flora and fauna. In many ways, it helps that we are walking with small kids because it ""forces"" us to linger and pay attention to the surroundings. We like it a lot!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"We tackled this hike with our 6 & 8 year olds in tow. We had no problem finding the parking place in our rental car and there was plenty of parking when we arrived around 9:30 AM. The first two kilometers of the hike are down a fairly steep paved road. At the bottom of the road, you'll arrive at a little house/hut type of structure with garbage and recycling bins as well as picnic tables. From there you follow the trail signs down more toward the 25 Fontes. The trail continues down several sets of stairs before you find the levada that you'll be following much of the rest of the way. The trails are very narrow in places, but are stunning and peaceful (until a bus load of folks want to pass!!). We were a bit discouraged at the number of people on the trails. There were no fewer than 4 giant bus tours there at the same time we were there. Next time, I'd go earlier in the morning. The falls at the end were beautiful as the sun was just cresting over the top. We enjoyed a packed lunch on the rocks at the base of the falls. The Madeira Endemic Finches knew this was a spot for lunch as well as many were eating out of the hands of tourists. The walk back was CROWDED. We got stuck between two bus tour groups. Eventually we found a place on the trail wide enough to let the group behind us pass, so we didn't feel like herded cattle. There were several hikers making their way to the falls, who were obviously frustrated with the huge groups traveling back all together because they had to sit or stand straddling the levada for long periods of time while the masses of people passed. Eventually we got back to the bottom of the stairs and started the long journey up. We took it slow and it wasn't so bad. There was a shuttle at the bottom, but I'm not sure how much it cost. The line for the shuttle was very long and I'd rather leave it for older folks who might need the lift more than our family did. The shuttle passed us with three different groups of people by the time we reached the parking lot at the top. Even with the crazy crowds, it was a lovely walk and I'd do it again...just earlier in the day to try to avoid the bus tours.

The walk is not too hard, but some of the paving alongside the levadas is crumbling meaning it is one way in places, but everyone is polite and friendly, so no alterations!!

There is a tunnel from that end, which is not shown in the walking guide so we had no torch, so remember to carry one, and there are a couple of steep bits, with steps, but nothing too bad.

Also, tour busses come with 15-20 people at a time, with people walking very slowly, so if you get the chance, overtake the crowds in the wider paths. We were fortunate to overtake a big crowd which meant they held back other hikers, so when we got to the fountains we almost had it to ourselves for 30 minutes before the tour crowd arrived.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"Described as Madeira's most popular walk this levada lures huge crowds. "" Huge crowds"" are not a good thing on a levada walk. Tour companies are delivering throngs of walkers who are expecting a peaceful beautiful get away. However, the nature of levada walk can be challenging and can have risks. Uneven terrain, slippery surfaces and narrow one lane paths can make the experience very challenging. Add to the risk a long length of tourists following a tour guide. Passing all these individuals can be very awkward, especially on a narrow steep edge. Not all tourists are suited for these levada walks. Seniors beware, you might want to turn back or even have a rest. Well there is NOWHERE to sit. Oh, you might find a rough rock, but it will not be comfortable. If you want to stop...forget it! The crowd control will push you on. Perhaps you can hear the frustration in my words. Yes, I am frustrated. We have been spending the winter in Madeira. Over the course of many years, we have seen this amazing attraction grow from a peaceful great walk to a Disney World type of attraction without all the amenities which Disney provides. Perhaps that is next..yikes, I hope not. The tour companies are out to make money and are destroying the beauty of the levada. If you plan on walking you must arrive very early to avoid the crowds. We must preserve such beautiful spots, but bring large throngs of people is not a good idea. Hopefully the Tourism authorities will recognize the need to control numbers in the future. Madeira is a beautiful place and needs to be nurtured and loved!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"Levada walks are surprisingly varied and normally fairly easy as practically flat (as long as you stick to one levada.)
They vary according to how wide the paths are, how well the sheer drops are protected, how old the levada is and the kind of scenery.
And how many tourists are walking them

This is a reasonably easy, well protected walk, with variations in scenery and some lavishly vegetated cliffs. (A couple of ups and downs according to what you do and see below.) At the end of one of the levadas is a waterfall. At the end of the other is a pool and number of small feeder streams.

The 25 fontes part has a fairly narrow walking path (though well protected). There are lots of places where it is possible to jump down to allow people to pass - but it is often quite a jump and the outside path does not exist everywhere. So this is a problem when busy with tourists.
If you are not going through the tunnel, then there is a bit of a climb back up to the bus.

We were there in mid-January and it was nevertheless annoyingly busy.
Maybe very early or late in the day?
Then it depends on whether you want to take the bus up and/or down the hill from the top. Or go through the tunnel - in which case you would have to climb up to the waterfall.

There is not much to see (bushes on one side, the mountain on the other), and besides that you have to be careful where you step on, so most of the time you are going to look down (if you want to stay safe, of course).

There are maybe 3 places where the view is nice but you can have beautiful sights almost anywhere on the island. The waterfall where we had our lunch was nice but nothing breathtaking.

When walking back to the mini bus we took an alternative path meaning that we walked inside a pitch dark 800 meters long tunnel. How exciting...

Lucky enough, being January we didn't encounter too many people so we didn't have to give way and to wait for others to enter the narrow paths before us...

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"The starting point for the Rabacal levada walk is the car part located on the ER-110. As Rabacal is cut off from public transport, you can reach by hired car, taxi or book a guided tour. We arrived by hired car, after an around 45 minutes drive from Funchal.The car park is free, the only 'parking attendents' you might come across are cows, which are grazing on trees in the area. From the car park you can either walk down the small winding, concrete road to the Rabacal forester house or take the mini bus, which goes back and forth between car park and forester house on a regular basis. The walk takes about 30 minutes while the mini bus takes you down in only couple of minutes. A single ticket is 3 euros and a return 5. At the Foresters house you'll find toilets and picnic tables. Make sure you bring water and snacks along as there is no possiblity to buy something en route.
From the Foresters House we followed the sign posts to Levada do Risco. We walked, with the levada on the right, into the dense greenery. We were quite excited when we spotted little fishes in the levadas.The mountains were dressed in lush moss, farns and other greens and water was running down. After an about 20 minutes walk, we took the path that branched off to the right, which led us to the truly amazing lookout point Cascada da Risco. Water was cascading down allover from the high rock.
From there we went back until we reached the crossroads from where we took the path to the direction 25 springs. After two sets of steps we arrived at the levada das 25 fontes, which we followed.The path next to the levada was at times very narrow and uneven and it was a bit difficult when groups of hikers had to pass from the opposite direction. We walked through a part full of bare branched trees, where we had the impression of being in a ghost wood. The diversity was astonishing. After about 1 mile we arrived at the beautiful spot 25 fontes, where the water was cascading down from the springs. We stayed there for a while to enjoy the scenery before we went back to the Foresters House.
From there we took the mini bus back up to the car park. A truly magical walk, I'm sure fairies and goblins can be spotted off the beaten track.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"Some reviews mention the 'crowds' but when we came here in October, we had no problems. Just off ER 110 near Rabacal is the start of PR6, the trail hike starts to the 25 Springs. Hikers follow the lavada for several km before reaching the destination. It’s an awesome trail and very popular. You will be hiking through valleys and along the mountainside. The terrain is beautiful, the trails are well-maintained and your reward at the end, magnificent. Imagine a giant horseshoe-like cavern with more than two dozen fresh water springs emerging from its embrace and settling on rocks carved smooth by the artistry of nature. The hike itself is long and challenging in places, but you can save yourself a lot of sweat and tired legs by taking the transit vehicle down the very long, steep and winding road to the bottom, where the trail really begins. It will cost you 5 euros return, but many feel it’s well worth it.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"My husband and I started out early to get to the parking lot on ER 110. I read this was a very popular hike which many tour agencies promote so I expected to see lots of groups out there.

What they said was true .. there were more than 20 cars in the parking lot when we got there. But we enjoyed our hike down to the Rabacal House (where there were comfort rooms, not too clean). I expected a trail but we actually walked down an asphalt road. And I was surprised that there were vehicles driving up and down this road.

The views of the mountains coming down was truly spectacular.

We went to see Risco waterfall first which, at the time of our visit, was not flowing as heavily as described in books I have read. We proceeded to 25 Fontes which I thought was nice .. a lot of water coming out from different springs and all cascading down to a pool.

In many sections of the levada route, the trail narrows, so the protocol is to give way to others. Who gives way first is common sense ... if people are already on the narrow path, then wait for them to cross. I did not find this irritating at all .. in fact, I quite enjoyed giving way to others and me having to squeeze tight or look for a place to stand on the levada to allow other people to pass. People were courteous and thanked us for letting them pass first. And vice-versa.

Be prepared to walk back up to the parking lot ... about 1290 meters up. It was a good workout and I also had time to enjoy the views of the mountains and clouds rolling in.

We did the 5.8km walk (it's worth noting that this is each way!) but as it was not hilly it was perfectly manageable. Would thoroughly recommend. Definitely worth checking weather and perhaps bringing a jumper/coat as it can get chilly. Also a minimum of trainers is needed in terms of footwear.",Jul 2016

From Rabacal you can choose to do either the slightly harder and longer (2.5km) 25 fontes walk or the very flat and much shorter (1.2km) Risco falls walk. If you're not up to the 25 Fontes walk then don't worry, the Risco falls walk is still worthwhile. The fall itself is quite impressive, although you see the fall from about halfway up not from the bottom, and the scenery is still spectacular.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This walk is a 'must-do', the scenery and waterfalls are very beautiful! We loved walking alongside the levada. This is a safe walk, as there are fences to protect you from some steep drops - unlike a few other levada walks!

Advice:
- Bring a torch and spare batteries for the tunnels.
- Wear walking boots, as the path is very uneven in places, and the tunnels can have large puddles.
- Arrive EARLY to avoid crowds of people. We arrived for 9.30am, and were pretty much alone on the walk (~3.5 hours). Walking back we met huge groups of people (organised tours) which would have ruined the mood of the walk.
- Check the weather forecast before you go.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"I would highly recommend this walk as long as you are reasonably fit. If 30minutes on the flat is your maximum, then give it a miss. It is very well sign posted so if you have a car no need to take a tour here. The walk is downhill on the way out and so uphill on the way back, but if you have had enough there is a minibus from rabacal back to the car park. We went in the late morning and there was quite a lot of low cloud up in the car park, so quite cool to begin with, but wall to wall sunshine and very warm at the end, so I would recommend a small rucksack to peel off layers and take snacks and drinks. The walk follows lovely old levadas and is very beautiful but there are bus trips around sometimes affecting the tranquility. We just pulled over to let them get on and then continued at our own pace. The walkways are quite narrow in places but I didn't think they were dangerous as some people have suggested. Suitable walking footwear is a good idea. I wouldn't do this in flimsy sandals or flip flops. The 25 fountains at the end is superb. It was a little bit busy when we arrived but then people come and go, and you get a few peaceful moments to savour the surroundings. We sat for a while and had snacks and drinks and then started back up. There are cheeky little finches in abundance. Small fish in the crystal clear levada water and beautiful wild flowers everywhere. What's not to like? If you are reasonably fit you will love this walk. Superb views of the valley on the way back up as the cloud had lifted and swifts swooping around as we headed back up their highways.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We had already done quite a long walk before we came here . We parked at the top and walked down because as someone else had pointed out you get lovely views of the surrounding hills from the road. There were clouds around but they kept clearing and we had sunshine once we got into the valley. We arrived at about 3pm when a lot of big groups had gone so it was relatively peaceful. First we walked to the waterfall where little birds came to perch on the wall by us. This is a relatively flat wide easy walk. We then walked to the 25 fountains. This walk starts down a lot of steps and then goes up another flight before reaching the lavada walk proper which is narrow . Happily at this time of day there were no big groups and it was relatively straightforward with little stopping. It seems quite a long slog to get to the fountains, which are in fact small waterfalls descending a high curved cliff into a large pool. When we were there there were only acouple of other people and then a few more arrived on of which went in swimming! The way back has quite a bit of ascent especially as we walked up the hill, although a 6.30pm the mini bus was still running.

We had a hire car and parked on the top, apparently you can get a small coach to the starting point, very useful for some as its a longish walk back to the road.

This Levada walk is not your simple incline walk, it's up and down. The track is narrow and you have to stop and let groups go past you.

the 25 fountains (of youth as you will be fit when you get there) are a bit of a disappointment but the levada is worth it !!

No seriously it's all a bit of fun but be warned if you are average sort of person with new kit, don't start your trip with this walk try a longish straight walk first.

We had clear sun then low cloud then light drizzle all within an hour. We didn't have the kids with us but there were quite a few families doing the walk.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We combined this hike with the levada do Alecrim, making a ""sort of loop"" after parking on the ridge of road #110. We were not aware of the mini-bus, which would save the long ascent back up from Rabacal house for only 3 euros one way or 5 euros both down and up. If you do choose to walk that section, as we did, look out/listen for for that minibus, because it goes very fast and the road is very narrow and curvy!
The number of people hiking the trails surrounding Rabacal house really surprised us, and some of the paths are very narrow and slippery, making meeting other hikers a bit challenging.
There is a public bathroom at the rabacal house, but it is toilet paper free and pretty disgusting. There are no other facilities.
Pack twice as much lunch as you think you will eat, wear really sturdy shoes, pay the bit of money for the minibus, and enjoy the hike. We loved it!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"Having walked several levadas, other hikers should be aware that we found that this one is a bit different. We parked our car at the top and walked down the tarmac road to the government rest house at the bottom. This is an easy and picturesque descent, but remember that what goes down must come up!
After the government house the path is well signed. However, whereas on most levadas the paths are pretty flat, this one soon starts to descend down for over a couple of hundred steps, until you hit the level. It is then even, apart from a few more steps after half an hour, until you reach the fountains in about 20 minutes after that. Having reached the fountains, we then retraced our steps back to the government house. Because of the steps at the end, the return journey took a little longer. Fortunately a minibus runs (every 20 minutes) up and down the hill to the car park at the top. This saved a very long uphill drag on the private road and was money well spent.
I think there were several drawbacks with this walk. First, the steps down (and up) are not easy and there may be safety issues for the unsteady. They are certainly quite hard work to ascend and descend. Second, we didn’t find walking along the levada that easy. The tow path (!) wasn’t as even as others elsewhere on the island, and the issue was exacerbated by the flow of people coming in the opposite direction or the process of overtaking or being overtaken by other traffic. Third, most of the walk is under trees. There didn’t seem to be that many panoramic views and often your eyes were being employed safely navigating the track, rather than surveying the scenery. Moreover you were out of the sunlight for long periods, although that might be a blessing if it was hot. Fourth, although the fountains and waterfalls at the end are very pretty, when we went, even at the end of February, they were also quite busy and there wasn’t much opportunity for quiet contemplation and a restful break.
Now re-reading this makes me sound a bit of a wuss. I’m not saying don’t do it. It is a very interesting walk and well worth attempting. However, I’m not sure it is suitable for young children, the unfit or those unsteady on their feet. Given those health warnings, by all means give it a go.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"A walk that is up front about saying 'not suitable for those with vertigo'. In places the path is only about a foot wide, separated from a drop of over 100 feet by just a strand of wire. There is also a tunnel to go through, about ten minutes each way in the dark and damp, torch definitely needed. The path to the falls gets gradually harder - narrower and less protected - as the falls get nearer; consequently the return walk seemed easy in comparison.

I suspect this walk is one that is very different in summer. In early March the path was damp throughout and at times slippery or with surface water. Most of the walk is fairly flat, other than steps down to and up from a bridge, so not strenuous. It is a very popular walk and we were fortunate in that our guide got us there early, ahead of most other groups. On our return from the falls we encountered a lot of other people and my guess is that they experienced crowds when they reached the falls.

One of the beauties of this walk was experiencing the laurissilva, with our guide showing us various plants as we walked, and also the trout in the rapidly flowing water. Visibility was poor the day we went; try to choose a sunnier day. Also, think about the size of the group you are with. Some parties seemed to be up to twenty strong, which meant they moved slowly - especially when needing to stop to allow people moving the other way to pass. In our group there were just seven with a generally careful and caring guide. Even so, there was a huge difference in speed between two sure-footed Swedish teenagers and two English ladies in their 60s. Unfortunately, the torch supplied to one of these ladies had a battery which died early on her return through the tunnel; the lady was the last in the group (the guide was with the faster walkers at that stage) and it wasn't until she failed to come out of the tunnel with the rest of us that anyone knew there was a problem. Fortunately, she was fairly accepting of the situation but it could have been a problem for others.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This review is for the Risco waterfall walk only, and does not include information on the 25 Fontes walk.

For anyone wanting to get a feel for the 'real' madeira but doesn't want to be hiking up mountain trails or along the edge of gorges, this is ideal

Park at the top (get there before 9.30 if you can as many tourist coaches turn up around 10 - meaning you can get some really peaceful 'alone time' before the masses arrive) and walk down the track (yes, walk if you are able as you'll miss so much of the stunning surroundings if you take the minibus) for what seems like an age (in reality about 45 minutes). You will arrive at an information board and a house (there are toilets around the back, no loo roll, but toilets so take advantage of them if you need to!). To the right of the information board, behind the small bus stop sign the path continues down, albeit much narrower and a little steeper early on. Follow the meandering pathway alongside a levada to your right all the way down until it ends at the spectacular waterfall. The waterfall really is worth the walk, trust me.

The easy route is the 1.2km one indicated 'Risco' - the 25 Fontes route is a bit tougher, I am told.

When you're done, make your way back to the house as mentioned above, then wait for the minibus (€3 each, well worth it) to take you back to the car park, saving you from what must be a 1 hour+ walk back up the hill!

This really is a couple of hours well spent.

Worth noting that the cloud tends to roll in from the north as the day progresses (and obscures everything (the temperature drops a lot too)), so you may have a better chance of a cloud free (and warmer) visit to the waterfall if you get there earlier in the day than later in the afternoon. Take study footwear, some water and wrap up as if it were an autumnal day in the UK (the temperature can be a good 10-12 degrees cooler up there than on the southern coast of the island). Better to have warm clothes and not need them, than to need them and not have them!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"On this levada walk our guide was very anxious about safety. However as long as the path edge was avoided it seemed easy.
There is no public transport and if self driving it is necessary to climb back to the car park whereas guided tours move the coach to pick up after a tunnel.
the walk itself was flat and although there are drops there are protective railings. I think i only got a bit nervous once and that was on the steps which were a bit uneven.
there is a safer part of the path next to the levada but groups force each other off onto the eath next to the high path. Theoretically this is more risky as the ground could crumble but really it is possible to keep safe by a little observation and care.
the actual features, the waterfall and the 25 Fountains were pretty but I enjoyed the whole experience of the walk and the group and the interesting drive

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"We took a guided tour with Madeira Explorers to visit this track. The walk down to the start of the paths is indeed a 2k downhill walk on the tarmac, but having had a wonderfully sunny December day with around 20 degrees, the views over the hillsides were fantastic already here. After the tarmac, the walk to the high waterfall is a flat and easy one, suitable for anybody really. The walk to the 25 Fontes is a bit tougher on the knees - quite some stairs descending in the beginning - but not too difficult. When walking along the levada, there are some parts passing right by steep drops, but at the narrowest places there are always railings. Having a bit of vertigo and fear of heights (or rather by drops?) I found it reassuring and felt safe. It would probably be somewhat slippery here and there on a rainy day, so make sure you have proper shoes.
The 25 Fontes was lovely, but be prepared to queue for good photos :) It seems to be a popular destination. We met two other groups and several couples doing the walk. Despite the traffic, the forest and the track were very clean everywhere.

Go back and then go to the 25 springs, this is a longer walk and the path gets quite narrow in places and it is generally very busy, a constant stream of tourists, the spring and the pool is lovely and after seeing it, we went over a wee bridge to the right and found a spot to have lunch and when we went back we had the spring to ourselves and took loads of photos and admired it in peace.

The return journey put a greater strain on the calf muscles (what goes down must come up!) and we caught the shuttle back for the final leg. The driver also commented on how busy the car park was expecting only around 20 cars a day at this time of year. By 2 o'clock that day he said they had already had 40.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"I took an organized tour to get here as there is no public bus available to do an easy one day tour. The second option is to take a rent car but them you have to climb up back / take a shuttle back to the car park. With our tour we walked through the tunnel where our mini-bus waited to take as back.
The first walk to Cascada da Risco is easy one ending at the interesting water fall at the 1000 meters above sea level. Then you have to return back to start the second walk to (Lagoa das 25 Fontes (the 25 Spring Lagoon) created by waters which come down from the Mountain Marsh. On the way to the water fall where we took the break with our lunch we enjoyed laurisilva forest and trouts in the canal. The area at the foot of the waterfall was quite busy as was the trail back when we had to wait to have a free path or give preference to people going the opposite way as most of the part of the trail is too narrow to walk both directions at the same time. But not major problem. So if you have your car come here as early as possible to enjoy the levada before the organized tours (mainly Tuesday and Thursday) come here.
We did not climb up back to Rebacal but walked through the tunnel (around 800 meters) in upright poition, no bending,so small torch/mobile phone is handy. But still watch your head. Our guide at the mini-bus provided us with the small one.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This was our first walk in Madeira and it has set our expectations right up there!

We parked at Rabacal which was fairly easy to find on the side of the road.
Once we saw the sign post of the walk we knew we were on the right track.

We chose to walk down the tarmac track instead of taking the shuttle bus. After about 2k of walking downhill we then started the walk.

Not really knowing what we were getting ourselves in for (Levada novices here!) we found breath taking views the whole way. Some parts of the path are quite narrow with a steep drop on one side but most have a barrier running alongside.

We got to the 25 fountains which were gorgeous. Recommend taking food with you and enjoying when you get to the fountains.

The walk to the fountains is mostly flat or downhill, so remember the walk back will be abit more challenging!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,3.0,"The start of this walk is very boring walking on a tarmac road. At Rabacal there are extremely basic toilet facilities/picnic benches and the walk proper starts. It was quite steep and rocky. I didn't get as far as the 25 Fontes (stopped at the bridge) as it was getting too steep, and I'd had enough walking. Apparently I would not have gone much further in any case, due to the very steep drops. On our return journey we waited at Rabacal for the shuttle bus back up to find the price was for a return ticket. Had we taken the bus down, I might have got a bit further. The 25 Fontes were apparentlynot very spectacular although pretty. They might be better at other times of the year with more water behind them.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"It was a rainy and foggy start, so I was a bit worried, but it cleared up a bit and was lovely nonetheless. We went with 'Walking with Emanuel' which was a great experience.

I did find it a bit more challenging than I expected - at some points, you walk right along the canal and the width of the walking bit is only as wide as the levada and can be quite slippery. If people are coming towards you, you need to wait for them to pass by standing sideways. There are some ways to do it that are better than others, as at one point we went down quite a lot of stairs and were worried we'd need to go up them again. A group had just started up them when we got to the bottom and I don't think that would be pleasant! But we passed by these on our way out and instead went through the 1km tunnel, where we got picked up on the other side.

A great choice for a levada walk - it's not as exposed as some of the others like the Pico De Arreiro or the eastern side of the island. The pool we stopped at for lunch where the '25 fontes' are is a picturesque spot and you could go for a dip, but the water was pretty icy when we were there!

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"A fairly large car park at the top of Rabacal does tend to get full quickly with the day walkers. I must admit that we cheated because we took the shuttle bus (€5 per person) and it cut out a 2km walk along a fairly thin meandering road - true the biggest threat to walkers came from the said same shuttle bus - but on a hot day it certainly made the trip more pleasant. The road way drops about 200m and so it is quite a climb out after walking to the waterfalls.
Cascada da Risco is 1.5km from the refuge along fairly even paths following the levada and is pleasant under the trees walk with views across the hillside. There had not been much rain and so the waterfall itself was not showing much power but it does fall about 70m and so when there is water around I imagine it can be quite spectacular. You can no longer walk behind it as the path is closed off with a locked gate but there is a little seating area where regular visits from friendly chaffinches occur.
Because of the lack of water we did not attempt the 4.6km round trip to 25 Fontes but I did see some people take a cut across path that did look a little challenging. If you wanted to walk everywhere from the top car park then I think it would be a total of about 13kms for the full trip..

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"As said, best place to park your car is at an old building on the road from Calheta to Rabacal. The 5,8 km trail starts there without much climbing to do at all. Bring a good flashlight though, as the walk includes a 15 minute walk through a 19th century tunnel. This tunnel offers good passage and is a much better choice than the large parking up the mountain. From there it is a boring walk down to Rabacal house, and quite a steep way back without much shelter. For 3€ you can get a taxibus for the ride back up though.
The fountains sprout from the rocks on top of an impermeable layer of rock, 10 meters above a large pool at the end of a ravine. A beautiful place if you can enjoy it in the quiet peace of the morning or early evening, but a disappointment when dozens of tourists scatter the place. We were lucky to arrive 30 minutes before some 300 people arrived there. Needless to say that spoils the entire trip. An easy walk, takes about 3hrs including the stay there

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This is an excellent Levada walk but is popular with the tour groups. The start is quite a long walk down to the levada trail along a single track private road. At the end of this road before you descend to the start of the trail proper are the only toilets along the trail (one each for men and women, they don't ever look to have been cleaned!). As you descend the hillside you follow the trail to the waterfall at Risco about 2km - an easy walk along the flat as you follow the levada. You then return to follow the longer trail to 25 Fontes. This is slightly more tricky but safe and relatively flat, with a few sections of steep steps. You do pass one open area of little waterfalls, we did wonder if that was 25 Fontes but no that's a bit further on (45 minutes or so) and unmistakable. You then turn back and retrace your steps. It is not a circular route.
Most people then needed to make the journey all the way back up the steep road in the hot sun to meet their tour group. Fortunately, our experienced guide told us to follow the levada, so on the flat and much quieter, for another 2km and through a tunnel where he was waiting for us and the AC minibus. This was much appreciated... Highly recommended levada walk although busy at times.

One of the easier Levada walks with spectacular views deep into the valley and woods of Madeira. Thankfully the area, although very popular with tourists, has not been ruined with commercialised cafes and gift shops. Take supplies with you and good walking boots. Some of the Levada paths are difficult to navigate and a few do have sheer drops into the valley so do be careful. I would also apply caution if the weather is wet as the paths can be slippy.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,4.0,"We walked along the Levadas das 25 Fontes e do Risco on a Friday, and both were rather busy.
To get to the starting point of the paths, which both share, one must park at the side of the regional road ER110, then walk about 1.5kms down to Casas do Rabaçal, where the signs to the path are quite visible.
The levada das 25 Fontes is 4.6kms long, not requiring special skills or great fitness. Nonetheless, better pay attention close to the high drops, narrow paths, only at times, and slippery ground. The views are amazing and the untouched nature around a hallmark of Madeira Island. At the end of the path there is a small lake and waterfalls, ideal for a break and a snack.
The Levada do Risco is shorter - around 1km, and much easier, almost like a ""walk in the park"". At the end there is a waterfall, and great views.
We definitely recommend these levadas, but paying special attention to avoid busy days or times. They are very popular among tourists.
There are bathroom facilities in Casas do Rabaçal.

If, like me, you seek solitude, peace and quiet on your walks, skip it and follow the levada (upstream) which runs under the road just a few tens of meters past the barrier on the road leading from the car park down to Rabacal. It wil soon take you deep into the woods. You will notice trout swimming in this levada. After about 7km or a little over an hour, you will reach the endpoint, a beautiful waterfall into a small green pool filled with trout. Ideal for a picnic.

I'm not keen on heights but didn't find this walk a problem at all, at no point did I feel unsafe.
It's an easy walk and we found the timings given in our guide book and on the official signage to be a little excessive (but we do walk quite fast). If you really want to soak it up though make sure you give yourself plenty of time, you could easily loose an hour watching the waterfalls.

Luckily nothing was broken or sprained but it did make us all very cautious, which was probably no bad thing. The path to the waterfall needed real concentration but the end result was magnificent.

He took notice that I was very interested in the flora and fauna of the area and made it a point to explain the different native plants of the area that were endemic or introduced to the island of Madeira. I very much appreciated his thoughtfulness and generousity of sharing his knowledge of the area.

The walk itself was approximately 13K in length which included the Rabaçal and Risco Levadas with a stop at the water display of 25 Fontes. At 25 Fontes (fountains), we paused for lunch and were delighted with the adorable Chaffinches that chirped for a treat!

We concluded the trek by walking through a 800m tunnel which brought us through the mountain into the South which offered a completely different landscape.

The trip had several steps which could be challenging for aged persons with bad knees - but it is manageable (see note below). There were also some narrow passages during the levada, should anyone suffer from the slightest form of vertigo. My husband recently had major knee surgery (< 2 yrs) and can suffer from vertigo - but was perfectly fine on this trek. It was worth each and every single step!!!

The day was perfect and we felt as if we had visited paradise.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"This was out second hike in Madeira done independently without a guide. It is a very nice walk, not an easy one, with lots of stairs, water dripping down from everywhere, narrow paths beside the levada, etc, etc. The walk took us more than 5 hours, but if you don't make often breaks and if you want to walk fast it will actually be quicker.
Highly recommended!",Jan 2011

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"If you like Port then definitely come and do the tour and tasting. We had a group tour with just the four of us. It was extremely informative and interesting. The tour finishes with Port tasting. We were advised to choose two different types, the Tawny and Ruby which we shared. There were three of each and we were told about the tastes we should experience. Excellent value at €22 which includes the three ports each. I think my favourite was the 20 year old Tawny. I know feel like a Port expert. One tip for Graham’s is to sell the Port glasses in the shop as we would have bought them 🙂",Sep 2021

As we had been on the tour before we just wanted to wait and chill for a couple of hours. The lodge has a bar and restaurant attached. So we were directed there by reception. Turned out that the bar was closed. However, the staff were very happy to let us chill and sell us a bottle of wine. Felt a bit peckish so ordered olives and bread. The staff were polite and friendly. When the bill came the bread and olives were only €2-50. For great olives and the best bread we had tasted in Porto that was an absolute bargain.",Jun 2021

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Interesting tour around the port facilities but I am fairly sure this would be similar to others. The tasting was exceptional, going for the super premium tastings at €35 gets you spirited away to a different tasting room with wood panelled walls and Chesterfield arm chairs giving it the feel of a Pall Mall club. You are given a flight of three generously measured ports to which you can add specific wines of your choosing (and a cheese platter). Our guide was knowledgable on the wines. There is no pressure on you to spend wildly, so of course we did. Came away very happy and merry having enjoyed some top notch wines. The Tawny wine progression was noticeably interesting as you went up the ageing. Even my wife thoroughly enjoyed it and she is far from a big port drinker.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Unbelievable experience and amazing value for money! We booked the enogastronomic experience package - Graham’s Lodge Premium Tasting and Lunch - for €60 per person. We started with a guided tour of the wine cellars which was about an hour long, and then was taken into a beautiful tasting room. We had 3 great tastings of Graham’s Port (very generous sizes!) and was also offered a complimentary extra glass of a different type of port also. We were then meant to be having lunch in the Vinum restaurant after 45 mins but the staff did not rush us at all and we stayed in the tasting room for an hour and a half. We then went onto lunch where we had 4 brilliant courses (small appetiser, starter, main (beautifully cooked steak), and dessert, along with 3 glasses of wine throughout and unlimited still or sparkling water and a coffee at the end. The staff were so so lovely and attentive. The views from the restaurant were also great. We then bought some Port from the store afterwards and got a 10% discount for eating in the restaurant. Highlight of our trip to Porto and the package with tour, tasting and lunch was extremely good value for money and made a great full day out!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We were lucky when we arrived we could book an English tour for 10 minutes later. I read later that you have to make a reservation before but maybe because of the COVID it was less busy now.
We had a really nice tour with a very friendly guide who spoke really good English.
They show a video, then you have the tour and beforehand you can choose if you want to do a tasting and which one. They have them in alle price categories.
We did one with tasting and one without a tasting. We thought one tasting was enough for the both of us.

Its a little further away then the other Portcaves but really nice.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We've had just, such, an amazing tour. We've been privileged from the current situation where few tourists are coming and we got a tour for just the two of us. Kind of a private tour for the price of a public tour.

What's more amazing is that the tour has not been rushed within the 1 hour given time but we spent almost three hours asking questions and got lots of explanations.

I don't know how it is under normal circumstances but if you come to visit during this period, you shall absolutely do this tour, it could well become unexpectedly the highlight of your trip.

They have different port wine options, especially three base ones. A basic one (for 17 euros) and two vintage ones for 22 euros (3 glasses of tawny or 3 glasses of ruby). We took the two different vintage ones and this was great to get a very good understanding how each branch is developing as we shared our six glasses.

Different selections were available so my wife and I tasted a total of 6 different ports. The guide was great. Gave an interesting and amusing tour.

We stayed for dinner at Vinum restaurant afterwards. Wow. Tasting menu was phenomenal and portion sizes were great. The house red wine was delicious and the service was fantastic.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"Interesting tour and the guide was very informative, but after going to the Douro Valley and seeing the small family run quintas, it just wasn't as good as their tours and tastings. We can't compare it to the other lodges ad this was the only one we did, but if you have the chance to either go to nova de gaia for the day or do a tour of the douro Valley then go to the valley instead! If not Grahams was very nice. Lovely views from
the tasting room. Lovely setting in its gardens.
You have to email and book in advance. The price depends on your tasting. Our cost €18.50 for the basic package which was two Ruby ports and a ten year old tawny. This was fine for us as we prefer Ruby's, but for port officianados they have more expensive tasting packages. Although everything they have in the tasting packages plus others they sell by the glass so we bought others we wanted to try as well. White port started at €3 for a glass and they had a vintage of the day for €10/glass.
We found the things they sold in the shop cheaper in balhao market. Not necessarily the fancy stuff but the gift set of four small bottles wad €13 in balhao and €15 at Grahams.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"The visitors center is recently renovated and really beautiful. We did the last English tour of the day, 16:45. Advance reservations are required. While you wait for the tour to begin, you can browse their interesting museum. There is a short film, then a tour of barrel ageing areas and cellars with vintages back to 1868. The price of your ticket depends on the ports you want to taste. My husband chose the premium red, I chose the white, so that we could share. It is even possible to order a glass of 1882 port at 500E! We were the last to leave as we wanted to ask questions and look at more displays - staff let us look, which was very nice, no rush.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Make reservations at least several days in advance for the tour & for the restaurant. We couldn’t do either as when our Sheraton hotel called the day before they were fully booked.

It’s a very long steep uphill walk taking at least 20 minutes with no sidewalks up to it. Take an Uber instead for a few euros.

Carry bottled water with you as none of the quintas offered us water.

Superb port – the best we have ever had for the tawny ports & we are port lovers.

We liked the atmosphere & the outstanding views. It was the best quinta we visited with the best port.We enjoyed sitting in some comfy chairs overseeing the magnificent views & drinking port & having appetizers.

Suggestions to Grahams:
Put signage when you enter to tell you where the tasting room, tours & restaurants are. We wandered around until we found the tasting room.

We would have paid for the more expensive port tasting if it was offered to us.

Explain there is no table service. We sat down & waited for around 10 minutes until I finally went to the bar where they explained there was no table service & you had to keep going up to the bar & pay for each drink. Table service would have been preferred so we could order more port/appetizers & could have started a tab.

We would have gone on the tour or ate in the restaurant if they had a cancellation so maybe ask if the person wants one when entering. No one asked us.

The tour was very informative and neither too long nor too short. It was not cheap, but we felt it was worth what we paid. The least expensive version of the tour was 17 euros and included three fairly basic ports. If you pay more, you get higher end pours.
We choose mid level, one flight of ruby ports and one of tawnies. We spent our extra money to have a cheese plate, which I think made the tasting much more enjoyable.

We selected the premium tastings and mixed and matched both the tawny and vintage ports. Worked really well. Worth the extra money if you like port or want to try some relatively expensive wines with no risk. To be fair all the premium wines were very good to exceptional!

These ports are much smoother and so full of delicate taste and flavour. Overall, really enjoyable experience, highly recommend.

2 suggestions for the Lodge:
1. Organise a shuttle bus from the cable car station to the lodge. We hiked from the Douro embankment to the lodge and it was not a pleasant walk.
2. Make more interactive displays about how the port is created, fermentation process, etc.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,A great experience learning about the production and storage of port at this family run lodge. Wonderful to see how the port develops in the barrel and then to see the vintage bottles stored behind gated rooms. Finally a tasting to sample 3 different types of port... A perfect way to prepare for an excellent lunch in the attached restaurant.,Oct 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We had a tour by Matthew and followed with dinner in the restaurant Vinum. Both were fantastic. I don't love Port but my husband does so he particularly enjoyed it. We learned a lot and the tasting at the end was really great. As others mentioned you do have to book in advance, but I would highly recommend this.",Oct 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"The 45 minute tour was interesting, but a bit dry and hard to follow at times. The guide said to ask any questions we wanted, but when we did he said it wasn’t important and he would tell us the answer later. I get this could be theatrics based on the planned tour, but it was kind of harsh in the situation - he also never provided the answer. There was a lot of discussion on what I later realized was the vintage v. Limited bottle vintage determinations, but at the time it seemed we were just looking for our birth years in the cellar. What was great, was the actual tasting. It was the best port we tried in Porto and a really beautiful setting - even in the rain. Travelers be warned - we were dropped by our Uber at the designated spot, which proved to be very far from the actual entrance resulting in a very wet excursion. It might be beautiful in the summer, but a quicker route (against the signs) could be followed in the rain I think. Enjoy!

Location is tricky to find, especially if driving yourself, so give yourself time to find it. The lodge tour is a wonderful experience. Highly recommend. If you want a GREAT restaurant down the road, go out the door of the winery, turn right and its the first building (apartment building) on the left. AMAZING food and service. Fairly new.",Oct 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"The Graham’s tour was really interesting - John was super informative and knew his stuff!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We did several port tours during our stay and this was by far the best. I’d never had port before and we were recommended to purchase the premium ruby and premium tawny tasting and share them. This was a brilliant idea and meant we got a very well rounded experience. The tour was very informative and the port tasted great. We also got the cheese tasting with the port which was tasty and obviously went well with the port. This was also the only port house we visited that gave us water with the port, which was great for clearing our palates between ports but also helped with hydration. I would definitely recommend this tour.
In addition you get a great view of the river from this port house.

The young lady who hosted our visit, Cynthia was very professional and knowledgeable not only about port but the full history of Graham's.

Would probably love me to visit one of their grape sites as they also looked amazing.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"My fiancé and I have just returned from Porto and we chose this tour on a recommendation from a friend. We were so glad we did! Excellent from start to finish. Great seeing all the barrels and some bottles from the 1860s. We learnt a lot about the origins of port, there were a couple of videos but nothing was rushed or too touristy. The tasting at the end was fab, we loved the tawnys! A perfect way to spend an afternoon and we’ll worth the walk over to Graham’s (which is a bit further out of the centre than some of the other port houses). Go, you won’t regret it!",Oct 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"I just returned from 8 days in Porto. There is not a port tour my friend and I haven't taken while visiting this city, since we've been port wine enthusiasts for decades. Our entire vacation was all about port wine, its history and everything else about it. What can I say, I simply love the stuff. The Graham's Port Lodge tour was by far the best one in town. Everything about it was absolutely perfect. The grounds, the store, the staff, restaurant(s) and the educational part of it. We were even able to purchase a very special post wine tasting package that included a 1972 Colheita port that was absolutely marvelous. If you are planning to tour port wine lodges make sure this is that last one on your list. We went there first so no other tour really impressed us. Leave the best for last.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We had a very enjoyable tour and learned about port production in the process.

The tour commenced with a short video that showed the Graham's vineyards above the Douro River and explained a little about the terroir and micro-climates, as well as the process for harvesting the grapes and converting them to port.

The tour then took us through the main storage warehouse, explaining the process of storing and ageing port in wooden barrels and large wooden vats. Our guide then showed another (similar) video but provided his own narration. This included background on the history of Graham's and the Symington family that now owns the company. Then we were taken to a cellar to see some older bottles of vintage port, that date back to 1868.

Next up was the tasting. Prior to starting the tour, each participant gets to choose which ports they will taste, from a selection of six options. Each option includes three glasses of port, but the price varies based on the ports within each option. Our guide explained a little about each of the ports that we were about to taste, including tips on suitable accompaniments for each (e.g. different cheeses, chocolate, etc.). We were then left to savour the ports in our own time.

On the way out, there is a gift store where bottles of port can be purchased, along with T-shirts and other items.

An appointment is usually required for a tour. It is definitely worth making it up the hill for.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"This lodge maye be a bit further up the hill than some - but it is surely one of the most magnificent.
We ended up going here as a second choice as Grahams booking system wasn't working for us - but we were so glad we made the switch.
Guide was excellent, spoke very good English, extremely knowledgeable and had the required sense of humour.
Lodge itself was eye opening and on a very grand scale.
Post tasting at end also opened our eyes to how nice some of the Port is that has been sitting on the supermarket shelves back home for years.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"We booked the tour and tasting at Graham's on line before our recent trip to Portuugal. Hiking up the hill was an adventure and the route we used had signage that was very limited and confusing. We finally made it to the entey and checked in. After a short wait the tour began and was pretty good. Some of the audio-visual resources were not fully functioning and the tour guide was good but not great. She shared with the group that she was not asked to stay for the winter season. We had reserved the Super premuim tawny and vintage port tastings and they did not disappoint, though at the 45 euro price tag having to buy your accompanying cheese or chocolate was annoying. Overall, this was a good introduction to the whole ""port wine scene"" and I rated it very good, but it fell short of excellent due to the problems with the tour and the cost to value of the tastings. Having said that the 40 yr tawny port was probably the best we tasted in Vila Novo de Gaia.

And what a view!",Oct 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"You must request a tour in advance and from the outset it was clear that this was a very well run operation. The initial response time and subsequent communication was excellent.
When you arrive, you are offered a range of prices which reflect the cost of the tastings at the end of your tour. They start at €17 and go well beyond the price range we were looking at. Before the tour, there was a small museum area which was well worth a browse.
The tour itself was a mixture of pre-recorded videos and a human guide. Our guide was very informative and welcoming and that was definitely more enjoyable than the video elements.
We went for the €35 tasting which consisted of Six Grapes, 2000 Vintage and 30 year old Tawny. The latter two would be out of our price range for a bottle so it was very enjoyable to taste something more special than you would get in your supermarket.
Would recommend this tour as a great introduction to port and would suggest that a real enthusiast would relish some of the more expensive tasting options.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"This wonderful place doesn't need another great review, but here goes. Graham's sits magisterially at a bit of a remove and up from the other port lodges, so I took a taxi. Well worth it. I got in by luck (maybe it was charm, maybe not) due to the kindness of the receptionist: you're supposed to reserve a place on a tour. I paid some more to have a slightly more special tasting at the end of the tour. It was well worth it. The tour was informative and interesting and, at its end, those of us who had paid extra were taken into a special tasting room for our various tastings. Mine included a 30 year old tawny and it was thrilling.
Afterwards, I admired the glorious views and wandered across and down to Taylor's for a wonderful lunch and more wonderful views. After that, I made my way down towards the river via a few more lodges.
A beautiful afternoon.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"There are many port wine lodges and it´s hard to decide which to do. We´ve been to Porto a few times and would say that what Graham´s has to offer is quality tasting and a smart, informative tour; the short films, especially on the vineyards along the Douro, are especially helpful. The visit was particularly focused on the background of ownership, the heritage of the port and, in the tastings, the opportunity to try and learn about the different types. We opted (for the second time) for the Premium/ vintage/ tawny tastings, to get a good idea of he variety of ports that we´d been learning about, and it was well worth it. The commentary with the tastings was excellent- our guide spent a long time talking us through each one in an informed and interesting session. We brought our whole family, who´d never been to Porto and they were both impressed and informed by the experience. We also had a drink and some snacks in the bar, which had great views and friendly service. Your visit needs booking in advance- and they´ll do a reminder- but you get to opt for your tasting on the day. Highly recommended.

There are several tasting options, ranging from basic and inexpensive, to quite deluxe. If you truly enjoy Port, I heartily recommend the Symington tasting, which serves 4 vintage ports as well as the 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, and 40yr Tawny Ports. Since that is a lot to drink, you are able to share the tasting with your spouse. After the tour and tasting, check out their beautiful patio overlooking the Douro (with great views), where you can enjoy a bite to eat and another drink!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We have been collecting Port wines for decades, but in September, finally had the opportunity to go to “the source,” Vila Nova de Gaia, across the Douro River from Porto. One of our first Port houses was Graham’s.

Going way, way back, Graham’s Six Grape Ruby Port was one of the first Ruby Ports, which I encountered. Since that early introduction, I have collected their Vintage Ports, and enjoyed many of their Tawny ports.

For this early Autumn visit, we only did the tastings, and they were spectacular, covering pretty much examples of the portfolio, and ending with four Vintage Ports, to cap the afternoon off.

Though part of the Symington corporate structure, Graham’s maintains its “house-style,” and their wines are unique, and well-worth exploring.

From their “introductory” Rubies, to their glorious Vintage Ports, every wine was excellent, and I highly recommend tasting the wines of Graham’s.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,Graham's was recommended as the port lodge to go to and it did not disappoint. The entrance to the caves is located around the back of the lodge and you start the tour with a video (which means your not holding up the group or being left behind if you are late like I was). You the get to explore the cellars with a knowledgeable guide and finish off with a port tasting (the port is great no matter which tasting you go for). The views from the lodge are also spectacular. The only word of warning is book ahead - it's a little bit of a hike up there and it would be very frustrating to get turned away at the door if they don't have space on the tour.,Aug 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We enjoy port but wouldn’t say we were connoisseurs! And thought it would be interesting to find out a little more information on the different types and techniques of making port.... we were not disappointed... the film starting was informative and Cecilia, our tour guide was full of information, answering many questions from all of us. It didn’t feel rushed and there was quite a bit to see. You can choose different ‘packages’ of port for your tasting and we went for the 45euro Tawny and Vintage choices,,, Cecilia came back and chatted about the tastes and techniques, which was extremely helpful.... the ports were all delicious too! Well worth the money and would love to do again.... we also stayed on the terrace for a glass of wine and a snack which was also delicious!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"The tour session wasn't very long, but quite informative. There was a general background video at the beginning and then our guide lead us around the cellar. The cellar was so nice to see and fun to hear the stories behind it. You can choose the wine tasting menu before your tour starts and our picks were absolutely worth the money. Definitely recommend it.",Aug 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Not really a port officionado but found it very interesting. We went for the two €22 sets of Ruby and Tawney.

Didn't feel rushed and the tasting afterwards was fun and tasty. Would happily spend longer there.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"I love port! Hence our family visit to Porto and pre-arranged visit to Graham's. The walk up to the lodge rewarded us with some splendid views and the buildings were beautifully maintained with that wonderful smell of aged wines that was instantly comforting.
The tour started with an informative video followed by a visit around the facilities. Whilst this too was interesting I felt slightly rushed; we weren't allowed to linger for a moment. Tour groups are obviously big business, with groups departing every 15 minutes or so, therefore the guides will be under instruction to 'keep the pace up'. Fortunately we were able to take our time during the tasting and I would recommend stepping up from the basic port selection to try some of their finer wines. They were also cheaper to buy in the tasting room than in the outside café.
We also stopped for a coffee and snacks in the café which were very pleasant.

The visitor areas are clean and modern within the old style of a port house. The setting and views are gorgeous. The tastings were well priced and all delicious. As a couple, we had a different tasting each which meant that we got to taste six different ports - perfect!",Aug 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"I booked this tour online before I left the UK for the late afternoon at 16:45. However my guided walk through Porto, with a stop for lunch took less time than planned and so I was very grateful when the staff allowed me to attend the earlier 15:45 session. It is a steep climb up to the entrance so if you are walking try not to go at the hottest part of the day.

I know nothing about Port; never tried it so I went for the classic tasting of a ruby, a tawny and a 2000 vintage which is held in a lovely room that resembles an old fashioned study. I learnt so much about port that on my subsequent Duoro river cruise I was able to speak like an expert. They also gave me a glass of white port for free. Marvelous setting with lots of information.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We were a family of 6 holidaying in Porto. We got an Uber there which came to about 10euros from rua de santa catalina - the Uber drivers don't take long whizzing through the traffic, was a 15 to 20 minute ride at 11am. We had a guided tour followed by basic tastings. The tour was excellent, not too long, and our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. It was interesting learning about the vineyards and grape varieties, and the harvest. We purchased the cheese board and chocolate truffles to go with tastings which were very nice and I'd recommend. We enjoyed our tasting so much we bought more types of white, crusted and tawny port to try afterwards! It's a good idea to get several types of tasting, it's worth it. The building and surrounding areas are well kept and the terrace and Vinum restaurant has amazing views of the Douro river and bridges. The cellars are immaculate. I feel Graham's is a high quality port compared to others, and it's really nice that it's a family business - they seem to care about producing high quality products and it's evident when you visit this lodge. Tip: stay in the tasting room if you want to try cheaper port, the Vinum restaurant and terrace is almost twice as expensive! But you can get cocktails and house wine on the terrace if you want. This was definitely a highlight of our trip!

The Graham tour is well organized and professional. You get the feeling that this is big bit industry, which it also is, but you miss the heart, that you get from visiting some of the smaller wine yards (Quintas) in the countryside around the Douro",Jul 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,Very interesting tour in beautiful lodge overlooking Porto. The whole family loved it. Matthew was an excellent guide. I made a stupid mistake with the date but they kindly fitted us in even though they were very busy. Most grateful as my father had worked there in the 50s and it was the reason for our visit to Porto. Would have been so upset to have missed it. Only regret was that we hadn’t booked lunch as the restaurant looked fabulous and much nicer than anywhere in town. Warning: Porto is very busy and it took us 45 minutes to get there through the traffic.,Jul 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"A really enjoyable tour, which you will need to book in advance, and lasts around 90 mins. The tour starts with a short video and is followed by the guide touring you around the cellars and interesting explanations on the different ports which Grahams make.

Each couple went for 1x premium port and 1x premium tawny tasting (each cost 22 euros per person) so that we could both try each of the six different ports. The tour ends in the shop which will tempt you with a vast array of ports from across the years.

A really enjoyable tour which we thought was great value for money.

Our tour was informative and superbly delivered, to the point where you would gave thought he was a member of the Symington family as his enthusiasm for port was amazing.
So onto the tasting 4 ruby ports & 4 tawnys with no expense spared either the bottles ranging between 13e to 142e we were treated to a great selection.

The Graham’s Tasting about 30 euros) in the vintage room was a good choice for us. Also a great restaurant with a view. The shop sells all the port and also ships internationally. Prices were about 15% than London prices for the same bottles at the time of my visit.,Jul 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"This is, hands down, the best situated port lodge in Porto. Up on the hill, you are in the surrounded by farms and gardens, with an amazing view of the city on both sides of the Douro. Being a solo visitor I was denied a port flight, which was disappointing (what;s up with this, i had no such problem in other lodges, such as Taylor's). The selection was the standard Symington options of Graham's, Warre's and Dow's, of which my preferences goes to the ""masculine"" feeling of the latter two. A good selection of ports to buy for all tastes and pockets. A good discussion with a (female) bartender, who knew the inns and outs of different vintages and styles, and seemed to love the wine, which was very cool. Sitting on the terrace, with those views and a few glasses of port, what else can you want?

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"The place is amazing, the tasting wonderful – thanks to the guide for the recommendation to take 2 different sets.
And now what we did not like: we have chosen this Port lodge because they offered tours in Russian. We wanted to find out about what is port wine, the history of it, traditions and other interesting facts. But the tour tells you mainly the story and the advertisement of Graham’s and not port wine itself.
Our city guide told us about the history of port wine more than we knew during the visit to the port lodge. And still – the tasting was fantastic! 😊

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We really enjoyed the Port tasting and tour of the Port cellars at Graham’s. If you are staying in Porto, when you cross the Douro to Vila Nova de GAIA, you will find Graham’s is the furthest to reach of the Port lodges but we tool the cable car down to the riverside and then it’s about a 10 minute walk that is worth the effort as the views down to the Douro are fabulous from Graham’s.

The price of 22 euros each for the tour and tasting is worth every penny for what is a unique and truly enjoyable experience. Included in that price was a tasting of 6 Ports (we chose 3 vintage and 3 tawny). The guided tour also starts with a short film about the history of Graham’s and Port making in the Douro valley.

If you do one thing in Porto, this should be it. Thoroughly recommended.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We turned up on the off chance they had availability and they did! Although, I will day this is very risky. The staff were so friendly and informative. The tour is the same for everyone but it's the tasting package that differs. Tour first, and then tasting. We picked the super premium tawney and super premium vintage. Both 45euros each but worth it. You go I to a different room with this is package and it's a lot more cosy and sophisticated. We were not rushed at all and spent at least an hour in there savouring the port. There was a more extensive menu so you could order more by the glass of you wished. We also ordered some delicious chocolate truffles to go with the port. A staff member talks through each port you have chosen and then leaves you to enjoy them. Highly recommend the vintage tasting. Where else will you get to try vintage ports? As once opened, the bottle needs to be drank within 24-48 hours at most. Very informative interesting tour. Spotless toilets and great shop at the end. Don't miss Grahams!

We had the Tawny premium and the Vintage Port Premium tastings at the library room. I highly recommend it! My partner used to say he is not fond of ports... until he tried the vintage ones! There was no rush to finish our tasting, which was nice. Unfortunately I ended up forgetting my phone at the lodge (too much fun wine tasting maybe?). That’s when their customer service was top notch, keeping in touch with me and sending it to the place I was heading to in Lisbon. Can’t say enough good things about them!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"There are a number of port lodges running tours in the area and I think that Graham's is the furthest away from central Porto - around a 40 minute walk and uphill all the way (!), however, the prize is the view from their beautiful terrace where you can also have lunch - as our tour had been booked by our travel company for 5pm we missed this opportunity, but we spoke to people who had eaten there and the reviews were glowing.
The tours are clearly staggered as there were groups at various stages as we started and the process was like a well-oiled machine, even if our guide did somewhat gallop through the information she clearly had to deliver! There was some confusion as to what had been booked - we were offered, and paid, for the opportunity to taste six further ports of various ages beyond the standard three (reserve, tawny and vintage), but in the end we were offered only four in addition - everyone seemed very confused, not just us, so be absolutely clear when you are booking what you are paying for. However, it was an informative and enjoyable experience and I now know infinitely more about port than I did before! The exit is through their shop, so you can purchase ports that you have tasted. If you don't want to lug them back to your hotel or pack them, there is a reasonably wide selection of ports at duty free!

You have to book ahead and when you arrive you choose the value of your ticket which refers to the three wines which you wish to taste at the end of your tour
The tour begins with a short five minute video about how the grapes are grown and how the wine is treated. You are then guided through the huge cellars containing rows of huge barrels 6ft hight whilst the guide tells you about the production of Grahams port wine and the types of port Ruby Tawny and vintage and how they are made. With the help of a wall map the guide shows the location of the vineyards and explains how they are favoured by the geography soil and climate of the upper Douro river . He also briefly summarises the history of the Symington family who now own the company. You then move on to see the vintage port maturing in bottles some from as long ago as 1900. The tour finishes with a tasting in which the guide explains what to notice with each wine as you see smell and taste it. He also discusses how long they keep once the bottle is opened and at what temperature they should be drunk, food parings are also mentioned.
We felt that this was an excellent choice of Lodge especially as you can go afterwards to the wine bar which has a balcony overlooking the city.
Our young guide Mr Hoog was an excellent and knowledgeable lecturer . It was all surprisingly interesting.

Having a personal tour guide who was full of energy and able to answer all of our questions made it a much more memorable experience. It is a lot more expensive but you get to sample some exceptional ports. My favourite was an ‘83 Vintage. But we also tasted 30 yr old tawny. Well worth the higher price for a special trip,Jun 2019

A confirmation email is sent and on the day you receive a reminder. There is a small museum on site which tells the history of the lodge.

Our guide was Philippa who was very knowledgeable and made the whole tour a delight no matter what was asked she knew the answer, it was a very relaxed and interesting tour. The tasting was very well organised and again Philippa explained all the ports we tried, it was not rushed and no one pressured you to hurry up or buy anything. The climb from the front is well worth it as the view is fantastic, there is a restaurant there but there is also a terrace where drinks and snacks are available. A great afternoon out we learned a great deal, sampled 6 ports and now have our favourites.

We had heard it was a bit of an uphill trek to get there, and as it was a warm sunny day we decided to take a taxi. And, when we were finished, the girl at the restaurant reception called a taxi for us and it arrived within minutes. All staff we encountered were pleasant and courteous and visitor-orientated. The tour starts with a short film, then a guide took us into the cellars and gave a lot of history of the Symington family and how port is made etc. Then it was time for tasting - when you arrive at reception you choose which tastings you would like - having heard good things about the Vintage Room we decided to opt for that and the three of us selected different tastings - the Graham's tasting, the Premium Port tasting and the Premium Tawny tasting so we got to try 9 different ports in total! The Vintage Room has a gentlemen's club/old library sort of vibe which adds to the tasting experience. Only one person has to choose one of the Vintage Room tasting selections, the others can be from the Main Tasting Room 'menu'. After that we sat out on the sunny terrace balcony with superb views over Porto and enjoyed some lovely wine and small bites from the wine bar.

It wasn't no audio tour, but with a guide, that told the story behind Graham's and port wine. Also it was nice, as you could ask questions at any time. Afterwards, I do know the difference between ruby and tawny ports.

Also the tour included tasting (depending on your choice). For the couples (or groups) I do recommend taking a different tastings as you get more to taste (as in type and quality, not quantity). For the tasting, tasting notes and information was given.

For us, it was an excellent tour and would recommend it to anyone.

After the tour and tasting, we went for a lunch at Vinum restaurant, located within same premises as the Graham's Port Lodge (reservation needed/recommended). Lunch was great but more of that on Vinum's page

Good to go as long as I respect their closing time, which is thirty minutes away. Out of nowhere, manager intervenes to cancel the tasting, despite team saying it was okay.

Arrived towards the end of the day, after lost Uber and hike, to finally arrive at this place for the first time ever. Security guard points down the hill, no explanation. Rush.
Am routed to a staff room on their smoke break (!) where they kindly tell me I'm probably still good for the tasting room. Follow their directions, enter the restaurant. This is the wrong place to be, but the hostess kindly directs me to the next room over. Meet helpful bartender, the tasting room is actually one more room down. Okay! Reach it, the kindly staff member in the tasting room explains they will be closing soon (30 or so mins) but I am welcome if I am quick. Okay! It's my last day in Porto and so I am game, given Graham's reputation and the nearly 1.5 hr saga (traffic, sun-drenched walk) to get here. The tasting glasses are about to be laid out. The manager suddenly interjects (has been sitting there silent, until now): nope, we're closed. But your team just told me yes? But it's my last day here, won't be a tomorrow? Doesn't matter, sends me away with no explanation.

I think you can and should do better, fellow travelers!

Casks, Vats, Barrel, Vintage Bottles, what a dream!
Tasting is excellent by definition and you can choose different levels (and prices...).

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Started off with an introductory video. We had a tour of the caves then the tasting. Everyone chooses their own upon entrance and pays appropriately. We had a premium tasting, which was in a smaller, more intimate room with vintage ports and old tawny ports. Delicious! Highly recommend!",May 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We booked the port tasting and tour as part of our Ruby Wedding Anniversary trip to Porto. It was a lovely experience and a real high point of our holiday. We walked up to the lodge from the riverside. It was a hot day and the walk up is all uphill, so take care if you have trouble walking any distance. It may be better to drive or take a taxi. It was a difficult choice as to which port tasting experience to choose but both my husband and I were glad that we didn't opt for the cheapest one just because of the price. We have often drunk the cheaper ports and it was brilliant to taste the subtle differences of the more expensive ones that we would normally not be able to buy. When we saw the prices of the ports per bottle later, we realised that the tour and tasting were not as expensive as they may have appeared at first. Before the tasting, however, was the tour. It was a very enjoyable experience and although we already knew quite a lot about port, we still learned lots of interesting facts about the port lodge, its history and the process involved in producing fine port. Our guide, Assel, (I hope I got her name right), was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. She was obviously very new to the job and still has a lot to learn but her manner was delightful and she made the tour interesting and fun. We also met some very nice people who were tasting ports in the Vintage Room with us. Of course, after the tasting, we spent some time browsing the shop and made some purchases. It's very easy to spend more money than you intended, but take your time and don't impulse buy. The staff were very helpful and did not rush you into buying. The entire afternoon was a very enjoyable experience.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,1.0,"Went for a wine tour, the tour was alright. But the experience post the tour was not pleasant. I had actually left my jacket at the tour and realised when I reached the hotel. I called them to confirm the same and made about 15 to 20 calls. 10 to 12 of which weren't recieved and the rest of the calls were answered by different staff who all understood my problem and promised to revert to me within a few minutes and I did not hear from any of them. I have called so many times and each time I requested them to respond with whether they found the jacket or not and non of them responded. They infact stopped receiving calls which I felt was quite unprofessional. I still haven't heard from them. Wish the staff was more helpful.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"There are so many port houses in Porto that most people would be hard pressed to visit more than a few. We knew we needed to narrow down our selection and we decided to visit Graham’s. We made an on-line reservation well before our visit. We liked that you reserved the tour, but didn’t need to select which tasting package you wanted until you were there. Prices for tours range from 17€ for a classic tasting up to considerably more for rarer pours. The tour itself was thorough and you really got a sense of the process and the Symington family who owns the cellar. Seeing 4 million liters of port in barrels was pretty amazing. The tasting room is light and bright and at the end of the tour, your selected tasting is ready for you. The ports were great and had a depth of flavor that we didn’t find in some other ports we tried during our time in Porto. The lodge itself is a bit removed from the main drag so it will take about 20 minutes to walk there from the waterfront in Gaia or you can grab a taxi or Uber.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"It was one of the best experiences I've ever had! I was really looking forward to this, and yet the reality exceeded my expectations.

I've purchased the Symington tasting. Symington tasting includes 8 wines, 4 tawny wines & 4 vintage port. My my! This is what heaven must tastes like!!! I accompanied my wines with chocolate truffles, the compination was perfect!

After extensive research, I choose Graham's port lodge because it seemed as the less touristic one, and that was spot on. The wines were simply extraordinary, of course some I liked better than others, but overall the quality was very good.

My personal favorite, was Warre's 1980 vintage port. I day dream about it regularly, and it is a matter of time before I order it from Graham's.

It's totally worth it!

We learnt a little about the family history, the port making process and had a great tour of the cellars. Book online in advance and decide on what ports to taste when you arrive.
We booked a table at the restaurant for lunch - window seat with possibly the best view of Porto and the Douro. Good service, lovely food and the set menu was great.",May 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,Very nicely kept building with some great port wines. I’ve been to two of these tastings and this one was by far the best. The only thing is I wished I could have purchased the wine I tasted as they were sold out in the gift shop. Good spot for an evening glass of wine or dinner also as they have a separate restaurant and bar.,May 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We made a day of it. We walked across the bridhe and along the river then up the hill to Graham's. Beware that it does get quite steep and the signage isn't great. We arrived a little early and had cocktails on the terrace overlooking Porto. The cocktails were excellent and the service prompt. We ate a fabulous lunch then took the tour and the €35 tasting in the library. Great ambiance, lovely setting and fabulous port. Somewhat merry we walked back down the hill and got the cable car back to the bridge. Fabulous views and a rest for the legs. Take it slowly, savour every moment and have a grand day. Make sure you book the tour in advance and make a restaurant reservation. The tour is informative and about the right length.

The information on Graham’s, the Douro Valley, and the port trade was presented well. The port tasting was incredible. My wife and I shared the Premium Vintage Selection and the Premium Tawny Selection. The 1983 Vintage was sublime. Amazing port. The 30 year old Tawny was quite nice, but then the 40 year old Tawny was wonderful.

I highly recommend Graham’s. Be sure to enjoy a tasting.",May 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,Great tour and tasting of Graham’s. Beautiful facility and classy comfortable tasting room.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,We visited Graham’s for a tour and tasting and the visit exceeded my expectations. We had visited a vineyard in the Duoro Valley the day before so I was expecting to hear similar facts but they went into a lot more detail and added to our understanding of port making. The venue is beautiful. I haven’t done a tour of any of the other lodges in Porto but can recommend Graham’s.,May 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"When we got to Vila Nova de Gaia, Graham’s was the first stop we made. If you’re walking from the main river area, beware, it is a short hike uphill and on a hot day that can be tiring. But it is well worth the hike up.

If you want to do the tasting and tour, you need to reserve ahead of time. They book up fast, especially English tours. I thought the tour could have been cut shorter. The informational video in the beginning was ok. Our tour guide was good. She explained the process of how the port wine is made, the significance of vintage ports, and showed us the private cellar. The cellar and the realization of how long some of these wines have been aging is incredible.

The tasting itself was great. This was our first tasting in the region and it didn’t disappoint. The port is very good. However shipping to the US, as is the case with every producer is pricey! At least 70 euro minimum. So plan accordingly if you’re trying to bring wine home. Also go check out their small museum as you are waiting for your tour to begin. You’ll see the history of the place and also how many dignitaries throughout history love this producer!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"João conducted an English-speaking tour which began with a video of the Douro valley, the source of Port's grapes. A trip through the cellar began with a review of Graham's history along with the production geography and was followed by insights into how Graham's (and sister brands) approach the process of creating great ports. Then the tasting. I chose the Super-Premium tasting, because I wanted to try Graham's 40-year old tawny. The tasting included the 40- as well as a 30-year old and the single harvest 1994. The cost of the tasting is 45 euros, a step up from the 35 for the premium tasting, but less than the charge for sampling them all a la carte. The 40- was sublime and the others superb. To me, the Super-Premium was well worth it. Those I respect had recommended the Graham's tour as one of the best. I second the recommendations enthusiastically.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We booked a tour of Graham’s online . They were very responsive and even sent a reminder the day prior. The lodge is the last one on the other side of the river. We decided to walk but be warned it is a hike. The tour itself was excellent with our guide taking the time to ensure all present had the opportunity to ask questions and take pictures. There were 6 people on this English speaking tour so not too large. On this trip to Portugal we had come to enjoy our port. The tour helped us understand the differences between ruby and tawny and vintages vs the 10, 20 , 30 year old. The tasting we purchased was excellent as was the explanation provided by our guide. The venue is fantastic with a great view down the river once outside. Our only disappointment is that we could not purchase a book explaining the various techniques as they were sold out, odd to be sold out of English books at 10 am.
Recommend the tour.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Yes this place isn’t as cheap as others for tasting. Yes, other places give longer tours. However, having been on a number of wine, sherry and port tasting tours I think Graham’s has a great offering. Cecelia (our guide) was incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgeable and while the tour didn’t go on for ages I certainly felt well-informed and felt it was an appropriate length. We opted for the €35 tasting which immediately meant we were ‘upgraded’ to another tasting room full of old books and with a great atmosphere - we felt very special! When you consider some of the ports we tasted were €18 a glass and we got 3 glasses and a tour for €35 I think that’s good value! Go, enjoy the tour, learn, taste amazing port, sit in the terrace and enjoy the magnificent views. Life is good here!

My wife and I opted for the €22 tastings of vintage ports and tawnys respectively which we felt was good value inclusive of the tour. This lodge has a wonderful elevated view down the river and we capped off a great morning with an excellent lunch at their restaurant. This is well worth the walk up the hill.",Apr 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Graham's was one of the more expensive tasting and tours that we went on while in Porto, and as mentioned in other reviews, it is one of the furthest out from the main street. However, I can say that it was well worth both the money and the uphill walk.
You have to notify Graham's in advance to let them know you are coming and they provide you with a list of tastings and experiences to pick from. When we arrived, they advised us to buy two different tastings (Premium Port Tasting and Premium Tawny Tasting) to ensure that we could taste a variety of wines between us.
The tour begins with a very informative video that tells you all about the Douro Valley and the process of port making. Afterwards, you meet with a guide who takes you on your tour of the cellars. This was really the highlight of the tour as our guide was very knowledgeable, with little tidbits of information that really added to the experience. She also spoke absolutely fantastic English. However, what really set her apart was how she made the tour feel personal, even though there was around 15 people in the group. She took us through the various elements of the cellars, looking at the different casks and vats and showing us the bottle-aging vintages, giving us time to see if any of our significant years were vintages (our birth year was!). What was nice about the Graham's tour is that there were so many links to its own heritage, such as legers from previous centuries available to be viewed.
Finally, the tasting. As previously mentioned, my boyfriend and I were advised to have different tastings, which allowed us to sample six wines between us, which were delicious. They also had cheese and chocolate boards made up, ready for us to pair with the port. A small detail that I appreciated was they has a jug of water available, which is an essential when drinking something as strong as port, but many other cellars overlooked.
Overall, an enjoyable and informative tour which was well worth the money and the walk

He gave an enthusiastic and eloquent introduction to the history of Graham’s, their philosophy, facilities and range of brands and products, while deftly answering any and all questions thrown at him.

My wife and I each chose a different tasting, hers featuring three tawnies (regular, 10 years and 20 years), mine featuring an LBV, a crusty (2013) and a 2005 Quinta dos Malvedos. Quantities were generous, and afterwards João took time to answer a further slew of questions we had for him.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Graham's is a company with a really interesting history. You need to book the tour and my advice is to give yourself at least thirty minutes before the tour starts to review some of the documents and read some of the stories on the panels.
The tour starts with an interesting film: bit of history; bit of romance; bit of an explanation about port.
The tour itself takes place, for the most part in a cellar with rank after rank of port barrels and vats. Our guide brought her story to life as she took us through the cellar pointing out interesting barrels and giving a detailed explanation of the port-making process and the history of the business.
The amount that you pay depends on the ports that you choose to taste in the very well-appointed tasting room. Three good measures rounded off a really interesting hour's tour.

Our guide was excellent and told us lots of interesting facts and the background to the family history associated with port. We opted for a tasting of vintage and tawny port. Again more useful advice on which one to taste first, how quickly port should be drunk once the bottle is opened.
After the tasting we walked out onto the terrace, there is a lovely conservatory restaurant but we decided we weren't hungry. Standing on the terrace with the sun shining and a wonderful view of Porto we decided it would have been rude not to try a Porto Tonica! It was gorgeous and set our tastebuds going.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"When in Porto, you have to take in at least one Port Wine Lodge visit. Grahams lodge visit is lovely, well laid out and an extremely good price. The tour is great but in my opinion the experience could be much more of a journey of the process and history. It looks like that is the intention, but I expect that space maybe an issue. Do not get me wrong the tour is good value and informative as was our guide. The tasting was fantastic, My wife and I went for the VIP 3 x ports and 3 x tawny ports all at very good ages, I also chose some of the tasting snacks as well. Luckily I got a taxi as my wife finds generally Port too sweet for her taste...so all 6 for me... ;))) Would highly recommend the VIP tasting as the Ports on offer are rarer and better to taste in this setting. The shop is well stocked, but, unfortunately, I could not purchase any port to take home as I only had a small non-checked luggage case for the flight home - but this means that I have to visit again. Make sure you pre book the on site restaurant Vinum for after the tour as for me and my wife it was an essential part of the experience!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"I have visited Graham's three times over the years. And it remains my favorite port lodge. The tour keeps getting better, so even if you have done it in the past, it's worth revisiting. Our guide, Mario, spoke perfect English and was very very knowledgable. I thought he had worked there for years (despite his youthful appearance), but it turns out this was only his second month.

The tastings are also very very good. I have done both a premium experience and a library experience. I prefer the library tastings of higher end samples, but it really depends on who you go with. My friend that joined me this time wasn't sure she loved port, so we did a premium tasting. Turns out she loved what she tried (as I knew she would)!

Definitely make Graham's a stop on any port tasting in Gaia. And the views from the terrace where you can eat lunch or dinner or also some of the best in the city.

It seemed like an awkward segway. We looked for our favorite port from the tasting in the shop and couldn't find it. It would have been nice to have had a guide.
We had appetizers at the restaurant and the calamari was excellent. The restaurant is very very elegant and would be a great place for a nice dinner, but they didn't make us feel bad for our t-shirts and jeans. Lovely place, and worth the trek up the hill!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We have just returned from 3 days in Porto, in which time we did tours of both the Sandeman and Graham’s port houses. The former was decent but Graham’s was equisite.It’s a bit of a walk to get there but well worth it. Being up on the hill and away from the crowds, it almost felt like we were in the countryside when sat on the terrace.
First we had lunch at the restaurant, which was quite pricey but the seafood and wine was very good. From there you have great views of the Duoro, bridge and the city. After lunch I did the premium tawny tour and my wife did the premium vintage tour (the same tour but with different tasting samples at the end). The tour guide Alex Torres was brilliant - very informative, knowledgable and spoke perfect English. I learned a lot from Alex. There were 150 year old vintage ports in there. Saving the best until last, we got to drink 3 ports at the end - I had the Tawny, 10 year Tawny and 20 year Tawny. We stayed for more port and cream custard cakes on the terrace afterwards. Graham’s Tawny was the best port I’ve tasted.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,My husband and I recently visited Porto and wanted to do a Port wine tasting. Graham's cellar was exquisite! We did a group wine tasting and Ania was our tour guide. She was extremely knowledgable and so nice! We enjoyed our tasting in the vintage room and walked around the cellar/shop/premises on our own afterward. We sat at the restaurant on the premise to enjoy the incredible views of Porto and the river after. It's a must see! We can't wait to come back next time.,Mar 2019
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,We had a lovely time touring the cellars at Graham’s. Our tour guide was very informative and knowledgeable. We learned a lot about the history of the winery and how port wine is made. The tour was the perfect amount of time (around 30 minutes). After the tour we went to the tasting room to try 3 different port wines. Our guide explained each one in detail and then we sat and enjoyed our wines until it was time to leave. I would definitely recommend this tour!,Mar 2019

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We booked a late tour at 4.30 pm to enjoy the port before going for dinner.
The tour was very interesting and informative. It captured my interest and the guide was very good at answering questions. We did a tasting at the end which was really good. We tried cheaper ports and more expensive ones and found out which ones we enjoyed and which we loved.
There was no rush to move at all. We sat for an hour bought a cheese plate and sipped our port. Afterwards we went to the shop and found a couple of bottles we could not get in the uk and bought them. The prices were the same as the uk so we didn’t buy much to take home.
If your going to do a tour book and do this one. All the tours are around the same price and this was far superior.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We had our second time tasting with Graham’s and we opted for a boarding experience with more exquisite variety of tawny ports from ten years all the way to the 40 years. The tasting was well-organised and we got four vintage ports from 2003 to 1980 and then four tawny ports. All are remarkably fantastic.

The experience was particularly good with a 24 years old guide who was passionate and knowledgeable about port wines. Very informative session and two thumbs up! He also managed to answered all my queries regarding making port wines.

We went for different tastings on their recommendation as you got the chance then to taste 6 ports between you rather than 3. A beautiful setting and a very informative tour. The price of each tasting reflected the quality of the port. We would definitely recommend a visit and look forward to returning to visit their vineyards next time .,Jan 2019

We went with the Port and Tawny sampling, so a bit more, but worth it. First you tour and then you end in a beautiful tasting room with a great view of the Douro River. It was a good education, as we had no experience with Port nor Tawny prior to this. Yes, we made purchases in the gift shop to enjoy on the rest of our trip.",Jan 2019

I’m not much of a wine fan, but I found a few ports I really enjoyed, most especially the 40-year Tawny. Of course they lead you through the gift shop on the way to dinner and we all bought port and other gifts. They absolutely stuffed us with food, different wines with each course, and T- bone steaks 3” thick!

Grahams is a big name in port so they need no introduction. The museum in only a small area, so here you mainly go for the cellar experience.

The tour was done in English, it is quite informative tough the tour guides can only answer you to a certain point.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"‘They’ say that if you’re going to do anything do it well – and since you can’t go to Porto without tasting Port - you may as well push the boat out and have a Premium tasting experience at Grahams.
The tour is well orchestrated, the guides (in our case a Russian intern with a very English sense of humour) are well informed and the tasting well worth the money.
If you can, choose the Premium tasting – we chose the Tawny option at €40 per head and as a result were shown into the wood panelled Vintage Room and sat in leather armchairs surrounded by portraits that provided a real sense of history as we tasted 3 lovely Tawny Ports.
If you really want to push the boat out, a tent card invites you to try a 5ml glass of Ne Oublie at a mere €500. Needless to say, our boat stayed resolutely tied to a more modest mooring!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Great place to learn, taste and appreciate port wine. It’s a bit further away from other cellars but with uphill location, it has a great view. The tour took a bit more than an hour with additional 30-45 minutes for wine tasting (depending on how fast you can consume 3 glasses of wine ^^). Super nice tour guide with friendly welcome atmosphere and any strange questions. Sorry that our kids ran around and made some noise but he managed them quite well. Thanks! 15 euro as a staring price is not at all expensive comparing to what you will experience from this heritage industry. We are not wine drinker but from the visit it encouraged us to learn more about this sweet special wine from the region. There is a parking so quite convenient to reach by car. A must-do thing if you are at Porto and Gramham did an excellent job. P.S. It requires pre-registration at their website. Walk-in is not possible.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We'll never drink Port the same way again, and we have raised our expectations. Our visit was a small group, only 6. The guide was very knowledgable and pleased to answer questions, and find out if we stumped her. It is definitely a fascinating visit and quite an education on Port making. We took the Premium tasting and so had 6 glasses between us, red and tawny. We also ordered some cheese as it is better to taste and nibble. We took a long time drinking and comparing and where in no way hurried.
The shop is well stocked and can deliver if you get carried away.
Only down side is the lack of the publicity about the museum at the entrance. If we had known, we'd have come earlier so as to see the exhibits and look at the photos. As it was, we never got t see it all.
Icing on the cake is Vinum, the wonderful tapas bar and restaurant next door that allows you to have an excellent meal with Graham/Symington wines whilst admiring the views.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Saturday dec 15th turned out to be a rainy day in Porto. We did some walking in the river area and crossed the river to visit Gaia. (The other side of Porto....). On this side many portwine houses are located. We went to very beautiful situated Graham’s Port Lodge and did a Tawny Port wine tasting + tour of the caves. Great guides were informing us about the vineyards of Graham’s along the Douro river and explained the process how to produce RUBY (large wine vessels- wood), TAWNY (small wine vessels- wood) and VINTAGE port wines. After our tour we ended in the restaurant where we took a cheese tasting with the leftover TAWNY 10/20 year samples. Also the personnel in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful when we tried to order an UBER taxi. Graham’s port wine lodge has 2 entries ( high / low) and this is somewhat challenging for the taxi drivers. The first UBER arrived and we were at the wrong gate...then this gentlemen decided to Cancel the ride and left.( 2.50 euro is deducted from our creditcard—- we are going to try to get the 2.50 returned by UBER!) After 10 min UBER Nr 2 arrived and with the help of the Graham’s personnel this time we were more successful.

The tour includes a short video and the guide who talked through the history of the brand, the products and their place in Porto. This was followed by a tasting. Depending on which tasting option you chose before the start of the tour will determine if you go into the large tasting areas or into the vintage tasting room. Prices went from about €20.
We then had lunch at the adjoining Vinum restaurant. The restaurant looks out over Porto. We had fried Octopus and suckling pig followed by Creme brûlée. Excellent service and were able to provide gluten free options. Would recommend a visit. Medium price range.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"This was probably the best of the port lodge tours that we did. The whole place is very professionally run and our tour guide was excellent.

You do have to reserve in advance but it is worth doing. There is an interesting display in the reception area (which includes some of Winston Churchill's port orders) so it is worth getting there a little early to see this first.

The guide then takes you through the lodge where the wine matures and explains the port making process and the different types produced.

At the beginning you choose (and pay for) which wines you would like to sample at the end and once the tour is finished they are set out and waiting for you in the tasting room (with tasting notes). We chose 6 different ports between the two of us and this worked well.

All in all and excellent tour and a nice walk back down the hill afterwards to the riverside. Thoroughly recommended!

She had such good rapport with a diverse group, and such extensive in-depth knowledge of her subject: this is how all tours should be! The pacing of the tour was perfect - there was a lot of information to take in , but we didn't feel rushed at any point. The history and geography of port production was really interesting.
After the tour we had port tasting in a room like a library, and we had plenty of time to savour the port & enjoy the moment. We were not great port drinkers before, tbh, but this tour has changed all that - we are confirmed port drinkers now !

As it turned out, we were given a private tour and couldn't have been happier. Our guide, Anna Krupa, was very knowledgeable and interesting and answered all our questions patiently. We took a Premium Port package and a Premium Tawny package. This allowed us to sample six different wines. Anna carefully explained each wine to us as we enjoyed them. This, by far, was the best of the three lodges we visited. Following the tour we had lunch at the lodge. The lunch was excellent. We arrived at 2:00PM and the restaurant was not very busy.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We found Grahams difficult to find - our GPS kept trying to take us the wrong way up narrow, steep streets. Once we found it, the tour was fabulous

You can (you must) book online for a particular time slot. They start you with a film, the tour the cellars, then end up in the tasting room

When you arrive they ask you which tasting you want, and it is waiting for you at the end of the tour. We chose the basic Tawny tasting and the Expensive Tawny tasting, which took us from really young tawnies to really old tawnies, and is an excellent way to get an idea of the breadth of tawny ports. I would have liked to return and done the same with Ruby ports.

The place is clearly a tourist processing mill, but their product, both the tour and the tasting, is well presented and you do not obviously feel you are being processed

I was impressed and could recommend Grahams to anyone

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"I joined the port tasting with Graham and I thought it was good and professional (and the wine is of good quality). The only thing you need to be mindful is they are located just about the furthest possible from the bridge. If you walk from Porto (for example, the Cathedral), you need to climb down to the riverfront and walk all the way to the other end of the area and hike up again about half way. It probably takes a good 20 minutes of walk and hike from the bridge. Just be prepared.",Oct 2018

Treat yourself to the 20€ tawny or ruby tasting, not the cheaper options.

The museum area is small but interesting, particularly the letters from notable people. After a short informative video, we started the tour and found it gave a good insight into the Symington family and port wine. The cellars are amazing!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,". . . this is not as “touristy” as it may feel. Really.

This is a good introduction to the international dimension of the Port wine trade, a great introduction to the transshipment of the wine through Porto, and a delightful tasting section (if you are a small party, have each member select a different level of the tasting so you can sample a wider variety).

We went the first night to a good tasting session (at Portologia — look it up), on a tour to the Douro valley the next day, and then to Graham’s on day three. I would recommend that sequence very highly.

Can’t say about the other lodges in Porto, but the experience at Graham’s was absolutely excellent with a fine guide and little commercial pressure to buy.

Then a walk in the cellars where there was a moment of slide presentations to further overview Grahams history and port production. To see the barrels was quite impressive.

Joao (John?), was our guide and he was so polite, knowledgeable, and informative. He was patient with questions, as there were a few inclusive of my (many) inquisitive ones. Before our trip I had studied about Port and he really filled in some of the knowledge gaps. He also was quite humorous. Even at the end of our tasting he came back to answer some additional questions. Above and beyond. - - oh, and not to forget, so are Graham's ports! We really enjoyed them.

He let us know that he had worked at the competition and that this is the bet tour. Not sure if this is true but we enjoyed the time in the cellars. We also upgrade to the top level tastings and were ojj in another room where we sampled 11 different ports. Watch out if you are driving as it can sneak up on you.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,The walk up is is easy enough and when your up the hill at Taylor's the view is gorgeous. The tour is very informative consisting of an hour's guided tour. We opted for the €35 tasting which is well worth it. You are brought off to the lovely surroundings of the library where you sit down in comfy leather chairs for your tasting of 3 exquisite ports. You go through the shop after to pick up some lovely ports to being home. I tried the 20 year old tawny which is beautiful. There is a restaurant on site but you need to book as it is popular.,Sep 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We had heard good things about Graham's from travel sources, so this was the lodge we chose to reserve a tour of while in Porto. Little did we know, the Graham's port would be our favorite we had during our 8-night stay in Portugal. The lodge is off the main tourist area of the riverside up a fairly steep and windy hill. If you're not in the best shape, you might want to take a taxi up. The tour was nice, but the main attraction for us was the excellent ports we drank at the end. My wife was a never a fan of port before, because she thought they tasted ""too raisiny."" Graham's made her a true believer. I believe we had two of the second-tier pricing flights, one a selection of rubies and one of tawny. We both really loved the LBV and dos Malvedos rubies, but all the others were great as well. I think we ended up ordering two additional tastings of the rubies to drink by the large window with an amazing view of Porto and Vila Nova (an advantage of being located atop a steep hill). I would highly recommend that if you love the ports here like we did, that you buy the bottles here. We were advised by our bnb host that prices are cheaper outside of the lodges, but we found Graham's difficult to find in shops around Portugal, particularly the bottles we really liked. To sum it up, great view, good service, good tour, and most importantly, excellent ports.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"We went to Graham's on recommendation - do be sure to book in advance, they really fo mean it!
A really great tour showing off their work in the Douro Valley, with some very impressive viewing of the multitude of wines in cask, and in bottle, at the lodge.
Very good guide who was very knowledgeable and able to answer the various questions thrown at her during the tour.
You finish up with a tasting which is the ""paying"" part of the tour. You choose 1 tasting per visitor, which start at euro 15 and go up into the low hundred's of euros. We tried the two premium tastings at euro 20 each.
Decent servings of three wines were offered up, and although we forgot to wait until our guide returned to guide us through them, it was a great experience.
Oh, and I now know the difference between ruby, tawny and vintage port!!
As others have said, a compulsory visit when in Porto.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"There are numerous Port Lodges in and around Porto but a friend recommended Graham's. It's located a little outside Porto but easy to reach with public transportation. The tour with Premium Port Tasting for 20 euro's p.p. was definitely worth the money! As the staff recommends, one of us chose the ruby and the other one the tawny option so we ended up with all six (three of each option) glasses of Premium Port to try. We did not know anything about port before our visit to Graham's but advanced port drinkers are free to pick more extravagant glasses.

Going to Graham's without making a reservation is not recommended (in the summer seasons) as it was well-booked.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"Six of us visited after a visit and tasting at another port house. About a week earlier we wrote in and received the reservations for the last tour on Sunday. After a short video, we toured the facility and were told about the manner in which Graham's ports are destined for the different ports they bottle, including those that come from a particularly exceptional grape year. We were taken to the area where very old bottles are kept. Note that there are no white ports at Graham's, a deliberate decision. We completed the visit in the large modern tasting room, with the 3 red ports (6 grapes, LBV and 10 year old) that we had paid for. The characteristics of each were explained by our guide, and you could clearly taste the difference from the different styles and aging. It was possible to buy samples from other styles, and we tried one that was aged 20 or 30 years. They had a large store where you could buy different ports and other Graham merchandise.

There was a 15 minute introductory video, followed by a tour and a tasting, which varied depending on the package you bought. We went for the Graham’s Experience at 35 Euros, giving a taste of Six Grapes, 30 Year Old Tawny and 2000 Vintage. The tastings were in a nice, old fashioned room with leather armchairs - very atmospheric. There is a shop and also a restaurant and bar. The view from the terrace back over to Porto is really great and well worth the cost of a drink. The food was also really good - we had a few plates of traditional tapas.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We weren't Port enthusiasts. Please note the past tense. Oh my goodness - these Ports (Graham's) are stellar - delightful bouquet, smooth, and oh so pleasing! Yes, we now ARE Port enthusiasts! So glad we visited Graham's - no idea what the other cellars are like. The buildings and grounds are beautiful. Our tour guide did a great job - we did the English tour about Portuguese Port given by a person with a Russian accent. The cellars are impressive. The tasting room is very classy. We are in Central Texas with almost 50 wineries nearby so we are familiar with the different types of tasting rooms. After our tour was over, the group (about 12 to 15) was taken to the tasting room which had wooden tables with stools. Each table had place mats with three glasses on them. Our guide checked our tickets and seating us accordingly based on the type of tasting you ordered. We did the Premium Port and Premium Tawny tastings - thanks to the front desk for recommending we do different tastings so we could taste 6 different Ports! We enjoyed all 6 and ended up buying a bottle of the Tawny Port. We never knew there was such a thing. We learned a lot and have a new-found appreciation for this fine fortified wine. Hopefully we can find a local distributor for Graham's! By the way, this is the Port favored by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth! So, give Port a chance and do it at Graham's - you will NOT be disappointed!

Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, and we learned a lot about the production processes and the various types of port and the grapes. We would recommend that you sample the Vintage selection since this is done in the comfort of the library. Prices start at 35 euros for this, and the measures are more than decent!",Oct 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Graham’s is the best place to sample Port in Porto. The terrace overlooks the city and has good food and a wonderful view. The restaurant looked lovely but it’s pricey and we liked the casual feel outdoors. We avoided the lunch and dinner hours (arrived around 2:15) so we had no trouble getting a table. The tour itself was interesting and informative. The tasting was fabulous. We upgraded to a superior level of tasting for not much more money. As a result we had a more private and luxurious tasting experience in a library like setting (leather armchairs). Go for it! We paired our ports with chocolate truffles which were heavenly. After Graham’s we were ready for the Douro valley. We took a taxi there and walked back and over the bridge to Porto.

We had 3 children younger than 8. The tour was relatively quick and awesome information. We love the guide and his insight in port. After tour we paid for the deluxe tawny and worth every penny.

It also has an awesome garden at the back for food and drink if anyone just want a good time.",Aug 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"The setting is spectacular and the inside was a mixture of beautiful modern decor with antique barrels. Our tour was very informative and helped to understand the difference between port styles. The history of port making, the Douro and Graham’s was also covered. At the end of the 60 minute tour,we were led into an attractive acting room with three glasses of port (ruby, 30 year tawny and year 2000 vintage). All were outstanding.
Following the tasting, we had dinner at the restaurant. The food was very good and we had a very good steak- not often found in Portugal. The bread was the best we have had in nearly three weeks in Portugal. The accompanying wine was also very good. The service was attentive.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"As a group, we wanted to experience our first wine tour, and Graham’s did not disappoint! Our guide, João, was fabulous; he made the tour fun, packed full of facts, and was great with all of our questions.

The port at the end was delicious. We had all gone for the classic tasting, with additional truffles to share, but we would have gone for the next tasting “level” if we had known we would like the Port so much!

Without a doubt, if you are going to visit a Port Lodge in Portugal, you have got to come to Graham’s!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"We slogged up a mighty hot road because the taxis were on strike, occasionally berating younger son, who recommended a visit. But he was right, as usual. What one actually sees are barrels (and barrels and more barrels) of port. Impressive. There are no labs or wine-making activities here. However, we had an excellent, enthusiastic guide, and learned a good deal about port. I am a wine buff and was thus happy, but the tour might not interest everyone. Herself liked it, though, and she drinks little.

The tasting is intelligently conducted. You specify what you want to taste in advance and it is laid out ready in the tasting room. I tried 10, 20 and 30 year old tawnys, each with its own characteristics and all well worth drinking. The 30 year old was richest, as one might expect.

A pleasant, interesting morning. Recommended for anyone who likes wine, especially if one goes on to lunch at the Vinum restaurant next door.

The tasting of three port wines was good, too, though the samples were somewhat small compared to the usual serving size in Portugal ...

The view from Grahams is spectacular and really makes you realise how pretty Porto actually is. The tour its self is about an hour long, it starts with a 15 minute video on the history of Grahams and followed by a guided tour around the cellar.

Our guide was very knowledgeable however he needs serious training in keeping his political opinions to himself. As we were in the tasting room, he made a very rude remark about how he disliked the French people while 2 of our clients were French! His remarks fell blunt and everybody felt awkward. I was in shock as this had never happened before in Porto and it certainly spoilled a great afternoon. Not mentioning his eye-rolling when asked questions. He would seriously benefit from interpersonal training and practising to bite his tongue whenever he feels like bashing other nationalities when dealing with a multi-cultural group.
Very unprofessional!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Booked the tour in advance. There are many different options, from a few quids to hundreds of euros depending on what you would like to taste. The tour remains the same, what differs will be the location of the tasting at the end of your visit and the Port Wines you'll drink.
Basic wines are drunk in a modern, bright tasting room; premium wines are drunk in a charming library and top wines are served in a superb environement.
Please be aware that wine is served generously, so my suggestion is to go for different tasting experience and share with friends.
We opted for Vintage Port (2003, 2000 and 1983) and Super Premium Tawny (30 yo, 40 yo and Colheita 1994) for 45€ each and had a fantastic experience, sipping all those 6 beautiful wines.
The cellar is lying a bit uphill on Vila Nova de Gaia and is a bit outside the classic touristic route, so less people around and a stunning view over Porto, the Douro and the Iron Bridge.
The shop is very well organised, too and the restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

No-one came and we drank our port wines and ate the cheeses and truffles (amazing truffles!) we bought. After 10min I went to the bar again to ask if someone would come to our table. The woman behind the bar was busy with other things, so it took a while to talk to me. Then she said that you can only get an explanation if you do the full tour. I told her that their website says otherwise, but still no-one came to our table. After another 10min we asked a very nice lady that explained on the neighbour's table for people that had booked the tour if she could tell us a bit about the ports and she did.

Overall we had MUCH better service at Churchill's and we personally liked the ports better as well.

We had taken the cable car from the tram stop down to river level and then had a pleasant 15 minute walking up a quiet winding street to the Port House. Beautiful entrance and light and airy inside.
The tour guide spoke excellent English and was clearly extremely knowledgeable although her delivery was machine gun style - difficult enough to follow if English is your Mother tongue but I did wonder about some other nationals on our tour.
The set up is both modern yet steeped in history and very impressive - thoroughly enjoyable. We both booked a €35 tasting in the wood lined room to add authenticity and enjoy our tasting in more relaxed surroundings than the light and airy more ‘cafeteria’ style standard tasting room.
We were hoping to finish our tour with lunch in the restaurant but, although we had tried to book online that a.m. (as we did with the tour) we had no response. Unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked but we were advised that we could eat at Vinum’s Wine Bar and to ‘find a table or somewhere to sit’ on the terrace. Again, beautifully situated on a hill looking across the Douro to Porto - beneath a trellis of vines ..... lovely. After 10 minutes we managed to attract the attention of a harassed waiter and requested a large white coffee and a menu. 10 minutes later an almost cold espresso arrived but no menu ...... apologies - he would get one. After another 10 minutes during which we watched other people complaining about poor service and incorrect food being brought my husband fetched a menu himself and complained to a waiter. After another 10 minutes of waiting for our order to be taken we went inside to find the manager and informed him that we had waited 40 minutes, received a cold coffee that I don’t drink and had had to fetch our own menu.
There were far too few staff waiting on during what is clearly a busy period - lunch time!
We left in disgust although the manager did call a taxi for us.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"We booked a “90 minute tour and tasting” that actually takes about 50 minutes in total and costs €15 to include three glasses of port. It started at 530pm and we were tasting the ports at 615pm while being politely told that we had to be out of the tasting room by 630pm. Grahams need to review their tim8ngs or adjust their clocks.

The guide was Joao who was very knowledgeable but speaks VERY fast and it was obvious that this tour was not going to last 90 mins (as stated repeatedly on the email sent to me) by the speed of his presentation.

We are fluent English speakers but I knew some others were struggling. The tour is not like one you would get at a French vineyard or Scottish distillery where you are led through the process as you walk around the Cellars/distillery. At Graham’s, with the help of some slides, you are told the history of the Grahams and the Symingtons...and about the Symingtons...and more about the Symingtons. You stand in a big cellar of thousands of barrels and then are shown where some vintage ports are stored. And that’s it.

I was trying to decide whether Joao was witty or catty. I really enjoyed his way of presenting - reminded me of the untucked lounge in Ru Paul’s Drag Race. The €15 was worth it to hear his rapid-fire, knowledgeable, sarcastic banter. Would I rush back? Probably not.

Make sure you stop at the gorgeous Vinum terrace for drinks & snacks and a truly fabulous view.

We had tastings of premium port and premium tawny. I personally preferred the premium port.

Pre-booking is required. We booked the day before. Also, the walk up the hill is quite long, so taxi / Uber is suggested.

Definitely recommended.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"Very enjoyable, interesting and informative visit to Graham's Port Lodge. Looked around the display area before beginning the tour which gave some background information. This was followed by a video presentation which was the weakest point of the tour, a lot of it was just scenic views of the Duoro valley rather than specific information about port. Potential for some improvements with this. The tour itself was excellent, we had a highly knowledgeable and pleasant tour guide who explained all that we needed to know about the origins of port wine and the processes involved in it's growth, harvesting and production. Had lots of opportunities to take a good look around the port cellars and also to ask questions. The best part of course was the tasting, we had 3 good sized samples. Again we had lots of time to taste the samples and to ask any questions about them. A very fun and enjoyable tour which I would highly recommend.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Having been to Porto and on a port tour once before, I was after something more personal and less hurried. Graham's Port Lodge did not disappoint. I made enquiries via e-mail in advance and got prompt responses. You don't have to pre-choose which ports to try at the end of the tour--you can select on the day. My party of six opted to go for the classic combo and the next level up (which included a 20-yr old tawny).

There were about 20 in the tour group and we were told the history of port and its processes via film, dedicated guide, slides and a walk through the warehouse and private cellars. The guide was very friendly and answered a variety of questions from the group. At the end of the tour we were taken to dedicated tasting rooms. Because we had selected the premium package to were ushered into a more intimate tasting room replete with books, aged bottles of port and pictures of famous port clients. You can buy cheese and chocolate plates to accompany the ports. We spent a bit of time savouring the different port varieties and did not feel rushed or harried. In fact after the guide explained the various ports laid out we were left in peace. We were interested in white port, which was not part of the aforementioned combos and were given a complimentary glass when we enquired about it. The guides were super friendly and knew their topic well.

I would recommend this tour for those who want the personal touch. I think we spent about 3 hours at the lodge, but all in my party will remember it long after as probably the best part of their visit to Porto!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"If you visit Porto and do not visit the Graham's you'd have not visited Porto. It is an experience exquisite in every sense of the word.
We first had a quick bite at the bar on the terrace. The views are just amazing. The food was very refined. We had sardines, out of a can, they were delicious, make sure you also order the sausages, maybe the best you'll ever eat. We then proceeded for the task we actually came to do. Getting acquainted with Port Wine. The tasting tour was a pleasant experience and a great introduction to the subtleties of Port Wine. Graham offers an enormous variety of great vintages especially (my favorite is the 40 year old Tawny ... a silky aromatic symphony that tickles all your taste buds). The guides were very nice and helpful.
We loved the place so much, we decided to come back the next day and try out the restaurant. We were not disappointed. Although Porto is a great & charming city, we were a bit disappointed by the inconsistent quality of services and the rundown state of the city's old quarters (the heritage of Porto). So for us Graham is by far the BEST Porto has to offer, the buildings are very well designed, built and maintained to a high standard. A great deal of thought has gone into each and every detail to make the visit pleasant. The decoration, a mix between new and old respecting the 200 year history this house has and the great products they offer. They are very proud of what they have achieved and they should be.
Indulge yourselves in a tasting tour (go for the Premium & or the Super Premium Tawny Tasting Programs) but also make sure you try their restaurant ""The Vinum"" and order the suckling pig ... my mouth still waters when I think of it ...
Very Friendly and Very Professional Staff throughout.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Graham's Port Lodge is definitely worth the walk up the hill: the views are stunning. We did not prebook the tasting and were able to choose which ports to try.
They also allowed us to sit outside on the terrace at the end of the tasting and enjoy the views. Definitely recommend.",Jul 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Graham's was recommended by the hotel as being one of the must visit port houses. It really was pretty nice. It is at the top of a hill from the river and it was kind of a long walk up a tiny winding road and I would recommend taking a taxi to get there (we took a taxi back after walking there). As you enter the front door you are in a huge room with reception desk on one side and a semi large museum on the other side. There are also a number of chairs/couches for sitting while you wait for your tour to begin. There are at least six or more from which to choose different tastings. This actually ended being a small problem for us (more on that later). The tour probably had maybe 20 people on it, but it was not crowded. Our tour guide spoke good English (although I believe she was French) and was very friendly and accommodating. The tour takes you immediately into the production facility. Its dark and cool, with 100 year old huge wooden tanks. We watched a short movie that explains the almost 200 year history of the Port house. The tour ended in brightly lit modern tasting room. Since we had purchased one premium and one other tasting we were lead into a special reserve room with dark wood and leather chairs and walls of port. It was pretty nice. There was another group of four at one table and my wife and I sat at a table by ourselves with all six of our tastings already poured (3 each from the tastings we selected). Now here is where it got kind of strange/awkward. Since our guide could not be in both rooms at once, she stayed in the main room with the largest group of people and she had a colleague that was in this new reserve room. The new lady proceeded to introduce herself to the other group of four, but completely ignored us for about 20 minutes. My wife and I were like WTF? One of our tastings had a sheet explaining each of the three ports that had been poured, but we had no idea what the other three were. After about 20 minutes that lady came over and was like, oh I am sorry were you also interested in hearing about the port you purchased to taste? Yeah, of course we were. The original tour guide came by to see how were doing and we told her about our awkward experience and she really went out of her way to make it right. We got to taste a couple of extra ports in addition to our original six. Maybe we should have spoken up, but it was really strange because we were literally right in front of this other lady the whole time (it wasn't like she couldn't see us). Anyway, we had lunch at the restaurant and I got the impression you normally needed a reservation. The restaurant was fabulous (views of the river and Porto were close to perfect and food was great) and the service was impeccable and they graciously called us a cab and walked us to the cab after lunch. It was a pretty unique experience and it would definitely recommend it taking this tour and eating at the restaurant Vinum if you can.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,2.0,"We went on the Graham's tour. Starting of interesting, hearing about the history of Graham's an a basic tour of the port types and their port casts, and museum storage.

Then we moved to the vintage from as each of us had paid for the premium tasting.

This was extremely disappointing. We were a group of 6, and a number of us had vintage Port with huge amounts of sediment. Obviously the end of the Bottles, but took a lot of convincing for these to be replaced.
After replacing them, the guide said she would return for discuss the ages port tasting. Never did?!?

So after waiting 30minutes we just left. After paying 49 EUR for the tasting, you would have expected a lot more.

A lot better places in Portugal to do a port tour.

If you are a wine / port buff I would suggest that tastings and directions are a little basic, I think it is more for tourists but it has the most fantastic lunch venue - the views and food were exceptional so it is worth a tour to finish up with lunch there although you can book to just eat.",Jul 2018

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"If you are in Porto you need to visit the Graham Port Lodge and have a tour and experience a tasting of the great ports they produce. We reserved online and they responded the next day. If you are unsure which tasting you should do, go for the premium. It is more expensive but well worth it. In our case it gave us the opportunity to taste the vintage and tawny at the same time. The guide we had, was excellent and willing to answer all questions. It seemed he went out f his way to make sure we left with a very good idea of the Graham history,the quality of their ports and new knowledge on how to appreciate the different ports.",Jun 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"Since I had been drinking the Graham's 40 Year Tawny I had to visit Graham's during my visit to Portugal. First we (nephew and I) had lunch at the restaurant then we went for the tour and tasting. We were taking the last tour of the day (5:30pm) and for some reason we didn't have to pay. Our tasting cost us 35 euros a piece. The ports were great and learning the history of the Graham's label was a fantastic experience. Then we picked up a couple of bottles to bring home.

Because of signage we had a tough time driving to the lodge. So we ended up parking at a parking garage and walking. Bad choice, the walk up was steep, long, and winding...LoL!!! What a surprise to both of us. I guess some signs like ""do not enter"" really does not mean ""do not enter""...LoL!!

The view from the Graham's hilltop is breathtaking!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"When in Porto, you have so many choices for port wine tours and tastings. Our tour company chose this one for us, and we are so glad they did. What a wonderful experience! Although it may be a farther walk than some of the others, it is worth it!

Graham's can be seen from Porto's riverside, but is a bit of an uphill walk to reach. You'd be wise to double check your directions at your hotel before departing. The entrance is beautiful and welcoming. We were unexpectedly upgraded to a more exclusive tasting--very nice!

The tour was excellent. Our guide (an Italian gentelman--I forget his name) was knowledgeable and informative. We were told the tour would be about 40 minutes, but ours went over 1 hour.

Our upgraded tasting took place in a library-like room, with lots of wood, bookcases, and leather chairs. The three ports we sampled were all delicious.

We highly recommend the Graham tour! Enjoy!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Be prepared for a long hike up a windy STEEP hill to get to this port house. Our taxi driver had to drop us at the bottom due to seasonal changes in the one way systems. So leave plenty of time if you don't want to arrive hot and sweaty like 80% of our tour group did!

Once you arrive this is the most beautiful port house you will visit with amazing vistas over the town and river.

The tour guide was excellent and the tour really informative - plus you get to see some very very old vintage ports. We opted for the premium tastings so were shown to a wonderful room where the guide talked us through each port in turn and was happy to answer any questions.

All in all a first class experience.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"My wife and I booked an English tour at Graham’s by email for a Saturday at 3pm. The lodge is a 10 mins drive from Porto centre. We paid €20 each, one of us went for the vintage tasting, the other the tawny tasting.

The tour - 8 people - started with a short video about the Douro Valley vineyards. Our guide, Svetlana, then started showing us around, explained the Douro Valley area, explained the difference between the ruby port, the tawny port and the vintage port in terms of production and storage. She was extremely enthusiastic. We both learned a lot. Perhaps one of the best tours we’ve done in a while.

The tasting room was organised like a classroom with tables facing Svetlana who explained the ports as we tasted. Our favourite was the Crusted vintage. We bought a bottle at the shop, €25. We also had some truffles at the tasting which were tasty, €7.

Overall, fantastic. We had an excellent time, learned a bit and got a bit tipsy. Highly recommended.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Graham’s Port Lodge tour and tasting experience was an excellent excursion. I would suggest booking early as Graham’s keeps their tours to smaller numbers than some of the other Port producers. John our very experienced guide (I think 23 year old) was well beyond his years in knowledge of the production of Port in the region and was very well spoken. The tour began with a video of the Graham’s story followed by a history and tour of the facility, and tasting all with John, then a visit to the gift shop and there is also a very nice restaurant. The tasting session took place in a beautiful room where we were provided adequate amounts of various blends for our tasting experience. The group really enjoyed this educational time and the drinking of the Port.
When in Porto a trip to Graham’s is a must.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"I booked this tour online and it was very easy to do and they responded in less than 24hours, which gave me confidence in the tour I booked.
Graham’s is a little out the way compared to some of the port caves, but worth the walk up the hill.
Once we arrived we checked in and they went through the different port tastings we could do. We picked our ports, paid and waiting in the small museum before the tour started.
The tour started with a lovely video before our guide took us around.
I think our guide was Alex. He was very friendly and helpful and had a huge amount of knowledge and very funny. The tour was informative, entertaining and lasted about 45 minutes.
After the tour we sat down to drink our ports which were already laid out for use. Each port was explained to us and we were given lots of time to relax and enjoy our ports.
The tour was lovely and relaxed,Graham’s feels very modern and is set on top of a hill so the views are amazing. The ports were lovely and we never felt rushed on the tour or at the tasting.

Along with our meal at Vinum, this was our standout time in Porto. Graham’s Lodge is a fabulous place steeped in history, immaculately kept and with the best view of the city. Every member of the team there are very personable. You feel their genuine passion for the city, Graham’s and of course the fabulous port they produce. Their passion was infectious and our thanks to Anna Krupa who was simply brilliant.

The private tasting room was extraordinary - a real privilege. Thank you.

I can’t recommend this Lodge highly enough. The extra distance away from the bustle of the main riverside location is well worth it - you feel like a guest to a family estate - which of course it is, rather than a tourist.

Loved every single tasting I had from the tour. My husband got the more extensive collection of the tasting and I got the premium one. Between the cheaper ones to the more expensive ones, they were all good. The difference was the depth of the flavors, but cannot say any was bad at all! We enjoyed everyone of them. We got the truffles to accompany our tasting and it was delicious as well. Afterwards, we ate at their restaurant next door. Food was amazing as expected. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"As a wine lover with only a few hours to spend in Porto, I had to visit one of the port shippers' lodges for a tasting. I had heard very good things about Graham's Port Lodge and was not disappointed. Unlike many of the other lodges it is not by the riverside. Rather, it has a commanding position high up above the quayside which means it is a good 10 minutes' walk up hill but when you get there the views back up the Douro valley are tremendous.

The facilities are equally impressive; it is clearly a very professionally run organisation. But with the personal touch too, i'm glad to say. My party of three enjoyed a great tasting in the very capable hands of Marina who took excellent care of us. She clearly explained the differences between the various Ports and didn't rush us at all - which allowed us to absorb both what she was telling us and all the fabulous aged tawnies in front of us! It was a memorable experience in a marvellously atmospheric tasting room. I very much hope to return one day.

Tip 1. bus 901 or 906 from opposite Sao Bento Stn alighting at the Rua do Agro stop (about 15/20 mins). Tip 2. The winery is set between two streets – Rei Ramiro or Rua do Agro. Rua do Agro would get you to the visitor centre a bit quicker. Tip 3. The return bus stop is in Rei Ramiro.
Tip 4. On foot it will take 30 minutes approximately back to the city centre, down might be ok but up, I’m not so sure especially with walking difficulties.

The informative guide did a perfectly magnificent job of walking us thru the tasting, and when we showed our specific interest, moving away from the set tastes to several more that were even better. The 1972 Colheita (single harvest - 36 years of aging in the cellar before being put in the bottle) was a delight. Not cheap - but a delight. If you are interested in tasting high end Port - this is the place. Don’t miss it. (Oh, and we added a cheese tray at 14 E to our tasting- well worth it.

The experience however was very much clouded by the behaviour and mannerism of our tour guide; he seemed arrogant, dismissive and largely disinterested in keeping our group engaged and making sure we were enjoying ourselves.
When asked to speak slower by a European couple, as English was not their mother tongue, he agreed, said the next sentence more slowly, and then carried on extremely fast yet again.
Throughout the tour, we felt his overall demeanor really left a mark on how pleasant this tour was. We felt like objects being spoken to, pushed round an assault course as such, rather than guests who had spent their own money to experience something new about the Graham Port winery.
Overall, a very disappointing visit.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,3.0,We had come from vineyards north of Port where we had amazing and personalized tours and tastings of wines so I was disappointed to be a in tour of 13 people with a tour guide who had never participated in the making of the Port she was explaining. The lodge was interesting but we were moved through with the rest of the visitors and it left something to be desired. We could not sit on the terrace after the tour- it was empty but roped off so we were in and out in about an hour. Kind of a bummer for the $$ we paid.,Apr 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We booked lunch at Graham’s, followed by the Port Tour.
The lunch was absolutely amazing with first class service and food.
The restaurant setting has you dining overlooking the Douro, with a choice of tables inside of outside.
The wine selection was classic as expected, and complimented by the excellent food selection.
Highly recommended for an afternoon in Porto, with a few Ports to wash it down after of course.",Apr 2018

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,2.0,"The tour itself was reasonable with good information, but the experience was completely ruined for me by the treatment I then received in the bar. I had waited in the bar before the tour which had been ok (a female waitress had actually served me), but following the tour, I sat on the terrace for 15 mins, and was studiously ignored in favour of bigger groups of people, who clearly would be spending more than me.

A large group of 8 came out to the terrace about 5 minutes after I did, and were fawned over (furniture moved for them, drink orders taken, and drinks brought to them). 15 minutes after I arrived at the terrace, a group of 4 men arrived, who were also given menus, and had drink orders taken. I left after the second group were served. 15 minutes of being ignored was pretty patient I think. I did mention how upset i was to the waiter and also to the person at the tour desk - as I am not the kind of person to leave a bad review here, without drawing it to someone's attention in person.

There are enough Port wineries in Gaia that I am sure would not be so dismissive of people travelling alone, that I would not make the trip to Grahams again. or recommend it to anyone else.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"One of the best port caves to visit in the region is Grahams. With their state of the art visitor’s center this is definitely worth a visit. It’s a little out of the center but easily accessible on foot. There is a great museum with some very interesting artifacts. We took the tour in English and the guide Alexander was great. He was very knowledgeable great with English and really fun company. The premises are breath taking. The warehouse with the barrels and vats are the cleanest I ever came across and that is not just for port wine. The end the visit with a tasting with a spectacular view over the Douro and the Luiz I bridge it was a really nice experience. Go for the tasting formula with the more advanced wines as it’s worthwhile. If you get the change the restaurant appears to be very good as well. I only read positive reviews on that.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,3.0,"The visit at Graham’s Port Lodge is well organized .
After the intro video friendly guides show you around and give you information about the different areas of the wines and show how to work to get the right port wine.
The Graham Lodge is a well established company with a lot of wine areas all over The Valley.
The barrels of Port wine are located in in-dark and moistened cellars. It needs time to get the right selections of Port.
The demonstration of Port wine was ok. Depending of the selection of entrance fee you may have a great variety including food.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We shared a taxi to Graham's Port Lodge which overlooks Porto as it is quite a steep climb to reach this facility. OK to walk balk if you can manage the cobbled streets.
Best to book tour time in advance.
Very well organised and informative tour covering the history of the port industry in Porto and the Douro Valley. You should learn somrthing new.
If you have chosen a port tasting experience as well, highly recommended (from 20euro to 250euros per person) you will be given selection of ports and tasting guide.
You can then visit the port and wine shop. Allow at least 1.5 hours to fully enjoy.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"On a rainy day in Porto, this was a wonderful activity in a beautiful building. After checking out a few collected family artifacts, we watched a movie and took a tour of the Port lodge in English. The tour was informative, even for those who know very little about port. At the conclusion of the tour, you do a taste of three different ports--you get to choose your selection of three. The tasting is mostly self-guided and allows you to enjoy them on your own at your own pace, but I might have liked a little more support/description in this area. The restaurant on site is also excellent, and has a good deal on a prix fixe lunch.",Apr 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"When you travel with friends that love wine and food some of your destinations are to seek out just that! Porto was no different. One of our goals was to visit Port Vineyards. The Graham Port Lodge was fantastic. You do need to make a reservation which was very easy to do from home and by e-mail. When you get there you do have to decide what type of tasting you would like after the tour. The tour was wonderful and learning how Port is made which is very different than wine was interesting. Our guide was very good.
Go for the Premium tastings! Since we are winos, we decide to go for the premium tastings and we were not disappointed. They take you to the ""library"" and a table is set with each glass of port over a placemat with type of port/ tawny you are tasting. At the head of the table the full bottles are set out. We had an expert take us through each tasting explaining the characteristics of each. Answering our questions and just adding to the wonderful experience of the visit. One of the couples we travel with is retiring as Professors in the next couple of months. They wanted something special to celebrate and our guide for the tasting told us about "" Ne Oublie"" port which was from 1882. This is presented in a 1 oz bottle in a box and is very very special. This was a taste from heaven that none of us will ever forget or experience again. No question it was one of the nicest tasting visits we have had and we have been to many in various countries. After the tasting which lasted a lot longer than we anticipated and we were not rushed at all, we went through the wine shop and able to purchase various ports, tawny. BEFORE YOU LEAVE MAKE SURE YOU GO OUT ON THE DECK THAT HAS WONDERFUL VEIWS OF THE RIVER ,BRIGDE AND PORTO. TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES!!!

Informative tour in small group. A wander around the cellars vats and barrels. Lots of port in here guys.

We paid for the tour and 45 eu tasting. This is the exec option and you get to sample the better ports and sit in the very impressive library.

Add cheese and chocolate to your sampling for an extra touch.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We had a newish guide who was charming and did a good job. That he was being shadowed by a senior guide who took notes on his performance tells you how seriously they take doing these tours to a high standard. They have struck a good balance of imparting information about Port making process and the Douro Valley and not overloading you with too much detail. If you already know quite a bit about Port you may not learn much but for the novice or someone with some knowledge it is interesting. Graham’s is part of the Symmington family group of companies so this is at the more corporate end of things, but the slick tour and lovely tasting room are the benefits from going with the professionals.

The tasting we chose was the Classic and chocolate truffles. The staff were really informative and helpful! And above all else, the ports were gorgeous!",Mar 2018
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"My two friends and I really enjoyed this tour and the tastings because we felt like we learned so much about port in just 1-2 hours. Book via email and know that you're on a tour with other people (I thought we'd be on a private tour, but was mistaken) and it starts with a short movie about the company/vineyards (good if you're a tad late like we were). We opted for the 3 different tastings, as we had 3 people in our group, and we had 9 glasses of 7 different ports that we shared (our guide recommended this and it worked out great). While they did close the tasting room at 6pm and kicked us out, they did have a bar outside the restaurant to get drinks and appetizers. We had a 7pm dinner reservation as well (made via email) and that was a nice experience, albeit pricey, and a separate review. Highly recommend going to Graham's for the thorough introduction to port wine and definitely recommend getting different tastings in your party so you can taste many!

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of Graham's for several reasons. First off, their tour is very personally oriented. Compared to the other full tour we went on had only a very repetitive audio tour. Whereas Graham's has tour guides for multiple languages. They are also very open to answering questions as you move along the tour.

As for the tasting, oh yeah, this is the stuff. We sampled the Six Grapes, 2010 LBV, 10-30 year Tawny Ports and a special 1976 vintage port. Absolutely out of this world!

The set up is very classy, elegant and welcoming as well.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,We ended up at Graham's because we tried other lodges that were fully booked or closed so pleased we were able to walk in and join a tour half an hour later. Tours started at €15 for classic ports but we chose the €20 premium tours (one for ruby port and one for tawny). The guide was very informative and we got to see the cellars as well as some very old bottles of port. Tastings were ready for us when we finished the tour and the guide described each one.

Afterwards we visited the gift shop (great t-shirts) and bought a bottle. It was a lovely afternoon and we were with friends so we ordered a cheese & sausage plate and a glass of port and sat out on the veranda to enjoy it and the pretty view of the river and city.

Tastings start at Euro12 - we went for the superior one (think that is what it was called) for Euro17 each and it was worth it. Really splendid selection of ports and decent tasting measures.

Since Porto is very hilly, realise that Climbing up to Graham's can be a tough stroll. It took us rather long to get a ticket since the ticket office at the hall isn't very efficient- and no chairs available to wait once you have your ticket and have to wait for the start of the tour. Tours are given in several languages. While waiting for the start of the tour you can see a little exposition about the history of Graham's in the hall. The tour is very interesting and you learn a lot about the different Port wines. In our case special about Tawny ports. You see big barrels and bottled ports.

Tastings range from £12pp. We opted for the Premium Tawny, Premium Vintage. Each at £40. The price included a full tour of the cellars, including bottle vintages store. The guide was extremely knowledgable and engaged the group well. The guide walked us through the families history, differences in Port styles and the making of Port.

Our specific tastings where held in the Grahams library, a very special setting and made for the perfect setting in which to sample very special Ports.

There is a great restaurant, or if you prefer a cafe with fabulous outdoor seating in case you arrive early, or to simply chill with a coffee or yet another post after the visit.

Take the Premium Tour - I mean, why not? When the tour is over, you'll be escorted to an area with the best views, where it is possible to just sit and and enjoy the liquid and views. Wonderful place - enjoy.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"We booked the tour without realizing how far the grounds were from the river side. On the walk up the hill we passed 5-6 other Port tasting facility's and wondered if we had made the right decision, but the view from the cafe is worth the walk (if you don't fancy walking, I suggest getting a taxi)
As there were four of us we split the port tasting to two different groups including vintage tawny and would recommend not sticking to the same style so you get a wider choice to try at the end.
The guide appeared very knowledge and the caves were impressive. All staff were customer focused.
When you go for the tasting you are split up depending on the tasting style you have paid for. It appeared you can take as long as you like for the tasting, there was no rushing you. The option to buy a cheese platter is available but this seemed expensive.
There is the option to try other ports for example a glass at 500 euros (1886) but we passed on this.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"Visited as a large group and although there were few Port drinkers amongst us we all enjoyed the experience at Graham’s Port Lodge.

We met our confident and at times arrogant guide and were led down into the caves (cellars). I saw arrogant as at times he came across as a show off regarding the Port Collection and made you feel a little silly with the way he answered your questions. At times this was awkward, other times the awkwardness made it entertaining...a bit like watching an episode of The Office.

The caves are beautiful, impressive and super clean and the information provided in the tour is comprehensive and highly interesting providing a history of the families involved and processes to make the Port. It certainly builds up your curiosity towards the end as to how the different types of Port will taste like.

The value and volume of Port in the caves is colossal and the tour took between 20-30 minutes (ideal). We were then taken to the sampling area - again beautifully presented, clean and airy and talked through the 3 samples of Port. I’m not a red wine or Port drinker but given the opportunity this Christmas I will definitely partake in a glass of Port with my dad following this experience.

A class place and great experience that surely has to be on your list of places to visit whilst in Porto. Oh and of course you get the opportunity to buy your Port in the shop at the end.

Staff and facilities are world class and reflect the great values of this sector and Graham´s in particular.
Despite the standard visit is worth what you pay, don’t hesitate in upgrading the tasting in case your budget allows for.

I researched Grahams ahead of time and was glad I had prior reservations for the tour. Also by way of research I found that there is restaurant here also that you need reservations for. So we had prior reservations for lunch. One of the best views of Porto is from the restaurant at Grahams. If you are a foodie then there is an excellent menu to match wines with foods. However, if you want the fine dining experience on a budget then order off the Executive menu. This was well worth the visit

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"While we are neither wine nor port connoisseurs, it would have been a great shame to visit Porto and not go to a port cave. We chose Graham's, on the recommendation of a friend and also our concierge at the Intercontinental. It was my birthday .. so, why not. It turned into a perfect ""dinner"" (we had a late lunch).
First was the explanation of how port grapes are raised, harvested and selected for making into port, which has an enhanced alcohol content. We then toured the warehouse, and were shown where bottles from especially successful years were kept under lock and key. Then we were guided to the tasting room.
We were seated at a table with three sets glasses, each partially filled for tasting: 20 year tawny, 10 year tawny and a recent 6 grape blend. Also we had dark chocolate truffles to eat. Yep, a perfect treat.
I was also impressed that we were not in the least pressure to buy anything. Of course, we did buy a few bottles of what we drank, and they placed them in bubble bag containers to assist in getting them home without breakage.
It worked.

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Loved every minute of this informative visit. Beautiful building and grounds not to mention the great port samplings. Well worth the walk up to see this historic site. The view of the city is stunning as well. A must see in Porto. Don't forget to pick up some port from the shop, great selection and prices.",Oct 2017

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,Despite the steep hike up narrow roads this was an outstanding tasting for those who just want to taste some great wine with minimal commentary from the winery. Reasonable in price for the wines and views offered. It is in a lovely updated room that looks out over the Duoro River. It also has a nice looking restaurant. Tours are offered but after multiple tours a tasting only was appreciated.,Oct 2017
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Visited with a colleague, as was in Porto for the weekend for work. We didn't have a reservation for a guided tour, but received a very warm welcome on arrival and were easily booked onto the next tour. We opted for the €12 basic tasting option (the €12 included the tour and a tasting of 3 ports at the end). Great value for money. Learnt a lot about the port making process, but tour was just the right length, so didn't lose interest. We had Marina as a guide and she was great- very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Would definitely recommend!",Oct 2017
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"6 of us stopped here as part of a Viking River Cruise optional excursion. After a short tour of the cellars, we had our private port tasting. We sampled 4 vintage ports and 10,20,30,& 40 yr old Tawny ports. All were excellent and generous pours. We followed the tastings with a 5 course dinner paired with more Port and Graham’s table wines. Dinner was exceptional and the the service first class. The evening was one of the most enjoyable in my life. Not cheap - but highly recommended!",Oct 2017
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"Suggest you make a reservation for the tour. As we were walking to the lodge, people were walking away and said they could not get in for that day. The tour lasts about one hour and then you can choose a 3-port tasting or a 5-port tasting and one other option. After the tour, they sit you with others who have chosen the same option. We bought a bottle as a souvenir, only to realize that even though we flew to Portugal with carry-ons, we had to check the bags for the return flight! So keep that in mind if you travel light, which we do.",Oct 2017
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Suggest to make a reservation for this tour. Once there they offer 3 different price groups depending on the quality of wine you would like to taste after the tour (3 small glasses of different wines). The tour was inclusive of the history of the Douro Valley and the wines and the last part to the tasting room tables, Thoroughly enjoyed it-very relaxing and good wine selections for tasting. Allow about 90 minutes. Well organized.",Oct 2017

Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,4.0,"We did the Super Premium Vintage port tasting in the Private Tasting room. Three years; 1983, 2000 & 2007. The room is beautifully designed and harks back to Victorian elegance where gentlemen retired for brandies and cigars (in this case port) A very knowledgable wine consultant answered our questions and conducted the tasting. The 1983 was outstanding, perfectly aged for maximum tasting enjoyment. The 2000 & 2007 still have some strong tannins and will get better over the next 15 years. Beautifully crafted ports!",Oct 2017
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,"Highlight of our trip to Porto was the guided tour of the port lodge, port tasting and 5 course meal with wine pairings. Be prepared to pay €17 for either the premium ruby or tawny flights (€12 for the classic flight), as a group half chose the ruby and half the tawny flights that way we all got to try all of the wines. The meal was a good add on to the tour, €75 each for the traditional menu with wine pairings - food and wines were amazing, ending with a 10 year old tawny. Views were fantastic from the restaurant too!",Oct 2017
Portugal,Graham's Port Lodge,5.0,Allow 2 hours for tour and tasting. We had the premium vintage for $40 each. Well worth the experience. The tasting room was very elegant and the views on the terrace provided a great view of the river.,Oct 2017
