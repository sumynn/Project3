Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"I'm not really a fan of aquariums and so, but this one was really interesting. Nicely built on 2 levels and a lot of information, suitable for both children and adults. A must if visiting Lisbon with kids.",Nov 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Located a short drive outside Lisbon proper, Oceanário is arguably the city's premier destination. Opened in 1998, the Oceanário was the centerpiece of a World Fair and remains committed to conservation above all.

Less ""cute"" than many modern aquariums, the focus on education over cartoons admirable, much of the space wraps around an enormous central tank featuring countless fish both common and novel. From Sun Fish to Sharks the space then expands to artistic aquascaping and theaters that outpace most.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,We really enjoyed it here. The aquarium is so big and everyone there at that particular moment could see the fish and other creatures while keeping safe distance from each other. Well done and keep it up.,Oct 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,A wonderful way to spend 2 or 3 hours. We brought our 7 month old and he was mesmerised...I think. It's actually a really cool area around the Aquarium. Take the cable car to the Myriad Hotel.,Oct 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"The Lisbon Oceanarium is a fun way to spend a couple of hours, especially if you're there with kids. They will love seeing the sharks and rays and other variety of fish, plus they have penguins and sea otters that love to put on a show in the water. We purchased the combo ticket that gave you entrance to the aquarium as well as the gondola ride overlooking the water and the city, this was a lot of fun to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding area. There is also a garden and a bunch of great restaurants just a short walk from the aquarium. You can take the gondola there too.",Oct 2021

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,4.0,"Lovely places to watch some fish. There's a lot to see here, but if you skip the movies and other information and just go to see the animals, you will probably be done in about an hour.

It's an excellent place to go with kids as they will love to see all that variety, but when you left there it looks like something is missing.",Aug 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"I've been to more interesting aquariums in Tampa, Florida as well as in Hong Kong. Not sure how they figure this to be one of the largest in the world.
We waited over an hour to purchase tickets on a line being serviced by just one person; we went in and were done in less than an hour.
Not impressed at all.....",Aug 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Totally recommended for all ages, if you do not have purchased your ticket on line, you have to wait in the lines about 30 to 60 minutes. You will see thousands of species, excellent designed area with very beautiful lights.You have the felling that you dive in the water with the fish!",Aug 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"1) Buy tickets online. The line for off-liners is longer and processes 5-10 times (!!!) longer. We spend 1.5 hours in the line.
2) Average oceanarium as for a Europe. Quite small, no tunnels, no huge spaces, no good panoramas. 1 hour to visit.",Aug 2021

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Really beautiful aquarium, with lots of species, arranged in different environments, what makes it interesting for all ages.",Jul 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"We knew this aquarium was famous for being one of the best in Europe, but we were very pleasantly surprised. It was expensive, but well worth it (20 euros per ticket).
We started with two exhibits, one was a very beautiful movie (One) about the Ocean, its place in our lives. The other was a magnificent exhibit built by a Japanese master with beautiful music which gives a surreal ambiance of serenity to the place.

The rest of the aquarium was very nice too, with amazing fishes, sharks, and other wonderful creatures. The best: a couple of extremely cute otters that played around, such a treat!

Last but not least, the whole place gives a large part to ecological awareness, how to behave and consume responsibly. A big plus!

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"A wonderful oceanarium highlighting many interesting species. A highlight are two very unusual sunfish, and my favorite, penguins.",Jun 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,Really well done and an incredible experience. And why not try hiring some electric scooters outside and riding along to the major shopping centre/starbucks etc on the purpose built cycle/scooter lane ;-),Jul 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"The design of the oceanarium is quite clever, with one very large tank in the middle that housed many larger species, and 4 corners off of it representing different types of oceans. It was fun to watch the penguins while beautiful Inca terns flew around us in the Antarctica exhibit. It was also fun to watch the otters swimming and playing in the North Pacific exhibit. The huge tank in the middle represents One Ocean and has a wide range of species. It even has a very large sunfish! I did not expect to see one of those! I have always wanted to see one in person, rather than just in photos and videos! It also had a very large tiger bull shark. It was quite impressive to see one up close and safely. The oceanarium also had a beautiful exhibit at the beginning called Forests Underwater that was simply beautiful. The place was a lovely way to spend a few hours and a nice break from seeing gorgeous churches and extensive museums.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,Our two little boys love this place. We love this place! no cueing we hopped on to the cable car after,Jun 2021
Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,3.0,"Great place to see. The main tank is very big and can be seen from many angles and several floors. Some great animals I had never seen before, like a giant fish divers inside the tank were feeding by hand.

However, was a bit too busy for proper social distancing, despite booking in advance for a specific 1 hour time slot on a weekday (Monday) at 11:00. I think they are letting too many people in at each slot/hour, and also let people aggregate at specific places. I surely wouldn't go there on a weekend.

Walking outside of the building and near the riverfront was nice too.

Portugal,Oceanário de Lisboa,5.0,"Fantastic aquarium, one of the best I have visited anywhere in the world. Lots of fish, colourful and healthy, and tanks are clean and well cared for. Like all Portuguese people, Staff is super friendly and professional, we all speak more than one language. I highly recommend the gift shop, amazing T-shirts. If you can give a contribution to help care for the aquarium vs animals! The tickets is only €19 for adults but is well below price in comparison to smaller and less diverse aquarium I visited so is quite cost accessible. You have unique experiences packages.
I love it and highly recommend the visit.",May 2021

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,A walk along the upper level of the Dom Luis I bridge is absolutely essential for any visit to Porto. The views of the old town are unparalleled and the bridge itself is a marvel of 19th-century engineering.,Nov 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,We walked across on the lower level and after ckimbing up to the cable car station we crossed back. The views are stunning and worth the effort.,Nov 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"Visited at night only.

I actually started by crossing Ponte Infante Dom Henrique which offers a nice side view to Ponte Dom Luis, then on my way back ended up crossing Dom Luis. From up there, you can see the city lights, the top of the cathedral, pretty buildings, the lights reflected in Ribeira's water and the boats, some streets below... You get very pretty pictures at night, even the train crossing the bridge is a nice addition to the pictures lol

TL;DR: The view at night is incredible... Wish I had a boyfriend to share this moment with 😂

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,"It's a beautiful bridge. It has 2 levels, the top one is where you can see all the views of the river and of Porto. The lower side was currently under construction, due to this, there is nothing to see. Unique thing about this bridge is that it is a pedestrian and subway only bridge, so people pour out all over the bridge until the train comes and every hugs the sides. A must see.",Nov 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"Of course this is ""must"" when in Porto. Nice view over Douro river and especially when it's getting dark.",Oct 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"This is a 'must see' on a visit to Porto - both during the day and at night the views are superb. It is a live train track with no barriers, but the trains move slowly and make a lot of noise so are easy to avoid.",Oct 2021

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,The view is outstanding. You view the whole of Porto in all its colours. The night view is also beautiful with all the lights. The climb up to the monumeto just above the bridge is worthwhile. From there the view is even better,Oct 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"If you want to capture a different perspective of Porto, the river, the horizon, and the sunset, going on top of the bridge is the way to go. You may either walk up the hill opposite the bridge, or take the cable car.

The views of the bridge itself from the Cais are outstanding as well.

Simply magnificent!!!",Oct 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"You can walk or tram across the upper level, then walk back on the lower level, There's a cable car near the top down to the river on one side and a funicular on the other side.",Oct 2021

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"You have not seen Porto if you did not visit the bridge and the nearby area, on both sides of the river",Sep 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"Enjoyable experience - cars public transport still access lower level, Tram access on the Top level - more room to walk.",Sep 2021

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"We walked across both top and bottom levels of this very grand bridge. Views fantastic and just an experience. We walked from the Riberia side across to the Nova side; took the cable car down (6 euros) and walked along the riverside back to the bridge and back across along the bottom level. Really good way to experience the bridge with restaurants, bars and little stalls along the way back.",Jul 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,If you go to Porto you need to walk across the bridge. The views of the river are out of sight. Just the #1 thing to do in Porto,Jul 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,"The bridge connects Ribeira with Vila Nova de Gaia, and offers great views of both areas. The top deck is a little more windy and has periodic trains to avoid, but the views are better! The bottom has cars and leads you to the ground level with more cafes and wineries. You should walk across one level and switch on the return journey.",Jul 2021
Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,4.0,"A stunning structure which dominates central Porto. Said to have been designed by M. Eiffel (him of the Parisian Tower), it permits road traffic, pedestrians and heavy duty trams to cross. Study the interlacing of the structure and the strange ladders that allow engineers to climb up into the structure. On the North bank are numerous cafes and restaurants to enjoy the view from.",Jul 2021

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,Beautiful views from both levels - but the top is the showstopper. You can get the funicular from one side and the cable car from the other.

Portugal,Ponte de Dom Luís I,5.0,What a gorgeous feat of engineering and the night time double reflection in the water is so beautiful!!,May 2021

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,4.0,"We walked here one very hot morning from the Paladim Hotel in Albufeira, stopping at the marina for a well-deserved drink and some food, then it's a big hill climb and the signs disappear once you get into the very very nice luxurious bugalows and hotels which border the beach. It's a nice place, the only beach eatery seemed pretty good value but we couldn't get in as you have to book and we didn't know, it was packed. The queue for a drink took 30 minutes and the prices for water are a bit more than Albufeira, after all, we kept getting told it was an 'exclusive beach'. Got a good spot near the rocks and enjoyed the baking heat and the cool sea water, stayed 4 hours and then met a great bloke who runs the surf school shack in the car park who kindly called us an UBER taxi to get us back, it arrived in 5 minutes and cost 9 Euros, well-pleased!, lovely place but God only knows how much it is to stay here.

Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"We were fortunate enough that our hotel backed onto this beach so this was the closest one to us! It is quite a small beach and is fairly quiet, nicely tucked away. Lovely views from all around the beach too! Definitely worth visiting.",May 2021
Portugal,Praia Sao Rafael,5.0,"This was my favourite beach around Albufeira. I do not have a driver's license so I went there by Uber, it cost me less than 7 euro. It is beautiful, make sure to take poetic pictures from the rock which has a hole in the middle. My cousin has been there before and she said that behind this rock there is a kind of waterfall but when I was there, it was dry. It was totally lovely and in April I was in the water, surprisingly it was not cold! I could bathe, it was amazing. Long beach, beautiful, I can only recommend!",Apr 2021

Shame you now need to pay to use the toilets!!!",Oct 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Weather changes rapidly up here, but if you see it when it’s clear of cloud, this is a first-rate viewpoint and the departure point for some truly outstanding hiking.",Oct 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Wonderful views once the fog cleared! Not a chance I was doing the hike to the tallest Pico though, but it's a well marked out trail if you're a keen hiker and the weather is good. It was very wet and very poor visibility for us. Bring cash for toilets and snack bar.",Sep 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"It is the highest peak in Madeira that can be reached by car (or tour bus) and the third-highest on the island. It can be very cloudy at times, but when it isn't, the views of the island are spectacular. It can get very crowded at times.",Sep 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Amazing views and amazing drive up there! Went there twice, really nice. You can do vereda walk from here to Pico do Ruivo, but it is quite difficult, but if you're up to it - views are amazing! If you're not up for it - do it at least to the first view point it will take you 1 hour in total but it is worth it. Also - if you can go there in the morning before sun goes up - it is magical :)",Sep 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"The tour is also a must see in Madeira. The street is winding up through Monte and parking space is limited at the top. People park along the streets. If you go early enough you may have free views on the city and surroundings. In the afternoon the hilltop is mostly cloudy or even foggy, which limits the enjoyment. The trekking tour to Pico Ruivo is strenuous and you should be fit as it always goes up and down. However its spectacular, a highlight on the island",Sep 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Amazing and overwhelming view! A must do hike and possibly the best on the whole island! The whole path down is well paved, but can be challenging.",Sep 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Beautiful place, we drove up but be warned the car park was very full and many cars were abandoned on the road. Great views, even has a gift shop, restaurant and toilet.",Sep 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We did the hike on a Saturday and even though we arrived early the Parking Lot was already full, so we parked the car a little down the road. The road is sometimes a bit narrow and step, but take it easy you will make it for sure. At the parking lot is a shop and toilets, check your provision and go. The hike to the Pico Ruivo is amazing. The path is accessible but sometimes very steep-the view is Worth all efforts. You will pass a few tunnels, some are longer and you will need the light from your smartphone or a torch. For the whole hike we needed about 5 hours with stoppage at the top and taking plenty of photos. As mentioned there is a good path all the time but do not underestimate the physical challenge of this hike as it is very steep- we tracked an equivalent of 300 levels at the end of the day.
Highly recommend this hike if you are at Madeira- one of the best we‘ve ever did.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We did it. We did only one way and pre-booked a taxi to pick us at Achadas Teixeria back to Pico do Arieiro where we parked our car. We found this arrangement fit us the most as we did not want to join any guided tour. We wanted to hike at our own pace and we had rented a car and did not want to waste the money of not using the car on the day. We found a couple via TA Forum to share the taxi fee with us. The total taxi fare was EUR 60. So it was EUR15 for each of us. It took us one hour going back to Pico do Arieiro from Achada Teixeria. Relatively economical in this way. The taxi driver was very kind to offer us some banana after the hike. If you want to know the contact of the taxi arrangement, you can message me and I can share with you the travel agent's phone no.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"You can’t miss this hike if you’re in Madeira and the very early wake-up call to see the sunrise is totally worth it. You’ll witness the sun coming out of a sea of clouds and the view is majestic from the first miradouro along the path. Then, hike the nearly 7 km to Pico Ruivo to enjoy some other majestic mountain views along the way. You’ll walk along a breathtaking ridge and through tunnels and you’ll climb stairs surrounded by different kinds of vegetation up to the top. Tiring but doable if you’re moderately fit. Go there early to be blissed by the sunrise show and avoid crowds. There’s a parking and a cafeteria right by the starting point of PR1.",Jul 2021
Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"This is a must if visiting Madeira. The drive up is great fun especially if the clouds are low and you get to drive through them.

We did this twice whilst on Holiday in different weather to experience the difference in high and low clouds, was well worth it. The weather at the top can be different to the bottom.

Views from the top are fantastic.

From the top there are walk of approx 7km to the next highest point.

Had a pizza and drink in the Cafe and was standard price for Madeira.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Super views. Great walk up from Funchal or Monte. We walked from Monte. The Walk up via the ice house is great. A bit like Snowdon when you reach the top if you have walked there. (You know what I mean if your a walker)Full of people who have walked a short distance from there transport.
The cafe serves good soup.
Toilets are dirty and charge you 50 cents .

We did another walk by getting a taxi to drop us off at Pico do Arieiro and walked to Pico Ruivo. This is the walk most people do. The views are great. This walk is worth doing but I wouldn’t do again due to the amount of people in big groups.

After Pico Areiro we took the encumaeda pass then took the fork off down to nuns valley. Great views looking back up at the mountains. This is a great walk if you are a walker. We then caught the bus back to Funchal on the road where the path comes out. This is a 5.5 hrs at a good pace with a couple of short stops.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"Thursday 24th June and we drove from Caniço to the interior of the Island to visit this amazing place. Our route took us along steep winding roads via Joao Frino, Poiso and finally here.

The flora and fauna along the roadside on the way was an experience in itself. There were a wide variety of all types colourful plants and blooms lining the roadside, beautiful.

On the way we did encounter large patches of low cloud, it resembled a rolling mist with poor visibility. At on stage we thought there is no point continuing with our journey.

Thankfully we persevered and were rewarded with the most incredible scenery when we arrived here as we were actually above the cloud.

Pico do Arieiro, is Madeira's third highest peak at 1,818 metres above sea level.

There are a number of hiking routes around here for seasoned walkers.

At the base of the steps, which go to the peak, there is a stone marker which informs visitors that at that point they are 1,810 metres above sea level. So need to climb the  steps to the concrete marker to reach the summit, standing on top of the marker is a popular photo opportunity.

Also located here is a radar installation, a large ball like structure, think it has Naval connections.

There is a cafe and a souvenir shop.

There are toilets here for which there is a charge of €0.50.

It is very popular here and parking can be a bit of a nightmare, so be prepared to park down the road a bit and walk up to the peak.

Portugal,Pico do Arieiro,5.0,"We went on a cloudy day and had really low expectations... until we kept driving up the mountain and eventually left the clouds behind! What an incredible feeling to be above the clouds - it feels like you are in the heavens with Zeus on Mount Olympus. This place is just incredibly beautiful, with plunging cliffs and lush rainforests below. The drive up here can be quite scary if you're not accustomed to winding mountain roads, but it is well-paved and a very safe road. Highly recommend!",May 2021

Take the steps down to the rocks from which the boats leave, book directly from the guy standing there ($20 for adults, $10 for kids 5 and over; for $70 you get a private boat) and take the 35 min ride sightseeing all the caves and secluded beaches from the water.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,2.0,"In this area there is a road to walk for several km with nice views, but is not different from the rest of places you can find in Algarve.
I expected Ponta da Piedade to be something so spectacular because of these reviews but is nothing more than the typical tourist trap. You go down some stairs to take a boat to see the typical rock formations that you can see in any point of Algarve.

Portugal,Ponta da Piedade,5.0,"A lovely place to watch the sunset! I drove there with my friend who has a car and is a local and showed me this spot. After we got to the lighthouse, we walked to the right side and there is a wooden path which is very poetic and there were some benches for people to sit and watch the sunset. Previously, I had gone there and did not turn right but left and walked around to have a closer look of the rock formations and also saw very big set of stairs going down but apparently there was no beach there.

There are so many parts to this palace, and kids would be totally entranced by the grottos and climbing opportunities (the chance to be Rapunzel in a tall tower!).

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,Written by my 8 and 5 yrs old: it was so so so beautiful! It looks like the fairies could live there. I loved the well and the drawings in the Palace. The architecture of the Palace was really good because the ceilings were rich with crafted woods and the floors with marbles.,Oct 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Definitely worth a visit to explore the gardens and tour the palace! Be advised that the initiate's well (seen from above in all promo photos) cannot actually be viewed from above - only from within. Still definitely worth checking out, however!",Oct 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"First off - you must visit here, it is incredible and not to be missed on a visit to Sintra.
The house is around 100 years old and was built by a millionaire business man who also happened to be a Freemason and member of the Illuminati. It is thought that the grounds of this property hosted initiations into the society and events for the Freemasons.
The grounds are stunning and the perfect place to get lost, with twists and turns, hidden underground tunnels and a 27m deep well.
The house itself is incredibly grand and well maintained.
It is €10 to enter but I would recommend going on a guided tour to here so that someone can take you and show you around while telling you about the history of the place. I would recommend “keep it local” tours.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"While on our anniversary trip with my wife, this is one of the sites I was looking forward to seeing the most. It did not disappoint.

The gardens and the well were amazing to see, and truly blew my mind. The house was amazing, although they still appear to be renovating several other areas, so this is only going to get better. A complete enjoyable experience. I can’t wait to g back and see what more work they have done and continue to open new rooms in the house.",Oct 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"This place is a must see while in Sintra. The grounds and gardens are other-worldly. I saw the well and tunnel online, and knew I had to see it. It turned out to be even cooler than I imagined. The rest of the grounds are equally impressive and grand, in a quirky sort of way that was just fun. Only downside is the limited access to the main palace house, and the insanely authoritarian approach of security involving masking while outdoors on the grounds. One of our group put her mask on while walking up to the entry turnstile, and the tiny little excuse for a security guard insisted she go back to the door, take the mask off, and put it back on before walking back! People like this have no place in tourism. Hopefully once Covid passes, his kind will be stripped of this shred of power they try to wield. Regardless of security and their issues, this tour is worth every Euro!

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,4.0,"The gardens are amazing as well as the story of the well and tunnels. Beautiful location in the mountains. The house is beautiful, but unfortunately only the main level is open to the public. There is plenty see and enjoy around the gardens. Having a guided tour of the grounds is extremely helpful to understand this place. Very responsible price to enter",Sep 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,2.0,"I visited mainly for the palace.
I queued for twenty minutes and was back out in under five minutes, most of which was spent waiting for my turn to peer into a room briefly.
You pass through one room, look at the lobby, look at the recital room, look into another, pass through a second room and you’re out. (The rest of the place is being renovated).
I stood at the entrance of the chapel and looked in.
After that, I simply couldn’t be bothered to wander round the rest of the grounds.
Is anything else open? Even if it is, are you restricted to peering in from the door? Who knows?
To cap it all, the lady in the bookshop did her best to prevent me buying some of the books I wanted (picture souvenir books, but in Portuguese), then insisted on putting them all into separate paper bags. I had to fight to avoid her giving me a plastic carrier bag. So much for reducing waste.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"The most mystical fairytale place that I have ever visited. The entire castle and the surrounding gardens are imbued with an atmosphere of mystery. Even after reading many interesting facts about the history of the place, there is no certainty that all this corresponds to reality.
All lovers of riddles, unusual pictures, beautiful locations - definitely here.
It takes a lot of time. To get into the well of Initiation, for example, there is a queue for 2 hours. So plan ahead.",Aug 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"Absolutely amazing architecture, gardens and historic interests... the initiation well is amazing!!!
Booking is easy at the main door €10 and you can get the listening guide in various languages. This provides interesting information on a specific viewpoint or building. I would take standard headphones 🎧 with a wire (round jack) as the volume does not go very loud so in a crowded area it is a bit hard to hear. 🙂🙂
Give yourself 2 hours to fully explore and see inside the beautiful house 🏠..
Excellent attraction!! 🙂🙂",Aug 2021
Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,3.0,"This is a spectacular villa and garden at the north end of Sintra old town. It is about a 12 min walk from town, mostly flat although the actual entrance is up a hill. It is poorly signposted but you have to walk on the road round the corner of the main villa and 100m or so up hill to the entrance.

The cost is EUR10 per person and you get a map. We headed straight to the main attraction which is the initiation well. At first there are a few signs but then the disappear. We walked for 15 mins around the upper garden looking for it amongst dozens of others. It should not be difficult to put up more signs as clearly everyone was having issues. Once there the well is truly something special to see. You enter at the top, spiral about 60m down and then exit through a long underground tunnel.

The other attractions (house, lake labyrinth, etc) are nice but not spectacular in my view. Overall we were happy we went to see the initiation well, but did not spend more than about an hour in the gardens.

Portugal,Quinta da Regaleira,5.0,"A short walk from the centre of contra along a flat road is this wonderful attraction. At €10 per adult it’s very reasonably priced and plenty to see for a few hours.
The main attraction is the initiation well, we queued for about 20-25 minutes as they are restricting entry to limited numbers at a time with the pandemic. This meant it was quieter inside with plenty of opportunity to take the attraction in.
After making our way to the well (keep an eye out for small paths and stairs as they are shortcuts to the main track) we headed down the hill to explore the rest.
Make sure you find the hidden labyrinth behind the lake at the bottom left, it’s dark so bring a torch but incredible!

A great day for everyone.

All the buildings and gardens are so beautiful, loved walking round and taking it all in. Only annoyance was the queue for the well which was about 30+ people long we didn’t wait for, and a queue for the place inside I imagine due to covid to limit numbers but that went quick enough.
There was also a comedy play with some seating in one of the areas, quite funny and unexpected.

Most of the paths are cut off and there is no warning on the website or at the entrance or ticket office. So, we were counting to be able to have a normal visit here, but most of the little corners that made the place really special are inaccessible.

There are many special small constructions dotted around the grounds, buildings that really served no purpose other than being different and attractive. Just walking around the colourful gardens coming across a small castle, a waterfall grotto or ornate Italianate wall with turret is a delight. In truth the actual palace whilst stunning externally does not offer a lot internally except for a couple of very special rooms.

Portugal,Seven Hanging Valleys Trail,4.0,"We started at Praia de Centeanes and got as far as Praia de Carvalho in 2 hours at a leisurely pace, with a short picnic stop. Turned round and went back because we didn't want to be on the trail after dark. Return journey took 1 hr 30 min.
The scenery is beautiful and intriguing: cliffs, stacks, sinkholes.
The path is quite rough, sometimes sand, sometimes clay, sometimes rock. A few places have well-made wooden steps. I would say not suitable for children under age 5, because of some steep bits, and because in some places you are walking quite close to the cliff edge. No toilets seen on the half we walked. I wouldn't recommend it when wet because some bits would be slippery. Probably best avoided in the heat of the summer sun, as there is not much shade!
But another day we will drive to Carvalho and walk the other half of the trail.

Portugal,25 Fontes and Cascada da Risco,5.0,"The Rabacal area is definitely worth a visit although it's very popular so don't expect to be hiking in solitude and it's a real pain when you get stuck behind a group on the nartow levada paths!

The drive up from Funchal is pretty steep and takes about an hour (rather quicker 45 mins back down). Reasonable amount of car parking but toilets only available by the cafe.

All the trails are well signposted so you really don't need a guide. Expect the temperature to be around 8 degrees cooler than the coast.

Most of the trails are pretty easy and vertigo free although there are plenty of steps. We walked for around 4.5 hours total, covering 12 miles and took in 25 Fontes, Risco and Lagos da Vento. The Risco waterfall is the most impressive and the shortest trail if you are time limited.

There is a very nice cafe with sandwiches, great cake and coffee options as well as some hot dishes. If you don't want to walk down (or back up both around 30 mins) there is a minibus service for 3 euro or 5 euro return.

Good day out to experience the Madeira mountains.

It's a bit uneven in places (as you'd expect - it is up a mountain!) - I only mention this as it probably wouldn't be suitable for anyone unsteady on their feet. One or two places are quite high with fairly steep drops, but if you stay the other side of the path it should be ok for those who don't like heights - for those that do this gives some stunning views!",Jul 2021

The tasting was exceptional, going for the super premium tastings at €35 gets you spirited away to a different tasting room with wood panelled walls and Chesterfield arm chairs giving it the feel of a Pall Mall club. You are given a flight of three generously measured ports to which you can add specific wines of your choosing (and a cheese platter). Our guide was knowledgable on the wines. There is no pressure on you to spend wildly, so of course we did. Came away very happy and merry having enjoyed some top notch wines. The Tawny wine progression was noticeably interesting as you went up the ageing. Even my wife thoroughly enjoyed it and she is far from a big port drinker.

We had 3 great tastings of Graham’s Port (very generous sizes!) and was also offered a complimentary extra glass of a different type of port also.

We then went onto lunch where we had 4 brilliant courses (small appetiser, starter, main (beautifully cooked steak), and dessert, along with 3 glasses of wine throughout and unlimited still or sparkling water and a coffee at the end.
