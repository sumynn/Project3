Prague Zoo,Czech,"Great zoo, probably one of the best and biggest in Europe.
It has a wide variety of species from the smallest to the biggest ( jiraffe, hipo, elephants... and even polar bears!)

It is a perfect place to spend the full day, as it takes around 4 hours non-stop to visit all the installations. It also have restaurants, kiosks, machines, etc. and everything at a very affordable prices. They also have activities, shows and exhibitions for both adults and children.

It´s very recommended to get a map at the entrance of the zoo as well as the schedule of the activities and show, to make sure you don´t miss the important ones.

Conections to Prague City Centre are very diverse and very easy to get to the Park, using tramp/bus takes you directly to the main entrance.

Prague Zoo,Czech,"Very well kept, clean and well signposted. Some very nice enclosures and some interesting animals to look at. We easily spent 3+ hours just wandering about. The only negative point is that as far as we could see all, bar one, of the cafe areas only had outside seating. It was cold and very windy when we went and not very pleasant to sit down and have a coffee. Our top tip: take a taxi there, it was about £16 there and back.",4.0,Oct 2021

Prague Zoo,Czech,"One of the most beautiful zoos I visited in Europe. Very large, to see it at your own pace, you need at least half a day. The natural setting of the area is very well used to create areas as close as possible to the natural environment of most animals. Easy to reach by public transport.
In many places there are kiosks where you can have a snack or a beer or a soft drink. Avoid going on weekends, it is extremely crowded.
I did not like that the map of the zoo is not included in the ticket price, as at other zoos I visited.",4.0,Aug 2021

Prague Zoo,Czech,"Beautiful and spacious zoo.
Easily accessible through metro and bus from Prague center. The zoo is VERY big so be prepared for a lot of walking (and climbing the hills). There is a chairlift but unfortunately, it is not included in the admission price - which is a pity.
There are many rare and lesser known animals here, so be prepared to discover some new species! Many different food options, just don't expect haute cuisine.",4.0,Sep 2021
Prague Zoo,Czech,"Its almost 15 min by Uber from center of Prague.
Not far ,easy access,should buy ticket on entrance and the price is about 10 euro which is very reasonable.
Has many kinds of animal which i never saw,and each of them are divided by continent or climate,im sorry for some wild ones like tiger ,panter or fishing cat which are in very small area,but needs exactly one day from morning,unfortunately we went on sunday and zoo was full of people,sounds ,and children and i guess most animal were afraid ,so we couldn’t see many kinds of them specially wild ones.
The zoo had some signs to show where you have to go but in some parts also were not any signs and make you confuse!

Staromestske namesti,Czech,"I did a guided live-streamed tour of the Old Town with a guide from Prague City Adventures on Heygo. The tour lasted an hour. We started at the Municipal House which features a spectacular façade decorated with numerous statues and stuccos, as well as an enormous semi-circular mosaic on top of the main entrance. It is located next to the Powder Gate. The Municipal House is the most impressive Art Nouveau building in Prague and it houses the largest concert hall in Prague.
The Powder Tower, also known as Powder Gate, is a dark Gothic tower which serves as a gateway to the Medieval Royal Route, and is currently one of the most iconic buildings of Prague. This tower was built in 1475 and during the seventeenth century, the tower was used to store gunpowder, hence its name.
We walked down Celetna Road.
We also saw an example of Czech cubist architecture in the Grand Café Orient which is inside the House of the Black Madonna. We also looked at the display of cakes in the window. Some cakes are in the form of coronavirus while there is also one looking like a bottle of vaccine. When we reached the Old Town Square,
the guide was so lovely to give us the best postcard shots of the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Its construction began in 1350, and it was finished in 1511. Nowadays, it is one of the most impressive Gothic buildings in Prague with its eighty-meter high spires. We also saw the Kinsky Palace, a pink-and-white Rococo manor in the middle of Old Town Square.
Our tour includes the viewing of the iconic astronomical clock found on the South wall of the Prague Town Hall. The Calendar Dial represents the months of the year. The Dial also has medallions with all the zodiac signs and the Prague Old Town symbol in the centre. It also has four small sculptures that don’t move: a Philosopher, an Angel, an Astronomer and a Chronicler. The Astronomical Dial represents the Universe. The dial includes a Zodiacal ring that shows the location of the Sun and the two clock hands are designed with a Sun and a Moon each. The show on the hour was a short one and our guide gave us a good view of it.

Charles Bridge,Czech,"I LOVED walking across this iconic bridge. The details of all of the statues along the bridge is amazing. The bridge crosses over the Vltava River which runs through the Czech Republic. There were some venders selling their crafts on the bridge, but they did not yell out or hawk their wares. There were several excellent painters. I enjoyed hearing about the statues. Probably the one that will stick with me is the statue of St. John of Nemuchuk. Our guide told us the story of his demise. Fascinating! This is a totally free experience. I would like to go back and check out some of the statues and venders more in depth since we were there as a small group. The Czech people are very proud ot the Bridge. The bridge is named after King Charles the 4th.

Cesky Krumlov Castle,Czech,"Excellent views. We walked up but there appears to be parking, but does not seem to be wholly wheelchair accessible. Worth the short climb.",5.0,Sep 2021
Cesky Krumlov Castle,Czech,I have traveled a lot in 40 years and seen many castles. Cesky Krumlov Castle is fairly good. But the theater there is an absolute gem that is not to be missed. One of only two preserved theaters of its era left in Europe. The new remodel was done 1766-68. Original props and costumes are still there and all the wooden effect- creating machinery. The tour is from both the audience and under the stage areas. Fascinating.,4.0,Aug 2021

Cesky Krumlov Castle,Czech,"The castle is really impressive and worth visiting simply for its stunning views and scenery. However, the tours are also totally worth checking out!

The first tour we did was for the baroque theatre. The tour is really well-structured, and our tour guide was able to show her knowledge and explain everything really well.

The second one we did was the 'basic 1' tour of the castle. The tour on itself is already worth paying for, as you explore amazing parts of the castle filled with history and great views, especially the masquerade hall. However, what made it incredible and memorable for us was our incredible tour guide, Jan. He explained every bit of history from Cesky Krumlov with great enthusiasm, showcasing his great knowledge about the history of the castle and surrounding areas. Jan is a funny and interactive guide, making the experience more of an immersive talk rather than a simple monologue. If you ever take an English tour of the castle, be sure to ask for Jan as your guide!

Cesky Krumlov Castle,Czech,"The castle itself is pretty impressive, butvthe fact that they still keep two bears in such a small space in the front is irresponsible and absolutely from another time.",2.0,Jul 2021
Cesky Krumlov Castle,Czech,"The castle is a huge sprawling complex, with construction styles spanning centuries. It was one of the most important regional power centres in southern Bohemia and beyond. The castle was owned by three different noble families over the centuries, each of whom left their distinctive mark. The Baroque gardens are impressive, but the theatre is one of the best preserved theatres of its type in the world. The great bridge connecting the castle and the theatre looks almost like a Roman aqueduct and gives a very distinctive look. The tower at the western edge of the castle gives wonderful views of the town. All in the all, the castle is beautiful and fascinating both inside and out.",5.0,Jun 2021
