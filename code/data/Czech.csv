Czech,Liv,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Amazing zoo, even though it‚Äôs winter there was a lot to see. We arrived at 11am but the zoo closed at 4pm which was a shame because there was still so much left to see!
Very accessible by bus. We had a great day and for the little money you pay it‚Äôs an amazing experience. A must see if you have a day to spare in Prague.",Nov 2021

Czech,GMG,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Great zoo, probably one of the best and biggest in Europe.
It has a wide variety of species from the smallest to the biggest ( jiraffe, hipo, elephants... and even polar bears!)

It is a perfect place to spend the full day, as it takes around 4 hours non-stop to visit all the installations. It also have restaurants, kiosks, machines, etc. and everything at a very affordable prices. They also have activities, shows and exhibitions for both adults and children.

It¬¥s very recommended to get a map at the entrance of the zoo as well as the schedule of the activities and show, to make sure you don¬¥t miss the important ones.

Conections to Prague City Centre are very diverse and very easy to get to the Park, using tramp/bus takes you directly to the main entrance.

Czech,Gavin J,Prague Zoo,4.0,"Very well kept, clean and well signposted. Some very nice enclosures and some interesting animals to look at. We easily spent 3+ hours just wandering about. The only negative point is that as far as we could see all, bar one, of the cafe areas only had outside seating. It was cold and very windy when we went and not very pleasant to sit down and have a coffee. Our top tip: take a taxi there, it was about ¬£16 there and back.",Oct 2021
Czech,Snory L,Prague Zoo,4.0,"It was very good for a zoo, and offered a wide variety of species. I would have to complain about the amount of climbing done to see the elephants and so on. The cable car was very fun.",Sep 2021
Czech,zuv,Prague Zoo,4.0,"One of the most beautiful zoos I visited in Europe. Very large, to see it at your own pace, you need at least half a day. The natural setting of the area is very well used to create areas as close as possible to the natural environment of most animals. Easy to reach by public transport.
In many places there are kiosks where you can have a snack or a beer or a soft drink. Avoid going on weekends, it is extremely crowded.
I did not like that the map of the zoo is not included in the ticket price, as at other zoos I visited.",Aug 2021

Easily accessible through metro and bus from Prague center. The zoo is VERY big so be prepared for a lot of walking (and climbing the hills). There is a chairlift but unfortunately, it is not included in the admission price - which is a pity.
There are many rare and lesser known animals here, so be prepared to discover some new species! Many different food options, just don't expect haute cuisine.",Sep 2021
Czech,PnazH77,Prague Zoo,4.0,"Its almost 15 min by Uber from center of Prague.
Not far ,easy access,should buy ticket on entrance and the price is about 10 euro which is very reasonable.
Has many kinds of animal which i never saw,and each of them are divided by continent or climate,im sorry for some wild ones like tiger ,panter or fishing cat which are in very small area,but needs exactly one day from morning,unfortunately we went on sunday and zoo was full of people,sounds ,and children and i guess most animal were afraid ,so we couldn‚Äôt see many kinds of them specially wild ones.
The zoo had some signs to show where you have to go but in some parts also were not any signs and make you confuse!

Czech,Lets cruise,Prague Zoo,5.0,The Prague zoo is on of my favorites places in Prague. Since the 2002 flood the Zoo came a long way.

The zoo is very clean, hilly in places and very big.
The animal enclosures are pretty big and the animals seem well cared for.
The different zones of the zoo are great and match the theme of the areas where the animals are from.
Lots of things for kids to do.

Loved the cable car ride up to the top, the views of the city are fantastic.
Would highly recommend a trip here.

Has elevations and heights that need to be walked on foot, and can get tiring, especially for those motivated to see the entirety of the exhibits. Definitely need a whole day to enjoy the exhibits, but half a day would be enough if one chooses in advance what to cover and see.",Aug 2019

Czech,Tigeriffic69,Prague Zoo,3.0,"It is very easy to get here from the centre of Prague. Very reasonably priced. Paid at ticket desk. You have to pay for a map which I think is a great idea. There are some nice views over Prague. I ate at there restaurant ""Gulab"", great value, but be careful when ordering coleslaw, as I was given a beer. Eventually I was given the correct product. It was great to see the polar bears. There was no Hippos due to maintenance. The giraffe enclosure seemed to have too many giraffes in one space. It was great to see the Lions, and Tigers up close, but they was in such a small space, it didn't seem right. I also like the gorilla section, there is always a mischievous one, which is nice and fun to see. I did not see many toilets around.

Czech,Sean B,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Seeing as we always enjoy a Zoo visit what was a trip to Prague without a visit to the Zoo.
It was well worth the trip.
My wife had never seen a polar bear and was very impressed to see two in the zoo. We managed to see the majority of the animals close up too.
The hippo enclosure was closed which was disappointing as well as some of the other enclosures while they update and the chair lift was not running.
Be prepared for lots of climbing slopes. We have never visited a zoo with so much elevation which is understandable when you read the details on the zoos past flooding history. I was very impressed by the mountain goat exhibit it is a must see I don‚Äôt want to spoil it.
Also loved that Dogs where welcome in the Zoo we love to take our dog with us to Zoos but many in the UK do not allow dogs.

We visited and we were not disappointed! The trip for our family of five in an Uber XL took 15 minutes from the centre of town and only set us back ¬£8, the entry was very reasonable too. We had never experienced tigers, giraffes and gorillas at such close range (but behind glass.) It was truly fascinating. The cages were mostly spacious apart from the polar bears but they had a new huge enclosure under construction. The animals seemed well cared for and happy. We had a great day and would definitely recommend Prague zoo to anyone visiting the area. I think the children would say it was the highlight of our trip!

Czech,TomOCM,Prague Zoo,1.0,"Short and sweet, this zoo samples animals who clearly look distressed, bored and upset. I am not animal expert, but having watched the polar bears in a very small enclosure for roughly 5 minutes, it became very apparent that one was pacing up and down the enclosure, to and from the exact spot which after doing some research is an clear sign of the animal being in stress.
One elephant and all the tigers doing the exact same movement.

Very sad - we left shortly after seeing the tigers which was unfortunately the last straw.",Feb 2020
Czech,The Ellie That Travels,Prague Zoo,4.0,"We couldn‚Äôt quite believe how far we walked that day!! The zoo is mapped over terrain which makes it different to many zoos I have visited before.

Czech,David W,Prague Zoo,4.0,"We chose to take a cab to the zoo as it was outside the city centre and not on the metro network, there are bus stops at the zoo but we didn't want to risk getting lost, anyway the cab only cost a few pounds.
The zoo is on a hillside and offers wonderful panoramic views of the city, beautiful on a sunny winters day. The selection of animals was vast and all looked well cared for in naturalistic enclosures. The mountain sections with goats and Barbary macaques ascending vertical cliffs are stunning. The facilities in the zoo were immaculate and the toilets were the cleanest I've seen in a tourist attraction and even the gift shops were great value for money.
We spent half a day winding our way round the zoo which is on a hill but there is so much to see, the indoor cat house gives some of the closest encounters you could ever have with tigers and lions . We were also fascinated watching the polar bears playing in their wave pool. If in Prague it is well worth making the trip to the zoo.

Czech,Emily B,Prague Zoo,5.0,"This is a fantastic zoo. It's huge, well signposted and has a large variety of animal species.

We traveled from Lesser Town via tram and bus - it's a very easy journey and cheap too. Trams and buses were regular on both the way there and back. Entry to the zoo was also very reasonable. There are lockers just outside the entrance which could hold largish bags (probably not suitcases).

Almost all of the exhibits were excellent. For the most part they were large and a lot of work had obviously been put into making them as natural as possible. There were different shelter options, lots of foliage and enrichment items. There was a lot of coverage so that animals did not have to be on display and indeed there were some that we did not see - obviously disappointing for visitors but I believe this a sign of a good zoo. One or two of the habitats were less than perfect, mostly for the big animals - e.g the bison and polar bears. However I understand that the polar bears are currently having a new exhibit built, and they did seem happy - we watched one of them playing for some time.

All of the animals looked healthy and as far as we could tell, happy. They were interacting with each other, their habitats and in some cases the visitors (most notably the orangutans)!

The terrain of the zoo is very steep and a little hard to get around if you're not 100% mobile, but there are slopes and ramps so it is wheelchair accessible.

In all this is a truly good zoo. We enjoyed it so much that we returned on our last day in Prague, for an extra few hours. We would definitely return if we went back to the city.

The zoo is huge, we were there for 4 hours and didn‚Äôt even finish it, so leave yourself a whole day if you‚Äôre going. All the animals had really big enclosures which I‚Äôm very picky about and will make or break a zoo for me and all seemed extremely well looked after and the variety of animals was fantastic!!

Czech,Jen P,Prague Zoo,5.0,"The open spaces are beautiful. I loved seeing actual logs and branches being used inside and outside the enclosures, and creative use of spaces to traverse the zoo. The animals seem healthy. We were there in winter, so many of the African animals were inside, but many had the choice to go out. Not sure if the giraffes and elephants go out or not in winter. I was surprised at the vast number of species here.",Jan 2020
Czech,Benjamin T,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Very well looked after, the management are clearly interested in animal standard of living as enclosures are spacious and cleaned. Animals had space which is important for a modern zoo and there were no abusive ""animal shows"". Some European animals like wolves which you very rarely see in other zoos.
Especially recommend the bar restaurant next to the gazelle enclosure, the beer is good and cheap.
A public bus takes you to the zoo, which was fine getting there, but made coming back during rush hour at closing time difficult.

Czech,GeoffandClare1,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Great zoo with some wonderful animals. Loads of giraffes, elephants, tigers, polar bears etc. Lots of other animals. Easily a good few hours of entertainment for a reasonable price.

We went six years ago when my little boy was two. I took both he and his younger brother (6) to the zoo on 4th Jan. While in the tiger area on a rainy day we saw a zoo keeper cleaning one of the cages. We walked over and watched her and took a photo as we thought she was really brave. Just as I had taken the photo she turned around and starred at us. She was really angry and began snarling and staring me out. I was genuinely terrified - I wish I had taken another photo so I could accurately record the intensity of the exchange, but I was genuinely too scared. She just stood, snarling ... genuinely furious. After a minute of starring into my eyes she began to clean the windows with some spray. This zoo keeper was clearly not having a good day and was very angry. As soon as we could we fled the tiger area. I have never experienced such fear in a family venue ... it really brought the dangers of visiting a zoo home to us all. My children thought it was amazing and couldn't stop laughing. She was definitely NOT joking!!! At the end of the day as we were leaving I said to my sons they could have their favourite exhibit as a cuddly toy. Both asked for the 'angry lady'. Sadly the zoo does not have a cuddly version yet. Honestly this was the best bit of the trip. Thanks.

Czech,Lee M,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Excellent zoo....
As a family we have always been unsure of zoos outside the UK following a visit to a poor one in France...

The reviews for this one tempted me and honestly glad we have it a go.
Crazy cheap for a day out.
People on here have said animals are inside and not out roaming in December... what do you expect it‚Äôs freezing. Visit any zoo this time of year and you won‚Äôt see much.....
What they haven‚Äôt mentioned is although the giraffes, elephants, tigers etc might not be outside there are excellent viewing sections of the indoors.

Parts are dated but also there are brand new sections and new sections being built.

If you have a spare day it‚Äôs well worth a visit...
And if you do visit spend the extra ‚Ç¨1 and go up the chairlift, all part of the fun

Czech,h_schamhardt,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Amazing, very large (and actually still growing further) zoo, beautifully situated over a large hill, which is used for some of the animals. With Komodo Dragons and Giant Salamanders as very special attractions. And nice domains for the other animals. Due to colder weather unfortunately many animals inside, which does make sense. One (maybe even the) best zoo we have visited!",Dec 2019
Czech,Ashley G,Prague Zoo,3.0,"Great zoo, but a lot of the animals werent out due to the cold (went in December). Loved the penguins, several giraffes, and tiger. A good variety of animals, but would recommend going when its warmer to be able to see more. Only other thing I wasnt a fan of were it seemed to be a lack of food options for toddlers. We went to a couple different restaurants and while it was neat they tried to theme the food with the area we were in, there weren't many basic food options like chicken nuggets/fries/pizza/spaghetti/etc. The food we had though was really good for ""zoo"" food!",Dec 2019
Czech,LucySaw92,Prague Zoo,5.0,"This was the best zoo I have ever visited! Such a variety of animals, some I've never seen in person before.

Due to the weather, some of the animals weren't out, but you can still see them through the glass on the inside section. So you still get to see all the animals.

Advice would be to leave plenty of time to get round the zoo, we were there for 4hours and we didn't get round the whole thing, but we did just about manage to see all of the animals. So leave plenty of time. Also, we went in December so pretty cold, make sure you layer up and wear comfortable boots/shoes as theres lots of walking to do.

Got to see my favourite animal, elephants ... in absolute fascination. They were amazing! Definitely recommend getting to see them. Along with the giraffes and polar bears ... amazing too! The polar bears unexpectedly fascinated me, playing around with the ball in the water like humans ... amazing!

There are toilets and eating/drinking stalls around the whole zoo within good distance of each other. We had food in the main canteen/cafe and it was delicious. We had the pork casserole with rice and the beef stew with rice ... they were both so tasty! They have it written in English underneath so you understand what you're looking at. Reasonably priced too.

100% recommend going here!

It‚Äôs a big zoo, and the food served is good, some of the animals do seem in good condition, but when I looked up Prague zoo I read it was one of the worst zoos to visit because of how small the polar bears enclosures is, you can see the distress on them it‚Äôs awful üò¢

Czech,jeffrey h,Prague Zoo,5.0,"While in Prague, we visited the zoo. Mostly this was because my wife likes zoos a lot and we have been to more than our share. This zoo was reported to be one of the biggest and best in Europe. It is in an out of the center location, not served by the metro. We solved this problem by taking an Uber to the zoo. It cost about 10 USD after conversion to local currency. The cost of admission to the zoo is fair.
A word about converting to Czech currency. Much was made of the rip off conversion parlors in Prague. We initially changed some money at a cash machine, which are also suspect. Banks are hard to access. It turned out, though, that there was a place to change money near the Charles bridge that was fair enough...if you don't get the last 5% its not the end of the world, right?
Now back to the zoo. This is indeed a big zoo. It has lots of neat animals, especially komodo dragons, which occur in three different enclosures. There was also an exhibit with exceedingly rare macaw parrots.
There are plenty of specialty exhibits, The Amazon rain forest is great and can you imagine being in a dark room with Flying Fox bats swooping around you!
The zoo was clean and modern, the restrooms were plentiful and free and the animals were very well cared for.
Without meaning to be xenophobic, there were no hordes of Asian tourists which were a problem in Central Prague. I love people of all kinds but those huge groups can overwhelm you. So the zoo represented a chance to get away from the maddening crowd.
If there is a complaint, it is that the zoo includes a significant ridge. Additionally, it is a long distance between the animal enclosures..And there is no transportation inside the zoo. We would have liked to see the wild horses, but as we are older, they were just beyond our ability to walk that far up hill.
As elsewhere in Prague, things were mostly signed in Czech, And most of the employees did not speak English. Czech is an obscure language to us occidentals.
Getting back from the zoo was easy. We took a bus to a metro station and caught a tram from there to our neighborhood. As I suspected, it would have been difficult to do this out bound because I don't speak Czech and finding that bus to the zoo might have been tricky.
All in all, the zoo was a great excursion.

Especially asian and african animals like elephants lions are not seen even at the indoor area and some even not allowed to go in (3) even cable car is close no service
Lot of walking and indication and signs are not really clear for example only one exit is open but signs show another exit to the other parking area which is not really an exit which is confusing to tourists

If you are over sixty entrance to the zoo is around ¬£6, over 70's with proof of age pay the equivalent 4 pence!!! Compared to the British Zoos this is unbelievable value. You could easily spend the best part of a day here, great variety of animals. As with most zoos you may question whether they should be there, but then you have to think of the breeding programme with the endangered species and the good work they do with other zoos and countries. Felt sorry for the polar bears, when you think of the vast area they cover in the wild compared with comparatively small enclosures in the zoo, but they looked content. Food was a bit hit and miss in the takeaway outlets, not sure about the actual restaurants within the zoo. It is quite hilly to walk around, so take this in account if you struggle with hills. All in all a nice way to spend the day.

Czech,Angela,Prague Zoo,5.0,"As a group visiting Prague from the UK, we decided to check out the zoo and were thrilled we did - the zoo is a brilliant and a great day out.

Getting to the zoo is super simple. From the centre of Prague, we bought a 90 minute ticket at the metro station costing 32 Kƒç which is valid on all city buses, trams and the metro! We took two trains to arrive at N√°dra≈æ√≠ Hole≈°ovice station and literally right outside the station is the stop for the 112 bus which runs every 10 minutes and takes you right to the zoo. Easy!

The zoo itself is enormous and has some really great exhibits - particularly that of the Barbary macaques and Barbary sheep which is built into a steep cliff and so presenting as natural environment for the animals as possible - fantastic to see them climbing up the rocks!

One unique aspect of this zoo due to its size and steep nature is the chair lift from one section to another. Must admit, I had serious jelly legs riding it but glad I did!

Be prepared to walk, we put in some serious steps and still didn‚Äôt see everything!

Highly recommended!

Zoo entry price is good - less than ¬£13 for both of us - take student ID if aged between 16 and 18. Car park charge is extra so perhaps take tram and bus, which stops directly outside the zoo.

It is as if a rich person was playing Zoo Tycoon, and thought I could do this in real life.

The place is massive and we must have walked 10 miles by the end of the day, which was a little hard going with a pushchair due to a couple of steep hills and the sheets size (don‚Äôt be put off, the pathways were in very good condition and I am out of shape)

Some of the enclosures are incredible, (Yes, know animals should be free to live in the wild, but humans are awful and destroying habitats and it will be Zoos that bring animals back from the brink), sorry back to the enclosures, they are simply fantastic for visitors and animals alike, large and open.

On top of that there are areas that Disney would be proud of, the detail that has gone into the Elephant area, is second to none.
One minute I‚Äôm like oooooh a baby elephant, the next I was like wow that‚Äôs the story of Buddha‚Äôs mother and the elephant dream.

Food outlets serve good quality food at a reasonable price 500ck for two people to have beef and dumplings and grilled cheese with drinks was the best priced meal we have had in Prague.

Czech,Soodavesi,Prague Zoo,4.0,"Easy to visit, we went there by tram and bus. Really large, spent there 4hrs and didn't managed to see it all. Worth a visit and the children enjoyed as well as we grown ups.",Sep 2019

Czech,Derezomov,Prague Zoo,4.0,"Very big zoo, probably larger than the others that we have visited, in Vienna and Budapest. The animals seem to blend in their natural habitat, but sometimes it is a bit difficult to see them for that precise reason. Maybe it was just us, as we visited the one in Vienna just 2 months before the one in Prague, but we had the feel that this one just isn't interactive at all, and the distance between you and the animals is considerable. Expect much more ""close encounters"" in Budapest and especially Vienna. Overall, this is still an awesome zoo, worth visiting. If only the restaurant staff spoke English and treated foreign visitors with more enthusiasm...",Aug 2019
Czech,diane g,Prague Zoo,5.0,Visited on a dull day but we had a fantastic time. The area was amazing and the animals looked very well cared for with lots of open space. The chair lift was a very nice touch as a means of accessing the upper level. There were lots of refreshment areas although it was a shame there was only the one with inside seating. The price of admission was unbelievably cheap when compared to other zoos around the world. We had a lovely day and even spending 5 hours there did not see everything so will have to go back next time,Sep 2019

The zoo is outstanding, spacious, nice, every small detail is well-designed (eg. in the Elephant Valley the buildings are designed like an indonesian vilage, the railings of the paths are made of bamboo, etc.). The selection of animals is interesting, the zoo infrastructure is very enjoyable.
Go and see yourself. Highly recommended.",Aug 2019

Czech,Allen‚Äôs Travels,Prague Zoo,5.0,Cheap entry and you get a lot for your money. The animals are well kept in large enclosures.

Czech,summertravelz,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Such a great zoo! My partner and I both work in a zoo in the UK and we were able to get into the zoo for free using our employee passes. We were so pleasantly surprised by the zoo, it‚Äôs huge! There are lots of animals to be seen over a huge area. We bought a map at the start for 5czk which I didn‚Äôt mind paying as it deters people from just throwing them away as they‚Äôve had to pay for them! The map was useful as the zoo is huge and there‚Äôs lots of different pathways to take. The toilets were very clean and seemed pretty new, they were all free as well which was great. We took our own food but there were lots of places to get drinks and food. My personal favourite animals were the hippos and the open vulture enclosure on the side of the rocks. It‚Äôs a great zoo with great views of Prague as well. Would really recommend visiting for the day, it took us a good 4 hours to walk around but we wish we‚Äôd had longer! If we could‚Äôve visited again on our trip we would‚Äôve done, it was so good. Only criticism is that there was not one big gift shop at the entrance but many little ones, so it would‚Äôve been nice to have had a big one at the end to look around but we still managed to get some nice souvenirs.

Overall great day out!

There were penguins, vultures, mountain goats, giraffes, but our highlight were the lions and tigers

Czech,Nick H,Prague Zoo,4.0,"Genuinely interesting and well kept and funded zoo with big enclosures and well kept animals. Lots of effort has been made to make this one of the best in the world.
Unfortunately a few of the animals looked like they had to the mental scars of previous poor captivity, but this was restricted to a couple of the Elephants and the polar bear. They all looked really healthy, just exhibited some repetitive behaviour.
All the cats were fabulous (especially the cheetahs) and overall a really good zoo.
Absolute bargain for 200 Cz Crowns. Must see.
Point to note. If you plan on walking here through the park there is a very small FOC ferry across the river (20m crossing max) which can add up to 20 mins to your walk. Get tram and bus here if u are pressed for time.

The area is huge and really pleasant to visit. You walk through a forest, and there are a lot of places to eat and drink.
There are A LOT of different animals to see such as elephants, lions, wolves, giraffes, otters, horses, crocodiles, snakes, polar bears, and more. They all seem to be well treated.

Czech,Jyrki,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Visited the Zoo during our autumn break in Prague and we were very pleased with our visit. It is easily accessed with city mass transportation, even though we had to make two metro trips and one bus trip to get there.

The Zoo is large. I mean, seriously big. Which is good, because it means there is plenty of room for animals and I especially liked the large open area for giraffes, zebras and like. But, be prepared for long walks. Bring a water bottle and some snack, if you're not planning to get some from restaurants or small kiosks. Plenty of photographing too, so it might be nice to bring a spare battery for your camera.

The Zoo is amazing in warm, sunny day. Luckily for us, it was a very nice day during our visit. Of course, some animals were hiding or sleeping in shadows, but majority of them seemed to enjoy themselves in autumn sun. I really enjoyed taking photos of a tiger who went for a bath and drinking at the same time. Big cats were taking it easy though.

Nice place. Even nicer for kids and whole families. Any Zoo in any city is well worth a visit.

Like many zoos, some of the smaller animals appeared to have larger enclosures than the bigger animals which I've never understood and in some of the pens, the animals were pacing along the sides of the enclosure. Having said that, there is a lot of work going on and I'd suggest that the zoo does care highly about the animals in its care and is trying hard to ensure that each is well looked after.",Aug 2019

Sure it has some of the same animals you find anywhere, but...there are some cools ones also. 2 polar bears!! Red Panda!! A leopard that you only find here and one other zoo in the entire world!! It does get a bit hilly, so bring you tennis shoes. And for the people that couldn't find animals in their enclosures, here is a hint. Due to changing weather, hot summer, very cold winters, almost every animal has an indoor and outdoor area they get to chose from, so you have to look in both places. We were there on the hottest day of the month and many were inside in the air condition. Also there is a bus from the city that takes you right to the front gates of the zoo, so convenient.

It covers a large area to the north of the city and is very hilly, so can be difficult for wheelchairs/pushchairs, but the enclosures are generally well thought out and spacious. New enclosures are being built in several areas, including one for the polar bears (which I was glad to see as they do need a lot more space). Staff were on hand at some enclosures, however they seemed to be more concerned with playing on their phones than interacting with visitors which we found unprofessional. That was the only bad aspect though. Worth visiting.

A lot of enclosures was so over grown you couldn‚Äôt see the animals, and it just wasn‚Äôt well kept at all, I felt sorry for the animals. I would of much rather paid more to have the animals looked after properly and there enclosures clean and not so cluttered.

Czech,FiftyFifty5050,Prague Zoo,5.0,"To be honest, a zoo wouldn't normally be at the top of our list of things to do whilst on holiday, but we were in Prague for a few days in July with blazingly hot weather and crowds and crowds of tourists, so we planned a day at the zoo for a bit of shade and space.

The zoo is situated on a wooded hill site, a little out of the city - take the metro Line C to Nadra≈æi Hole≈°ovice (there is picture of zoo animals beside the station name on all the depictions of the line) and, once there, go out of the station and follow the signs for the zoo bus (No.112). If you buy a daily (or longer) travel pass, the your ticket will cover both the metro and the bus.

The zoo is great value for money - an adult ticket costing around ¬£7.50 - and there is plenty to see and do for a day.

There are plenty of food outlets on site and locals were using them in droves. Food on offer ranged from simple baguettes to a full sit-down restaurant and, as far as we could tell, prices were on a par with what you might expect to find in the city. The zoo also provided plenty of seating and picnic areas for visitors bringing their own refreshments.

There is a lot to see here and quite a bit of walking involved, if you find yourself at the bottom of the site, there is a chair lift which you can take back up to the top level for about ¬£1.

We thought the areas were generous in size and well laid out - the elephants particularly seemed to have plenty of room. The only enclosure we felt a little uncomfortable about was that of the polar bears, with one of the bears swimming to and fro in a regular pattern, but we noticed from the free guide and signage that they are currently constructing a new one.

Most of the signs had a portion of them translated into English, certainly sufficient to give you relevant information.

There are lots of trees and foliage in place, which gives cool and shady paths and a release from the heat in summer; also lots of activities for children and families along the way.

Of course, many of the animals had retreated into the shade because of the heat, but the surroundings, atmosphere and those animals that were to be seen, more than made up for it.

A thoroughly enjoyable day, which we would recommend.

Czech,Diana1va,Prague Zoo,4.0,"We took a train and a bus to get here, quite simple as the bus stop has the name of the Zoo, so can't miss it. They accept student cards for a discount. Even without the discount I think it's cheap.
We got to the zoo quite early and it was an amazing experience. The whole place is huge and has an extremely wide variety of animals that you can see. There is a lift type swings that takes you up from the bottom all the way to the top, so you get to see the view of the majority of the zoo and Prague.
There are too many to count but my favourite were the cutest red pandas, swimming polar bears, flamingos and elephants.
You'll see how well the animals are looked after and how the right environment is created specifically for each and every animal. The mountain goats had an insane high mountain to climb on.
I personally don't particularly enjoy zoos but I was surprisingly ok with this one. Still felt bad for the polar bear and the wolves. Since they really can't be in a closed of field all their lives.
Some animals are roaming free, I believe the peacocks and few other animals were just walking around.

If you get hungry you have a few cafe options to choose from. The prices were not cheap.
If you want to see everything, suggest going from the morning.

Czech,Sindre,Prague Zoo,4.0,"It's a nice park with alot of animals. It's worth a visit for the cheap price. However I wish the park itself was built in a bit more exciting way, as it can get tedious to walk around for hours. And I think some of the animals have too small cages, but I suppose that is to be expected when going to a zoo.",Aug 2019
Czech,Adamb1110,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Visited the zoo on a sunny Sunday so unsurprisingly was quite busy but it's such a big place that people are spread out well!

So many exhibits and enclosures to see you can quite easily spend the day here. The enclosures are among some of the best I've seen and there is a really wide variety of animals across the park. There are plenty of opportunities to watch feeding and talks on animals but these got a bit too crowded for me on a busy day so I gave them a miss.

There are food/drink outlets dotted about across the zoo so you won't walk far without the opportunity for some refreshments.

The one thing I would make people aware of is that the zoo is based over a vast area which is also very 'hilly', for me as a keen walker it was absolutely fine but for some it might be a struggle to reach certain areas.

Easy bus service from metro takes about ten minutes to get you there, if you don't already have a travel ticket then you must get one before boarding the bus and validate at the machines on board.

The other great thing about this zoo is the cost, 200 crowns (about ¬£7) for the adult entrance fee.....bargain :-)

Czech,JOHN_TAIN,Prague Zoo,5.0,"Visited here and wasn't disappointed. A huge zoo with a lot of uphill climbs, so if your unfit like me it will certainly get the blood pumping. The zoo is huge with about every animal you can think off. I can see why its number 5 in the world.

Very good value for money !",Aug 2019
Czech,Mahnoor Ahmed,Prague Zoo,3.0,"As a big animal lover, I am 100% against zoos and would never visit one. I had read the excellent reviews on Prague Zoo and decided to try this as they focus on animal care/rehabilitation and are big in helping endangered species. Although seeing all the animals was lovely, I would not go back as the enclosures did not fully mimic their natural habitats. However, that is to be expected as it‚Äôs hard to promote a zoo and promise a strong resemblance of natural habitats together. The elephant and giraffe enclosures were excellent and I was very happy at how much space they had. However, seeing the gorillas, orangutans, and polar bears made me upset. It was a pathetic attempt to replicate their natural way of living as they are very intelligent and sensitive creatures and definitely did not have a lot of room from what I could see.This is my personal opinion and experience and in no way am I classing Prague zoo as cruel as I never saw anything behind the scenes.

I did very much enjoy the chair lift.

I would not go back but it is a nice day out for families who enjoy the zoo due to its massive size. It takes 4-5 hours to get through everything.

Czech,Katerina P,Prague Zoo,5.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for something to do with toddlers and the weather is nice, then I‚Äôd recommend to go to the Prague Zoo.

There are three ways to get there, by bus - runs quite often but is packed, or there are two car parks available nearby but you have to get there as early as possible. Or you can actually get there by boat from the city centre on the river Vltava and they will drop you off 10 minute walk from the main entrance.

Entrance fees are reasonable and snacks or souvenirs won‚Äôt ruin your bank account. You can take your own food or there are places to eat, take away food or restaurant.

The Zoo itself is quite big, but it is a nice walk either with a pram or the little ones can just wander around.

Years ago the whole zoo ended up quite badly flooded, so the lower part of the zoo is all relatively new.

It‚Äôs a fun place to go as a couple, with a family or friends.

Czech,BillyBNYC,Prague Zoo,5.0,"If you have some extra time in Prague, the weather is pleasant, you like zoos and have no physical limitations this a great side trip for a half day or more.

The zoo is right outside the Center City area. It is quite large and has a fairly extensive collection. It is considered among the best zoos in the world. Animals are generally presented in their natural habitats both indoors and outside. The exhibits are connected through winding wooded paths. But, because the zoo is built on the side of a hill, walking on these paths can be strenuous at times and might present a problem for someone with a physical limitation.

I do not recall the exact admission price, but I do recall that if you are 70 or older and present your passport as proof, admission was extremely cheap.

Czech,Peter,Prague Zoo,2.0,"I do not understand where is the excitement about Prague ZOO coming from. Yes, Prague ZOO has developed a couple of new projects recently and some animals are living in huge spacious enclosures, on the other side, within the last couple of years number of animal species exhibited is going down constantly and they probably are only interested in attracting visitors, animals come second. There are many children playgrounds, many eating places (you do not visit ZOO for gourmet food, do you?:-) and you can even bring your dog to the ZOO and nobody really takes take if it runs around the park freely. So if you are looking for a family day out among lots of other visitors, it¬¥s probably is a perfect place. If you just want to enjoy animal exhibits, there are better places to go.

Czech,Miss B,Prague Zoo,4.0,"We had a great day at Prague Zoo, there are lots of different animals to see and they look well cared for. It's great that the enclosures have plenty of trees, bushes, etc, so the animals have privacy if they want it. The grounds are immaculate, spacious and well laid out.
I have knocked off one star due to the rude member of staff working on the cable cars. The contactless card machine charged me but didn't print my tickets for the cable cars (I assume the paper had run out) so I explained this to the man who was so unhelpful, rolled his eyes at me, refused to help me and ended it by muttering something aggressively at me before turning and walking away.

P.S. Free park sounds better than ‚Äú‚Äùzoo‚Äù‚Äù.",Jul 2019
Czech,Simon M.,Prague Zoo,4.0,"The zoo offered a great variety of many different animals. But most of the information boards for the animals in the enclosures, while beautifully designed, were Czech only. Some had an English translation and only few offered a German or Russian one. Warning signs were in general multilingual. Another great thing is the general maintenance level of the zoo which is taken very seriously. During our visit we saw multiple staff members ensuring that the park was clean, that nothing was vandalised and that photography rules, like none at all or no flash, were followed by the guests.

Due to the zoos location on a hill, you should be prepared to walk a lot. And if you walk a lot you'll become hungry. Sadly the restaurants do not seem to be a valid solution to end your hunger. There are already other reviews concerning the Gaston, we went to the Gulab. An English menu was only visible while we were already standing in the queue in the form of a plastic encased pamphlet, while a Czech menu was highly visible above the paying area. I am sure that one of the best zoos of Europe could at least squeeze an English one there as well. The food itself will fill you up, but that's about it. This is why I recommend that you pack your own food. It will be cheaper, taste better and there are enough benches and trash cans so you can eat there and dispose of the leftovers.

Overall, I can recommend the zoo. It is also constantly improving. At the current day of the review they were building a new polar bear area as well as a new Australian area.

Czech,GrittSmitt,Prague Zoo,5.0,"A very beautiful zoo, placed outside of Prague Central. This means that it's a zoo built into nature, instead of nature built into a zoo in the city - this you could definitely feel.
It's a very open and large park with a lot of space to walk around.
The most special about the place is how close you can get to the animals. I was surprised by how close you felt to them and how clearly you could see them.

Unfortunately, due to the extreme heat, we didn't get to see any of the large cats (lions, jaguars, tigers, etc.), but that is not the park's fault. I would recommend coming here when it's not full sun and heat.

Semi-quality restaurants and cafes, but nothing that's not to be expected.

Great place for kids and adults alike. And the grand selection of animals is just impressive. A solid place to go if visiting Prague.

Czech,Josie B,Prague Zoo,5.0,"A very lovely day out, well worth the 200 crounds, about ¬£8. The zoo was clean and tidy. Plenty of toilets and places to get drinks and food. Food and drinks are reasonably priced and the milkshakes are good. Lots of vending mashines around to get water from, but some don't work.

The animals were happy and well looked after and the enclosures made you feel like you were in with the animals. Some you can go in and the animals and birds are in with you.

The only think I would say is there seems to be no logical way to walk around the park. You will have to at some point go back on yourself. It is very hilly and they are quite steep, you can get a cable car to the top and walk down but would have to walk up the other side to see what you have missed. It's a basically circus with in a circle.

Definitely worth it though.

Me and my partner spent 4 hours exploring the GIGANTIC zoo! All of the enclosures are just amazing quality for the animals and there is SO MUCH to go see and do. I especially loved going up the chairlift into the second part of the zoo and it's really cheap for the experience you get! Entry is only 200 Koruna (¬£7 or 150 Koruna (about ¬£5) for students) and it is completely and totally worth it! If you have a travel card, it's really easy to access and if you jump on the 122 bus, it goes straight to the main entrance. I would easily go again and recommend that this place is a MUST when visiting Prague :)

Pro tip: At the end of the day, if you want a seat on the bus back and want to avoid being trampled as you get on it, head over to the North Exit (by the Hippo enclosure) as it's mega quiet and the bus heads there before the main exit which gets very crowded and manic.

Specially the staff at the information desk. You also have restaurants at various corners if some decides to have a meal. Except for the restaurants you have vending machines and also snacks shacks where you can pick up some food. At the end its really beautiful and well kept zoo. You can also if you want to adopt animals for a year.,Jun 2019
Czech,DG.,Prague Zoo,4.0,"One of the things my girlfriend was most excited about when visiting Prague, was Prague zoo. We have visited many zoos throughout Europe, and seen a variety of standards! This one promised to be one of the best.

I think the first thing worth noting about our visit, was that we went in January - when it was cold! Very cold! So perhaps it wouldn't be fair to judge this against a trip in the summer sun! For example, there must have been less than 300 people in the Zoo total when we visited! (BTW this was not a problem at all, who doesn't want a private zoo!?).
That said, the standard of the enclosures, and the attitude of the staff, was as good as I would expect them to be in the height of tourist season. Some of the enclosures stood out as some of the best we have seen, others were fairly reasonable. There were certainly no BAD enclosures, and even the polar bears appeared to be interacting with their surroundings with little disturbance (unlike other polar bears we have seen!) Good points scored there.

We were disappointed not to see all of the animals there, but were relieved to hear that on the most part, this was because their enclosures were being improved, though we didn't really see much work being carried out - too cold perhaps?

Overall Prague zoo was pretty good. Was it much better than other zoos we have been to? Maybe, maybe not. I'll have to visit again in the summer to decide! :P

Czech,Kirstie G,Prague Zoo,1.0,"I was so excited to go and see Prague zoo after having read about it online. When I got there though I was very disappointed. For a start we were not given a map to follow so blindly had to find our way around the zoo. If you have any sort of mobility problems it‚Äôs probably not the place for you as the hills are ridiculous! The animals in the petting zoo area were running riot and had fur that was so matted, they didn‚Äôt look like they were being cared for properly. My real issue though was with the elephant enclosure, there was a lone elephant who I‚Äôm assuming was the bull elephant who was kept apart from the rest of the group, which I get is practice until they are in musk. However the area the poor elephant was kept in was disgraceful, there was no enrichment for them what so ever and the area itself was tiny! The poor elephant was pacing back and forwards constantly, I‚Äôm not surprised as that enclosure would be enough to make anyone lose their mind!

Czech,Withnail_19,Prague Zoo,2.0,"I read reviews on Trip Advisor and other online sources which rated Prague Zoo as the 5th or 7th best. On the basis of what I have seen today there must be some really shocking Zoos out there if this is near the top of the pile.
When my daughter (7 years old) went the Zoo was having renovations/improvements meaning that several of the attractions were closed. As we arrived there was a bill board advertising a giant spider in one of the attractions-my daughter really wanted to see it but when we got to the area where it should be it was not on display (the display where the spider was supposed to be even had a big spider as part of the sign but inside there must have been 20-30 species on display with one spider in a tiny tank.
The staff seem uninterested, at one of the food outlets two women sat talking whilst I waited staring into the abyss at an empty counter.
The restaurant as you enter was closed but then opened as the zoo closed as a band was on murdering Beatles songs.
What capped the day off was my daughter saying to me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that‚Äù and I turned to see what must have been one of the exhibits (possibly a red panda-it was the right size and shape) roaming free on one of the footpaths before it disappeared into the undergrowth.
The animals looked well cared for and the enclosures were well maintained, it just appeared to be operated in a shambolic fashion. Avoid.

Plan the visit for at least a half of a day.. but you can easily spend a whole day there :) This time we enjoyed a special experience: feeding giraffes (it has to be booked and paid online in advance). It was amazing! There is a small platform above the enclosure with giraffes, you meet a guide there and he/she takes you to the platform, gives you short presentation about the giraffes, answers your questions and provides you treats you can feed the giraffes. The giraffe eats the treats right from your hand, its dark long tongue licks your whole hand and you can look straight into its eyes. Just awesome. There are only like three giraffes brave enough to come close and since they are not forced to come you have to be careful and patient. There is only a group of maximum eight people at the platform and it happens just once a day so usually this experience is sold out. Also it's really cheap so check the availability in ZOO's eshop before your visit and don't hesitate to buy it if you are lucky enough and it's still possible to book it :)

The rest of the zoo also is just soooooo cool. You can see all the animals here in such close proximities and they are also given good space. You name the animal and you will find it here. All the big cats, aquatics, all types of herbivores are present here.
The nature of the zoo was also very pleasant!
The only problem with this zoo is you cannot cover it in a day. You probably need a day and a half.",Nov 2018
Czech,Dmitriy S,Prague Zoo,5.0,"One of the most exiting places in Praha! It is more the park itself, than about animals. Vast territory with different relaxing zones, small cosy cafes. Long picturesque footpaths will lead you either to beatifull garderns or to quiet lakes. Special impression gives one of the best observation decks in Praha! From the top of the rock you can observe Vltava, Prazsky Hrad and the whole city lays in full view! Goose-bumping
All the animals and birds seemed clean, healthy and well fed. Houses and cabins are in order and warm. I hope this place serves as a good home for all the habitants and has its only aim to show all the people how beatiful our nature is in fact! And how importaint to protect Nature from big Cities!

Czech,Joanna R,Prague Zoo,5.0,"After googling the zoo and it coming up as No.5 zoo in the world on trip advisor I thought well it could be a fun trip out on a wet day.

I was not disappointed- I feel this zoo does not get enough credit- it‚Äôs barely even mentioned in my tour book. Perhaps this is a good thing as the entry price is still very cheap as zoos go and it was a world away from the hundreds of people on walking tours.

All the animals have ample space, particularly the elephants. I was also not expecting to see polar bears (so at first I was a little hesitant) however after experiencing one swimming on its back with I‚Äôm sure what was a smile on its face I was overjoyed.

Add to this a beautiful hilly landscape, gorgeous flowers and plenty of restaurants and inside enclosures to escape the rain this place is a must visit- I‚Äôm so glad I made the trip out there on my final day.

However, it clearly became apparent that many of the enclosures at the zoo were much too small with many of the animals (Polar Bears, Elephants) showing signs of stress. This including pacing of enclosures and an elephant, separated from its herds, which would not stop swaying its head from side to side (A well-known and very serious sign of distress). Not a zoo to visit if you are an animal lover!!!",Apr 2019

The zoo is well planned out so that you can see all the animals without having to go back and forth, the map is good and very cheap.

We stayed for lunch at the zoo in Gaston, which was pleasant food. Slightly expensive but to be expected. Portion sizes where huge which made it worth it.

There is an amazing little ski lift in the zoo that takes you from the bottom to the top of the hill. (Individual seats) worth a trip up.

Not too busy when we visited (early May 2019) with a few school coaches arriving at opening but the space absorbed 3500 visitors that day without problems. It was early season and not all the food outlets were open but we enjoyed the variety of coffee on offer and really filled-up on the traditional fare in Goƒç√°r‚Äôs House Inn - generous portions.

Located on the bank of a large hillside, the animals contained within are far from caged. Call it the Hilton of Zoo;s if you will.

With easy access via bus we headed out for the day ( children in tow) and was totally blown away by the variety of wildlife. The space is large so go prepared. There's a cable car to give you the birds eye view and of course, for those who prefer the calmer life of a golf cart, they are too for hire making the distance between attractions a breeze.

definitely not to be missed, especially for those who previously disliked zoo's. This one gets a thumbs up in my book.

Czech,Bluexandee,Prague Zoo,3.0,"The worse thing was the stressed polar bear. The zoo was opened in 1931 with the goal to ""advance the study of zoology, protect wildlife, and educate the public.‚Äù But not for the polar bear it seems. The enclosure housed 3 bears and looked far too small for 3 but one was just pacing around. A study from March 2017 shows: ‚ÄúA study that quantitatively assesses polar bear pacing finds that it indicates the animals are disconnected from their captive environment. Among the various stereotypic behaviours that captive animals show, pacing is one of the most common. Among animals housed in zoos, pacing is widely reported.‚Äù Please do something for the bears sake. I will say that many enclosures have low fences and even where there is glass protection they can be photographed well. Some enclosures seemed massive. However the hippos & the seals enclosures were shut. Many of the exhibits appeared to be empty.

Entrance to the zoo cost 200 CZK (under ¬£7 per adult) and children under 3 go free. It‚Äôs an absolute bargain.

The zoo is enormous and it took us all day to get around and see all of the animals and explore the play areas and splash zone etc.

The food, drinks and souviners are all very reasonably priced so no need to worry about it costing a fortune once you get inside.

One of the best days we had in Prague and would highly recommend a visit to anybody!

Czech,LucyKernow,Prague Zoo,1.0,"I was utterly heartbroken to see so many animals here with little room to experience any kind of natural life. A large number of the animals such as the polar bears, and the tigers were exhibiting rocking and pacing repetitive behaviour which is a sign of emotional stress. One elephant was clearly showing signs of being really mentally unwell. There was no stimulation for alot of the animals and no sign of interaction with keepers, or information on how they were dealing with the emotional welfare of the animals.

The zoo covers a large area with some steep hills. The chair lift wasn't in use when we visited probably due to the high winds. Good views of Prague could be seen whilst walking around the zoo. Toilets were clean. There were a large variety of animals however some we noticed were pacing back and forth in their cages which was worrying. Entry prices were good. They have an offer on Mondays for seniors, students, children however you must bring a form of identification.

Czech,Pash68,Prague Zoo,3.0,"Having read some rather good reviews we were looking forward to visiting this zoo. I don't entirely agree with zoos but I do understand why they exist and some are way better than others. Prague Zoo is easily accessible by public transport and the entrance fee is very reasonable. Parts of the zoo are wonderful - the smaller animals are certainly in suitable environments and appear happy enough. A number of the larger breeds, including the big cats, are not so lucky - or happy. I saw a lot of pacing - the big cats seemed stressed and were pacing continuously in their enclosures. The gorillas were downright unhappy - sitting in their indoor enclosure with nothing to do except be stared at and a photographed. Most of the animals have both indoor and outdoor areas, however both of these are designed for public viewing and the animals have nowhere to hide or be alone. I understand that one of the purposes of a zoo is for people to be able to see endangered, rare or unusual animals and therefore the zoo obviously wants people to actually be able to see the animals and not for them to be hiding all day.....but some of them looked so bored and so sad I did question whether it was 'right'. The overall area of the zoo is huge and certainly some animals did have a lot of space to roam but the sight of the big cats constantly pacing the perimeter of their enclosures and the obviously unhappy/depressed/bored larger monkeys/apes was heartbreaking. Also the polar bear enclosure was in no way large enough to accommodate 3 polar bears. I am surprised that this zoo ranks so highly in terms of world zoos and I was far more impressed with Berlin Zoo than this one.

The variety of animals is amazing and most of the facilities are made so that you can get as close to them as possible without being in danger and admire their beauty. It is also nice to see appropriate facility sizes for animals that need more space.
The only inconvenience is that a lot of info boards are written only in Czech but I hope they'll work on that in the future.

What a stunning zoo, we read that the lift wasn‚Äôt running in the winter so decided to start by walking up the hill first.
Animals all looked happy in good spaces, highlights for me where the giraffes. Been to many zoo‚Äôs around the world and this I would say is one of the best.

The zoo is on a hill so be prepared to do some uphill (and downhill) walking. My boyfriend was extremely exited about seeing the honey badger at the zoo, as there are only a few zoo's in the world that have them due to them being extreme escape artists. Unfortunately due to it being so cold the honey badger was inside and aside so we couldn't see him in great detail. But the rest of zoo was amazing. The enclosure were safe but enabled you to get up close with the animals and really see them in details. I've added some photos to show you. I love Giraffe's and loved their enclosure.

The zoo looked like it was undergoing some refurbishment and some areas were nicer than others. All the animals seemed well cared for though. It was a real treat to be so close to some animals that are rarely seen. Just glass separated them from us and standing eye to eye with a tiger was really quite something. The elephant enclosure looked quite large but they were all indoors at the time of our visit but there were plenty of pictures and information. Maps were available to buy from machines, which is probably wise, they are very cheap and help you find your way around.

Getting there was relatively simple using the trams and bus, and as it was winter there was no overcrowding. The zoo is large but well sign posted with multiple rest stops along the way.

The quality of the food in all of these stops was amazing and good value.

The enclosures are well maintained, spacious, and plenty of information about the animals and events are supplied. What is particularly good to see is that even in the cold of winter, when most of the right minded creature of this world hide indoors, due to the construction of the park, you can still see the animals.

A lovely day out.

The sections offer enough space to the animals and some are in surprisingly nice settings.
I reccommed for visit the ZOO not in summer weeends - might be a bit crowded.

Children will also appreciate riding a pony and similar fun. Parking a car is sometimes difficult, but coming by public transport - metro and bus- or tram and bus is quite easy.

The elephants are shut away without mental stimulation in boring featureless compounds with bare concrete floors. And the Feline house (big cats - lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) is the worst we have seen in years of travelling the world. Inside big cats are shut up in tiny featureless metal cages with absolutely nothing to do. The tigers pace backwards and forwards - a bad sign of mental anguish. Also too the large family of gorillas only has a small area - too small for the number there - and they obviously well bored. This zoo needs closing down. It is obviously incapable of looking after the wildlife it has.

Czech,Anna_Morgana,Prague Zoo,4.0,"Really big zoo not too far away from Prague and fully accessible using public transport. It wasn't awfully crowded when we went and we could stroll around and see the animals at our own pace, although we only managed to see it all because a part of it is closed for renovations and some of the animals were kept out for hibernation: it is truly big a park!!

What I liked:
- The fact that animals are kept i environments that mimic the temperatures and conditions of their natural habitats.
- The fact that some are left to fly around freely or in really big spaces to use comfortably.
- The fact that a variety of species cohabit in any one enclosure.
- The fact that enclosures have a number of differentiated spaces so animals can roam here and there without being stuck in one single place.
- The fact that you can adopt animals to help the zoo keep their outstanding work in taking care of them.
- The number of rare species, especially from South America, that live in the zoo and the fact that you can learn a lot about them, their behaviour and habitats, as well as when and why they are endangered.
- I was especially moved by the information panels about palm oil near the orangutan enclosure - educating visitors about the importance of nature and wildlife and our impact on them should always be one of the functions of zoological spaces nowadays.

What I didn't like much:
- The fact that government withheld funding has meant they had to close the hipo enclosure as the renovations can't happen in the current situation, which was very sad to learn!
- As with any zoo, I always feel like animals should have more space and less fences but, that said, there are indeed incredibly big enclosures such as that of the elephants or the wolves.

Worth visiting? Absolutely! And donating to also if you have the chance

Czech,woodielisa,Prague Zoo,5.0,"I took my 8 and 10 year old children here for the afternoon. We had a great time.

The place is MASSIVE and we covered only around 50% of it in 4 hours!!! After that we were tired out and it was closing time anyway. So we have plenty left to see next time.

We visited in winter so obviously none of the Animals from Warner climates were outside in their large and very well designed spaces. They were all mostly inside keeping warm. There are inside viewing areas within windows so you can still see them, although they are very docile and inactive when inside.
Some animals were 'missing' from their areas for some reason - no lions, no polar bears, no hippos..? That was a bit of a shame as they are some of the most exciting animals that we wanted to see, however there was plenty of other stuff to see.

Highlights for us were the seals - could have watched them all day - and the bat cave where the bats fly freely around your head!!! Sounds horrible but it wasn't - it was actually very exciting. Also the crocodile and turtle tank was fascinating.

It was disappointing that the chair lift was not running because half the zoo is on top of a very large hill and we had to walk up. After already walking lots around the lower level, instead of being able to get the chairlift to the upper level, instead we then had to walk all the way back to the entrance and then up the very large hill. This zapped the energy from the children and had it not been nearly closing time, I think we would have been unable to complete the last half of the zoo as a result.

The cafe had reasonably price nice hot food, soups, pasta, roast pork, goulash, etc... and the newest and cleanest toilets we have ever seen!!!

The amount on offer for the price was excellent value for money and there is a lot of work going on which looks like there will be even more to see in future.

All in all a fantastic zoo and easily a whole day out.

Alway check your time for returning and ensure that you do not exceed it. We did by error and were fined 800 Checz Crown each. Three people before us in line were charged the same as were three tourists behind us. All for differing reasons. They do not take any excuse or accept a minor discrepancy. If you refuse to pay, they will call the Police. If they are charging this over one half hour period, how much do they make in a day????

You can easily see Tigers, Lions, Cheetas, Ostriches, Kangaroos. There biggest attraction is Indian Elephants. As an Indian I felt proud of it. they also have a small temple of Lord Ganesha besides it with information. More than 100 species of birds including migrating birds reside in the zoo.

Inside the church, you are greeted with an ambience that radiates the 18th century. The decorated glass windows and wooden pews remind you of the early days of the church as seen in medieval movies.
The very high ceilings with hanging lights create an atmosphere of calm that radiates around the church.
It is very close to the city center so be sure to stop by even for just 5mins and immerse yourself in this very rich Moravian architectural masterpiece

Czech,Carol H,Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul,4.0,"The cathedral, with its soaring towers (275-ft-high) visible from afar, stands on what was, in the 11th and 12th centuries, the probable site of Brno's first castle. Originally Romanesque, the church acquired a Gothic appearance in the 1200s.

My spouse and I found the exterior just as exquisite as the interior. Of note inside is the elaborately decorated 36 ft-high main altar featuring both Saints Peter and Paul, along with the other disciples, which were carved by Viennese sculptor Josef Leimer; the remarkable jewel-toned stained glass windows; and the Kapistranka pulpit adorned with cherubs, which was named after the Franciscan friar St. John of Capistrano who preached in Brno in 1451.

The cathedral bells strike noon an hour early in remembrance of the city being saved from attack by the Swedes during the Thirty Year's War by this clever ploy.

It is usually called Petrov, the same as the hill it's located on. Its spires can be seen from many places in the old town of Brno, and the facade of the gothic building is imposing.
The church is a nice one, with beautiful stained glass windows behind the main altar.
On the side of the church there is the entrance to the bell tower and church museum.
The museum (located immediately after the boot where you pay the entrance fee) hosts the few remaining gold / silver pieces of the past, and they are very beautiful indeed.
If you continue the climb to the top of the tower, you have nice views of the old and new town of Brno, and you can pass direcly under the massive bells.

The entrance is very cheap for going up to the two towers. I highly recommend this to photographers not only because of the amazing view but also the light insight threw the windows. You might find some inspiration.
The little museum insight shows some religions gadgets which are like every where in churches. It is included in the ticket for the towers.
I recommend also to go up when the bells are ringing, even if it is very loud it is a fun experience and you can feel the power of the bells!

Situated at top of a hill overseeing Brno, this church originates from the 14th century and has been reconstructed/renovated many times over the years and through various wars and economic downturns.

The stain glass windows around the alter are amazing.

A must is to visit the treasury and tower. When you exit the church, you turn left and will find the entrance at the side of the church.

Entrance fee is 80 czh for family of 4 or 30 czh each. The climb to the top of the tower is not for the faint of heart, but once you get to the top you will be treated with an amazing view of Bruno. The views are incredible!!

5. As you go up the flights of stairs, exhibition boards will tell you how the church comes into its being, how the bells are to be used three times a day to indicate the prayer times, the shortening of the southern tower to make the two equally attractive, and so on.

6. And then the same boards appear again and again repeating themselves on the top decks. So that you‚Äôll not be excused to miss a single detail.

For best pictures of the whole cathedral you`ll have to go further and ideally walk up to the Spilberk castle park from where you can take the best pictures of both cathedral and old city towers.

There is a narrow and low corridor to a small terrace in one of the towers, looking to the central part of the city. The view is amazing. On the other side there is a small wooden door, leading to another terrace (a bit larger) facing the newer part of Brno. The view is not so attractive, despite we took some pictures.
It is a must see sight!

The ornamentation is from different periods (mostly Baroque with bulky little angels as in Rubens paintings).

40 Crowns to go up one of the over 80 meters high towers and a small museum with religious objects. The view is great, though do not expect a 360 degrees view as there are just two small viewpoints way under the top.

It has a funny story about the clock:
""Traditionally, the bells of the cathedral are rung at 11 o'clock in the morning instead of 12 noon. The reason for this, according to legend,[1] is that during the Thirty Years' War the invading Swedes had promised, when laying siege to Brno, that they would call off their attack if they had not succeeded in taking the city by midday on the 15th of August. The battle underway, some shrewd citizens decided to ring the bells an hour early on this date, fooling the Swedes into breaking off the siege and leaving empty-handed.""

The cathedral is really impressive. Not as grand as koln or Rome. But it has suffered more neglect due to war and communism.

I strongly suggest taking a tram there and walk down the old city from there. All will be down hill than. Easier to do.

You can enter inside to see the high ceilings or climb to the towers to have lovely view on Brno city and Spilberk castle that is situated really close the cathedral. The park - Denisovy sady are close to the cathedral you will have great view on railway station or Mendel square, in summer is really great to hang out with your friends there or enjoy the salsa open-air classes and during the night - you can just sit on a bench and let your thoughts to ramble somewhere and staring on the city of lights - Brno.

Czech,Amanda M,Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul,4.0,"The cathedral of St Peter and St Paul is a fairly easy 5 minute walk up from the cabbage market in central Brno and it's iconic twin spires can be seen from miles around. You can drive up to the cathedral if you are unable to walk it. It is a beautiful building inside and out and well worth a visit. You can also climb up into the twin spires for a small fee, and this was definitely worth doing, to see the fabulous views out over Brno and beyond. You might want to avoid doing this near the hour though as the bells ring out from inside the spires and they are right above your head and VERY loud. One interesting fact is that the 12 noon bells ring out at 11am, to mark a historical event whereby during the war with the Swedish, it was discovered that the Swedes has boasted that they would have taken control of Brno by noon the next day, so the commander in charge in Brno decided to trick the Swedes by ringing the Cathedral bells one hour early and it worked.. the Swedes lost their conviction and retreated. Brilliant!!

Unlike most, this church really felt like a centre of a religious community - even before I had walked around it and seen chalk writings showing that blessing of the adjacent buildings has been done in 2015. I actually do not remember having seen these K+M+B's much around in 21st century.
As I just had come from the Spilberk with its views, I did not go up the tower (so cannot comment on that) and the crypt was unfortunately closed. But even with all that I do not regret going up the hill and seeing this beauty.

A baroque architwekt from Bavaria, Melchior Grimm, has created the impression of an oval buildinf through darl altar niches. The church is sparsely decorated by non-desript cultural works. paintings would need restauration or et least cleaning. No historic pews nor an abundance of confessionals are in sight.

The approach to it is masked by other buildings so as you turn the corner it suddenly appears in all its majesty. The slim twin towers that soar above you were built in 1905. The cathedral itself has been added to since the 1300s. Once inside it is all you would expect of a Catholic church of the Austrian Empire-heavily ornate and baroque. Get their before 11 am to hear the bells chime to remember the calling off of the Swedish seige in the Wars of Religion.Traditionally, the bells of the cathedral are rung at 11 o'clock in the morning instead of 12 noon. According to legend the Swedes had promised that they would call off their attack if they had not succeeded in taking the city by midday on the 15th of August. The bells were rung an hour early on this date, fooling the Swedes into breaking off the siege. The Cathedral shop sells a selection of extremely charming crafted locally made terracotta religious plates of a unique design.

Even Brno has at least two other crypts. This was not a crypt. This was a tiny renovated room with a couple of pointless exhibits tossed in. We could literally see everything there was to see standing in one spot. We lingered a little while because we didn't want to embarrass the poor girl they have sitting there taking people's money.

Czech,kim buay p,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"I did a guided live-streamed tour of the Old Town with a guide from Prague City Adventures on Heygo. The tour lasted an hour. We started at the Municipal House which features a spectacular fa√ßade decorated with numerous statues and stuccos, as well as an enormous semi-circular mosaic on top of the main entrance. It is located next to the Powder Gate. The Municipal House is the most impressive Art Nouveau building in Prague and it houses the largest concert hall in Prague.
The Powder Tower, also known as Powder Gate, is a dark Gothic tower which serves as a gateway to the Medieval Royal Route, and is currently one of the most iconic buildings of Prague. This tower was built in 1475 and during the seventeenth century, the tower was used to store gunpowder, hence its name.
We walked down Celetna Road.
We also saw an example of Czech cubist architecture in the Grand Caf√© Orient which is inside the House of the Black Madonna. We also looked at the display of cakes in the window. Some cakes are in the form of coronavirus while there is also one looking like a bottle of vaccine. When we reached the Old Town Square,
the guide was so lovely to give us the best postcard shots of the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Its construction began in 1350, and it was finished in 1511. Nowadays, it is one of the most impressive Gothic buildings in Prague with its eighty-meter high spires. We also saw the Kinsky Palace, a pink-and-white Rococo manor in the middle of Old Town Square.
Our tour includes the viewing of the iconic astronomical clock found on the South wall of the Prague Town Hall. The Calendar Dial represents the months of the year. The Dial also has medallions with all the zodiac signs and the Prague Old Town symbol in the centre. It also has four small sculptures that don‚Äôt move: a Philosopher, an Angel, an Astronomer and a Chronicler. The Astronomical Dial represents the Universe. The dial includes a Zodiacal ring that shows the location of the Sun and the two clock hands are designed with a Sun and a Moon each. The show on the hour was a short one and our guide gave us a good view of it.

Czech,Wenovo,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"The Square was beautifully lit at night , when we walked out of a dinner in a restaurant U Modre Kachnicky nearby. It has been a long time that we were passing through at night.

Still crowded , but less so then during the day, it was more enjoyable to walk around.

There was an Ice cream vendor, prominently displaying his merchandise. I only wanted one scoop of ice cream on the cone.
Even though I speak Czech, the man was pretending not to understand. He insisted that I have to buy ice cream by weight, but would not tell me how much .
Very funny, because he thought I was going to get little bit of ice cream for some exorbitant price.
Not a lick of ice cream, just a bad taste in my mouth....and I was prepared to pay steep price, but only knowing it upfront ....
Ice cream by weight ? Its a good thing they are not selling beer by weight - yet :)

I have visited several cities where there is no real city center, but this is not the case for Prague, where old Town Square gathers a melting pot of people, both locals and foreigners. Whenever we are in town there is always something going on here, either a Christmas market with its nice Christmas tree in December, or wannabe musicians and tourists during the summer.
There are several attractions both on the square and in its proximity, hence if you visit Prague you must visit this square and the other city's iconic landmarks.

Czech,rdrozd7,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"There are always plenty of tourists blending with the locals, so it is usually funny to ask for directions ( like at Times Square trying to find the New Yorker ).
Every structure around has some historical significance, so it is a good idea to do some Google before. That makes You feel like the local (almost).
Never mind the crowd- it never disappears!
Take Your time to study architecture, make plenty of pictures, keep Your wallet protected if someone tries to create distractions.
After circling the Square, leaving Saint Nicholas Cathedral (Hussite church, entrance free, nice classical concerts in the evenings), You might want to exchange currency (cash only), with the best rates ($100=CK 2230) at 2 Franz Kafka N√°mƒõsti ( to R leaving St.Nicholas Cathedral-100 yards/meters).
Still some Christmas decorations are present and the market as well. Enjoy.

Czech,Sparrow1305,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"This square is eye catching in its own right but at Christmas time in December it is purely magical.
The huge stunning Tree is amazing, with the lights coordinated to the music. The Choirs on stage, most especially the children, singing hymns and songs just add to the Christmas feel.
They really do make an immense effort with the lighting and the stalls selling their wares. I defy anyone not to feel in the spirit of Christmas when here!
Of course, there is inevitably a great number of people here and you can get bumped into quite often but it's par for the course..
I highly recommend this in December, and if you do visit the Christmas Market here be sure to try the Chimney cakes (Trdeln√≠k)

As you'll see in the reviews, people recommend against this. However, for us, since it was only one time, we really did not mind the over-priced food, or the feeling of hustle and bustle as the clock chimed, because the whole scene was so magical and we felt incredibly fortunate to be able to sit and enjoy it. Yes, the food was indifferent, and the service, after they have hooked you in, pretty indifferent, but you're paying for the view and the experience, and we really didn't mind. Our kids had ice-creams and so they were happy, and we felt like we were in paradise. We also took one of the horse-drawn carriages that depart from the square. This was expensive and not really that much fun, it's a bit bumpy and you don't see much more than you would as you walk.

An ever changing cast of musicians, dance troupes, punks and vendors make the square as colorful as the buildings that surround it.

Try to visit in the early morning to see the sunrise throught the buildings and at night when the buildings comes alive at night.

Stalls sell traditional snacks and there is a programme of concerts given by local schools. If you visit at other times of the year, you get more of a sense of what a fabulous square this is.

Czech,Sr.Seguro,Staromestske namesti,4.0,"We had opportunities to visit Prague in every season and therefore, to compare this place's outlooks through various periods.
Definitely, it's more beautiful and not very overcrowded in late spring when the weather is blooming and mass-tourists still wait for the summer :).
In winter, especially on the eve of the very Christmas and NY, the lack of snow doesn't permit to feel entirely festive despite all markets evolved and NY trees set.
Besides, as in summer within this vacation period there are too many guests per each square meter and you feel rather packed... tightly :).
That's why in a fortnight we'll be mainly in Karlovy Vary in course of our sixth visit to the Czech Republic and look in Prague just for two days.

And, yes, it's absolutely necessary to find some time to admire that restored piece of art measuring centuries :).
If you want to oversee patiently how noisily lives the square and at the same time to bite a little bit visit that restaurant on the roof from where you could see everything beneath accompanying that with good but rather pricey dishes :).

Czech,Brenda Cantillano,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"This is a beautiful old square, with very typical architecture and overall is most attractive in the day and also i luminated at night ,has two lovely old churches, one where Mozart played and there are regular evening classical concerts here, and of course the world famous clock and clock tower which if you climb to the top has spectacular views and is an exellent spot to get the best photos of Prague over the rooftops. There are some very good restaurants and little sovenier shop also, we were there when it was decorated for Easter with lovely trees full of eggs and flowers and lots of stalls with food and local products on sale, handcafts etc, a lovely time to visit, they also have a very nice Christmas Market which we plan to visit soon, Prague is always a good choice anytime of the year.

Czech,philcarey2018,Staromestske namesti,4.0,"They say that all roads lead to Rome - in Prague, all roads lead to Starometske Namesti - the Old Town Square. One of the challenges lies in actually getting to the Square, especially if you follow the human tidal wave that washes over from Charles Bridge! But if yo visit Prague, this is one of the ""must see"" places.
The Square is bounded on all sides by the beautiful architecture of the Old City - tall gabled buildings, beautifully preserved and maintained. At the western end of the Square is the famous astronomical clock, where the footways seem to be permanently blocked by the crowds of tourists waiting for the clock to chime the hour.
To add to the fun, the Square is often filled with booths and tents, even a stage, when particular events are being celebrated, so it's not the place to be if you don't like crowds.
To really appreciate the Square in all its glory, you might find it best to visit early in the morning, when you are also likely to find a good seat in one of the surrounding coffee shops after your tour, from where you can watch the descending hordes from a place of comfort!

Czech,Parviz M,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"We started our Prague city walk with the Prague Old Town Square since our hotel was located with walking distance. Wow, what a fascinating place it was, just like in fairy tales! Gorgeous streets with old and original street tiles/stones, amazing buildings all around, the fantastic Astronomical Clock, tall and historical Gothic Powder Tower, the wonderful Church of Our Lady Before Tyn, Charles Bridge, lots of beautiful and interesting shops and many great restaurants. And of course, with huge crowds. This was late September and we still saw many huge crowds in Prague Old Town Square and in all other city attractions. This was the busiest place of all places we visited during our vacation including Budapest, Salzburg and Vienna. It is not easy to describe this wonderful place because we were astonished everywhere we looked and walked. The whole place is just lovely. We went there multiple times and we still could not get enough of this charming and interesting place. We also went to Old Town Square during evening since the clock, the buildings, and Charles Bridge are so pretty when lit. Our first day walk took about 3 hours and we all really enjoyed it. Would highly recommend a visit of Prague Old Town Square and spending a few hours walking over this amazingly beautiful, historical, and fascinating place. Do not miss it!

It's pedestrian-friendly. with small winding streets, old building, shops, and beer halls and cafes. In the center sits the charming Old Town Square. The square's centerpiece is the memorial to Jan Hus. Across the square stands the rower of the Old Town Hall with the ludicrously complex Astronomical Clock, with uses revolving discs, celestial symbols, and sweeping hands to keep several versions of time.

Staromestske namesti (Old Town Square) has been a market square since the 11th century. Today, the old-time market stalls have been replaced by outdoor cafes and tackiest breed of souvenir stands. The Old Town square packed all the day and night time, and never really quiet. A huge bottleneck occurs in front of the Astronomical Clock near the top of each hour, but as soon as the show's over, the tourists disperse quickly. Farther to the right is the towering, Gothic Tyn Church with its fanciful twin spires. It's been the Old Town's leading church in every era.

Instead of preserving its historical value and significance for the whole country, currently, the square is a bustle of hordes of tourists and groups, street performers, frozen statues, so this place loses its appeal and charm.

Czech,TheHonestRater,Staromestske namesti,2.0,"Prague is without a doubt one of Europes most iconic and beautiful capitals. But despite the tremendous amount of historic content and architecture, the casual Czech service staff (due to our stay in an Airbnb I do not rate the Hotel staff) is worse than imaginable. In 4 days we visited around 8 restaurants and bars of which at least 5 are considerably upper class establishments. Besides the food being mostly okayish the staff was mainly unfriendly and slow. But the most interesting thing is about local tipping habits. We learned by our city-guide, that generally speaking Czechs do not tip (like in many other European countries), but Czech service experienced so many US American tourists, that it grew to becoming habit, at least serving foreigners. While paying we were directly asked for at least 10%, whether we liked the provided service or not. I am aware, that this sounds crucially snobbish, I mean why should I as a guest deny tipping a hard working waiter/waitress? The part about it, that irritates me is the impertinence that goes along with staff demanding a tip without offering quality service.
Great beer though.

It is overcrowded, stressful, noisy and the restaurants and bars all around are really over-priced. Such a shame really.",Jul 2019
Czech,Xave Edison,Staromestske namesti,4.0,"The square is situated in the middle of the old town surrounding by historical buildings such as the look-alike Sleepy Beauty Castle (Church of Our Lady before T√Ωn) and Prague Astronomical Clock.

Though the square is quite big, the number of tourists flocking in the morning can be quite a nightmare.

Instead of staying longer, we left within 20 minutes and headed towards Charles Bridge and Prague Castle.

When we are back in the late afternoon, the crowds in the square are starting to disperse, which we spent slightly longer to enjoy the street performances as well as taking pictures with the mascots and the surrounding architectures.

Czech,Steve B,Staromestske namesti,5.0,"Many visitors to Prague start off their itineraries by going to Prague Castle (see separate Review) and then walk down the hill and - after crossing the famous Charles Bridge (also see separate Review) - heading towards Staromestska (‚ÄòOld Town‚Äô) Square - home of many leading attractions (Goiz-Kinsey Palace, Houses of the Stone Bell and White Unicorn, Jan Hus Monument, Old Town Hall (Astronomical Clock), Storch House & The St Nicholas and Tyn Churches).

Having visited the Castle yesterday and Staromestska Square earlier today, both were busy but I would recommend forthcoming visitors consider reversing the above itinerary. Either way, enjoy Staromestska Square because - as already indicated - there‚Äôs plenty to see and do!

Czech,Swell Traveller,Staromestske namesti,3.0,"When on my daily Prague walks from 5.30am, heading here was a highly advantageous due to the fact that were limited people around, apart from fellow photographers such as myself and bridal parties. Late night walks are ok too where things are lit up.

There is plenty of art work around including fountains and statues. There are galleries, churches and many shops too. As the astronomical clock is here, it is completely nuts around lunchtime and the restaurants are always busy too. Be wary of the vendors with the wooden carts around the square as they charge tourists heaps and some food is sold by weight. Also watch out for people dressed as polar bears and statues as they charge to have photos with them.

This is also the main spot for the tourists buses and hop on and off, plus horse carriages. Watch out for current exchange places on the square as they are a rip off, look at the fine print and a new law demands you have 3 hours to get your money back if you find a better deal.

This can be a great place to learn about history, but not in the summer or school holiday months when it is super busy like now.

There were horse drawn carriages for hire; we didn't feel comfortable with the horses standing out in the heat and couldn't see any water available for them, the only bucket we saw being full of bottled water for the drivers and, presumably, customers.

The day that we were there, there were some interesting super-sized artic animals (actors in costumes) which were attracting crowds, plus some quite aggressive street performers and the ubiquitous human 'statues', some with quite clever props.

Well worth a visit, look up as well as out, for there are many beautiful buildings around the square, great photo opportunities.

I have seen it now in various seasons too, last visit was before Christmas and this visit earlier this month (July). Each time, the square is different but still quite vibrant. When I got there this trip on a Tuesday, there was a one day jazz festival in the square with a full stage and even cameras and a huge screen showing the performance. The next day it was gone, only to be set up the third day with a bunch of smaller kiosks selling Prague wares and food of course.

So much to see there with the Astronomical Clock, Tyn Church, the Old City Hall, Churches galore and of course gazillions of tourists at all times of the day and night.

So very iconic, well worth seeing during the daytime and again at night when the buildings in the square are fully lit.

This visit I took the elevator in the old town hall up to the top of that tower which looked out just over this square and I got tons of great photos by doing so. It was great for sure.

I would strongly recommend. Everyone goes there alot, so should you.

If you can, see it before all the tourists arrive. Early morning walk there is great.

I've been to many city centre squares in Europe, and this one is up there with best. Being literally one of the few city centres that was not destroyed or bombed during WW2...old town square in Prague had true historical architecture and buildings that date back centuries, showing you what central Europe would have looked like before the destruction of war. It truely assaults your senses as you get sucked in by its beauty and atmosphere. While it's true that it can get supremely busy with floods of tourists, its street food vendor stalls will try and rip you off and restaurants and bars in it are far more expensive than a couple of streets away....it's still worth coming to gaze at its amazing architecture and the Astronomical Clock and Old Town Hall alone.

The hectic migration of keen visistors¬¥groups define the present-day peaceful times. However, those of you, who are interested in history, may be attracted by 27 white crosses paved in the sidewalk near the Old Town Hall. Let us set our minds nearly 4 centuries back, when the atmosphere in the square was not so idyllic. The crosses remind us the execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders of the Bohemian Revolt by the Austrian Catholic House of Habsburg that took place here on June 21, 1621 - on summer solstice day.
After the Protestant uprising of the Bohemian estates against the Catholic Habsburgs resulted in Thirty Years' War and a final defeat in the Battle of White Mountain, Habsburgs took their revenge and executed some of the key leaders of the uprising. Although some others were pardoned and some escaped into exile, the Old Town Square is affected by this terrible act to this day...

Now, in Easter, there are several Easter stalls. Some of them are quite nice but the problem is that they block the view of the square. Be aware of the food stalls selling ham! It costs 99 CZK for 100gr but they will serve you like 500g! Make sure you tell them exactly what you want or expect to be scam. I honestly recommend visiting the place in the early morning. I went there at 7AM on a Tuesday and I had the square for myself, and trust me it was one of the most pleasant moments of my whole trip. It is not that nice when there are thousands of people there. It can also be quite annoying when they keep offering you free tours. Go there twice, once to see how busy it can get in the early afternoon and the other time early morning or evening to see the true beauty of this magical place.

The square itself has some nice traditional buildings and plenty of places to grab something to eat or drink. There are market type stalls selling traditional food but you should be careful when purchasing from these. We tried the pork for lunch along with the traditional dish which was potato with cabbage and ham. We only wanted a light lunch to shared this but the portions were big and very expensive. The price is displayed per 100g and on the face of it looks reasonable. Once they has squeezed as much as the potato dish into the container as they could and put the pork in another it came to more than 950 crowns. This is more than ¬£30 and was no way worth that, we felt ripped off. To top it off the potato/cabbage dish was cold and tasked disgusting. So ¬£30+ for a couple of slices of pork, lesson learned.
Lots of vagrants around too emptying the bins looking for scraps while we ere eating was quite off putting.

The square is ringed with beautiful buildings with amazing architecture as well as the Old Town Tower, Astronomical Clock and the Tyn Church. There are many restaurants on the square but we never ate in them as there were less touristy places a couple minutes walk away. The square is a popular tourist destination in Prague and is filled with tourists throughout the day, but at night it was really nice and almost deserted so we could enjoy the surroundings without the crowds.

The entrance fee is reasonable so we accepted the pricey photo licence and did not regret it. Wear sensible shoes - you have to cover your shoes in shrink-plastic (it's quite fun) to protect the floors, and I am not sure if they would let you wear heels. The tour was good - our guide Lucaz was very clear, helpful and informative. We really liked the fact that we were not rushed around, but instead had time to admire the furniture and take in the light and the spaces. The onyx wall was amazing. Thank you Lucaz!

We'd also like to add a special thank you to Kla're who we met in a coffee shop. Her excellent English helped us enormously and we were very grateful. Evidence that the staff at the Villa Tugendhat are very nice!

From the street level the villa does not seem out of the ordinary, but it is splendidly situated on a slope, commanding views of extensive grounds, with a well-kept garden, and of central Brno in the distance. The two adult bedrooms are delightful, but the real pi√®ce-de-resistance is the so-called glass room, with a single, integrated space, partially partitioned by means of a lovely onyx wall, featuring a grand piano (which visitors were encourage to play on - lovely acoustics!), a library and study table, and a lovely side winter garden, whilst extensive trees of various colours and hues enrich the experience, via the large, full-height glass planes. The side overlooking garden is all glass, the structure being supported by unobtrusive, polished steel columns. Marvelously relaxing and refreshing - with a splendid sense of the indoors extending into the gardens outside. A curved wall of exotic wood partly partitions this space from a large round dining table. The space is difficult to describe and not even photographs do it justice; in needs to be visited in person to be experienced. Everything has been beautifully restored, with the co-operation of the family, and consists either of original features or of meticulously reconstructed replicas. Our tour embraced also the huge basement, with the large boiler and electric machine, which, combined with a system of various sluice gates, controlled temperature and humidity, and also
included the laundry (with a primitive washing machine). The guide was most helpful and pleasant. Photography is not permitted indoors unless one pays a substantial additional fee. However, it is difficult to imagine mere photos doing justice to the space. I urge you to visit if at all possible!

Czech,PermaForenner,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"The Tugendhat Villa is a modernist architectural gem you must see if you love good architecture and want to see and feel it at its best.

Now a UNESCO world heritage site and beautifully restored to its former glory after decades of destruction and neglect first at the hands of the Nazis, then the Communists and finally an under funded Czech state, the Tugendhat Villa is now owned by the City of Brno in the Czech region of Monrovia who spent 6 years with an international team of well funded experts to restore the building and its furnishings to their original state.

The original building and all of its interior features, furnishings and technology were a brilliant collaboration between Mies van der Roe (and his life partner and collaborator Lilly Reich) and his clients Greta (primarily) and Fritz Tugendhat and their builder, the Villa spared no expense and made one of the greatest contributions to Modernist, or as they say in Brno, Functionalist, architecture.

On an organised tour (book well in advance if you want an English speaking tour) you will learn about the amazing family, the rich choices of material, see the stunning views and see how this building worked as a dwelling and as a technological modern marvel from innovative air conditioning ahead of its time to social and functional layout to privacy and working spaces.

Conceived and built in 1928-30 at the same time as Mies van der Roe and Reich were working on the iconic Barcelona pavilion (now lovingly re-built in Barcelona) it captures the best of what was learned at the Weisenhoff estate in Stuttgart a few years earlier and rises just above but perfectly complements the wave of other impressive Functionalist buildings of the same era in Brno.

After your tour wonder down the hil to the Low-Beer Villa of Greta‚Äôs parents and see a great Art Nouveau building and a whole floor of pictures, commentary and films about the Tugendhat Villa which, after all was funded by Greta‚Äôs father and carved out of his land.

Czech,Janka K,Villa Tugendhat,1.0,"This is not the review of the place itself, but rather the review of the guided tour in German language that I attended with my friend. Even though I speak Czech, me and my friend chosen German tour, as my friend speaks good German, but no Czech. I understand German, I use it from time to time,but it's not my mother language and I don't use it professionally. I know the villa, I know many facts about it, and I went to the tour just because of my friend. And I don't understand what kind of show was the German tour that we attend supposed to be.
The tour guide had such a bad German that the German tourists on the tour constantly helped him to find the right word or corrected his grammar. At the few stops, the guide stopped thinking about all those words he couldn't remember and he just read some text he had prepared (probably learned by heart). Because of his language skills, he didn't mention many information and it was hard to listen to him.
The whole tour was boring and I was so ashamed that I persuaded my friend to visit the place. After the tour, I summarized and told her the facts that I knew from the tour I attended in Czech language few years ago. This is UNESCO heritage and this kind of service doesn't leave good impression from Brno, neither from the museum itself.
If you have German as your first language, consider English tour, as I hope they have some better guide and you will have a proper experience that you paid for from this beautiful place.

Czech,Brigantian,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"This is one of those hidden gems that unless you get a local top off then you would never know it was there.

On a free afternoon with Czech based colleagues we took advantage of a company made bookIng (BOOKING AGRAD IS ESSENTIAL) and entered this amazing house with its incredible history.
Designed and built by a wealthy Czech Jewish family during the period betwee the 2 world wars, this ultra modern spacious open plan family house had design features that houses of today would be proud of.
From recycled and purified heated air to advanced cold storage the setting is superb. The spacious kitchen surprisingly lacking in modern conveniences (they were not invented) stands out as a testament to the age when the most that could be offered was space and cleanliness offered by the fully tiled walls.
Derelict for many years untiltsken over and restored ad a national cultural treasure this house is a must to visit... in preboojed small private groups ... overshoes provided I should let the full story unfold during your visit.
Very much recommended.

In the 21st century that is not really possible to see months in advance if you can really travel somewhere, decisions are taken just a few weeks, maybe a few days before.
That was my form, unfortunately this is an action I will maybe never see, I will just check pictures and some video descriptions on the Internet.

Czech,DEPNewYork,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"Villa Tugendhat was a site that I had wanted to get to visit for many years. In May 2017, I finally got to visit Villa Tugendhat. If you go to the website shortly before your planned visit, you will be discouraged; as it will likely advise you no space is allowed let in visitors for the guided tour of the interior; especially if you are looking for the English language tour. I was able to reserve a place to visit the interior of the house under the German language tour one day before my desired arrival time (I can also speak German). It is miracle a house was able to be built successfully on the sloping land parcel where it is located. Water erosion and mold was a major issue in its location. The nifty features of the 1929 house is electric retracting windows in the family and dining room facing westward and down the hill, dumb waiter in the kitchen; the beige marble wall dividing the family room and the library is fantastic. The circular dining room table that can be expanded or reduced in size by folding leafs is a clever idea. The washing machine made out of copper that came with the house is still there!! If you go into the utility room where the fuse boxes are located, you will notice see Czech text showing what appliances each fuse is for. I highly recommend The Glass Room by Simon Mawer. If you read the book, the description of the house in the book and the Tugendhat family is remarkably similar to what is in The Glass Room. Have fun!!

Czech,Vera,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"I wanted to visit this house since about 1992 or 1993 when I lived in Brno and first learned about it in my History of Fine Arts Class. But at that time, it was closed and almost in a very poor condition. Some 10 years later, I moved to the USA and it was little bit out of my way. Since it was repaired and reopened, it is difficult to get in, as you need to reserve tickets at least 3 months in advance.

The tickets were reserved for us by a family member as a gift and even thought we went in the winter, where there was not so much to see in the garden, it was still great. They only let in 15 people and the guide was very knowledgeable. While the cost of the ticket is high by Czech standards, I would definitely recommend trying to get in next time you plan a trip to Brno. I would not recommend bringing children though (unless they are very interested in modern architecture ;) ). Especially small children will get bored very quickly.

The value of this tour is in the amazing details that have been preserved and/or restored. The tiger-wood paneling, the stunning stone wall through which light passes, and the innovative windows and ""air conditioning"" that were cutting edge at the time.

The villa is located in an urban residential neighborhood, we drove and found street parking difficult to find. Allow time to search for a place to park - one should eventually open up [10 to 20 minutes].

It's actually a bit of a faff to book. Three months in advance, I got some of the last tickets for the day. And when you arrive (early, of course), it's like a test trying to work out where to go and when. But all worth it for one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever visited. The tour is informative and engaging, with lots of time to explore - no photos without a permit though. And you can stroll around the garden afterwards, where photos are permitted.

Tip: if you don't manage to get a house ticket, do visit the garden instead for glorious views of the exterior

Practicalities:

- Book in advance, *well* in advance
- it's about a thirty minute stroll up from the old town
- the site is only open just before the tour starts, wait in the street for staff to let you in. I'm not sure what would happen if you missed this window to enter
- there's a loo just off the ticket office that you can use before the tour
- souvenirs are available at the end of the tour
- there are two staircases to go down inside the house, and one to come back up to street level as you leave

Czech,teatour_karen,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"1. Make a plan in advance to see this. It's not really an on the fly kind of thing. They can't take hundreds of people through at a time or just let people wander, so there is a timed ticket that you should look into procuring about 3 months ahead, or at least I did.
2. I found the staff to be very accommodating of requests. Honestly, they bent over backwards for me and my group and the guide was knowledgeable and personable - really a pleasure to meet.
3. This is a modern architecture jewel. It's amazing to think of all the disrepair and neglect this place saw throughout WW2 and the communist era, and yet so many of the original elements, what really makes this place spectacular, are still intact (like the onyx wall and the still-operating mechanics of the glass wall) or were able to be returned (curved ebony wall).
4. The backstory of the Tugendhats, and of Brno's thriving jewish community pre-WW2 is worth some reflection. While it wasn't a focus of the visit, a little dig into this history will painfully reveal the precision by which the Nazi's obliterated this community that today has a relatively small presence in the city.

Filled with period architecture, every feature and detail from the chairs to the knobs to the sideboards is a vintage piece of design. Also, the house uses sumptuous materials such as marble, ebony, zebrano wood and Italian marble. Money was no object for the wealthy clients.

The building is made of concrete and used massive steel beams to create open spaces, the first such use in a residential structure. My wife and I are not a particular fan of this style of architecture but we figured we should see such an icon of design, and we were surprised to like it more than we had expected. Spare interiors, yes, bordering on austere, but the place is internally consistent and we grew to appreciate the aesthetic, as well as marveling at some of the feats. There's a massive circular table (at which the papers for the Velvet Divorce were signed) but outer rings could be peeled away to make a more intimate space for family or for entertaining guests.

Reaching it on foot from the city centre is easy (from our hotel it was 25 minutes walk). The visit was made all the more valuable thanks to our brilliant guide who led a witty and extremely well informed tour of the house in English (there are also tours in Czech). For anyone who loves 20th century architecture this is absolutely not to be missed - and the building has also played its part in more recent Czech history as the separation agreement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was signed here in 1993, at the very large (and very ingenious) dining table.

Czech,crinamariai,Villa Tugendhat,3.0,"I had mixed feelings about this visit. I had heard a lot about this monument, and the fact that you have to wait many months for the ticket creates very high expectations. This can be both good and bad.

The good stuff first: I went there on an organized indoor and outdoor event. The event was great, and we spent most of the time outdoors (good weather) in an amazing garden with a beautiful view. We even had a projection of a classical movie. They handed out some blankets, so we could sit on the grass until late into the evening. Conveniently, there was a cold bar indoors, with food and drinks, which looked very nice but tasted like nothing (I may be biased, as I am a gourmand). Regarding the indoor tour, the best part about it is that it really takes you to a different space and time. In addition to the space reserved for the bar, we were given a tour of the villa with some history pointers. If you are an architecture and/or history lover, this will be a very interesting history lesson. You even get a brief glimpse into the personal life of the people who built the house and lived there (not going to give you any spoilers). I enjoyed the tour. The villa is reachable on foot if you don't mind hiking uphill a bit. The trip is very pleasant.

Now the (perhaps) less good: If you have never seen functional architecture or you are not familiar with the style, most of the inside of the villa will look like a poorly maintained hospital. There are a few exceptions, of course, such as the wide windows covering entire walls (which you can see from the outside - as I said, you'll get no spoilers from me), but the overall impression is precisely that. So, before you pay and wait forever to get in, it's good to consider why you are going there. Everything related to this monument is overpriced (tickets, souvenirs, etc.), which is understandable given the very high interest to visit. I am not sure how many people come to visit a second time though.

Overall: What I recommend is to try and visit other functional architecture sites in Brno (e.g., the restaurant AVIA, where the food is as expensive as that in Villa Tugendhat, but tastes much better) and see whether this type of monument is for you. If so, it's worth waiting several months to see the inside of Villa Tugendhat. Alternatively, be on the lookout for special events taking place there, and you may be able to get a place much sooner.

PS: I visited in 2013, but the system does not allow me to set any date older than 2016.

Czech,Ian W,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"This is a 'must-see' if you intend to visit Brno in the Czech Republic. It was the reason why we made an overnight stop in Brno when travelling from Prague to Budapest. Villa Tugendhat is an interesting building and has a most inviting garden area at the back. Built it the 1930s it is a functionalist modern building in a sea of traditional houses. The Villa has a most interesting and eventful history and in fact a novel was written about its historic background - The Glass Room by Simon Mawser. In fact I read the book prior to coming to the Czech Republic and my interest aroused by that book made me list Brno as a place to visit. However, one suggestion - I think Brno has enough attractions to make it worthwhile spending 2 or more days in that city.

Czech,Europeanfemaleshere,Villa Tugendhat,2.0,"I love modern architecture especially houses, so I was dying to see the house. We didn't know that there is a very long waiting list approx 2 months to view inside, until we got there. I was so disappointed. We went at the end of September and it wasn't busy but we were told no.
I always thought the house would be in a park or a big garden, it's actually on a normal street about 20 minutes walk from the centre of Brno, surrounded by other houses.
We bought a ticket and walked round the garden which took about 10 minutes, you can see into the lower part of the house but that's it.
There is a shop on the lower ground, which we decided to go into and have a look round, there is a selection of furniture from the house, and also photographs and a model of inside so you get an idea.
The sales assistant in the shop was uninterested in serving us, we were the only ones there, we felt that we were just in the way of her, she never said hello when we walked in, she was just interested in her emails.
The toilets downstairs were in a disgusting mess, the ladies/disabled had feces smeared all over seat and the outside of the toilet bowl, and paper towels all over the floor,
To say it's supposed to be a world heritage sight it was a disappointment to say the least.

Czech,Dohfar,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"This is a modernist house designed by Mies van der Rohe in the early 20c. It has had an eventful history - it was occupied by senior German officers in WW2, was badly damaged at the end of the war and later restored, and was the location for the Czech/Slovak separation agreement. It's a very beautiful place, whether you're interested in architecture or not.

You can only visit with a tour group, and you have to book quite a long way in advance via the website. Don't just turn up without booking - they are strict about numbers and people were turned away during my visit. The tour is informative and there's a shop for books and souvenirs. The villa is a fair distance from central Brno - it took me about 25 minutes to walk, but you could take a tram.

I found it fascinating that the ideas within it had been thought of in some way 'before their time' - I would love the opening windows they have in my own house. It is so sad that a lot of the contents (and part of the structure) was destroyed by the Nazis and the Soviets but it has been really well restored. The views from the house are delightful.

When we entered the main living area - the glass room, we have just stayed breathless.

It is worth to take the extended tour that includes the technical hinterland of the bulding. Partcularly the aircon system is very interesting (if you realise that the house has been built in late 20th of the last century). There is a small shop at the end of the tour where you can buy some nice books with the photographs and the story of the house. After the tour you take some time for you to spend in the garden, just sitting and taking the lovely views to the city and the garden and enjoying a special atmosphere of the place.

Second piece of advice, read Simon Mawer's fictionalised account of the house, The Glass Room, not very well-looked upon by the original owners' family, but a great taster to the structure itself. I enjoyed the whole visit immensely, especially the entrance to the glass room itself, which seems to leave you breath-takingly and weightlessly suspended in mid-air over the garden. Our guide's English was not perfect, but she gave us all the required information, was very young, and also extremely beautiful, so who cared about the odd linguistic slip. Try to see the whole house, including the fascinatingly innovative technology going on in the lower sections.

Czech,keeweeset,Villa Tugendhat,4.0,"My main reason for coming to Brno was to visit the Villa Tugendhat! The house was designed by the famous Bauhaus architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for Fritz Tugendhat and his wife Greta. Mies van der Rohe even designed the furniture for the Villa with the Tugendhat chair and the Brno chair still being sold today. The Villa is one of the most important buildings of modern architecture.

I did the ""extended tour"" (90 minutes), which covers the living areas of the Villa, the technical facilities, as well as the garden. The website advises visitors to book their tour 2 months in advance and they are not kidding! Since I wasn't that well organised I didn't get a spot on an English tour. I emailed the Villa and asked/begged if there were any free spots. Fortunately, I got lucky and I could tag along with a Czech tour and was provided with written explanations in English. The nice tour guide also offered to answer any of my questions in English. Well, yes, it was a little weird to walk around with a group of people that you don't understand but once I got used to it, it was fine.

The only thing that, let's say, irritated me was when 2-3 of the visitors started touching things. They started knocking on the walls, to see what type of wall it was, I guess, working the doorhandles. The tour guide didn't interrupt them at all, which I thought was weird especially since you have to put on protective covers over your shoes so the floor doesn't get damaged. As such I thought the tour guides would be more protective of the Villa.

The house is spectacular, well restored with replicas of the original furniture. The rooms are beautiful, windows everywhere, well planned although imagine a family would have had some clutter. The mechanics are amazing, the house is built so you have garden views. Even the kitchen has nice views. My husband who was working would have loved to see the air conditioning units, the house was well ventilated and heated, would work well in today's world as well. It made you long to build your own house so you could have such pleasant surroundings. Lovely storage as well in every room. The bathrooms were also well done. I love house tours anyway and this one is special.

Czech,wimbledonian1,Villa Tugendhat,4.0,"Had discovered from reviews here that it is necessary to book far in advance to get to see inside the house but also that it is well worth visiting the garden from which you can see a lot of the inside. Unlike for others the staff volunteered that the garden was open, but they really do seem to want to discourage visitors. Firstly, there is almost nothing outside to tell you that you are at the Villa, though of course it is instantly recognisable if you have seen photos. There is no indication that the house or garden is open. The entrance gate is kept locked. Some distance from this gate is an intercom from which it is possible to press a button marked ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô and talk to the staff inside who then come and open the gate for you. We were dealt with efficiently but as if we were intruders. Bizarre.

The house and garden themselves are, of course, wonderful and well worth seeing. Amazingly ahead of its time. Would have given 5 stars if the place was more welcoming.

The staff did not offer this option but simply told us it was fully booked when we arrived. You can see inside the house from outside & the gardens & setting give a good idea of what it must have been like to live there. As part of the garden access you can also go inside to a small area where there is an exhibition.

It certainly didn't disappoint! The building is amazing - although designed in 1929 /30 it is so modern - I felt I could just move in!! (I wish!) Visits have to be booked well in advance and are available in English. This can be done online. The history of the house is absolutely fascinating - so if planning to visit, do read about it beforehand, even if it is primarily the architecture that interests you. The groups are small, so it's easy to see everything and to ask questions. If given the choice, do book to see the ""workings"" of the house in the basement.
Just one point to note - As we were travelling quite some distance, we arrived early for our booking (and it was raining), but we could not enter the building as there is nowhere to wait inside the house. In fact we went a little way along the road and found a lovely coffee shop / restaurant (The Cat Cafe) where we were able to pass the time.

Apparently Grete Tugendhat, wife of the original owner told Mies he had ""unlimited budget""... So expect to stand in awe in front of the onyx wall dividing the living area, the spacious dining area and terrace, the sublime 1920-30 furniture and accessories (reacquired, so said the guide, after the Nazis and the Soviets plundered the place and used it for interrogations resp. horse stables...). Admire the airconditioning and heating systems, and the huge plate glass windows (3.5 x 5m, electrically operated to sink into the floor).
You need a special ticket to take photos inside the villa-- but in our instance the guide was flexible about this. Either way don't miss to take a photo from the bottom of the garden, the villa is most photogenic from there.

However, when I later planned to take my visiting friend there, I couldn't book an English-language tour for more than a month ahead. So, beware, and plan well ahead.

If you manage to get in, though - I think it's amazing. So sparse, so functional, so lack of ornamentation - or that's how it seems at first. But once inside, you realize that it's still full of life. It's not the kind of minimalist design which seems to contain no life at all. This minimalism, this functionalism is something which is full of life, and walking through the rooms, it's entirely possible to imagine a life lived here. And that's the feeling I always look for and that's the question I'm asking myself when I'm visiting buildings, or when I'm looking at pieces of architecture.

Can I imagine a life lived here?

Here - the answer is yes. This building is brimming with life, and brings back the feelings of an era long gone.

The history went through this building and it is a miracle that it now truly in its original shape again. Being built by a Jewish family it was soon in the hands of Nazis, than just at the end of WWII Soviet army shortly occupied the place and during the communism long time small children used it as a gym. The communists ""renewed"" the house partly destroying the equipment of the bath, kitchen and etc. Some of the pieces of equipment where taken by people who had access to it and brought them back during the reconstruction, others were found in museums and remade in original way.... The most intriguing history is connected with the onyx wall that was hidden by a wooden sarcophagi. The technical brilliance of the building is well explained by the guides and anybody interested in modern architecture should not miss this place. Belive me, I am a local patriot living only round a corner in another functionalistic house and I recommend this visit cordially to all my friends who visit Brno.

Czech,John G,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"Brno is known for its abundance of excellent modernist architecture. The Tugendhat Villa should be the starting point for any explorations of Brno's modernist heritage. The Villa is one of the last European works of Mies van der Rohe before he fled to the US to escape the Nazis. Today it is so popular that you need to book at least a month in advance to get a tour of the interior. If you cannot get inside, for a small admission fee you can tour the gardens below and to the sides of the Villa and get a good idea of the structure and its significance. You can also enter the basement (the original equipment room) which is now a gift shop. A walk around the Villa and through the gardens is a very good choice if the tours are fully booked. If you are interested in modernist architecture google Brno Architecture Manual for a superb collection of walking tours of Brno's modernist buildings. You can also get a hard copy at the Tourist Info Centre in the Town Hall. Highly recommended.

The floating structure, where metal pillars rather than walls provide stability, means this is a stunningly open space, even now still breathtaking to come onto the main floor and enter all that light.
I visited first over 20 years ago and it is really moving to see it so carefully and respectfully restored now - it was recently closed for two years while the depredations of history were repaired, and the architects and designers who devoted so much time and care to this task deserve much credit.
Of course it is impossible to forget this beautiful simple modern house was built for a couple who lived there only a few years before they had to flee the Nazis - and the complex history of Brno, and the Czech Republic, are illustrated in the various misuses, plunder and damage later visited on the Tugendhat's home. But they are also also shown in the quiet acts of disguise and protection, and eventual restoration, of this stunning house.
The display in the basement is informative and we had a tour guide who gave lots of interesting details. Worth reading about online or getting a guide book (or reading the fictionalised account in Simon Mawer's The Glass Room) so you don't miss any of the details.
Gardens are splendid, views back across central Brno from the high house terrace are brilliant.
Allow some time to sit and take it in, well worth it.

There was also installation of self-playing piano in the garden (set of strings connected to piano that acts as an amplifier - operated by wind or by set of little motors). Enough with exteriors, let's move to interior... There's plenty original pieces of furniture designed specifically for this villa (some is still in production today!), but the best stuff is yet to come:
The house has 3 revolutionary elements (considered 1930s)
1) partially translucent onyx wall (to see and fully enjoy its effect, visit the villa before sunset)
2) two huge sliding windows (works similar to automobile window, but weights a few tonnes), thus you can enjoy fresh air in the living room and so on
3) ultra-modern air-conditioning system that distributes fresh air (or warm air or various mixtures of both) inside the building with possibility to add scents of flowers or wood.

Well, no wonder it is UNESCO world heritage site.

OK, we enjoy architecture - from castles, cathedrals (mediaeval & modern), streetscapes, houses (of all sizes), and so on - but this building was ground-breaking in its day, and yet, after restoration, still strikes you as being ultra modern.
Although some people have reviewed that it is diffucult to get to, on the contrary it is very easy to reach from the centre of Brno - just take the no.9 tram from the railway station.

We were really lucky with our guide (young boy named Adam), really appreciated his commentary.

Tip 1: To save your time when coming to the main entrance. All gates will be probably locked, just ring the (red?) button on the pole nearby the information desk. Staff will come to open the gate.

Czech,Vagabond_of_StAlbans,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"Booking in advance is essential - I made the reservation in July for our mid September visit .In preparation for the visit I read Simon Mawer‚Äôs Glass House and I am glad I did.
Although it is fiction, for me it greatly enhanced the experience. Viewing Villa Tugendhat after having read Mawer's novel was a doubly unforgettable experience.
I understand that in Brno the novel is not lauded and there is no reference to Mawer in the guidebook to the villa or in the book shop.
I was very impressed with the restoration effort and the result is stunning, every detail has been carefully researched, everything that was missing or broken has been replaced exactly as it was in the 1930s. Wherever possible the same manufacturers were used and asked to reproduce missing furniture and fixtures.
Walking through the villa, it‚Äôs simplicity, modernism and above all the way it brings the outside space inside has to be experienced, no photograph will do it justice.
We did the 90 minutes ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô tour in English and were shown around by a competent young guide. At times I felt that perhaps he did not quite show the passion that such a place would warrant.

The villa has an interesting history, one of the first to be built in the modern design, owned by a Jewish family, who escaped when Adolf arrived.
Stolen by the Nazis, then stolen by the Communists, used as a stable by the Russian army.
Finally restored by the Czech Republic.
Read the book to learn it's history, allthough, I suspect it has been dramatised to make it more interesting.
We prebooked our tour by telephone from England, we were offered an English speaking tour, I think!!?.
When we arrived for our visit the best English speaker went for his Lunch/break. We then found we were with a Czech group, the guide although she could speak English concentrated on the majorityand, spoke in Czech, nevertheless, we were given printed sheets in English which enabled us to follow.

The internet site would not allow me to book and I had great difficulty in getting through on the telephone. However, apparently, not as much difficulty as czech citizens in Brno have! I asked the hotel receptionist to confirm the time of the tour. She could not get through. She said that she always had difficutly in getting through. She emailed. No reply. She tried again. No-one answered. Only by being extremely persistant did I finally manage to make contact. When we arrived at the Villa, there was no obvious way to enter. By accident, I managed to speak to a tour guide who spoke English and he opened a gate for us. But what would have happened if we had not coincided, I do not know. I asked for a photocopy of some notes on the Villa and the receptionist gave them to me (they were behind the counter). However, the tour guide said that I would ""have to give them back at the end of the tour""! When I challenged this, he backed off. But what on earth is going on here? Photocopies cost pennies. This is a World Heritage Site into which millions of pounds have been poured. The Villa is a treasure. The organisation is a disgrace.

It was just weeks after Dubceck had been tossed out and Russian tanks and soldiers were everywhere. (As a took pictures of the inside a gun was put to my head to discourage such behavior)
Fast forward to April 30, 2013: The restoration is fantastic! It is as it was first built, probably better because of improved materials. It was magic to see the huge windows drop into the floor, as when original. (In '68 they were 4'X4' lights of glass framed by 2x4s)

One of Mies van der Rohe's iconic buildings, it is now fully restored to its former glory after many years of neglect and mistreatement after its original owners fled to Switzerland in 1938. The big open plan room on the middle floor is worth the price of admission on its own, with its pale floor-to-ceiling onyx wall, its curved dining room wall in sumptuous wood, the tubular steel chairs designed by Mies himself in contrasting green and red, the enormous dining room table set on a single polished steel pillar and the huge glass windows that retract into the floor at the touch of the button, uniting the inside of the house with the lovely garden. The view over the city is glorious, too.

We participated in a tour that included the mechanical aspects of the Villa (90 minutes versus 60 minutes) and we highly recommend this tour.

I'm not an architecture savvy, but it is impossible not to be impressed by it, not just by its simple but stunning beauty, but also by its advanced technology, even for today! The story of the family, told by the guide through the tour, adds another layer of interest. If you're in Brno or around - don't miss it!

The villa was fantastic and the tour guides were eloquent and ""knowing"". We are both huge fans of MvdR and enjoyed experiencing the spaces first hand.
We were also impressed by the way the tour guide set the context for us. Walking around in this spacious, light filled house, instantly made us forget that it was actually drawn, built and lived in 80 yrs ago. Well thought out detail to put an old car in the garage... That set the time frame for us.
The downstairs museum shop had an excellent variety of books etc at very reasonable prices.
Very memorable experience., for both my architect husband and for me as a person with a non professional approach to architecture.
Some say the best view of Brno is from Tugendhat. We wouldn't know, but it was indeed a beautiful view.

Czech,Saint-Grail,Villa Tugendhat,2.0,"The villa is beautiful, that's for sure. But to get there you have to accomplish more than you would wish on a day that is supposed to be about the joys of travelling. First, you have to find an opening. You can visit the interior with a guide only. They accept just 15 people per hour. There are two tours: interiors and technical background. If you're not interested in the technical background of the villa (heating, fur safe), you only have like four tours a day to try to get to. For a UNESCO monument, that seems to me quite insufficient.

Second, the villa resembles a fortress! There is no entrance area - the cash desk is hidden, locked and invisible, there is no caf√©, no museum shop, no bookshop, nothing! You have to press some button (congratulations if you have found it and if it occurred to you what you're supposed to do with it), wait for a person, that person will lock up a door in the fence and guide you to the cash desk. If you buy a ""garden tour"" (a ticket for the garden, simply - the Czech love to complicate things with language, it's a 200 years old tradition), this person will accompany you outside to the street and open another door in the fence for you. Fortunately, while leaving, it's enough just to press another button and this door will release you.

My strongest experience after a visit to this Mies van der Rohe masterpiece doesn't concern architecture. I just had one question in my head all the time during and after the visit: Why all that rigour???!!!

Czech,joncrel,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"Great visual and aesthetic experience. You need to book on the website to get a tour of the building, but visiting the garden is worthwhile, allowing you to see most of the building, and the exnibition in the basement. Im advised that if there are no places on the website, its worthwhile phoning to see if there are actually any places on tours available.",Apr 2012
Czech,Officium,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"The Tugendhat Villa is finally reopened after a two year closure and a $10 million (USD) rennovation. The transformation from its condition in 2010 to now is amazing and the Czech's should be congratulated and thanked for the on-going preservation of this remarkable structure - and for making it open to the public. One of the great highlights is the recovery of the original Macassar veneering for the dining area semi-circle which had been reused in another building in Brno.

Reservations must be booked online, and be sure to print-out the downloadable ticket as a confirmation. I found the reservation part of the website a bit counter-intuitive, but keep at it, the visit is worth virtually any online hassle.

To clarify the tour information: there are two tours, a 60 min. 'general' tour of the main spaces, and a 90 min. tour which also includes the mechanical (technical) areas of the house. One does not need to book both tours. The 'Technical' portion is a bolt-on of the general tour, so if you want the ""full"" tour, chose the 'Technical' tour option. I would recommend this option as the technical areas are fascinating also (air-conditioning system, exposed structure, retracting windows operation, etc.)

I visited on 03 May 2012 and you could still smell the paint drying. The house must look even better now than the day it was built (except that the top story concourse areas have not been re-paved exclusively with travertine, but with a semi-convincing concrete flag alternative).

Our tour group was about 12 people, which seemed a comfortable number. The content of the guide's discussion was good and he appeared to have a proper understanding of the architectural significance of the house - and for what people had come to see. His English was very good & he spoke clearly.

There is an excellent exhibition space and small bookshop in the ""basement"" which one can visit at their leisure (as opposed to Adolf Loos' Vila Muller in Prague). One can also visit the refurbished rear garden and remain on the grounds as long as one wants. They have done an excellent job in all respects. There is no cafe (for those that expect such things), but there is a small cafe/pub about 100 yards down the street which you will pass as you approach the house.

WORDS TO THE WISE:

First, no heals (pumps, stilettos, etc.) are allowed in the house due to the linoleum flooring in most of the spaces. All visitors must wear plastic covers over their shoes.

Second: BOOK EARLY!!! There is presently huge demand, and English language tours fill fast because they are taken by not only native English speakers, but basically by anyone that doesn't speak Czech or German. [French, Dutch, Spanish, Japanese, etc. etc.]

Third: If you want to take photographs, you have to purchase an additional ticket (""license"") and sign a non-commercial usage clause. You can book this online as a separate 'ticket'. You will be given a sticker to wear while you are in the house. I paid for my license on-site, but many others did not, and were not prevented from taking photographs despite not having the sticker...so some might elect to see how far they can get. I suspect that they'll crack down soon enough as the fee is about $15 US - a genuine loss of revenue.

Fourth: to walk to the house from the train station takes about 35-40 minutes, and all should arrive at the house 15 min. in advance, so plan accordingly.

Lastly: there are also many other modernist houses to see (many not open to public however) in central Brno. If interested, also check out the 'Brno Architectural Manual' at www.bam.brno.cz

After extensive and meticulous renovation, bringing it to its former beauty, one can feel its sophistication and charm, looking around at the scope of the space as well as the smallest details.

After Villa route with staff you can spend time in the garden,long how you want! Technical route is better than standart route!",Mar 2012
Czech,TinaQ,Villa Tugendhat,5.0,"The Villa is now open after a long and expensive reconstruction and restoration that cost more than 6 milion euros. It was worth the money and the wait, however, as the Villa is now being restored into its former splendor. It is an architectural miracle designed, both the building and all the d√©cor and furnishing, by Miese van der Rohe, a pioneer of the German functionalism. If you haven't seen it before, imagine a stylish white angular villa with furnishing that very stylish and fashionable and sold as designer pieces at insanely high prices. Now imagine this piece of art which looks as modern as it could today was built eighty years ago. It is a true marvel of an architecture and worth seing.

If you are interested in a tour, buy your tickets online in advance, as the weekend tours are fully booked abouth a month in advance. The weekday tours have still some places left. There are two tours to choose from, the standard tour of the first two floors of the villa and lasts about an hour, or a technical tour which also takes you to the engine rooms, heating rooms, aircon rooms and other rooms of the ground floor used for technical maintenance of the villa. This takes an hour and a half, but will most probably extend by another ten minutes. Tours available either in English or in Czech language. As for the quality of guided tours, since the interest is huge, I guess they had to make larger tour groups, but they are too large for my taste as there are some spaces where you literally have to squeeze through a mass of people to get through. Also our guide was nice, but still haven't learned his speeches properly as he was sometimes quite nervous and made some mistakes and generally seemed very unsure. He was very kind though and was able to answer all our questions. I guess with more time he'll be more at ease.

Overall it is an attraction definitely worth visiting even for people not really interested in architecture or design, they would still walk around the villa and marvel at how it ran ahead of the age it was built in. Truly amazing.

Don't confuse the walking distance with a hike up the mountain which I definitely did not do. I rode the cable car up and down the mountain. Yes there's a charge of 90 crowns total for that ride, but if you suffer from back pain as I do, you'll see it's well worth the small price. When you're riding up the cable car you realize how very steep it is through the forest. Walkers, you're healthy as a mountain goat and deserve a large pilsner when you arrive at the top. Once you get to the top, you'll come upon the lookout tower, a butterfly museum and a restaurant. I stopped at the lookout tower 1st and was highly relieved that the lift was working because that's about another 5 flights up. It was truly spectacular! It was quite windy up there especially since the weather was cold and rainy today but mesmerizing. You have a 360¬∞ view of the entire town and the mountains beyond.

Czech,–ê—Ä—Ç—É—Ä –¢,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,Lookout tower Diana is a highest point over Karlovy Vary. You can see whole city from this tower. To get there you need to use funicular or go on foot up the hill. Funicular is not working in the winter. As for me this is one of the places you must visit in Karlovy Vary. Unfortunately i can't say anything about restaurant because i didn't visit it.,Feb 2018

Czech,bbbo,Diana Lookout Tower,3.0,"We've been to the tower after lunch, as it is very close to the Diana restaurant.
The tower is easily accessible by cable car or you can hile if you prefer.
There is a lift to go to the top but the wait might be really long as the lift takes up to 8 people or no more than 2 prams if you go with kids. Alternatively, you can you the stairs but it's 150 steps to the top (I've done it on the way down not up).
The view from the top is very good, but the space really limited so it can be a bit of a nightmare if it's busy (when we were up there were no more than 10 people amd it was already pretty crammed), so i suggest you avoid peak times, if you can find out when they are (we were there on a Tuesday).
Anyway, i think it's worth visiting it.

Czech,The Swiss Nomad,Diana Lookout Tower,4.0,"We visited Diana lookout tower by taking the funicular from the city and up into the forest.
At the top there is a restaurant and next to it this tower; to access the top you can either walk upstairs or take an elevator.
The views are beautiful, even though there is not so much around so you will mostly see the forest and the city. We enjoyed our time at the top, but it gets crowded so after a few minutes we left.
We then decided to walk back to the city through the forest, I suggest you to do so too as it does not take too long.

In less than 15 min from the city center you can reach The deer jump, which already gives you a great view over the city. 15 min farther you reach Diana. Really easily accessible, and if you're lazy, you can take the shuttle for a reasonable price. I singly suggest the walk though that contrasts a lot with the town, it feels like you're deep in the forest!
There is a restaurant up the but we didn't eat there. There's also a ""mini zoo"" (which is just 2 poneys 3-4 goats and 2 pigs.. But it's nice :)

You can go there by foot or with the funicular. I really recommend using you feet. There are various paths to this place. Decent inclination. You can reach the top in 25 to 40 minutes depending on the path you choose. It s better by foot. The funicular does not offer any particular sensation. If you are lazy and a sedentary person, use it.
Diana is a small tower where you can go up and have a panorama view over Karlovy Vary. You can use the elevator or the 150 stairs up.

Either take the funicular or do the half-hour climb through the woods on marked trails (I'd recommend the latter; it's fun and free and takes you through some beautiful wooded areas with views of the town below you at several points). Follow the trails marked with the white and blue stripes and you'll eventually reach the tower. Climb 150 steps or take the elevator to the top and you'll have some spectacular views of 3 towns and the surrounding wooded areas.

Czech,Radrler,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,"I visited the place twice: once in 2015 and once in 2017. It's right beside the railcar, so much easier to get to than... the other place. Don't go to the other place. Seriously, just... don't. Anyway, both times, I was tremendously impressed with the service and food quality. This might be the finest restaurant I've been to in the Czech republic. As if that wasn't enough, you also get to visit the Diana lookout tower, which overlooks, by the feel of it, about two thirds of Europe. And if THAT wasn't enough, there's also a petting zoo and butterfly enclosure. All in all, an absolute must for a first-time visitor in Karlovy Vary. I mean it. Highly recommended.

P.S. Be warned: the railcar ticket cost 80 ck (like 3 ‚Ç¨) last time I checked and it IS ck, they don't accept Euros for some reason.

Czech,Serena W,Diana Lookout Tower,3.0,"This is more a general review on Karlovy Vary which seems to be one of the most popular short day trips out of Prague. Easy 2ish hrs travel via coach from Florenc bus terminal, also picks up at Prague airport on its way out. Bought ticket from studentagency counter, cost about ¬£12 return, coach was great with free hot drinks and toilet on board. Suggest buying in advance as seats get booked up. Can also buy tickets online with 10% discount. We took the 8:30am coach from Prague, arriving just after 10.30am and returned on the 4pm coach which was enough for a leisurely hillside walk and a late lunch. You might need more time if you want to try the spas.

This town is obviously very touristy, full of restaurants and mix of sovernir and designer brand shops. To save a little time get off the coach at the penultimate stop before the terminal at Karlovy Vary and walk along the main street which follows the waterways past elegant period buildings with the odd interesting sight including street entertainment and public taps where you can taste the spa water for free (tastes pretty metallic and salty to me). Many tourists bought ornamental cups and spa wafer snacks.

When you get to Hotel Pupp, you can either take the short cable car directly up to Diana Lookout Tower or walk up to the top by following the zigzag paths to the right of the cable car station. The paths are not signposted but you can roughly work out how to get there by looking at the maps displayed outside or the free map from the tourist information office. The walk and views are ok but surrounding area covered with trees so you don't see a lot until you get near the top.

In summary, a day trip to Karlovy Vary makes a nice change of scene away from the busy city especially if you are visiting Prague for more than 2-3 days.

Czech,GalwayCB,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,"We originally heard spa town and wanted to spend a day at a spa in Karlovy Vary however as we would be travelling from Prague it made no sense. Confusion over the idea of the ""Spas"" led us to believe each spa would need to be paid for which is not true.

We paid ‚Ç¨12 or 330 local for our return tickets, the bus booked out fast and leaves at the exact time, boarding starts 10 mins before departure. The journey is 2 hrs 15 mins and the bus offered tea, coffee, hot chocolate and had an entertainment centre for each seat headphones were also given out. We got off at the Terminus as we needed to catch the bus home from there.

We didn't know what to expect from Karlovy Vary and we were pleasantly surprised bu its beauty and the clean fresh air and uncrowded streets (in comparison to busy Prague).

The main street is full of shops and some bargains can be found. We found the first tourist information unhelpful but the second was much better. Language barrier was the main problem.

Picture of the town simply don't capture the experience of being there. It is a magical place. It has several spas which are all accessible as you walk the main route from the bus terminus to Hotel Pupp.
The water in each spa is full of minerals and doesn't taste very nice, they vary on temperature and it feels like a treasure hunt to find them all. Most are housed in Collonades which are spectacular buildings that lend their greatness to the overall archeticture of the town.

The town has a river running the length of it and the streets are conected by a series of pretty bridges.

Access to the Diana lookout tower is by cable car which costs approx ‚Ç¨7.50 for two return. You can also hike up the hill. Time was not in our favour.

We had a delicious two course lunch for ‚Ç¨9 each, in a hotel which faces Hotel Pupp.

The town is simply gorgeous and a must see. We could've spent days there enjoying it however it is manageable in one day. Try to give yourself as much time as possible as our four hours was jam packed.

The walk is amazing in the snow and the view is astounding.
However I must caveate this.It is slippy due to the snow and you need proper clothing and boots that grip. Dont do it in trainers or shoes in the winter.You should not be unfit either but you don't need to be a fitness fanatic. If you are in good health that's okay.
Once you get to the top the view is second to none and also it's amazingly quiet.
The path is slippy but we found it okay and a great walk. Leave plenty of daylight time though do not chance sundown as the temperature drops very low very quickly.
I am making it sound scary but it was a brilliant walk.Also once you get there there are lots of other trails all over the place but that for me is another day.

Czech,Andreas Michaelides,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,"Karlovy Vary is an amazing and beautiful city, a big percentage of its population are Russians. One of the many sights you should definitely check out is Diana tower.
There are two ways you can get up there, by teleferic or on foot, on foot you need about 1:30 approximately and the teleferic run every 15 minutes.
One gets on the top the tower is there to greet you with its magnificent structure. There are 150 steps and there is also an elevator for the people that cannot go up the stairs. The entrance to see the tower is free. The view from up there is breathtaking, you could see all of Karlovy Vary the near hills and also the Forrest.

There is a restaurant called Diana which serves a pretty nice menu. Also, check out the photos there it shows how the tower was through different time periods.

There is something like a mini zoo there a butterfly house and a few beautiful peacocks.
On the way back, it‚Äôs a good idea to go on foot if you can, you can back to the city through the Russian church Petr Pavel and the view and the scenery is simply awesome.

I had an amazing time visiting Diana tower, if I ever go to Karlovy Vary again I will visit it again highly recommended.

This was a nice way to see Karlovy Vary from a distance. There is an elevator to get up the tower is nice for people with mobility issues. The most exciting thing was seeing a completely white peacock who showed off for the crowd! The funicular gets a bit crowded and they expect you to jam yourself into the cars that already have people sitting facing each other with their knees touching so it is a bit awkward. There are probably nice walking paths around the area but we didn't go walking.

There is option to take mountain rail up or down or return trip, or simply start yoir day with mountain tracking. We took the rail up, and walked down from Diana lookout tower, to Deer jump.

Unfortunately the restaurant next to the Deer jump (stag's jump) is not open, maybe because of the low season. I think during summer, it will be a very good place to hang around.

At the top there is a short walk to the tower then you either take the free elevator or 150 steps to the top either way it is totally worth it the view is spectacular. Back down there is a butterfly house which is nice and cost approx czk 240 for 4, nice to see but rather small behind the butterfly house is the petting zoo with a few goats,pigs and shetland ponies. There is a restaurant at the foot of the tower but gave it a miss as it was such a nice day we walked back down to the town, the paths were not well sign posted but common sense keeps you heading in right direction, paths are like any outdoor tracks and can be slippy and steep in some places so walking shoes or boots are advisable but the scenery and views make it all worthwhile,stunning and a good excuse for hot coffee or chocolate in the Grand Hotel Cafe Pupp when getting back down.

Czech,Elana C,Diana Lookout Tower,4.0,"it was worth riding up here on the funicular to catch the wonderful views (no charge for going up the tower, and there's an elevator). you can see quite a lot (it was a bit chilly - so bring something warm when you go up here). The restaurant is not bad food-wise(though choices for vegetarians are very limited) and has a lovely atmosphere. In short, worth taking the time to climb or ride up and then walk down.
Note: the tram (funicular) stops at the midway stop only on the way up. We were planning to take it down one stop and walk back to town from there, but somehow ended up back at the bottom.

Czech,wheredoesthefox_stay,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,"First of all, there is a funicular which you have to use to get to the lookout tower, and when you get there, except the tower itself you also find there a small zoo with peacocks walking around, horses and donkeys, a butterfly muzeum and a small restaurant to have a rest. The entrance fee is 80 CZK if you go to the very top station of the cable car where the tower is located and also use the cable car to get back, otherwise it's cheaper.
The tower itself is definitely worth visiting as the view you get from it is really fantastic, you see Karlovy Vary as the palm of your handy, pictures attached are the proof!

Czech,Irene B,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,"That's a great lookout on the very top of the hill, overlooking the valley. There're no signs showing how to get to the funicular entance, though. So, as you walk along the main street, on the right side of it, pass Trzni Kolonnada, then, U Svejka restaurant (there's a sign), and then, watch out for a narrow side street winding upwards (if you come there around noon, there definitely will be other tourists there, so just follow the crowd.
I'd recommend purchasing a ticket all the way up (to Diana Tower). Because I think climbing up this hill is rather strenuous. When on top, you can either take an elevator up the Tower, or climb the steps. On the tower top the space is limited, so to avoid crowds it's better to come early.
The views are spectacular, though it's very windy up on this ""balcony"".
Then you can go down the hill following one of the numerous paths, though, again, it tends to be rather steep.

Lookout tower is for free, you can use elevator or 150 stairs:) At the top you can enjoy panoramic view, but I've got little phobia of hight so I didn't. Don't forget to attend Diana restaurant - you just can try great beer (I recommend wheat beer) or great traditional cuisine. So be active, walk there and do something for yourself! :)

Once we reached the top i.e. base of Diana tower, there are a set of spiralling stairs that took us right up there. It has a 360 degree view and is quite beautiful.

Czech,Haifanic,Diana Lookout Tower,4.0,"Karlovy Vary is a legendary place. The streets, the shops, the warm water flowing naturally.
There's no doubt, K-Vary has it's magic. If you arrived here, you cannot skip the Diana Lookout Tower. It is located almost at the end of the main walking promenade.

There are two ways to get up to the tower:
1. The somewhat small funicular (see photos attached). It reaches the top in about 90 seconds. You can buy a one way ticket or a round trip. If you bought a one way and than decided to use it downwards, you would eventually have to pay extra 10 czk. Not a big deal.
2. Walking through the woods. As it is a very steep incline, you should choose the walking option for the way down and not for climbing up. There is more than one walking lane (some are longer than others) and you should ask someone to help you choose the right one for you.

If you are young and healthy, as you reach the tower - climb the stairs. It takes no more than 5 minutes to climb up and it is much faster than waiting for the slow elevator. The view is absolutely amazing. You can even see the woods that mark the border between Czech Republic and Germany.

The mountain tramway (""Lanovka"" in Czech) leaves every 7.5 minutes, and stops midway at ""Deer's Leap"" or Stag's Leap (which turns out to be a short, moderately strenuous hike away). But from the top you can strike out in several directions for short or long hikes. We took a 2 hour hike on a trail marked ""21""--there are markings on trees about 20 meters apart. Hardly saw anyone else, so very quiet and pleasant; and actually on an asphalt path the entire way, so smooth walking. We ended up in the hamlet of Doubi and following directions in the hiking pamphlet put out by a committee from Karlovy Vary available free at our hotel (Embassy) and presumably many other places...as I was saying following directions, we came to a bus stop and took the #6 bus to central KV, and transferred to #2 bus into the historic center near the Hotel Popp--it's called the Dramatic Square (""Divadelini Niesti"").

Czech,SteveJacksonnufc,Diana Lookout Tower,4.0,"Having spent the day in Karlovy Vary we found ourselves at the top of the town near the end of the shops and decided to take the small venicular railway up the hillside and ascend Diana Lookout Tower. The ascent on the 'train' was good and only took a few minutes and was fairly inexpensive. The tower itself is next to a restaurant/cafeteria with outside benches and was a nice place to rest following the day walking through town.

The tower however, was a fairly lengthy climb to the top. The lift ( there is one ) wasn't working the day we were there and being a little less active than I should be I was a bit out of breathe when I made it up. However, the views were pretty good and it wasn't that busy. A great spot to look out across the valleys and Karlovy Vary below and take some time to relax for a few minutes.

Coming down was easier and a quick bite to eat before dropping back down to the town. Probably all in all a one hour excursion which was basic but worth the effort for the cost.

If you are in Karlovy Vary and have an hour to spare check it out.

Czech,Travelling_Bilbury,Diana Lookout Tower,5.0,"The entrance to the funicular is easy to find ‚Äì although it‚Äôs not sign posted from the main promenade ‚Äì you just have to go behind the little ally-way next to the Grand Hotel Pupp to find it.

If the weather is good and you‚Äôre feeling energetic then I would recommend buying a one-way ticket and walking down, - the view is spectacular and there are multiple paths you can walk down back into town ‚Äì the paths are a little soft/pebbly in areas ‚Äì so make sure you‚Äôre wearing shoes with good grip. We took the short walk down (about 1km) and it took less than 45mins to walk back to the bottom of the funicular.

The funicular has two stops, one half way and one to the top ‚Äì which takes you to the tower and restaurant, the tower has 150 steps or you can take the small lift (max 5-6 people) but the area at the top (of the tower) can get crowded ‚Äì so try to avoid the middle of the day (and the lunch time rush). The tower offers complete views over KV township and the neighbouring areas around it, for this alone I highly recommend a visit.

The petting zoo is small, with a few goats, pigs and a lone peacock. The pictures signposted at the top (& bottom) of the funicular have these animals painted on it so I dont think anyone should be under the impression that there is a real 'zoo' at the top of the funicular.

We had a late lunch in the restaurant, the outside dining area (wooden benches) were completely packed, so we decided to eat inside, where there were only a few other diners, so it was quiet, a little more romantic, (table not bench seating) and there were no smokers! We had a table by the window which over looked the mountain and the small petting zoo at the back of the building (outside seating at the front of the restaurant faces the tower and KV).

Our waitresses were friendly and helpful with ordering & our meals arrived promptly! We ordered goulash (which arrived inside a giant pumpkin-shaped bread roll!); chicken salad and pheasant stew. As we‚Äôre coming to expect from Czech restaurants ‚Äì the portions are huge, the food is hearty and everything tastes delicious!

We definitely recommend you add this to your list of things to do in KV!

Tuesday - huray !!! Funicular works, lets buy tickets and go, weather was nice. Got up and found out that Diana Lookout was closed.

Please be aware it's quite a taxing walk up to the castle if you're not able bodied (or like me, not too young in years) but worth the climb to see some of the views from the top (which I found more pleasing than the castle itself)! There is a little refreshment stall just outside the castle to quench your thirst after the long walk up. Don't forget to walk round to the back of the Castle (not the refreshment stall) to see the pretty little water falls for some pics. Plenty of green areas if you want to take a picnic up with you. At the foot of the much easier walk down, there's a rather nice restaurant/bar, Pod Spilberkem, to stop off for a cheap pint of Pilsner or whatever takes your fancy ... in fact we liked it so much we stayed for an evening meal which was delish!

After the heat of the day we were also rewarded with a lovely cold beer at the bar at the top. The only complaint is that pricing seems a bit of a jumble. It may be better to charge a flat fee to see everything, but instead you had to pay once to see the old jail, then there were lots of other separate tickets to see other bits like the tower or the exhibitions. Signage was not great either, and the ticket office was buried in the gift shop. All a bit confusing. However there is a useful push-button map in several languages, which can help you make some sense of it. Overall worth the hike, though the cost of jail entry was a bit steep considering it was mostly just a load of empty cells, with a sprinkling of a few stuffed guards!

The museum covers the use of the castle from medevial times and includes archeological artifacts (and a chance to see portions recently excavated), it‚Äôs history as military barracks, a prison and its takeover by the Nazis during World War II where it was used as a gestapo headquarters. It provides stories, artifacts and firsthand accounts throughout the years. A second floor houses items of religious and cultural significance to the city of Brno over the years including art, furniture, weapons, fashion and much more.

The story of Italian, Hungarian and Polish 19th century freedom fighters is told quite in detail. I learned a lot here. The local history permanent exhibition is a little old-fashioned and boring, the fireworks history exhibition is very colorful (I had no idea about this history!) and then by the time you get to the Brno art history exhibition, you may be too exhausted mentally to take it in. On top of all this there was a temporary exhibition with photos taken in Rome by Pavel Knopp. Warmly recommend this place, even though I think for over 300 crowns they could let us see all the parts, but it doesn't entitle you to see the royal tower. that being said, it is long and exhausting program enough with the casemates and the castle.

Czech,Silap Inua,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"Climb the steep hill and feel the mailed fist of medieval history, or tyranny, on your shoulder. Spilberk is a forbidding place that plunges you into the pit of centuries of brutal central European conflict. The castle itself is a masterpiece of near impregnable military fortification. Worth seeing. Its story is one of the darkest in Moravian history; the museum that tells its story is less impressive. A more interpretative, multi-lingual approach would greatly enhance the experience. Non Czech speaking visitors will struggle to understand the stories which are being told in the various interesting exhibition rooms. The horror of the Spilberk‚Äôs prison era is fairly self-explanatory but again more of its stories need to be displayed on multilingual presentation boards. The prison cells and torture rooms reveal one of the darkest and most horrifying chapters of Moravian history. The story of the founding of Brno itself is better told. The castle battlements provide a spectacular viewing platform to see Brno and the surrounding countryside; the elevated, well-tended parkland is a delight and worth exploring, too. There is also a welcoming restaurant. If you have 2 hours or more in your schedule, Spilberk is certainly worth visiting, if medieval history interests you. But this is a haunting place that needs the hand of a better storyteller to send its story broadside into the world.

Czech,macedonboy,Spilberk Castle,3.0,"I visited the castle and the exhibition was a bit boring. Whereas I was expecting the exhibition to explain more about the castle, the exhibition was more about the use of the castle as prison over the centuries for various ethno-nationalists during the period of Austro-Hungarian Empire. The exhibition was divided into separate sections for the different parts of the empire such as Italians, Czech etc, and to be quite frank, a bit repetitive and boring

The permanent exhibition also included a museum of medieval to pre-modern history of Brno (virtually all in Czech), and an exhibition of the architectural history of Brno which was much more interesting because it had a lot more English and architecture happens to be an interesting topic for me.

It‚Äôs a challenging climb up to the top where the castle is, and to be honest the views from the castle over the city was the best part of the visit.

Czech,Rafal W,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"Spilberk Castle perched on hilltop in Brno city, in Southern Moravia Region of Czechia. Old medieval castle was erected in 13th century by Premyslid kings. Gradually, castle has been turned into baroque fortress, and that's what we can admire today, Apart from beautiful baroque citadel with its moat and bastions you can visit old casemates, which in the past served as a prison, considered the harshest prison in entire Austro-Hungarian Empire. From the bastions and castle's tower there's beautiful view of the city. Castle grounds also holds temporary and permanent exhibitions as well as musical concerts and summer cinema. There's small restaurant/bar where you can possibly refresh yourself after climbing to the top of the hill. Once you've finally found yourself in the castle you can purchase ticket to individual areas of the castle or choose all inclusive option. Mind that you can't pay for them with Euro or other currency but Czech Crowns. Luckily enough they accepting credit and debit cards there.

Czech,dvorac4,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"It‚Äôs a pretty, wooded park with several different paths to walk around and to reach the castle, which is truly a fortress. It is a massive fortress; there are sections with very thick and towering walls and the main gate is next to a lovely little pond with artificial waterfall. Buying tickets was a little confusing as there are many different options so we bought the ticket that covered everything. Spilberk has a rather dark history, as it was used by the Hapsburgs as a prison for the worst criminals and political ‚Äúoffenders‚Äù and then was also used by the Nazis as a prison as well. The tour was self guided and mostly of several different rooms of Brno history through the years; some of it was particularly interesting about Brno‚Äôs role as the wealthy industrial capital of Moravia and also about Napoleon‚Äôs victory in Battle of Austerlitz which took place very nearby. This was the most interesting part of visiting Spilberk. There is also a self guided tour of the dungeons and prison cells, which was very dark (literally and figuratively). Spilberk is also used as a musical concert venue; they were setting up for one that afternoon and we could hear the music from our hotel later that evening. There were several volunteers in the various rooms who would be happy to answer questions once you approached, and that was very interesting.

It was steep but there‚Äôs plenty of benches to stop and rest and many inter twining paths to take. Nice quiet green area. Lots of views of Brno below along the way. Then you arrive at the high red brick walls of the castle‚Äôs fortification. Okay. Just walls. Eventually you enter the castle grounds through the only entrance and then you see the stark cobblestoned paths and the plain rendered walls of the castle with its tiny rectangular caged windows. There were no trees, gardens, gargoyles, decorative windows or soft materials. Stone, iron and brick. I was really underwhelmed. I walked all around the walls and into the underwhelming courtyards. There were bells hanging off one wall, which ring on the hour, and the top of a well. There‚Äôs a cafe but a little overpriced. I didn‚Äôt do any tours as I‚Äôm not interested in torture and prison cells. Didn‚Äôt do the tower as you can get same sights from rooftop cafes or St. Peter‚Äôs cathedral. I can understand exactly why this place was used as a prison. It is so dreary and unremarkable from the outside. Not sure about the interior but didn‚Äôt want to find out.

Czech,Master Jonjon,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"1. Get ticket for all its attractions from the gift shop, namely: watch tower, casemates, perm exhibitions (Brno City Museum) and temp exhibitions.

2. The watch tower offers the greatest city view you can find. Imagine possible intruders from the north or east.

3. As you reach casemate‚Äôs entry gate ‚Äì ring the bell. Staffer will come check your ticket and give you a leaflet. The leaflet introduces the background of every room. In some of the rooms you‚Äôll get mannequin re-enactments; or you‚Äôll get scared the crap if entered the wrong way. The casemates used to alternate between being a fortress and a torturous jail. You'll also get to see those historical moments.

4. The perm exhibitions open weekends only. Imagine how convenient it would be if they‚Äôre to narrow down their efforts and match everything‚Äôs opening time. It would be easier for tourists to plan.

(The castle opens one hour later during the summer. Take away: The daylight saving system is a failure only to be consciously annihilated by making everything doubly more complicated.)

My daughter is a college student, so she paid less to climb which was a nice bonus. The views from the tower were the best in the city that we found and the clear sunny day made it magical. I will say that we got coffee on our way back down to the city and their pastries did have mold on them in the fridge- we passed on the pastries.",Dec 2018
Czech,LaraKZ,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"First to mention you need a climb up to the castle through its park - so get ready for 15-20 minutes uphill walk - the cobbled paths are not so steep but still require some effort and they can get slippery in the rain so wear some proper shoes.
If you are not for the full walk take at least the first part up from where you`ll see already the town panorama and have the opportunity of pictures with both cathedral and other towers from the old city buildings.
The castle is pretty bare in decorations from outside, huge but more like a white modern building so this is a bit of downsize to the visit but its location up hill and its fortifications give him an impressive side. He is used as museum grounds so check on the listed exhibitions at the entry to decide if you want to go also inside or just enjoy the outside views of the city.
They have a beautiful terrace where you can enjoy coffee and sun but unfortunately it faces the industrial part of the city maybe during summer there is some seating option also on the other side of the court.
If the weather is not nice you might not enjoy at full this experience as to me the exterior and views counted more in this location.

Czech,David W,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"I had a few minor complaints, but overall it was enjoyable and a positive experience. Might I suggest you do your homework before arrival, like visit the website to find out exactly what you want to see and the associated costs. I made the mistake of buying a full ticket, and not using it all. The first and 2nd parts of the complex that I visited, the Archaeology and History sections were very, very good. The booklets in English don't really do it all justice. You can read the text in the booklet, but at times, what you are looking at is not really explained. After a 2 to 3 hour stint of standing and walking I needed to take a break and after that I did the walk up the tower, which is well worth it for the views and some good photos. The Casemates are an attempt to portray what the conditions were like, and I found it interesting, but the pamphlet was awkward to read due to no lighting, seems to be a bit of a no brainer. Although I do agree that it would be difficult to get it right. My main bone of contention, is the lack of signage in languages other than Czech. Signs in certain areas warning of 'No Flash Photography' would also be a benefit. On the whole a positive experience and well worth a visit.

Czech,Greenlakereener,Spilberk Castle,3.0,"From the old town square, it is a good 15 to 20 minutes walk, a lot of it uphill, to reach the castle. When you get there, you can chose one or both of the tours offered. None of the tours are accompanied by a guide...you go on your own. There are half price tickets for seniors, but you have to ask for them.

The first tour takes you into the dungeons and the prison complex. There are some recreations of a torture chamber, guard rooms, and kitchens, and you walk in dark chambers viewing the prison cells. It is very dark and creepy!

The next tour takes you into the museum where there are displays about the history of the caslte. Please note that unlike other castles in the Czech Republic, this castle does not have oringal furnishings, paintings or great displays, it is simply a museum, with displays in glass cases.
All of the displays are in Czech but there are English booklets hanging in each room that explains the exhibits. We found that a lot of it was rather boring and it took way too long to have to read everything, so we gave most of the displays just a quick look.

We did find the displays and exhibits about when the Gestapo and Nazis used the castle as their headquarters during World War II very interesting. But, in our opinion, it was a very long walk uphill to a museum that was only mildly interesting.

Czech,JapanTeacher,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"There are several things to do here besides just enjoying the walk up and down through the surrounding hillside park. You can opt for tickets to see different parts of the old buildings, including the old barracks cum prison underground, climbing the bell tower for the great panoramic view all around Brno, seeing displays of architectural and historical information, and touring a fairly extensive art gallery (skip the latter if you are a prude, some collector/curator apparently had a strong interest in nudes, abstract and otherwise). There are also a couple of restaurant-cafes up there, and apparently they sometimes do shows in the courtyard (we were treated to some dance rehearsals when we were there). Probably ideal to tour it in decent weather just for the views and enjoying the park, though you can easily spend a couple of hours inside the buildings out of inclement weather. There were a couple cars near the top, but not sure if the public can drive up and park, seemed like one probably needs to walk. Expect to use stairs a fair bit in the castle.

Czech,Usandawheelchair,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"I walked up the excellent paths to the entrance to Spilberk Castle - a very pleasant if uphill walk of around ten minutes in a wooded setting. There are various routes to take from the east (City) side of the hill upon which the castle stands, although the main path is signed from Husova. The castle is impressive, dominating the city in most views, and is a must see attraction. I was interested in the views that could be obtained from the Observation Tower, and from the surrounds of the castle. At the entrance there were some building works at the time of this visit, so payment for the various options open to visitors was in an inner courtyard. The charge for the tower visit was 50CZK. This seemed extremely cheap for what I was expecting to see. The area next to the tower is reached by climbing spiral staircases and through passageways with steps and a curious dimly lit room with an arched floor. Therefore it is only suitable for the able bodied visitor, so I was on my own for this visit. Beneath the tower itself you arrive on a walled parapet which offers views to the east over the city centre and to the north. There is a viewing telescope which is free to use, and I was able to see my wife in our hotel waving to me!! The views from here are incredible, and you will certainly need your camera or smartphone. All the major city buildings are visible, as well as views to the hills beyond the suburbs of Brno. A further spiral staircase leads to the viewing location inside the tower. Amazing, is all I could say. Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul (Petrov), The Old Town Hall, Church of St James, Church of J A Comenius (The Red Church) are just some of the things you will point your shutter at. Plenty of creative photo opportunities present themselves. You may even hear the bells ring in the tower if you are lucky. There are plenty of other views to be had of the castle itself and to the south and west of the city centre from the edge of the escarpment around the castle grounds. The AZ Tower (tallest building in the Czech Republic) and the Starobrno brewery are prominent. For the measly price the Observation Tower is a must visit when staying in Brno. I can't think of a city viewpoint that offers such value for money, in comparison to say the London Eye or View from The Shard. There are plenty of other things to see and visit at Spilberk, so you can make it into a longer stay, but don't miss that view whatever you do!!!

We came out three hours later having absorbed so much information we were reeling. We can't understand why other reviews say there's nothing about the history of the building. There's a whole floor of rooms about it!
I can understand why another reviewer wasn't keen on the prison side of it, but the information booklets did give details of the reforms instigated there and it was poignant to see items made by the political prisoners of the 19th century.

All in all well worth the money.

The castle is open for public and you can take few guide tours there (you have to buy tickets). There are seasonal exhibitions, too.
I think, the most interesting part of the castle is a tower (admission 50,-Czech Crowns). There is wonderful view of Brno from there.
You can find the restaurants there and a stand with icecream and drinks.

Only one thing, which I didn't like there: huge advertising posters on the wall at the entrance to the castle complex. If it is an advertising for a concert or a performance at the castle - it is ok, but why is there for example advertising for ""beer tram""? My partner, who is a foreigner was laughing, when he saw it and he said, that something like that is possible only in the Czech Republic.Very sad.

Suddenly around the corner we heard laughter and music! Apparantly they had an open air cinema on the roof of the castle; big screen, loads of benches, a small place you could get beer, softdrinks, wine, ice cream - yeah even popcorn for the movie üòÖ

Unfortunately, there were minimal exhibits. Mostly you were just looking at empty brick vaults with no signage.

Perhaps one of the other tours would have been more rewarding.

Czech,Catherine G,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"Easily reachable from the city centre, you can take a slow and steady walk up the hill to this castle. There are plenty of stopping places, and paths with different inclines so people who want to take it easy can. It was very beautiful in the snow, with a handful of people walking dogs.

You can get two tickets - one to the castle and view tower and one to the prison museum. If you have limited mobility visiting either of these could be difficult.

The castle was great but not outstanding. The views are lovely, especially on a clear, crisp day. Definitely the best place in Brno for views. The castle has some exhibitions - I didn't see loads though so I wondered if I missed something by accident? I didn't have an English map.

However the prison museum was fantastic. A friendly guide gave me a brief introduction and an English map with numbered points of interest. Then you are set off on your own. I was the only visitor - and the cold prison in snow, dark passageways, low lighting and shadows all contributed to a very spooky experience! The museum doesn't overwhelm you with displays and information, but layers up small comments, occasional recreations and lots of physical presence from the rooms themselves to imagine the conditions prisoners lived with.

After that a nice hot chocolate in the small cafe up there followed by a walk back into town. A good 3 hours spent.

There are a number of Austrian coats of arms carved in light gray stone on its walls, particularly at the entrance and in the courtyard. The castle contains administrative offices for the city. The views over Brno from the ramparts are very fine. One can visit the prison cells in the ""Casemattes"" installed by Emperor Joseph II in the 18th Century. It would have been a damp, cold and dark confinement. Interestingly, German occupying forces adapted some of the cells as barracks in 1944.

No trams or public buses go up so enjoy the walk through a lovely park and really enjoy the view once you are there. The castle houses several museums including one of the years that Spilberk was a prison which lasted through the Nazi years. There are some English translations but they are long and some are tedious. It is easy to get overwhelmed with all the things to see since the museums cover three entire floors of the castle plus the basement. Children will probably get bored easily. I believe that the city bus tour takes you up to see the castle so that might be an option for some people.

They stare at you gormlessly and follow you around the castle as if you are about to steal every artefact.

They stand by the side attempting to blend into their surroundings, yet their mere presence creates an atmosphere of trepidation.

Silence. Their mouths utter no words. Yet their footsteps are deafeaning. As the sound gets louder my heart begins to race. Will I leave this castle in one piece or will it engulf my entire being?

I write these words as I continue to find my way around this sinister labrynth.

Is my fate sealed? I cannot be sure. But my warning is clear. Enter this castle at your own risk.

Czech,DebInPrague,Spilberk Castle,3.0,"We felt our visit to Brno would not be complete without exploring it's most high profile landmark. We started with an informal tour of the casemates, the part of the castle that had been used as a prison. There was a very helpful attendant who spoke good English and explained some information about the casemates and she gave us some English text to read as we went round, which was numbered to correspond with various exhibits. After that we were on our own, which was fine but the information given in English about the casemates was pretty basic and factual. We felt it could be improved by adding some information about the reasons people were imprisoned in Spilberk and what day to day life would have been like.
After touring the casemates we wanted to see inside the castle itself. There is no tour of the castle but you can see some of the rooms by buying a ticket for the exhibitions housed there. The exhibitions include some history of the building of the castle and information about some of the key periods in its history. The information is mostly in Czech but summaries are available in several other languages including English. Again, in general the information given was very factual and dry. However, on the first floor we found some very interesting exhibits related to the social history of the city and it was a shame there was not more English (or other) language translation to support it.
Worth a visit to see the casemates but we would probably give the exhibitions inside the castle a miss another time.

We were told to just walk over the bridge and that it would become self evident. Signage would have helped. Had to unload our backpacks but were able to put them in locked compartments. Throughout the museum there always seemed to be someone at the end of the hall to direct us. Couldn't quite get the history part until we read books that were available in English and German. Details and displays were much too complicated to get through in ""museum time"". As it was, we were there about three hours. I felt watched the whole time. We especially enjoyed the Steve McCurry temporary photo exhibit. The casements at the end were dark and moldy and rather depressing. I couldn't wait to get out of there, and I promise I won't kill anyone or steal from a pensioner again!!

Czech,Lin1977,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"We bought a ticket at Spilberk Castle which allowed us to see everything including the lookout tower, casements and all the exhibitions. This was the equivalent of around ¬£10 and it was excellent value. We spent a lot longer at the castle and in the grounds than we expected to because the place is so interesting. The walk up is very peaceful through the trees and you very quickly feel you are miles away from the sounds of the city. There are plenty of seating areas and the paths are keep in pristine condition. The views across the city are wonderful on a clear day. We visited the coffee shop for a drink and a cake each and this came to under ¬£6 in total. If you are visiting Brno I would highly recommend you visit Spilberk Castle; a wonderful place which we would visit again if we were to return.

Czech,Barker2,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"This is the most distinct building in Brno, located on a natural hill overlooking the city it is easy to see how over the centuries it has been viewed as a sign of oppression at times and also as a sign of great defence and power. The Nazis also utilised this site during WW2. The history is demonstrated well with an array of displays and associated knowledge cards available to read in a few languages. Greater use of English would have been helpful within displays however this didn't detract too much.
The casement areas are interesting, showing what prison areas were like. The tower also is worth a look for great views over the city. It's a shame we couldn't access the chapel which seems to be out of bounds. The well is interesting with displays inside showing artifacts found when the well was explored. All in all its a good day out, allow lots of time to navigate all areas thoroughly 3 hours or so. Refreshments are available in a lovely coffee shop and restaurant which is inexpensive. Do not visit Brno and leave the castle out, it's a must. We walked from the centre which is uphill so those less able bodied would need to use vehicle access routes, obviously many areas of the castle would be impossible to access with a wheel chair.

Czech,Debbie K,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"This castle is a great place to visit, even in the winter. Firstly, the location allows wonderful views of the city with terrific photo opportunities. The grounds are enjoyable to wander as the architectural features of the castle can be explored at a leisurely pace. The tower is open and the climb to the top allows for a bit of exercise as well as enhanced views of the city.

While there are various agreeable aspects of the castle, the real highlight of this site is the Casemate. The tour through the old prison is very intriguing and there is quite a lot to learn about its use through the various eras in which it was being employed. The theme about criminal justice and prisons in Moravia was particularly interesting. The restoration of the structure has been superbly accomplished to allow a sense of the dark and dank atmosphere that prevailed in centuries past. I was also fascinated with the time in which the Nazis took over the Casemate as a base of operations. If there is anything that could be improved about their presentation, it would be to beef up the treatise of this era of the castle history. The audio guide is invaluable as it provides a plethora of interpretive information concerning the features of the Casemate.

If you are in Brno for leisure purposes, this is a must-see. The site itself is iconic. But more than this, it is an interesting study in architecture as well as a chance to experience great views of the city. I was particularly pleased with the opportunity to explore aspects of the history of the region.

A very enthusiastic guide directed me on my way with some local legends and a guide leaflet. It was quite eerie all alone in the cells and I enjoyed the silence.

Czech,bluemac-uk,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"This isn't the most easily accessible castle - it was a good 20ish minute walk up via the winding network of paths, and the wet leaves on the cobbled paths didn't make it any easier!

The views as you're walking up are brilliant, and you're likely to see a red squirrel or two (as we did), which is a lovely surprise for an Englishman who's used only to seeing their grey cousins.

We didn't enter the castle building itself, though we did have a poke around the courtyard and some of the grounds, which were nice for a wander around. We paid to enter the Casemates, which in my opinion were really worth seeing.

Essentially you walk through a series of tunnels which have been used to imprison criminals for centuries, and which were also reconfigured by the Nazis during WWII, showcasing a much different style of construction. Really glad we did it, highly recommended!

The whole area is pretty nice, there is an option to visit the underground facility called ""kasematy"" which served as a prison in the past and later as escape tunnels (that's what we were told).

The entrance is about 5eur and the courtyard is often used as a place for organizing workshops, food festivals etc. There is also a bar right before you enter the castle.

The tower offers a tremendous view of the city, the casemates give you an interesting inside into the history of the fortress.

Czech,path_primrose,Spilberk Castle,3.0,"To be frank, the castle was somewhat underwhelming, though it is definitely among the most interesting sights of Brno. It used to be a Habsburg prison for state prisoners, and there are extensive exhibits dedicated to the Italian/Czech revolutionaries imprisoned there. It does get repetitive quickly, unless you are a dedicated student of the 1848 Revolutions.
The city museum is also in the castle: it has interesting exhibits concerning Brno history, the most interesting event of which was when it was besieged by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War. There is also an art museum: some interesting (though derivative) 16th century religious paintings and 19th century portraits of local notables. The modern art collection is rather more dubious.

Czech,Amanda M,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"Unfortunately we didn't realise just how big Spilberk Castle is and we didn't leave ourselves enough time to do it all. We were told that you need at least 3 hours to do it all including the exhibitions. What we did have time for was to see the castle dungeons or casemates as they are called, and we could go up the tower to look at the view. The castle is interesting just to walk around too and is surrounded by pretty gardens which I have heard are lovely in the autumn. The casemates are interesting and in some of them are displays showing how the prisoners were kept (and tortured). The climb up to the tower is not too strenuous if you take your time, and is well worth the climb in order to see the views of Brno and the gorgeous cathedral from the top. The castle is about a 10-15 minute walk from the centre of Brno, mostly uphill, but I understand that you can drive up to it if you are unable to manage the walk but I don't know about parking. I have read some negative reviews of this castle but I enjoyed it and wished I had been able to see inside it and see the exhibitions.

Czech,Margrietina,Spilberk Castle,5.0,"They offer to choose between all-included ticket and separate tickets for several items in the complex. I chose the all-included, because I simply like castles (and if a castle offers additional content to learn more about it, even beter). For extreme budget travellers - you can walk around the castle free of charge and still get some feel of it.

If you are tight with time or on budget, kazemates is a wise choice of all the options, especially if you go there early enough to be the only guest and the only sound you hear is your own steps echoing far in the hallways. Put together with awareness that it was once a prison, gives quite an atmosphere. It also adds to the experience of history-exhibitions of the castle itself, as they are about the castle history and role as the prison. I was not aware how many nations have their historical moments connected to this one place, now I am.

For non-Czech speaking people they have prepared guides in English, German and in some rooms also other languages (especially if the room is devoted to prisoners from a certain country), so you can enjoy the exhibition at its fullest. And the staff is really friendly, smiling, kind and helpful too.

Unless you're passionately interested in Brno and Moravia, you might want to skip it. I didn't even go to the upper floor (art) because I was so desperate to get out of there. Really, it was deadly, and it's very large, so it eats up a lot of time. The baroque apothecary is also not all that wonderful. BUT the casemates are atmospheric and fun (and creepy) to wander around in. And the castle grounds are interesting. There are goats wandering around, munching on leaves!

Czech,TravellingDutchie,Spilberk Castle,4.0,"The Spilberk (Spielberg) castle is quite a sight, towering above the city. It's a bit of a trek up the hill, so take your time and enjoy the park surrounding the castle. The history of the castle goes back a long time, and that shows in several of the exhibitions. If you buy the most expensive ticket you get access to all the exhibitions and the casements (which were used as a prison during times of war (and beyond). Each section has its own ""entrance"", and the employees show you the way where to go next. But because of the size of the castle and the lack of signs here and there it can be confusing to know where you're going. A few of the exhibitions have descriptions in English on the artifacts, and for the other exhibitions you can get a guide in different languages, normally located next the entrance of a room. It takes at least an hour to go through all the rooms and exhibitions, so take your time and enjoy.

(NB you have to check in any hand baggage in a locker before entry). This included the Clock Tower and the climb to the top was well worth it for the panoramic view of Brno and surrounding areas. The exhibition of artefacts etc were well presented with books in each room providing translations into English, French and German. The Art Gallery had some really good paintings and sculptures and a visit to the Casemates showed how life was really like for those troops garrisoned there and later on for prisoners. All of this I had to myself as no other tourists in sight. In fact I would recommend mid April as the ideal time to visit Brno as not many tourists and the spring like weather made it so much more enjoyable.

Czech,TassieTravellers99,Spilberk Castle,2.0,"We visited this castle on a cold and rainy morning. It is accessed via a short steep path a short distance from the centre of town. It is set in its own formal grounds and there is a commanding view of the city from its promenades.
The biggest frustration was the mis-advertising of the opening hours. Whilst it opens at 9.00am in the off season nowhere could we find that it opened at 10.00am in peak season.
There are several courtyards and whilst there are a number of displays to visit the overall atmosphere quickly dragged this place down. Many of the exhibits were temporary artworks and the rooms they occupied such as the chapel and the apothecary were no longer maintained in their original form.
The expected highlight was the castle to fortress museum exhibit. Alas the attitude of the numerous staff who outnumbered the few visitors quickly frustrated us. We had to check our bag, no photography was allowed inside and every chamber contained an eagle eyed staff member who watched us to make sure we did not touch anything. Given everything was under glass we have no idea what they were monitoring. The exhibit contained an archaeological dig of the site, a small arms exhibit, a military museum and a very detailed and wordy crime and punishment display.
Beneath the castle were the casemates. We had a brochure which gave us a bit more information about the tunnels, including their use as soldiers barracks and a small torture display.
Overall the staff were over bearing and we admit that the website did an excellent job in over selling this place. On top of this the facilities needed a good flushing as every drain smelt strongly of sewerage. Not our favourite castle.

It was also utilised by the German SS during their occupation of Slovakia. There have been many renovations and rebuildings / remodellings of the castle over its history. There were fires that destroyed some of the castle over time and it was also left after one such event for many years. One can read all about it on various sites and the when one does the tour the information is provided in a number of languages for self touring. The stories and the information are well presented and match with the displays in the various cells that have been set up. In addition there was an additional exhibition of Fireworks through the ages with lots of photos of the recent competition in Brno and many old apparatus used in the past as well as currently. Well worthwhile.

And the staff on the top floor (noteably the chap at the mentioned art exhibition) were friendly and helpful and though their English was limited, they all did as much as they could to show us around. Unfortunately we spent so long in the main castle, we did not have time to go to the casemates which we were really disappointed about. The location is lovely too, we spent an hour or so walking around the grounds on a sunny day and there were several other people making the most of the situation. Well worth a visit-the bells playing Elvis are an unusual touch!

Most interesting exhibitions (i believe they are fixed) is about the history of the castle and Brno. There were others about fireworks, weddings, Geisha's & Samurais, paintings and carpets. These were not so good in comparison, maybe just because Brno's and Spilberk's history are so interesting.

Very touching were the letters of Jews who were sentenced to death and were allowed 1 letter to their beloved ones.

The whole tour had a recommended length of 3.5 hours. We took longer, some might do it in a much shorter time, depending how much you want to read about everything.

The history stuff, although interesting was not displayed in an interesting way. Perhaps, they are still working on it, but it involves a lot of reading. Reading materials are provided in each area in several languages.

There were several excellent painters. I enjoyed hearing about the statues. Probably the one that will stick with me is the statue of St. John of Nemuchuk. Our guide told us the story of his demise. Fascinating! This is a totally free experience. I would like to go back and check out some of the statues and venders more in depth since we were there as a small group.

Nice views, cool architecture.",Jan 2020
Czech,F.P.,Charles Bridge,5.0,"The Charles bridge is a very nice bridge with two faces. During the day the bridge is very well attended and there are a lot of small showmen, for example you can be drawn in a funny way. But keep in mind, if you visit the bridge during the day you have to be very patient, because there are many tourists taking pictures, for this reason you only can move very slowly. The second face of the bridge can be seen at night. At night the bridge has a very romantic appearance, its perfect for a romantic night walk with your partner.

In summary, you can say that the Charles Bridge is worth a visit at any time of the day and should be on the agenda of every visit to Prague.

We benefited from the fact that due to the Coronavirus episode the bridge was often sparsely populated and you can find plenty of opportunities for a decent photo of the castle or the city. There were a couple of artists doing caricatures when we passed. I did consider visiting very early in the morning to get some decent snaps but because of the lack of tourists this was not necessary. The bridge itself is beautiful and deserves prominence within the city. You have to cross the bridge on the way to the castle, unless you want to take a longer trip over one of the others.

That is why I never saw Charles Bridge as a tourist attraction. In the last 20 years it became one of the biggest tourists attractions in Prague. During our many visits to Prague, I long for the old days, when just the locals strolled around. Without the vendors selling the cheap stuff.

My husband and I were in Prague , when the news broke about Karel Gott's death.
He was a much beloved, popular Czech singer.
I was walking across the bridge that day and saw people crying, the musicians played his songs. It was a beautiful day and the scene on the bridge with the best views of Prague was quite moving. .

During our stay in the Four Seasons hotel, we had the best views of the Charles Bridge from our 7th floor room's wall of windows.
It was truly the best to be able to see it at all hours of the day and night , even hear the musicians performing there.

I was amazed looking at pictures from Prague during the pandemic !
The bridge was almost deserted , no tourists , just like the old times ....

Work on this impressive stone bridge started during the reign of King Charles hence its name. It spans across the Vltava river and along its length there are several stunning statues including St. John of Nepomuk.

Czech,Grover R,Charles Bridge,5.0,"Prague really is two different cities on either side of the Vltava River and this historic bridge, built in 1400, is there oldest connection between the Castle and Old Town. In fact for centuries it was the only connection. As such it explains the solid nature of the bridge. It is nearly 1,600 ft long and 33 ft wide and solid stone. When you walk it you forget the water is there. Part of that is on the castle side for a while you are crossing Kampa Island. However, part of it is the entire bridge is bracketed by art in the form of sculptures of the Saints. The most venerated is St. John of Nepomuk whose murdered body was thrown from the bridge. Finally, it offers beautiful scenery of the city. It is one of the Must See attractions of Prague so make sure you take the time to walk it.

The bridge connects the old town to the castle grounds. If you do not need to reach the castle, do not lose the opportunity to walk around the area just to admire the local sculptures.

Wonderful!

Filled with the normal small stalls it also contained several artists entertaining the visitors. It had an amazing buzz and we always stopped to listen every time we crossed the bridge.

We first visited at night and the bridge was lit up. It was incredibly romantic so if you‚Äôre planning on proposing - that‚Äôs your place without a doubt.

It‚Äôs a couple of minutes walk from Old Town Square and hard to spot.

In the daytime it was a lot more lively with street sellers as well as some homeless people. The views in the day were amazing and you could see up and down the river for miles.

You can‚Äôt visit Prague and miss out Charles Bridge.

Czech,Sean M,Charles Bridge,4.0,"Charles Bridge was one of the sites in Prague that I really wanted to see having read about it online. The bridge is very impressive in it's size and the views of the Vltava river and surrounding building. It's height was surprising,as was the number of arches. When you consider that it was built back in the 1300s it certainly is an amazing structure. The musical groups,the artists and other people of interest gave the bridge a festive atmosphere. I was somewhat concerned about pickpockets having seen warnings posted by people but the reality is that I need not have worried. When traveling anywhere simple common sense should prevail and Prague is no different. The bridge has some 30 large statues along it and over the years they have accumulated residues of pollution. Prague is a clean city so I can only assume that this occurred in the past. I would love to see these statues returned to their former glory if possible as I think it would add even more lustre to this historical place.

The statues were really nice to look at and there were quite a few to compare.
The views on the bridge were also quite nice, being able to look out over the river across Prague. The only issues were the large volumes of people and the buskers which hold up the droves of people trying to cross the bridge. Although there are plenty of bridges around, you should cross this one at least once to appreciate all the history carved into the bridge.

The touristy stalls were packing up and there were beautiful views of the castle and river. There was even a beautiful violin player the second night my friends and I went. Highlight of Prague,Feb 2020
Czech,VingrauSteve,Charles Bridge,5.0,Beautiful wide pedestrian bridge which connects the castle side and the old town. We crossed multiple times and it was always busy. The multitude of statues are all worth a look as is the view up and down the river. You can get off the bridge before the end (castle side) and this takes you to the peace wall and Maltese church. The whole area is worth the time to just walk take in the sights and the occasional sweet treat and or drink. Enjoy.,Feb 2020
Czech,Sean Craddock,Charles Bridge,4.0,"We visited Charles Bridge on a couple of occasions, first at night and then later to cross over to the Mala Strana for hiking up the hills the next day. It‚Äôs a very pretty bridge, and the striking statues lit up at night make a great foreground focus for photographs of the city at night. In the day it is very crowded, with a mix of caricaturists, musical performers and unfortunately a proliferation of beggars. It is probably the most tourist filled part of Prague, but it is definitely worth passing across it to explore the city north of the Vltava.",Feb 2020

Czech,Adin,Charles Bridge,1.0,"There are some nice things to see in Prague, but the cranky people ruin the city and due to that it is TERRIBLE! It happened to me more than 5 times in my 5 days I was in the city that whenever I wanted to buy something, food/ presents/ groceries, people were so unbelievably cranky and rude. Inpatient when you want to order, if they dont understand you because of their lack of English or German they start yelling or sighing. It felt like they hate their lives and their jobs. Wow, this makes the city really aweful. This is the main reason why I dont recommend anyone to visit Prague, my friends family colleagues all agree who have been there.

The medieval gothic architecture all around the views are stunning to say the least. There's so much to take in that you could miss out on all the beauty if you don't go slow. Ot is in the centre of the city and very easy to get to, I went from the Old Town, so it was on my way to the castle. The nearest underground (subway) stations are: Malostranska & Staromestska. They are both on the Line A of the Prague Metro.It has many statues of saints all the way and even a wish making Saint statue if you're into it.

Czech,andyccpc,Charles Bridge,4.0,Charles Bridge is provides a link between the two sides of Prague. It is typical of many such bridges in major towns and cities throughout the world with its multitude of traders selling a variety of arts and crafts - and also a fair number of beggars with their dogs to assist in the art of extracting money from sympathetic (and gullible) tourists.

Initially were worried and ready to give some money until we witnessed multiple of them kicking and dragging their animals to make them lie down or walk beside them. It was horrifying. The saving grace is our guide immediately alerted the police (who came running by that point because they heard us yelling), and the police handled it right then and there!!
If you‚Äôre going to the bridge, know it is not the original (only one of the entries if part of the original), and look up when you pass through the entry - you‚Äôll see the crown in the ceiling that was put there for Charles II!

Czech,wheels1153,Charles Bridge,4.0,"Can you truly say you have been to Prague unless you‚Äôve taken a stroll across this most iconic of bridges? Every stone, cobble, sight and statue has an impressive story to tell. History and religion just ooze out ever inch of this bridge. With visitors, stall holders, street performers and begging souls who are clearly down on their luck littering the length and breathe of the bridge its hard to stop and take a moment to drink in its magnificence. I urge you to pause, take a moment and let the bridges soul wash over you and tell it‚Äôs story. Then look up out across the water into the city and take in the riot of cultural heritage the stretches out before you. This bridge has felt the weight of several million footsteps, I implore you to add yours. It won‚Äôt disappoint.

SUBNOTE ON WHEELCHAIR ACCESS :

The Charles Bridge is situated at the top of a large slopped cobbled road/pathway which I‚Äôm ashamed to say I was unable to push up independently. I‚Äôm old and unfit with shoulder of dust but younger stronger wheelers may put me to shame. Once on the bridge it levels out to the standard gentle bridge arc. However the whole bridge is cobbled and most definitely not smooth. If you have a freewheel or power add on for god sake take it with you and use it. It will be handy throughout the whole of Prague as a large majority of the city is cobbles cobbles cobbles!

It‚Äôs very hard of me to drop to four stars instead of five, this is solely down to the number of pedlars there are on the bridge trying to sell stuff which is totally unrelated to the bridge and it‚Äôs historical purpose there.
Of course it‚Äôs busy that‚Äôs why you are reading this planning to go there, Prague is beautiful, I‚Äôve just returned from my first trip there and look forward to returning already.
Happy to answer any questions you may have.

I guess the local government could easily make a charge to cross over it, thankfully they haven‚Äôt yet.

I‚Äôve read some of the recent one star reviews and it looks like they have knocked it right down because of number of visitors there and what I‚Äôve said above. Relate it to the Tower of London which is full of buses, lorries etc etc not forgetting visitors and commuters. There is no transport crossing Charles Bridge.

Czech,Wenovo,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"600 years in the making. One of the most beautiful Cathedrals in the world.

I have visited many times over the years and can't help but wish sometimes for the old times, when the area was less crowded.
Those old times, when I came to attend a classical concert in the Cathedral many years ago, remain a wonderful memory.

Peoples opinions differ, whether it is worth it to buy a ticket. If you have the time and money, don't miss it.
The Mucha stained glass window. The solid silver (tons of pure silver ) St. John Nepomuk tomb . The king Wenceslas Chapel. The amazing architecture.

Attending Sunday mass is free. The doors close at the start. It is an unforgettable experience.

My husband and I stayed in the hotel Savoy close by, for the first part of our trip.
That made it much easier to select the most convenient time to sightsee the whole Castle area and selectively avoid the crowds ....

We come back time and time again ....

Czech,Silviaf,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"St. Vitus Cathedral is by far the most beautiful building in Prague. Gothic at its frenziest research for dramatic verticality. It dominates the City with its remarkable profile: clock-tower and pinnacles supported by rampant arcs. Inside it is sober, apart from the silver statue and casket of Giovanni Nepomuceno, which is too baroque for my taste. The stained glass is relatively modern, do not expect anything like the marvels of Chartres or Reims. But it is an excellent modern. Very colorful and creates shades of light on the high columns supporting the acute arcs. I visited the Cathedral first in the complete tourist route of the Castle and decided that I wished to come to Mass here and breathe in the more spiritual part of the stones. So, I came back at 10 (always check the time table of masses, because they may change....) and it was a wonderful experience. I do not know a word in Czeck, but I could nevertheless understand by heart. And the celebrant had a way to move his hands so that one...knew what it was all about. The sound of the organ reverberates through the nave and the acoustic is really good. All was simple, a simple altar, a simple bunch of flowers, no unneccessary wealth to show off the (mostly lost) power of the Catholic Church. We were a few dozens of people, all there to listen...some could understand...some not (like me), yet the readings are provided and one can follow. I always love the moment when we exchange a sign of peace, shaking the hands of a stranger, or a smile. I always thought it was a moment of joy, when we know we are all the same...here on this wonderful planet. The Cathedral of Prague is a welcoming building. And attending Mass allows one to stay for another half hour...before the madding crowd...and breath this solemn silence, inhale the height of the ceiling, and walk around with profound respect to the achievements of the master builders

Czech,Louise,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"St Vitus Cathedral is part of the castle in Prague. It's a trek up the hill but totally worth it as the combined ticked (there are a variety of combinations) takes you into multiple parts of the castle, including the cathedral. Sadly the treasury is a further add on so we didn't see it. THe stained glass is really spectacular, and the gothic style architecture is one of the best examples in Europe. There are the usual treasures of sculpture, precious metals, paintings and carvings, it really is a worthwhile visit.",Jan 2020

Czech,Turkish_12,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"Although a later replica rather than authentic gothic architecture, this cathedral is beautiful all the same. Its imposing stance over the castle that surrounds it makes it dominate the Prague skyline, especially when it's lit up at night.

Inside is housed an impressive collection of art and sculptures that you can see as you take the tour around the chapels on the outside walls.

I found this cathedral far more stunning from the outside than in but that's my personal preference and I'd still highly recommend a ticket to go inside.

A must if you're in Prague for sure.

I know that‚Äôs a big call, but we have travelled to many places and seen many cathedrals and in our opinion this is the best and should not be missed. Definitely worth the extra money to pay for you to see all of the cathedral rather than just the free parts. I could skip the rest of the castle and just spend time here, it‚Äôs spectacular.",Jan 2020
Czech,rdrozd7,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"Unusually lesser crowd( thanks to the changing of the guard at the Castle at the same time!). Nice tempo and space giving an opportunity for the pictures, enjoyable study of the objects. Since benches are cordoned off, there is no chance to contemplate while looking at the art around. Still worthy of the ticket price (planB- CK 250, valid for 2 days).",Jan 2020

Czech,hss915,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,I have been here a few times in the past. It truly is a spectacular site to behold and dominates the city. When you go up to the cathedral you can purchase a ticket to look around the palace grounds and the cathedral and to be honest it‚Äôs well worth it.

Czech,Kayleigh Anne,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"Worth the visit, absolutely stunning! Consider a tour guide though, the information dotted around is mainly to do with the structure of parts of the building rather than information about its use and history which we found quite boring (even as a lover of this type of architecture!). The tour guides we passed inside definitely give a more informative talk of the history than we could get from the information boards.",Jan 2020
Czech,debbie l,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,Stunning Cathedral well worth a visit.

Czech,Andrew R,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"If you are in Prague for more than a day you are probably going to visit the Castle and the cathedral which is within in. You can visit the exterior of the cathedral and view part of the interior without a ticket. To view it properly you need to purchase a ticket as part of one of the palace visit options. There is a also a separate charge to climb the tower. This is a quite a tough climb with lots of steps and fairly narrow. However the views from the top are amazing and you see the clock and bells as well so would recommend it if you are fit.

There is a lot to see in the actual cathedral and it is very historic and beautiful building.

It can get very busy so probably best to visit early rather than the middle of the day

The queue for security/bag check is very long at around midday but much shorter the earlier or later you go. There are a couple of different entrances with hardly any queues at the rear.

Czech,DCCKid,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"After climbing the gradient up from the Charles bridge you arrive at a small terrace in front of some steps. Turn right here and admire the palace walls architecture above you and the views across the river to Old/New Town.

When you get to the top (adorned with Christmas Market stalls during our visit) there is a very picturesque enclosed area with a green and the other side of the palace. All the time you can see the spires of St. Vitus but not how to access it. Face the castle (with the guards) and the entrance is in the LH corner next to a large map of the area to be visited.

After passing through security, the grounds are accessible for free (amazingly) and when you do exit from the tunnel, the great front of the Cathedral is at last before you. It will take plenty of time to tour the castle/cathedral grounds alone but if you want to access more internal parts of the Cathedral, there is a menu of tours with different prices.

Impressive.

Czech,Keith L,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"The cathedral is in the Prague castle complex. You don't need a ticket to walk outside or to stand just inside the doors. It is worth a ticket to look around. Good information panels throughout the building. Plenty of rich colour and quirky carvings if you can adjust the settings on your camera for low light.

Half of the building is relatively new but was built to exactly match the medieval end. There is little sign of the original building but outside there are some caged ruins. A reconstruction or information about the early original church would be a useful addition so best to read up before your visit.

Czech,John H,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"A beautiful cathedral in the centre of Prague castle, with stunning stained glass windows on all sides. It is visable from the other side of the river, as it towers over the walls of the castle. It is quite a dark building, which is very gothic looking. Parts of the inside need to be cleaned and dusted, but there is probably no time as the crowds are there every day.

There is a fee to see different parts of the castle, the inside of St. Vitus being one of them. As the heart of the castle, the jewel in the crown.

Give it a try, you will not regret it.

Czech,Peregrinus1,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"We were lucky to arrive at the moment when crowds of tourists were a little shrinked. The cathedral's amazing. The atmosphere, the statues, the stained glasses, the architecture of the church itself. There's a whole history present in the cathedral, and something beyond the history ‚Äì it's almost tangible. But there is one element we disliked ‚Äì the new (since 2018) monumental tombstone at the fore of the nave: tomb of Adalbertus, the Prague bishop who cursed the Czechs for a millennium! (Czechs have survived it, happily... although maybe not always so happy. Adalbert used to inveight against alcoholism, polygamy, marriages of priests and against selling Christians to slavery.) The cathedral is also dedicated to Adalbertus (next to st. Vitus and st. Wenceslas), though the tomb stands out like a sore thumb and feels in fact like an obstacle. Strange ambiquity. Yet, the positive impressions from the cathedral decidedly prevail.

Czech,Parviz M,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"One of the sites in Prague that we visited during our vacation was the Prague Castle. Prague Castle is a must see attraction in Prague. Since it is located up on the hills on the other side of the River Vltava, we took the tram from the Old Town to get there. We bought the 90-min tram tickets since it is very easy to walk back down hill and also see the other charming sites in Prague. I will review the Prague Castle separately; this is a review of the St. Vitus‚Äôs Cathedral Inside Prague Castle. There are different series (or circuits) of tickets to purchase to see different attractions in the castle. We purchased Circuit B tickets that covered: St. Vitus‚Äôs Cathedral, The Old Royal Palace, St. George‚Äôs Basilica, and Golden Lane with Daliborka Tower. There is a 50% discount for seniors 65 years or older with showing their passports. We also visited the Royal Gardens, which are free to visit. The St. Vitus‚Äôs Cathedral is simply grand and spectacular in every aspect. No wonder it took almost 600 years to complete it, of course, with some delays and issues. This is one of the tallest and most beautiful churches that I have seen and its Gothic style is just amazing. The structural details outside and inside the cathedral are fantastic and difficult to describe. There are many stunning statues, paintings, colorful glass windows, beautiful woodwork and metalwork of arts, and two grand organs. The arches are magnificent. This old and historical cathedral had a tremendous influence on the development of Late Gothic style structures in Central Europe, such as St. Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral in Vienna. The St. Vitus Cathedral is the largest and the most important church in Prague. Cathedral dimensions are 124 by 60 meters; the main tower is 103 meters high; front towers are 82 meters; and the arch height is 33 meters. One of the most prominent sections of the cathedral is the St. Wenceslas Chapel, which is located in the center of St. Vitus‚Äôs Cathedral. Its fascinating decoration and the unique conception of its architecture emphasize its singularity as the central point of the cathedral with the tomb of the most important Czech patron saint, St. Wenceslas. As expected, there was a huge crowd inside the cathedral and we had to walk very slowly to tour the cathedral. We spent about 90 minutes touring the cathedral and truly enjoyed it. It was simply a breathtaking site and a fascinating experience. Would definitely and highly recommend to visit this beautiful and magnificent historical cathedral in Prague. Do not miss it at any cost!

Czech,Billy007863,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"There is lots of information of what to see and do, or not what to do or see at Prague Castle. After doing some background reading, we decided against a tour and decided to just go and see it. We were glad we did as tour groups are not allowed to walk around the cathedral. All groups go and stand in a small area that is cordon off, and everyone is fighting to get a picture of the cathedral, from a distant. We on the hand walked through with our ticket, and had space to walk around take in the statues, decoration, etc. There is no information boards, they were taken out to try and get people to buy audio-guides, which are really expensive and you only get 3hrs. A walk around Prague Castle can be a whole day. There are apps that you can download, or books that tell you about the cathedral, but if you like lots of info, a audio-guide may be worth it, but look at the various options before purchasing. It is an amazing building. There is also the chapel of King Wenceslas, where there is info board about it.

It's included on Circuit A or B and is definitely the main thing to do/see in the castle area. We initially didn't feel the need to get a ticket after going in once for free but since the ticket we wanted (Circuit B) included it, we went back in a 2nd time and used our ticket to go further into the Cathedral and take more/better pictures.

I think we were in and out within 10 minutes (and that was only because we paused to sit and take in the view and to feel like we were getting our monies worth).

In our opinion, the real beauty is on the outside. The Cathedral is really really beautiful with all the dark spires against the tan bricks. Definitely worth a few photos! One section was under construction when we were there in mid-September and so had blue netting around it.

We went when they first opened, around 9am and you could just walk right in (both times). By 11am, the line was insanely long - a couple hundred people - and it just wouldn't seem worth it to me!

Czech,CamperTravel,St. Vitus Cathedral,4.0,"Magnificent church took forever to build. I believe 1000 years. So it was started with Gothic, then Bohemians (or Roman?) and ends up with Baroque roof. Look out for the third stained window on the left when you enter. It is entirely different from the rest of the windows!

There is a security check with meta detectors because the church is inside the Prague Castle. The castle is actually now used as government building, including the office of Czech president.

There are at least 2 public toilets in the area. One is next to the entrance to the church. Don‚Äôt forget to bring some coins!

Czech,tk3232,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"St.Vitus Cathedral - is the top church of the Czech people. It's where kings were crowded, royalty have their tombs, the relics of saints are venerated, and the crown jewels are kept. Located at Prague Castle Quarter (Hradcany) and even if you are not planning to visit all facilities in the Castle, this one worth to make a visit.
While it looks old, the front half is the same age as the Empire State Building. You can step into the very congested entry vestibule for a peek at the interior, but it's worth paying for a ticket Circuit B that lets you go deeper, leave some of the crowds behind, and explore. Admire the cathedral's highlight - the exquisite stained-glass window by the Art Nouveau great Alfons Mucha, which tells the entire history of Christianity in the Czech lands - from the first missionaries to modern times - with swirling figures, vibrant colors, and powerful symbolism.
I compared for myself which cathedral is more magnificent this one or Notre Dame in Paris, and I came to the conclusion that they are equivalent in grandeur, beauty and significance.
Cathedral open daily 9 am - 17 pm, Sunday 12 noon - 17 pm (closed Sunday mornings year-round for Mass). Don't miss it.

Saying it's crowded may seem silly as it's one of the top tourists locations, but I need to mention that. Tickets are overpriced in my opinion. And as per tourists themselves, well... I know it's a tourist spot, but it's also (if not mainly) a place of worship for Catholics, so I would have expected people to respect that",Oct 2019
Czech,let's travel now,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"We took a tour with a guide that cost ¬£31 and this included a 3 hour tour and access into 3 parts of the castle, one of which was the cathedral. To enter each part of the castle costs about ¬£10 per section so we had a good deal.

The cathedral was built in a gothic style and was a roman catholic cathedral. There are tombstones in the crypt where Charles and his 4 wives are buried underground and the glass for the stained glass windows came from Germany which is surprising.

The cathedral was finally finished in 1929

No weddings are held here even though the cathedral can hold 1000's of people.

This is such a beautiful site not only from the outside but the inside too. There is a solid silver burial area inside which yiy should definitely see.

Unfortunately, to enter to the cathedral is better doing it as soon as it opens its doors in order to avoid the huuuuge lines, we got there by 10 am and the lines at the end of May were extremely long that even it was going around almost the whole cathedral and people were waiting hours just to enter.

We decided not to enter to use that time visiting other places instead but we felt bad for not being able to see that beauty from inside.

TIP: Arrive as soon as it opens.

Czech,Stendel,St. Vitus Cathedral,4.0,This beautiful church is in Prague Castles complex. We climbed to the top and we were rewarded with stunning views of Prague.

Well worth a visit wether you are spiritual or not.,Sep 2019

Czech,Ru & Fe,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"My husband and I visited Prague in January 2019. We prefer taking mini city breaks during the colder months so January was perfect as it was cold and snowy and we absolutely loved it!

One of the best sights we saw was the St. Vitus Cathedral. This cathedral was absolutely stunning and heavily guarded and protected (perhaps due to the crown jewels that are kept in the castle). The architecture was breathtaking! We didn‚Äôt bother taking any tours but instead visited it on our own which was better for us as we could spend however long we wanted there ‚Äì which by the way wasn‚Äôt too long. The cathedral is situated near Prague castle which is also a must see. The best time to visit is before it gets dark as I do believe they close off the areas. There are several gift shops nearby which we used to warm ourselves up as the temperature must have been in the minus figures! The inside was equally as stunning as the outside. By far one of the most beautiful cathedrals I have seen in my life.

Overall I would definitely recommend visiting the St. Vitus Cathedral if you are taking a trip down to Prague, as it is a beautiful and breathtaking landmark.

Lots of interesting architecture and plenty of great vantage points for viewing the rest of the city. St. Vitus is a masterpiece to behold up close. One can't help but admire when looking up at it's beautiful Neo Gothic facade from ground level. Be sure to look for the strange little gargoyles all over the place....they're like Easter eggs. There are facilities available and a pay toilet at the front entrance of St. Vitus just to the right. There's also a small cafe behind the church. Easiest way to reach the castle is tram 22 from St. Nicholas church at Malostransk√© n√°mƒõst√≠. Jump off at Pra≈æsk√Ω hrad. A must see for any visitor to Prague!

Czech,petergoode2,St. Vitus Cathedral,5.0,"There are already thousands of reviews here at TA attesting to the magnificence of this cathedral...so we are adding another five star rating.

When we arrived around 10:30 a.m. with our guide there not surprisingly was quite a line, but it moved quickly. It was a madhouse in the area one could visit for free, but definitely was worth having the ticket to allow touring of the full interior.

There is so much history here, our guide was very helpful in putting in perspective. The glass windows, of course not original, were nevertheless amazing, so much detail. I do not recall if an audio guide was available for purchase, but one's appreciation for what one sees definitely requires either a Rick Steves guidebook or something similar.

There was a WC just to the right of the entrance, 10 Kr exact change as others have mentioned, and of course, be prepared for another line.

The exterior of the church was amazing from the front (need wide angle lens), and even more so, from the courtyard to the right.

A definite do-not-miss if visiting Prague.

This is probably one of the most biggest ones with height of ceiling making it so grand.

It towers the entire skyline of Prague and Prague Castle.
The stained windows with the colours are beautiful and breathtaking.
We found its Gothic exterior architecture very similar to Nodre Dame in France.
The size is huge and looks so so pretty.
I personally am biased towards Gothic Architecture so I loved it.

It has an entrance fee which is covered in the Circuits.
You can park your buggy near the entrance and take it back again while going out of th exit door which is the other side.

It can get very crowded in peak seasons.

This is a popular attraction so you have to compete with large tour groups but if you are patient and have lots if time you can wait and get your own good views and photos.

It is possible to access the back of the cathedral as the turnstiles are further down however it does get really busy and you can't see much without a ticket. We bought the combined ticket B and found this the most cost effective way to get into the key parts of the complex.

My only criticism is that all the pews were roped off at open times so that it wasn't really possible to sit quietly and absorb the atmosphere or pray which is a shame in an iconic cathedral such as this.

You just stand there and marvel at the decor and the stained glass windows with all it's great detail. A must see if you are visiting Prague and one of the main buildings on the skyline which you can see from virtually anywhere alongside the river. I suggest getting on a Hop on Hop Off bus as it is a fair hike to the castle from the old town or even better use the public transport which is an experience in itself. You have to go through a security check before you get into the castle and the cathedral so be prepared for a long wait, depending on what time you visit but it is recommended to go early as the ticket queues can be quite long as well. It can also get very busy inside the cathedral as there are so many things to see and take photos of, but no flash photography allowed and people are watching you all the time to remind you.

I have visited the U6 Science and Technology Centre with children - 8, 7 and 4 years old. The exhibition is really well done with everything described in Czech/Polish and English. What I particularly liked was the interactive nature of the whole place. In the main hall the staff was very friendly and showed us and the children how to make the most of the place. We really enjoyed it. Therefore it was very disappointing to make it to the last room where we were immediately told ""not to touch anything on the tables"". After my enquiry I was told that the reason was that the young lady had already prepared everything for the next day. It was 25 minutes until the end of the opening time. Children were really sad that they couldn't touch any of Playmobil-type toys which defeats the whole object of the interactive nature of the exhibition. The on duty manager who was already on her way out was also unsympathetic to my complaints.

It is a real shame that such a world-class exhibition is let down by some of the staff and particularly the on duty manager. They could all benefit from customer service training. The situation could also be solved by paying the personnel 15-30 mins longer so that they could tidy/arrange the toys after the paying customers have left.

All in all I would recommend to visit but there is definitely room for improvement on the human side of service!

Czech,XoanaMC,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,2.0,"The site is totally worth it! It is beautiful and you should get up to the Bolt Cafe (actually signed by Usain Bolt!). However, they do not offer guides in English during the week (only on weekends), therefore we decided to go with an audio guide. They told us to just ""listen to the tracks when the guide starts talking"" but we soon figured out that that made no sense. Then we realised we had to listen every time we saw a sign with headphones and a number, but the guide wasn't following a specific order and did not always stop by these signs, so we missed a few. We asked for our money back and they resisted a little bit at first, but ended up reimbursing us due to the fact that my mp3 player was actually missing one of the audiofiles. Basically, get the guide on the weekend or an entry pass to visit the site on your own and read all the signs. But be warned, if you don't know the first thing about blast furnaces, most of the info is going to go over your head since it is incredibly technical.

The guided tour is great because you can go inside the factory and also to the top of the tower.

Friendly and helpful staff.

I visited the area without a guided tour because, according to reviews I had read, it seems not to be the best for non Czech speakers. Some information, such as explanatory plans and diagrams in English, would make the experience even better.

However this was for extra charge and there was no other option offered. Additionally, the audio tour was not exactly in the same order as the spoken tour so it was a bit confusing at times and I had to interpret some parts for my partner.

When I enquired about the fact that we basically paid almost double for having the tour in English they just shrug their shoulders.

Also you have to pay for using the toilet which for someone with weak bladder costs a lot of money. But that‚Äôs Czech Republic for you.

On a positive note the tour was interesting and it is an amazing area to visit. I was just disappointed at how they overcharge foreigners.

Czech,HughJarres,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,4.0,"Fascinating to get up close to a bit of heavy-industrial history. Amazingly, there's no admission charge to wander around the rusting machinery and pipework of the former iron foundry. Tours are offered at Kƒç 190, but in Czech only and, as one reviewer has already noted, if that's not your lingo you're better off guiding yourself around and reading the information boards, which are also in English. We did that, then paid Kƒç 200 to be taken to the top of the Bolt Tower (built on top of the 1911 blast furnace and weirdly named after Jamaican sprinter Usain, who has connections with Ostrava): the ticket includes a Kƒç 100 voucher to spend in the caf√© up there, which is frankly an uncanny and unique experience, with spectacular views.

However, the V√≠tkovice experience could be so much better for the foreign visitor. Maybe the Czech guided tour covers this, but the wordy information boards assumed a knowledge of iron smelting and steel production that none of my party had, and we were desperate for some kind of visual explanation of how the various processes were carried out in these buildings around us. The place cries out for diagrams and illustrations, video reconstructions and historic footage, or maybe just some archive photos. And what about some living history? This iron works closed within living memory: we would love to hear from those who actually worked here telling what the experience was like. A huge missed opportunity.

The EU put money into the restoration: they should have insisted on a more imaginative explanation of this important heritage.

In conjunction one can visit City Museum, it has paintings of old city. And don't forget Train Museum, that can show some cool stuff too.

Random remarks:

It can be pretty busy during the weekend, so you should book your trip.
I've seen several hotels has direct trips here, it can be quite comfortable.
It is not center of the city, so you have to take a tram here. Taxi is also a good option, but not all taxies has a terminal, you should carry some cash with you.

- there are info boards in English all around the areal
- if you want to fo guided tour, you can hire MP3 player with English text for 100CZK
- however, from our experience, it¬¥s not really worth it. The guided tours, in general, feel a bit rush and the tour normally talks about something else anyway. Good idea (although we didn¬¥t do it) could be to pay only for the Bolt Tour and then do the rest by yourself as the info boards give you all te info you need anyway.

You can spend a day there without problem. I recommend to take a guided to tour where they will explain you all history and process of production of iron. And it is interesting. Do not forget to visit Bolt tower and walk through surrounding areas,Nov 2016
Czech,donna131975,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,5.0,"What a great place to visit. During the summer they hold the colours of Ostrava festival here and host up to 70,000 people and turn the place into wine bars, nightclubs and a party venue. When we visited we walked around the site looking at the bolt tower and various buildings they have turned into new businesses. There is a art gallery, tattooist and centre for wall climbing enthusiasts. It really is an interesting place and we wish we could have stayed longer. Fascinating and with the regeneration project in Ostrava it has plenty of potential. Free parking and a nearby science museum makes it a worthwhile visit for all the family.",Nov 2016
Czech,LyssaIL,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,2.0,"The biggest problem with this place is the poor communication. I was planning to visit with my husband and two children, ages 4 and 1. I emailed and called before I came to try to find out if children were allowed on the tour, etc. I was told my husband would have to wear the 1 year old in a sling, but we could do the tour. When we arrived, the reception people would not sell me tickets to the tour because of the young children. If that is the policy, fine, but I was frustrated because I had emailed and called in advance and was not given this information.

This was just the start of the communication issues. We found the children's museum in the Science Museum, which was amazing for kids, and my husband said he could stay with the kids while I went on the tour. I then had more communication issues and was ultimately sold a ticket for tour, which no one told me was only in Czech. I had to go back as the tour was starting to buy an English audioguide. Again, I didn't mind paying for the audioguide, but why didn't they tell me this when I bought the tickets? I clearly didn't speak Czech. Other people also commented that the service was rude, etc. This wasn't even all of the problems I had with the communication/service, it's just too much to go into.

The actual tour was okay. I was with the guide speaking in Czech. At each stop she would speak for 10-20 minutes while the English audioguide was 1-2 minutes long, so I missed a lot of information. Luckily someone else on my tour spoke English and was able to translate some information for me.

I probably would not go to the blast furnace or Bolt Tower again and couldn't really recommend it for families or people who don't speak Czech. However, if you're just looking for something for the kids, the children's museum on the property is great. I just don't know if tourists would really go this far out of their way for a children's museum.

Also, the cafe in the Bolt Tower only serves drinks and pastries. I thought maybe they served lunch food, but they don't. This wasn't really clear from the website. Plus, if you just want to go up to the Bolt Tower Cafe without the tour, you need reservations. People in front of me were turned away because they didn't have reservations.

Czech,Hema G,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,5.0,"During my short trip to Ostrava, we managed to visit the Bolt tower in Dolni Vitkovice. It is all that and more than what you would read online about this place. You can call up for reservations or get there and give a call to the number provided at the entrance. This is the only way to get to the cafe as the ride to top of the tower is via secured entry.

The staff are simply awesome and their passion for work at Bolt Tower/ Cafe shows up in their smile. When you reach the cafe, you still have a couple of stories to reach the top of the tower. One can choose to take the platform or lift to get there. And this is where you can see the breath taking 360 degree view of the city. Given the concept of the platform winding up like the screw threads around the tower, it is an ultra large panoramic view, I fail to recall seeing anything similar.

I was there around the sunset and felt it was one of the best time of the day to be there and when we left it was getting dark and could see the tower glow with lights in the dark sky.

I enquired about the tower being open in winter and I was told that unless there is too much snow that the lifts cannot be operated, they do not close and this has not happened since it opened.

I was also told by the staff that Dolni Vitkovice is now the 2nd most visited attraction in Czech. The cafe is open from 10 AM to 10 PM. I would call the experience as value for money.

The other part of Dolni Vitkowice has guided tours, but unfortunately within our short trip duration we were not able to organise a English tour.

We also visited the Bolt tower from which we had a great view of the entire city. My Czech colleagues thought however that the prices in the tower cafeteria is somewhat of a ripoff.

Czech,lsmkw,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,5.0,"DOV (as it calls itself around here) is amazing in scope. All the structures are gigantic and of another time and place in the world's history of industrialization. There are signs that explain what is going on in 3 languages (including English), but they were way beyond me - i still don't know how steel is actually made.
The DOV is special, and on the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list, because the DOV is the site of a coal mine, coke (before drugs and soda) production and steel production. Along with other coal mines and the slag heaps in Ostrava (see separate reviews) it is uncommon if not unique in what it offers.
Tours are only in Czech, except by special arrangement. They can be in English for 10 or more, and cost about $172 (USD) - not bad for 10, but too much for just me. I wandered on my own. An audio guide would have been really helpful, one that I could listen to while touring with a Czech guided group (too many dangerous areas to go into inside spaces alone). I was told by Czechs in other agencies they don't offer English audio because they know they are are so wonderful that they don't need to make concessions. Whatever the reason, I wish joining a tour would have been possible.
Bolt tower and cafe brings guests 71 meters up, built over a blast furnace (or something) and gives an amazing view of the city and surrounding area. It costs 200 (about $9 USD) and includes a 100 credit for a snack/beverage in the cafe. The cafe is open until 10 pm. To get up to the top you need to go to the info place nearby, but if it's after 4 it's closed. Then there is a number to call and someone will come down and get you. My phone wouldn't work, but a helpful Czech man called for us. (People are so nice here!)
There is also a neat gift shop, with tee shirts, earrings (circles with DOV on written on them) ($4), pencils, plastic hard hats, nicer jewelry and more.
There is also a hands on children's (and adults) science museum and another structure has been converted into a performance hall. These are mixed benefits in that these spaces raise revenue and provide useful and interesting spaces, but they alter the original structures, which detracts from what they once were. Someone at one of the mines said that the DOV is unlikely to become a World Heritage Site because too much has been changed.
If you come to Ostrava, this is what you should see first. Then the mines and slag heap, for the full experience. The DOV makes Ostrava special and offers an experience with an industrial past not easily found elsewhere.

The physical plant is quite interesting. It should be one of the most interesting locations to visit given the history. It was interesting comparing this with the Salt Mine Tour in Krakow which is probably too smooth and has lost all of the grittiness which DOV still has.

You are able to walk around most of the facility without a guide. Some parts require a guide. You really get a sense of the size and scale of the work performed. It was also nice being able to walk around with limited people and no lines.

They do have about 30 signs when you walk around the facility on your own. We found the signs a bit too technical and weren't properly engaging.

We were there one of the days they were setting up for Colours which is an annual concert for 30,000 people in Ostrave . This took away from our experience as they were installing many concert related signs and structures.

For a start you can admire the art of steel workers who made all those rusty pipes, yet in the past it was a proud industrial area which brought subsistence to hundreds of people. There are 3 museums you can visit. The first is a tour of the Hlubina mine, coking plant, and the blast furnaces together with an elevator to the highest point of the furnace no.1 with a newly built upper extension where is coffee shop, a club and a viewing terrace at 71m above the ground (opens 1st May). The second is U6 or ""small"" science and technology centre which is hosted by a former energy logger with many exhibits connected with the coal mining and steel working history of Ostrava together with other highlights of the industrial revolution such as submarine, steam engine, cars, busses and much more. The third museum is a newly opened (in October 2014) ""big"" Science and Technology center. There are also many interactive exhibits and you can easily spend there more than three hours.

Czech,Andrea B,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,5.0,"This place is best visited before nightfall, so that you can see it in both the light of day and the yellow-orange lights from the streets and its old, rusty lamps that hang above you at tens of meters in the air.

This place is so amazing as a relic of intense industrialism. Enormous, red-black, all rusty and impressive through its sheer massiveness, it's the perfect place for cultural events for the youth, such as the Majales festival.

I had the chance to visit the working part of Vitkovice too, on the 1st of May, as you can too. Inside, it's even more unusual; when you see the huge machines working, pouring, beating the steel, cutting it from enormous blocks. It's a once in a lifetime experience (unless you get to work in that factory, which is not that cool - literally).

Czech,hoskovcova,Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice,4.0,"If you are bored by all the castles and old city buildings, this is something very different. Tons of iron and the special smell of this place let you understand, what industry is. This is underlined by the noisy pipe factory next to the area and the still functioning metal production on the horizont. The visit of the blast furnace takes around 2 hours and you have to walk many steps, but I think, there is an elevator available. The people, who take you around are former workers of this place. Next to the Hlubina mine, coking plant, blast furnaces and the other technological facilities of metallurgical basic industry and energetics you find a technical park for children, called U6. Everything is interactive - children can try everything. It is more interesting for older children from 10 and higher - if they understand a bit about physics, electricity, sound and so on, they profit more. We did spend about 2,5 hours in the U6 area. I can recomend this place to everybody, who was or still is attracted by Jules Verne.

Czech,Guilherme Arashiro,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"The castle is really impressive and worth visiting simply for its stunning views and scenery. However, the tours are also totally worth checking out!

The first tour we did was for the baroque theatre. The tour is really well-structured, and our tour guide was able to show her knowledge and explain everything really well.

The second one we did was the 'basic 1' tour of the castle. The tour on itself is already worth paying for, as you explore amazing parts of the castle filled with history and great views, especially the masquerade hall. However, what made it incredible and memorable for us was our incredible tour guide, Jan. He explained every bit of history from Cesky Krumlov with great enthusiasm, showcasing his great knowledge about the history of the castle and surrounding areas. Jan is a funny and interactive guide, making the experience more of an immersive talk rather than a simple monologue. If you ever take an English tour of the castle, be sure to ask for Jan as your guide!

The Baroque gardens are impressive, but the theatre is one of the best preserved theatres of its type in the world.

Czech,msdAmerinParis,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"Both the town and in particular this castle are not to be missed if visiting the C√©ech Republic.
Built on a hill (not at all handicapped friendly!) the houses seem to not have changed in a century, and the castle is stupendous with its panaramic views and furnished rooms.
Unfortunately the ticket-selling people are as unhelpful as possible if you don't speak Czeck. And all visits are necessarily accompanied by a guide. Tickets are timed, and there are few visits in English, a few more in German and of course in plenty in Czech. If you are short in time and accept to follow a visit in a language you don't speak, they have texts they can hand out should you inform your guide of your difficulty.

Normally you cannot take photos, but some guides are more lenient than others.
Make sure you get tickets for the 3 most important visits: Tour1, Tour 2 & the theatre,
each of which lasts about an hour. Tour 1 includes the earliest state rooms; Tour 2 is 19th century; and the Theatre is the only still working Baroque theatre in the world - a true gem.
For the anecdote, I hadn't realized there were two tours. After following Tour 1 & the theatre, it was mid afternoon & I went to get a ticket for Tour 2 which I had specifically stated in English & in Szeck (""dve""). As I went to the door for the tour, I realized the ticket person had given me a ticket for Tour 1. When I went back to correct the error, she told me there were no more tickets in English for Tour 2 & only in Czech; that's the reason she gave me tour 1 again. I told here I'd already done the tour, and she agitatedly changed my ticket.
Also, don't miss the bears - rather than filling the protective moat with water, this castle has a moat filled with bears. And when a bear dies, the hides are made into rugs, which you will see in the various rooms.

Every building in this village was built before the end of the 17th century, including the massive castle. This is very rare to find something that has not been damaged by war or fire for so many centuries. The residents clearly take great care of their homes and structures to keep them in their original form. There are many quaint restaurants and shops aligning the river that acts like a natural moat. The local cuisine was delicious and the people were pleasant (we went during the Christmas Market which gave us an opportunity to talk with many locals). What a terrific day visiting here!

It is abt 3 hours to go there if you are coming from Vienna and 2 1/2 if coming from Prague. It definitely is a must see because there are so many places for good photo ops specially on a clear sunny day.

Castle and its long series of courtyards are very interesting, but my favorite point is Cloak Bridge - a triple decker, statue line, covered bridge spanning a vast gorge and connecting the castle firmly with the gardens that sprawl behind it. Enjoy the views - but believe it or not, even better ones are coming up. If you have enough time Baroque Theater (or Teatro del Castello as shown topic on TA) and Ballroom of the Rosenbergs worth to see by reserved tour. Castle ground always open and even worth visit at night time when this complex illuminated and gives more mysterious impression.
Ridiculous but looks like this enchanting delightful Castle and magic Old Town feel lost in a time warp.

Czech,Jesslyn C,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,Took a day trip from Prague to this old town as there are so many photos & bloggers reviews about it. It‚Äôs really worth a visit although it‚Äôs a 3hours ride from Prague. CK castle of course is the no 1 attraction if you want to have a panoramic view of the whole town. You can take a leisure walk around the castle compound where each & every corner gives you different view of the Old Town. Take a short climb to the top of the tower of course is the only way to have a panoramic view of the scenery.It‚Äôs definitely a wonderful place to visit !,Oct 2019
Czech,vonderluster,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We were stunned by the whole estate when we first arrive at Cesky Krumlov and lucky enough to catch the sunset at the balcony area. We noticed that the castle main gate doesn‚Äôt close off so we came back at dawn to watch the sunrise. Absolutely breathtaking and wouldn‚Äôt have done it the other way! 100% recommended for early risers who live in town.
In the afternoon, we came back to join the guided tour for Route one, which brings you to the inner parts of the castle. Very detailed tour with stunning structures, including the church and the masquerade ballroom. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to take any pictures during the tour. We ended our visit with the garden, which is not a Must-visit if time is press.
As per any key tourist sites, there are a lot of tourists here throughout the day. Recommend to come here during the early hours or late (after the ticket offices have closed at 5PM) to get a more personal take on this place.

Czech,Ayub Q,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We did much of our viewing in the lovely medieval town of Cesky Krumlov walking. The castle was very close to our hotel, but involved a daunting uphill walk which we attempted finally.
The castle dates back to 1240, built by the Witigonen family, the main branch of the powerful Rosenberg family. The baroque renovations and additions were done much later, in the 17th century. It is s national heritage site, a UNESCO world heritage site and a popular tourist attraction. It is a sprawling structure, with many courtyards and lovely gardens and a panoramic view of the town from the top.
The Cesky Krumlov Baroque theatre, situated in the Vth castle courtyard, is said to be one of the world‚Äôs most completely preserved baroque theatres, with its original theatre building, auditorium, orchestra pit, stage, stage technology, machinery, stage curtains etc.
Well worth a visit.

We decided to buy the next tour in Czech to at least be able to see the castle, which started at 11:00 am and was the pricer tour of the Theatre Castle. By the time we speed-walked through the hoards of tourists and made it to the tour gathering spot it was 11:02 and the tour had already started and we were not allowed to join. We asked why they sold us the tickets if they were this strict with the timing and knew it was a long walk to the starting point from the ticket office but they just kept saying it was impossible to join two minutes in. We returned to the ticket counter and after explaining the situation they begrudgingly gave us tickets to a cheaper tour route also in Czech and didn‚Äôt refund us the difference. Prepare for poor service, probably better to join with the pricer external tour guides!

Czech,msb444,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We availed of 3 guided tours in the castle- 1, 2 and the Baroque theater. You can read about each ticket & what it includes in their website. You can't enter any of these places without a guide. Pricey but does not disappoint. In my opinion you get your money's worth compared to the Prague Castle.
The tours have strict hours & number of people they will allow at a time. You must be at the meeting point at the exact hour as the doors are only opened by the guide and upon entry, locked immediately. And the same SOP is applied to all the rooms you walk through. So if you are late, you will not be able to get in at all.
The rooms are very well preserved. You cannot take any pictures of the interiors. The experience is like you are truly walking in another era. There is so much to see. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to see the gardens and our budget limited us to just 3 museums. I would be willing to return another day to see the ones I missed.

Most of the time you're just seated, major part is devoted to viewing a movie. The guide tries to be funny but his sense of humour is questionable.

There are two tour routes for the castle: we did Tour 1 that ended in a fantastically decorated theatre/music room with its walls full of murals of performers who once played to audiences in the Castle. There two further theatres that are well worth visiting. There is the amazing Baroque theatre ‚Äì one of only two in all of Europe - for which you need to buy an admission ticket. The other is a 1960‚Äôs outdoor rotating theatre that is sited in the Castle Gardens: there‚Äôs no charge to enter the gardens and view this theatre ‚Äì just keep walking up through the castle and then the steep drive beyond.

Czech,Kiwiana,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"Do yourself a favour, forget the stupidly busy and probably full Parking 1 & 2 which are right at the main entrance to this over-popular attraction, and instead go the little-used P4.

It feels like a world away from the tourist-bus-chaos out on the main road, its worth it just for the drive alone. In fact, consider going to Pilzen instead of Cesky Krumlov: much easier access to the old city centre, and more impressive buildings. Accommodation also a lot cheaper, we had a good apartment which looked out right over the square.

The Castle claim that it is one of the two best most fully preserved baroque theatres in existence, with a full complement of costumes, props, decor and manuscripts of the period. The guided tour of 40 minutes was presented by a rather patronising guide. We got to see the inside of the auditorium and the stage. Then we were shown a video of about 20 mins of exerpts from baroque operas that were staged there. After that 3 of us had the 'priviledge' to create stage effects with three copies of machines that were used during the baroque era. We were shown what the machinery below the stage looked like. There was not a single stage costume or prop to be seen anywhere. We could not see the wings or anything else backstage. Surely they can put a few costumes and props on display for tourists who pay 15 euro per ticket? Very disappointing. It was an absolute waste of money. A tourist trap in the extreme. Rather use that money for a good meal at one of the quaint little restaurants.

Czech,Rebecca B,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"The castle grounds are free to wander around in, but to enter you must join a tour. There are several options. I went on Castle Tour 1 and enjoyed it much more than any of the palaces I visited in Vienna! The exhibits were just much more interesting and well put-together than any other royal residence I‚Äôve toured. The rooms were also lovely.

The management could do a better job of promoting the side exhibits such as the Smithery, which is hidden behind the main buildings and whose employees were sitting around looking bored because no visitors were there.

I also paid to enter the museum and climb the tower (it‚Äôs a combo ticket that cannot be separated, ie. you cannot pay just to climb the tower). The museum is self-guided and I felt having gone on Castle Tour 1 gave me a good background for the exhibits. The view from the tower is somewhat different from the free parts of the castle, so I‚Äôd say it was worth paying for (but you‚Äôre not missing out if you skip it; I just happen to enjoy landscape photography).

Other reviewers here complain about Chinese tour groups, but there are just as many Spanish and German groups, as well as cruise ship tours. I went mid-week in June and it was actually fine; it didn‚Äôt feel as crowded as Prague on a weekend.

I took the train and stayed overnight. I found the village too small and too boring to be worth a night‚Äôs stay (it is pretty much dead at night, so unless you are looking for quiet relaxation, just make a long day trip).

Overall fantastic, just docked a star because visitor offerings could be fine-tuned (odd tour combinations; lack of promotion of available attractions).

Thousands (exaggeration) of tourists in the castle made for a difficult day. Founded in the mid-1300s by Lords of Krumlov passed to the Rosenbergs and then the Hapsburgs in the 1500s. Some additions were made at that time. It is currently a UNESCO site and under the ownership of the government. Our guide provided a most interesting views of life under communist rule (up to 1989!). The castles 40 building are part of a cute town with shops and restaurants. Moldavite rock is a speciality of the jewelry stores (meteorite). The ""bear moat"" is an unusual feature of the castle - a live bear in the moat (waiting for a mate soon!!)

Czech,Evan T,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"The castle and town are remarkable and picturesque, but crowds can spoil the experience between 10 am to 5 pm. We stayed overnight, and it was entirely worth the time.

First, you can walk through the castle area and viewpoints at night, after the tours are done, and enjoy the view of the town nestled in the arc of the river. At night or in early morning the town is quiet, and good for strolling or photos. We even saw a bear out at the castle in the morning.

The baroque theater tour at the castle is great, much cooler than I had expected. Seeing it on a video is interesting, but the 3-D effect of being there in the dim lighting is really something. They don‚Äôt actually demonstrate any of the historic scenery or effects, but you get to look at the ingenious way it was done. We arrived to town around lunchtime, and were able to get onto the last English tour that day (seems like the last tours are less crowded).

We also did the Tour 1 and Tower Museum tour (separate from other castle tours). Climb the tower early or late in the day, or you‚Äôll get stuck in the tourist traffic jams on the narrow stairs.

At the top of the castle area there is a beautiful and peaceful garden area, very nice to enjoy.

What is really remarkable is that this castle complex survived from gothic period through post-WW2; it is really something, and well worth making Cesky Krumlov more than a day trip on the side.

To summarize: storybook views, winding lanes, historic romantic castle, cool history, wear good walking shoes!

Czech,John R,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,This is a wonderful town a couple of hours south of Prague and well worth the visit. We had a car so we were able to spend the night but they have many day tour options available from Prague which would give you plenty of time to see the city and the castle there and get a feel for this medieval town. There is lots of art scattered around and many interesting shops. Definitely worth a day if you have the time.,May 2019
Czech,Mmm M,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"As would be expected of an old city, the streets are all cobblestone and the walk to the castle is uphill. I observed several tourists with walking sticks.

We went there twice over 2 days but could not see the bears that are reputed to occupy the dry moat in front of the castle.",Jun 2019
Czech,abw,Cesky Krumlov Castle,1.0,"After a wonderful guided tour of the castle and town square, we were left to browse in the multiple quirky shops and museums in the quaint town of Cesky Krumlov. When we entered the ""Museum of Commerce"" we thought it was charming until we entered the 3rd room where they prominently display 3 framed blackface racist ads - the kind where a small blackfaced child is turned white by some brand of soap. We decided to immediately not support this place and leave. What do we see on the way out? You can buy a small tin copy of these blackface ads for only 400 Czech krona. I guess UNESCO heritage organization does not provide guideline for inclusion. Either that or the folks of Cesky Krumlov don't care who they offend.

Czech,Jamie,Cesky Krumlov Castle,2.0,"There is no doubt that the Cesky Krumlov castle is beautiful. The tour of its rich history was very informative and well-organised. However, it is a shame that a certain tour guide soured the experience for us, who are East Asian university students. Here‚Äôs how:

1) The guide was particularly harsh to other Asian tourists in the guided group tour - when an Asian family was talking to each other quietly during the explanation, he bluntly demanded they keep quiet, but did not do the same when the Caucasian tourists talked.
2) In addition, he made a sarcastic and derogatory comment when an Asian tourist, who clearly did not to understand English very well, tried to take a photo with his camera. The guide did warn everyone in the beginning not to take photos, but the nuance with which he addressed the tourist was very condescending.
3) Most important of all, the guide deliberately avoided eye contact with all the Asian tourists in the group throughout the tour, only addressing the Caucasian tourists during his explanations. In the end, he only thanked the Caucasian tourists whilst remaining unresponsive when the Asian tourists thanked him for the tour.

I understand that tourists are not always pleasant to deal with, but it is unfair that people receive this kind of treatment even after paying for a service. The rudeness and discrimination that we experienced in the tour makes me think twice about recommending this attraction to other tourists, especially those of Asian origin.

I read that it is a city tradition, but wildlife protection should be a far greater concern than any tradition.

It was very sad to see the bears trapped under these conditions, with tourists throwing things up there, it was a shame to see this scene in the Cesky Krumlov.

Please take these bears to an animal protection reserve.

Tourists visit the city to see the architecture and the history, not wild animals trapped.

I hope to one day return to the city and not see more wildlife trapped, but only the beautiful Cesky Krumlov.

The panoramic view of the old town below with the river running by was iconic and beyond the wow factor.
We booked a car and a driver/guide from Prague to get there. It took us 3 hours to arrive because the traffic was very congested when leaving the city. The day was wet and windy which was a blessing because upon arrival, there were not many tour groups or tourists. We were able to enjoyed our walk. Suggestion is to arrive before noon, tour the castle, stop at all the view points to take photos, then walk the historical old town afterwards. This may be the way to minimize running into large crowd. Do wear good sturdy shoes. The cobble stones are not friendly to the feet.

Firstly, I thought it was pricey compared to all the other tours but I‚Äôm glad I did it as it was astounding. When your eyes adjust to the dim lighting, you see the rather large ornate stage in front of you in all its glory. It looks surreal. The stage itself is quite deep and large and the settings are so elaborate. The auditorium has the original wooden seats which you sit on and watch a 15 minute video on how the stage props work. It was interesting to watch and made you appreciate the beauty in front of you more. You were surrounded by the upper balconies where nobility would sit and looking up, the ceiling was elaborately painted as were the walls. It truly was spectacular and you could imagine what it must have felt like watching a show. It was even more astonishing that what was there was all original. We got to hear how some sound effects were made with props and we went under the stage to see the mechanisms used to change the props. That was interesting too. We didn‚Äôt get to go on the stage itself nor up in the balconies, which I would have liked to do, given the expense of the ticket. Nor were there any costumes or other paraphernalia on display.

The view of the city and the river from the ramparts is superb, the gardens are fine but not very well kept. So far so good. But the guided tour to visit inside the castle is not worth the money you pay, as you‚Äôll only see dull rooms. The English groups are big and the guide‚Äôs strong accent make difficult to understand the explanations. Moreover, the ticket does not include the visit to the theater, the tower or the museum, for which you have to pay extra tickets, and neither of them is worth the money you pay for. It‚Äôs is certainly a very profitable industry and expensive to your pocket, with low value. Foreigners pay more expensive than Czechs. That is a disrespect and yet another typical display of Czech‚Äôs disregard for visitors, which are bringing them the hen that lays the golden eggs. The appalling vision of the beer in the moat, which has nothing to do with the castle but serves to entertain children, shows a good deal of animal cruelty. The ticketing systems is very confusing, but don‚Äôt ask questions to the grumpy woman at the ticket office, the rudest person I ever met. Putting all together, I grade it a C-.

Our guide said the removal has been postponed at least once and they are trying to negotiate keeping it, so hopefully it will work out, but in case it is removed see it while you can if you are in Krumlov or nearby.

The most important thing to remember is that the interior of the castle is closed during the winter and early spring because it is not heated. We were enchanted by the grounds and while I wish we had seen inside we did not feel like we missed too much, but keep this in mind when planning.

Czech,Sailorsgirl,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We first visited Cesky Krumlov on our first trip to Europe in 2006 on a tour out of Prague. At that time we had a full tour with the inside of the castle and a little time to spend in the town. This time while staying a couple of nights in Ceske Budejovice, we decided to drive back to Krumlov. It's a short drive, under 30 minutes from Budejovic

It being Good Friday and the Czechs having a long Easter weekend, the town quickly filled up. The weather was beautiful and the Castle looked the same as it did in 2006, so it is well maintained. There is ample paid parking in front of the entrance to the city if you get there early. As we were leaving cars were circling the lot searching for a place to park.

Walk over the bridge, through the gate and into the city. Work your way through all the little shops and eateries until you get to the large square and the entrance to the castle. Just follow the crowd or purchase tickets to see the inside of the castle or the tower. It's quite a climb to the top and the streets are all cobblestone, so wear comfortable shoes. It's well worth seeing the inside, but if you don't have time or don't want to spend the money, you can stroll the courtyards and walk the high balcony to get great pictures of the city and the Vltava River below. Either way, it's a great way to spend a day in the CZ. Oh, and the big brown bear has been reinstated in his den to continue guarding the castle. Hundreds of years ago, a bear was always kept there, but there wasn't one there in 2006. We felt a little sorry for him because of all the noisy tourists but he seemed happy munching on his vegetable lunch. Europeans bring their dogs everywhere, so don't be surprised by all the canines who also enjoy at day at the castle!

Our tour guide was very knowledgable and I liked that he carried a set of old keys that he had to use to lock and unlock the doors to many of the rooms on the tour route. It made us feel as if we were being given special entry into the private lives of the former occupants. Tours are not conducted on Mondays but check the schedule and times online if you're interested in doing all 3 guided tours.

To walk around the castle grounds and gardens are free but if you want to go up the tower you have to pay a separate entrance fee for the tower AND the gallery. Unfortunately there is no separate ticket for those who only want to climb the tower.

Sad to say that they still keep bears in the moat/pit outside of the castle walls. When we visited there was only 1 bear (there are supposed to be 3--2 females and a male and the male had just died 3 weeks prior to our visit) I'm told that they're hoping to get 2 more bears shortly. In this day and age I didn't see the point of having bears kept in captivity just for the sake of authenticity.

Czech,1234texas,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"Geography plays a big role in just about everything, but here it was critical. Invading armies simply passed by the city because it is so well ""hidden"" from view. In this case, the armies from the north simply passed by the city and never attacked the it or the castle. We are the beneficiaries of that fortunate poor navigation, mistake or miscalculation! Virtually no damage was ever done to the area--other than time. Some of the old pictures show the ravages of time that have been corrected.

This is one incredible complex that is of the likes of which we have never seen previously. The size of the castle and the height of the walls is most impressive--it dominates the entire city because it is built on top of a ridge line. The city is a time capsule that is wrapped around the castle. The river running through the city is beautiful and the restoration work has been incredible. You really feel as if your are stepping back into time.

Although we were not able to get inside any of the castle--you have to be here at the ""right"" time & day--we were able to walk up the rather steep slopes (paved cobblestone or wood) with relative ease if you are willing to take a break or two (which you will do because the photo opportunities are everywhere). However, I did the climb up to the gardens (highest point of the castle) to determine if they were worth the climb for my wife--they were not. The gardens are very bland and have little or no interest for any serious gardener--there are absolutely no ideas to steal herel

The walk up and through the castle ""road"" gives you and opportunity to see some very nice stone work and architectural detail. The construction is massive and the engineering knowledge had to be impressive. The effort to haul that much stone up the mountainside had to be massive--in terms of time and manpower. There is a lot of history here, but the beauty of the city and the wonderful views from the open areas are the real show. The river from above is really wonderful--as are the city buildings (it looks like a gigantic sculpture)!

This town and castle have been ""discovered"" by the tour industry--even off season there is a mob here. We understand that it is ""10 times worse"" during high season. New rules are going to be imposed to limit the tour busses and visiting times-as well as parking. A word of warning based on what we heard from a very savvy guide: If you are planning to visit, make certain all the details of your visit are confirmed in advance--do not leave this one to chance! Look for reputable tour guides and providers that have been vetted.

As noted in other reviews, MAKE CERTAIN YOU HAVE LOCAL CURRENCY FOR ANY BATHROOM VISITS--other than in restaurants or bars. Also, this use of credit cards is not ubiquitous here-you are not in Kansas anymore! This is a beautiful trip from start to finish. The drive here is particularly beautiful, and you get to see some of the communist history and boundary checkpoints. This is a good trip!

Food options and lodging is rather limited since this is a small town. However, Ceske Budajovice and Linz (Austria) is nearby.
Recommended for DAY TRIP, even though 1 night seems like a good idea as well.

I was there in end-November 2018. The weather was around 5¬∞C and it had snowed the previous night. The snow on the roofs of the buildings made the place pretty good for photos. Please do visit the panorama photo spots as well!

I wasn't prepared to learn that beautiful bears were being kept in the castle moat - stone and concrete and I didn't see anything for their stimulation. Thankfully I didn't see them - but just knowing that's where they spend their days really upset me. They shouldn't be there and I hope that they're not there to attract tourist dollars. Hence my 'average' review,Dec 2018
Czech,Cathy S,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"I visited the Krumlov castle in February. Some parts are closed in winter but the museum and tower were open. The tower was a little creepy to me, and I was shocked to see a skeleton lying on the dungeon floor! I'm not sure if it was real but it definitely added to the creepiness! The stairs are very steep. The museum is worth a visit. It has a lot of history and information, as well as the
remains of a saint enclosed in a glass box for your viewing pleasure. There is also gift shop and a small cafe inside. The cost for the ticket was about $6.50. How I got there: I took a 3-hour bus ride (RegioJet) from Prague. The cost was about $20 roundtrip.You do not need a guided tour.

Czech,DanielD525,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We only visited for the day, so we made the decision to skip the castle but went ahead with the tower so that we'd have enough time to stroll around and engage within the town itself. Admission to the tower was 100 czk for both of us, and even if it was x4 more expensive, then you'll still not find better views whilst in the whole of Czech Rep. I know its a statement, but I wouldn't be making it if I didn't believe it.
Climbing the tower is narrow, dark, bricked and steep with lots of other tourists going up or coming down, so take your time as there are quite a few steps to encounter, but the wall rope is here to let you know of other peoples whereabouts. Once up the tower, the viewing floor gives you a panoramic vision of what makes this view so special. The Castle, Vltava River, canoeing, historic buildings, lots of colour and lots of greenery are all on offer. We were here during the end of summer, so the sun being out was a formality. Have a look at my pictures and you'll see the sun brings everything out, so much life and a unbelievable amount positivity generated from this truly magnificent town...

Bright and sunny during our visit, the town is an amazingly well restored centuries old castle walled city of soaring churches and all manner of structures.
Ours was a guided tour, well organized and planned to allow for a few hours of free time to wander, catch a lunch and explore. We frequently passed by others from our group who would share info and comments on things to catch nearby. Similar to Rothenburg in charm, but more *Eastern* in character (e.g. Onion domes, etc).
Small in scale but impactfully big.

They directed me to the next ticket office which due to poor signposting I missed completely, walking right to the other end before asking a tour guide where it was. Any way finally found it to learn the English tour of the theatre had sold out for the day. No problem I will come back tomorrow, but the ticket office couldn't tell me when it would be the next day. She was so rude and told me to book on the website, I tried to do this but the booking page was in Czech with no English option.

When we bought our tickets the lady was quite quickly printing out the tickets, not giving us the smallest chance to meditate which tour to attend (there was nobody behind us). As there is a definite time issue (our tour 1 started at 10.45, the theatre tour at 1 p.m)., we tried to get information about the starting times in different languages. Then she just knocked with her pen the sign ""tickets are non-refundable"". As the tickets are not cheap at all, I think the least they could do is to put a sign when the tours start and in which language. Especially when the ticket office personnels are so rude and non-communicating. Fortunatelly our bad experience lasted this long, the tour guides were very nice and informative.If you have time, try to include in your programme the barroque theater tour. The place is unique and they present quite a good movie about the theatre, its history and how it works. After the movie one can walk behind or better to say under the stage. There is a small terrace caffe just a little bit further on after the theatre with a stunning view on the town.

It was different from all other unicolor palaces that we had seen till now, with shades of orange being the dominant color. We decided to skip the palace tour, just took the ticket to nearby tower and went up to take photos of top view of the town.
After seeing the tower, we were walking around the tower and saw some pre-wedding shoots going on. In one photo shoot, interestingly the groom was seen holding and changing bride's shoes.
As we were walking around, we saw a cafe and went there to have hot wine with chips. Chips was the only food item available. The wine was nothing great - little tangy with a flavour of cinnamon but a hot drink went with the cold weather and view. We tried adding sugar to cut the tanginess, but then it tasted like cough syrup.
After the wine and photo session we went ahead and reached castle garden. It was a nice view.

The first is done on your own...purchase a ticket for the tour and castle museum in the first courtyard right under the tower, then climb several steep stairs for breathtaking views of the town and river. If you can handle the short climb it is well worth it. Then there are 3 paid tours inside the castle. The first takes you through gorgeous rooms, the masquerade ballroom, and onto the room housing the golden coach, all sights will amaze you! The next tour is also very good and takes you through the living quarters of the castle. The third, which if you have time is really interesting, takes you into and through one of only two baroque theaters in existence today, because most caught fire and burned over the years. You will see a film about the history of the theater, get to sit inside it and see the amazing sets and stage, then you go under the stage to see how they changed the sets, made sound effects, and more. It is really informative and fun to see! So if you have the time, try to do all four tours....you will love each one! Make sure you go early and buy your tickets for the English language tours as they only have a few each day.

Czech,Karri L,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We went on 3 tours of this castle - Baroque Theater, Tour I and Tour II (we did not go in to the labyrinth although we would have liked to). All 3 were well done and interesting. The Baroque Theater is such a unique venue that if you only have time for one - don't miss this one! There are only 2 baroque theaters left in the world so it is a must see if you are there. The nice thing about all these tours is they are very approachable, you are right in the room and not held at a 20 foot distance from the artifacts. The tour guides are interesting and full of tidbits of information. We had to take tour II in Czech but they have an english guide you can follow along and our tour guide was so nice he would speak with us about the castle as we moved from room to room to make sure were were following along. Get to the castle early and walk the gardens, it is lovely to be on the grounds before it gets too crowded. Definitely a day well spent here!

Czech,bubuli32,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We used a regiojet bus service from Prague. We purchased tickets online in US in advance (one month) as the seats fill up quickly. The RT tickets were very cheap ($16 per person). The bus was actually very modern and clean. We were offered a choice of a warm drink; water, pop etc for purchase; free wifi on board and a wide selection of movies to keep you occupied for 2 hrs.
The town is a gem. The castle tour is great but short. The directions to where the tour gathers was a bit confusing, and we saw ppl miss their assigned time. As you exit ticket office head left and you'll see a hanging sign ""Tour starts here"" or smth like that. The ticket itself is a bit confusing because the Tower is a separate ticket, and also you can't tour the interior without a guide so that means you must wait for the assigned time slot . And as English is often the default language those tours sell out fast. Overall a great day.

This is a fascinating tour you shouldn't miss out on if you are a fan of theater and want to know more about the historical details of the best-preserved Baroque theater in Europe! You get a glimpse of the inner machinery - the levers, ropes and pulleys for the scenery changes - and a live demonstration of the sound effects of the time, which is really cool. The last 15 minutes or so is a film in English that covers more of the details of the theater, such as costumes, historical details of Baroque theater and opera, and some film of the reconstructed plays and operas of the time.

As originally built, it had 40 building structures and five courtyards. It is a national heritage site of the Czech Republic, and also a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the castle now serves as a theatre, known as the Eggenberg Theatre. The theatre portion of the castle was added in the 17th or 18th century. This is the second -largest castle and chateau complex in the Czech Republic. The largest is Karl≈°tejn Castle, originally completed in 1365, which is on the hill and overlooks much of the city.

The rooms contain armory, an eclectic collection of various chamber pots in one of the rooms, porcellain and interesting details about Administration life of a castle & land owner. The other parts which we did not see apparently contain the more spectacular grand rooms. After viewing the lower part, do go up to the higher part and continue up the mountain. There is a door opening to a kind of terrace with magnificent views over the valley and buildings - you probably wont be able to miss it, just follow the tour groups.

Czech,SB01,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"If you are in Southern Bohemia this will be on your itinerary. A few tips to help enjoy your day.
‚Ä¢ Car Park 1 is the most expensive at 50 Koruna an hour, but is very convenient, being 5 very uphill minutes to the viaduct into the castle. Cash only.
‚Ä¢ If you enter from the ‚Äúviaduct‚Äù end consider doing the gardens first, as they are uphill and you will be faced by a long uphill walk after the tour otherwise
‚Ä¢ Try and decide what you want to see in advance. There are 2 different guided tours concentrating on different parts of the castle history. The theatre is an additional cost and the stables and the museum. To see everything will cost a family of 4 ¬£100+. The theatre alone is 920 Koruna for a family. Credit cards accepted.
‚Ä¢ You cannot take photos inside, so don‚Äôt go if that is your primary objective
‚Ä¢ Tours last about 50 minutes and are timed. Czech language groups are large so consider English or German if you speak these.
‚Ä¢ If you are on a budget then you can walk through the courtyards and visit the Gardens free of charge.
‚Ä¢ Like many other attractions afternoons are quieter as tour groups tend to visit in the morning.
‚Ä¢ There are lots of cobbles, steps and uneven surface so sadly a difficult place to enjoy for the less mobile

The interiors are very well maintained and furnishings and decoration splendid.

After your visit walk into the old town for a good meal in one of many excellent restaurants.

Czech,Ale C,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"The Castle, the 2nd largest in the Czech Republic, stands tall on the hill. Its Tower is the landmark to aim for as you walk up the slope from the bus station.
Enter the castle through its red gate. The first place we saw was the Castle Tower. There is a separate tour for the Tower should you wish to see it. Its ticket office is different from that for the main castle tours.
As you pass the moat, look down. You may spot Maria Theresa, its one lone she-bear. Lucky we saw her prowling around.
We went on Castle Tour 1 which showcases the original Castle interiors from the Renaissance to the Baroque period. Each tour lasts about an hour, and takes you through the rooms in the Castle. There are bear skins on some of the floors. Our guide was clear and informative as she related the history of the Rosenburg, Eggenburg and the Schwarzenberg aristocratic families. As with most castles, there is a residing ghost. In this case, the ghost is the White Lady formely Perchta von Rosenburg, said to appear before significant events. If she has a smile, it meant good tidings ahead; if she wears black gloves, it foretold death.
The Castle Tour ends at the really fascinating Masquerade Hall. This was the ballroom, concert hall and theatre. Every square inch is covered in murals, depicting 138 life-sized figures at a masquerade ball. One of them is the artist, Josef Lederer, who completed the entire artwork in just 6 months. The guests are in costumes and masks. There is a musicians' gallery above and that is decorated with musical instruments, costumes on pegs, and sheet music.
Look for the man-woman and day-night figures, as well as the man with the coffee mug and a paintbrush looking amusedly at everyone.
After the tour, continue to explore the castle with its 5 courtyards and gardens. One could easily spend an entire day here.

We paid for the museum and tower and for a basic tour in the castle. For the latter you can request your own language and we had ours in English with only about 8 in our group. Our guide spoke ""halting, heavily Czech accented English"" which wasn't always easy to understand. No pictures allowed. Not everything in each room explained. He didn't know the answers to some of our Qs, which I think was ""poor"" given that we did not ask anything ""difficult"". And the answers he DID know were fairly basic and I think should have been included in his tour commentary. We had a good couple of hours wandering the grounds which on a sunny day are really pleasant. We were fascinated by the 360 degree auditorium and the cafe next to it is very good. The museum & tower were good value. The stairs to the top are in places very narrow. The castle and the grounds were worth visiting and I'm really glad we did.

Czech,Sixette,Cesky Krumlov Castle,1.0,"I visited the Castle on 15 July at 2.30 PM.

We had to pay an EXTRA fee for the English tour (the ONLY language they have for foreigners!), which costs more than the Czech tour (why?).

The guide hardly knew what he was talking about. He was clearly repeating very few sentences he learned by heart, and when asked any questions he didn't know what to say. For example, he didn't know if the ceiling lamps were original of the period, and when we asked for information to reach the theater outside the main palace, he said: ""Sorry, I have never been there!"".

But the worst is... there were 45 of us often squeezed in not so big rooms (and we were NOT a group off a bus, but couples, families, etc..!), so we couldn't see anything properly, and as the tour was proceeding kind of fast, they wouldn't let you stay after everyone had left the room, not even for a quick look.

At around 5 (after visiting the theater where -I must say- the guide was very competent) we went complaining to the manager in charge for the bad experience with Tour A.
He said the rule is 30 people max for each tour ""but, hey, it's high season, what can you do?"".
About the inexpert and inexperienced guide, again, he replied that in high season they have to use students! I said that if I have to visit a castle in 45 people with an improvised guide, at least I want to pay a discounted ticket.
Not only didn't the manager offer a refund, he didn't even apologize!
He shrugged his shoulders and said ""that's how the world goes: sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad"".
If this is the policy and the philosophy at the Cesky Krumlov Castle, don't go, unless you're Czech. Because sometimes...it can be very bad and you will end up paying a higher price for an INADEQUATE service and for NOT seeing the castle.

Czech,FengXueSG,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"This grand, beautiful and history-rich castle is definitely worth exploring to full extend. Here are some tips:
1. The rooms in the castle and the theater can only be visited by guided tours. The ticket office for these two tours are in the main ticket office in the first courtyard. The tours are scheduled and you may end up having a few hours between your castle tour and theater tour. Be there early and get your tickets so you can arrange your day more probably (e.g. visiting the castle garden, or climbing the tower, or even going out for lunch between the two tours).
2. The ticket for castle museum and tower is sold in a separate ticket office in the museum. No guided tour is required.

I do see some review about the cruelty of keeping that bear. If you join the castle tour, you will hear the reason: the castle has the tradition of keeping bears since the Thirty Years War. Now they keep the tradition by adopting orphan cubs: they will get two more this year. I don't want to go into the debate of whether it is cruel to keep wild animals in captive (as every single zoo is doing that). But as I could see the bear is healthy and had plenty of food.

Czech,bruddle,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"To those unfamiliary with Cesky Krumov, it is a beautiful town stuck in the 1700s - small winding roads, quaint buildings, great restaurants - and above it all a wonderful castle. Quite the romantic destination. Of course with all these features, comes hordes of tourists. If you are staying in the city center it is certainly allowable to drive through the narrow streets to your hotel - even though it ""feels"" wrong.)) For overnight parking there are lots at the base of the castle that are preferable to those at the top.

I love this place - it is romantic, authentic and certainly deserves its World Heritage designation. The only drawback was the crowds - many, many day tourists that during the summer months make the city and its small winding streets hard to get through. I think that once the summer crush is finished (say mid to late September) it would be difficult to find a more perfect medieval town to visit. I stayed in the town for 3 days, and the restaurants cater to all tastes. Some, perched on the hill overseeing the river give a great view as well as passable food.

The castle overlooking the river and town is a must see. The guides do a wonderful job explaining the castle history to manageable sized groups - and there is quite a bit of history to learn about the castle and the region. The gardens behind the castle are very well maintained and a joy to walk through. I recommend than anyone traveling through Czech, or looking for a day trip from Vienna or Prague at least spend the day here - but when the crowds clear out, the evenings are wonderful. Enjoy.

The train ride was serene and comfortable. The only hassle was walking from the train station to cesky krumlov as there were no cabs around.

Try to get lunch at one of the restaurants on the cannel and enjoy the environment! We joined the only free walking tour via wisemantour and bob was very well verse in cesky krumlov!

Czech,Barb577,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov was the last place to visit on our trip, and we had seen our fair share of castles, palaces and churches. So we decided to skip the whole 2 hour long caste tour, and instead do the museum and tower ""tour"". And we HIGHLY recommend it!

The museum is set up in part of the castle and displays the castle's history, from 910 AD to now. It is really well set up and displayed. It's a self guided tour and I think you can get audio guides - but we didn't see anyone hiring them. But we didn't need one anyways - each room had a pile of laminated cards explaining, in about 10'different languages, the contents of the room. We took about an hour to wander through and read, and found it really interesting.

Included in the price is entry to the tower where you get the most magnificent views ever. However, the hundreds of steps to climb up there are steep and narrow and there's obviously no stringent safety laws (a wonderful relief actually!) so don't attempt it if you've got bad knees or a weak heart ... and if you're tall watch out for low beams (well you only hit your head on them once!).

This was such a fun, self-guided ""tour""

Czech,Tupelo010835,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"The castle wasn‚Äôt exactly what we were expecting. This based on castle tours in many cities across Europe. Not a great deal to see here. Oh yeah, there were all the bear skins. Moreover, it was clear to us that the operator spent very little time or energy keeping the place tidy.
And the luck of the draw, I suppose. Our guide smelled like he hadn‚Äôt bathed in a month.
See no need whatsoever to return. And maybe that the thinking of the operator, too.
Now, the castle tower was a different kind of frustration. Once at the observation level, it provided great views. However, getting there was a chore. If you plan to visit, do yourself a favor. Look up and if you see the observation level crawling with people, pick another time to visit. When arriving at the observation level you will find that it‚Äôs a two way street. That is, you will go down the same stairs you came up. So when you finally make your way around to the far end of the observation level, you‚Äôll need to turn around and fight your way back through whatever crowd there may be. The very, very narrow stairs as you get to the top makes for a lot of waiting for a break in the opposite direction traffic.

Entry to the castle grounds and area is free however, you can get a tour of the castle for a fee but no photos are allowed. The tour really is a must to see this staley castle laid virtually as it was huindreds of years ago. On the way up to the castle there is a small bridge crossing under which lives a brown bear however the conditions are appalling something akin to the old zoo's of the 40s and 50s. There have been bears kept there for a very long time and apparently when they die they are skined and the the head and skin are laid on floors or displays. But that aside it is a fanatstic place to visit and a must see if in the town.

Czech,Muffarah M,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"The castle and its grounds are impressive and come with a colorful history. It is about 800 hundred years old, the most remarkable thing about it is the covered walkway wide enough for galloping nobles, that is a km long, so they could ride in the winter as well. The grounds are beautiful with historic trees and significance in their types. The castle is now owned by the government, although it was illegally seized during the last world war. One of the last princes had a 16 year peasant girlfriend who he threw out the window one night. Luckily, since trash was dumped out of the windows back then, she made a soft landing and didnt die. Her parents nursed her back to health, but when the prince found out she was still alive, he demanded her back The parents refused so he promptly put the dad in jail. One month later, the mom offered a trade, her daughter for her husband. The prince agreed and that very night the hapless lass was cut into pieces and killed by him. The prince went unpunished as was the custom but died a year later at 21 because his dad put him under house arrest for something else. The moat has real gears in it because at one point the ruling family thought they were related to the Italian Ursini family, so they got bears. It turned out they were not, but by then they had the bears so kept them. Huge old castle, numerous buildings, lots of walking but all downhill.

Czech,timonetteh,Cesky Krumlov Castle,1.0,"Our visit to Cesky Krumlov castle was completely over shadowed by the sadness of seeing a lonely bear, listlessly wandering around her enclosure which did not remotely resemble a brown bear's natural habitat. This was Marie Terezie, obtained in 1990's from Innsbruck Zoo. To think that she has lived like this for over 20 years is absolutely heartbreaking. Her bear partner, Hubert, died years ago and she has been kept all on her own in this pit. It is my opinion that Cesky Krumlov Castle should not be promoted as a tourist attraction on Tripadvisor - or any other platform - UNTIL some significant changes are made to improve Marie Terezie's living conditions. Reconstruction plans of the bear moats have been made since 1995, but from what we've seen during our visit in May 2018, only Vok and Katarina's moat has been revamped to include greenery and a larger pond. It is still too small though and is essentially still just a bear pit. (Found a travel article on the internet which describes the moat as ""meeting modern standards with a lagoon""- I won't go that far). Marie Terezie's situation and conditions are far worse with only a small pond and a cut tree trunk on bare cement and stone. I have a video showing her wandering aimlessly to the bare corner of the pit, captured by bare concrete walls. She must be doing this countless times a day, every day of every week - for how many years. Unfortunately this thought dominates our visit to the beautiful castle area.

Gardens, turrets, cobblestone streets, vistas, enclosed plazas, trump d'oeil that is so true that, placed next to real windows, you can't see the fake from the real! It is a busy place to visit, even off season, but I wouldn't miss it. There is a sort of a moat area below a bridge that leads from the castle to the town - and in that area below the bridge is...a live brown bear. When we went back in the afternoon, the bear was lumberinging around his enclosure. After a visit, a stroll into town for lunch/coffee/snacks/small shopping is also fun since the town is really an extension fo this medieval experience. NOTE: we had no difficulty using the Euro as currency.

Czech,KangarooPhil,Cesky Krumlov Castle,3.0,"If you, like us, have traiped thru every place from Schonbrun to Melk Abbey this castle‚Äôs interiors are not that elaborate.
But for $20Aus it is worthwhile if you have the energy left to see another dining area and bedrooms and try to remember a few hundred dates.
If you don‚Äôt have the time or can‚Äôt be bothered still worthwhile to walk up and around for the views looking down on parts of the old town.
Note: the pet bear is in the former moat, on the left, near the very first entrance to the castle.

Czech,DavidEarle,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"CESKY KRUMLOV DAYTRIP
This daytrip is very worthwhile. The countryside is beautiful, and the castle is amazing. Our guide, Rosta,
was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful.
He is from Cesky Krumlov. Rosta worked in the archives for the church, town and castle. He had many stories, legends and tales of Kings and citizens from the past that brought all the historical sites to life. Our guide was comsiderate of restroom breaks, rest stops and staying on schedule. A nice aspect was that he was helpful and considerate of the slower and weaker walkers, and kept all guests happy with stories and history. He even introduced 2 waiters at lunch to us that were former pupils of his in the local school where he taught history. Rosta spoke clearlyand enuciated well, so all of us had no problem hearing or understanding him. He gave us some extra pamphlets, a book of Cesky legends, and helped us get excited about the great history of Cesky Krumlov.
I wish to thank your company and Rosta for an exciting and fulfilling day.
Thank you.

You can buy tickets to see the Baroque Theater and rooms inside the castle but we we chose just to stroll up through the courtyards and gardens which you can do for free. The views from the 3 tiered bridge and the gardens back over the river Vitava are nothing short of amazing. Literally took my breath away. Tip... if you are staying in Cesky, go up to the castle early... because by about 11.00 am the day trippers arrive in their coaches and the place is crawling.

Czech,zauberin,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"Visit of the Castle by guided tours only. Very informative, lots of history with well furnished rooms. You can purchase your tickets online. There are different tours offered at the Castle. Tour 1 lasts about 1 hour and covers pretty much everything. Please note: You need to book a tour of the Baroque Theatre separately. We ended up visiting the theatre during a tour in Czech language; however, the tour guide took the time to pull us apart from the rest of the guests and explained in English how the change of scenery worked. As well, the guide allowed us to view the video in English while the other guests left the theatre. Please note: no photography allowed in the theatre.
The Baroque theatre is a gem. There's only one other baroque theatre in the world, and that one is located in Norway. All other baroque theatres burnt to the ground.

There are other sites worth a visit on the grounds of the Castle, sites such as the tower and the stables. The gardens are free. Again, you need to purchase separate tickets for these.

We only walked around the castle ground & up to the tower, hence, unable to comment on the other sections of the castle. Entrance to ticket counter & to the tower were not as obvious as most attractions, the staffs weren‚Äôt that friendly too.

Towers wasn‚Äôt that high, but it got narrower at the upper section, with only one body width on the top ladder. The area on top of the tower were fairly small but you will be rewarded by the 360 view of Cesky Klumlov Town view, and great for selfies & wefies.

The town and castle are preserved well. Too bad the theatre of the castle was closed in december. The tower and some of the castle rooms(mummy included?) were not free.

The old painting on the walls is an odd feature that I have never seen so extensively done elsewhere, and the interior rooms are in first class shape. You can only tour the castle with a guide, and the guide we got was knowledgable and friendly. I don't want to downplay it too much - it's a really nice castle from the inside, and it's got a fascinating history. But there is no wow. Overall, I would recommend taking the tour more to learn the history than for anything special about the apartments. The best room is saved for last: the ballroom is a lot of fun, again because of the painted walls.

The inside is not what I expected, it was a museum, with rooms dedicated to themes. For example, a room dedicated to various examples of toilets, potty‚Äôs, washbasins etc.
I prefer a castle that replicates the rooms and this one did not. Not a complete waste of time but I would not do this tour again.

I loved that all of the tiled historic heaters, one in each room, were radiating heat as It was a chilly day and the warmth was much appreciated.
An older gentleman that took my ticket was charming, friendly and informative. Other staff were also nice to deal with.
I also did the view tower and the views were magnificent. Very steep stairs to get up there but well worth it.
Prices in the castle gift shop were outrageous. I am a Czech Canadian and I am able to easily comprehend the money. I felt that the prices in the gift shop were way too high, even for a tourist destination.
Taking in the views from many different spots was a highlight for me. The castle is surrounded by trees, the river, a park and being late September the colours of the foliage were magnificent.

Czech,Vamos5_Trip,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"Cesky Krumlov is well worth the train trip from Prague, regardless of whether you go to the Castle. The tour was okay, but the best part was wandering around, enjoying the views.",Oct 2017
Czech,Patty J,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"The Castle Area is very large. There is a moat at the beginning with a bear which was playing with a floating barrel when we arrived. There are 3 interior courtyards. There is a lot of faux painting on the buildings that can really fool the eye and a unique 3 level outdoor walkway. We walked all around the area, but did not enter any of the buildings. It was a beautiful way to spend time in this amazing town.",Sep 2017
Czech,Parker Sturbridge,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"It's a long ride from Prague, but do it!!!! This is a wonderful castle in a beautiful town. It's so beautiful that the entire town is a UNESCO Heritage Site I believe. Tourists aside, you'll swear that you've stepped back in time hundreds of years. Do a tour of the castle which is absolutely amazing. Then head down into the main village, complete with shops, restaurants, a menadering river and walking bridges. You won't believe that it's actually real. Don't miss the castle gardens either.",Oct 2017
Czech,Hoong Nan Y,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"A group of 3 of us stopped in Cesky Krumlov for about 5 hours on our way from Vienna to Prague. We had a driver arranged through Martin's Prague Taxi & Transfers (excellent service and highly recommend). Martin also arranged a 2 hour walking tour with our guide Ollie. We could not have asked for much better weather. It was sunny and not too hot and not too cold. We were there during St. Wenceslas Celebrations so the city was packed. Ollie did a great job walking us around the city. She got her Master's degree in the US, so it was very easy to talk to her about the city and culture. She was not our guide for the Castle Tour as we had to purchase that separately. We purchased Tour 1 tickets, and while we were glad we toured the castle, the tour was much less impressive than tours in Vienna or Munich for a couple of reasons. 1) the rooms did not have much in them (not a lot of furniture or paintings) and 2) the guide, while pleasant, was more like a machine. She would lead or direct the group to a room, then start talking as if reading from a script (I would have to assume she memorized the script). Then move to the next room. We are glad we did it, but it was very different from other castles we had visited earlier on our trip. However, CK is just beautiful and definitely worth a visit if you have time!

Czech,eilonglen,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"Having been warned in advance, and despite our visit to Cesky Krumlov at the tail-end of the tourist season, we entered the gates of this magnificent medieval castle before nine in the morning - only to find that half of China had beaten us to the punch!
We were actually delighted to see how East was coping with Western mores and these enthusiastic young travelers, armed with their cell-cameras, are the brave new faces of a still-restrictive monolith and need to be encouraged to expose themselves to the liberal values of the rest of the world...
This fine, well-preserved castle is vast and one is able to spend a number of hours exploring the fascinating apartments, halls and extensive grounds, without the paid services of the available guides. However, the steep climb up to the top of the Round Tower is definitely worth the nominal cost of entry, as the 360-degree views from the balcony are not to be missed - an amazing birds-eye view of the entire town with the lazy Vltava River snaking through the ancient Old Town...
Added-value is the in-house Cafe Hradek (Castle Cafe) hosted by wonderful Camilla and Peter Hadascokova, who produced great espresso coffee and home-baked ginger cake, followed by a photo-shoot, fortified with complimentary home-brewed slivovitz and wine. Definitely the friendliest people we had met in the country!
The impressive medieval engineering feat, creating the multi-arched, elevated causeway spanning the clefted cliffside, separating the castle from the Baroque theatre, is a wonder to behold, as one does not credit that historical period with these complicated architectural skills.One can only appreciate the structure from the gardens below.
Somewhat less impressive is the sight of the lone brown bear aimlessly shuffling around his limited quarters in the moat under the portcullis entrance gate. The only survivor of an original three or four bears maintained as an historical anomaly, when they were employed as ""guard bears"" by the castle sergeant-at-arms, he embodies a practice long-outlawed by the enlightened animal-lovers around the world. I personally do not believe his pathetic presence enhances an otherwise highly recommended Krumlov Castle visit.

Czech,sumita haldar,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"Awesome trip and weather was on our side.. last week of october. It was cloudy with no rain and not very cold and the fall colors just added to the beauty of the place.

Cesky krumlov is very beautiful place and its just 2.5 hrs of drive from Prague. Its a nice day trip from prague. you can do it your own however i and my friend took the Martin tours. We not only got a lot of history about cesky krumlov, we also got a bit of touristy information about some of the main sites of Prague on the way.
Our tour turned out to be a women dominating group and our guide was also a woman though she was like a Army general :-) quite strict.
It is quite a beautiful place.. lots of opportunity to take pictures so ensure you charge your batteries and have enough space on the SD card. We also were lucky to see the parade which happens on the start and end of tourist season. it is very colorful people wearing bygone era dress and put a little performance inside the castle courtyard.
wear comfortable shoes as you have to walk a lot on cobbled streets. There are lots of eating places varying from mid range to high end food joints.

Czech,Honeymonsterjames,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"A wonderful place with beautiful historic buildings and superb castle and gardens. Beware of the very very many package tourists tramping through on most days. Start early in the day or late afternoon to escape the selfie stick forest. Plenty of pleasant places to eat drink and snack according to taste. Suggest using a shuttle minibus to go to Prague, Linz or other long distance journeys unless you have light wheelie luggage or backpacks as bus station quite a walk and train station even further in a different direction. Note long distance bus to Prague is very cheap compared to shuttle once you get to the bus station ( taxi needed if luggage) . Egan Schiele gallery and Photo Atelier Seidel were fascinating and well worth a visit. Sadly Brewery did not offer tours but restaurant was good if you like German style beer hall format

Czech,LancashireLass,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"Before visiting the castle I read some reviews to see if it was worth buying a ticket to a tour to see the castle. Whilst this probably would have added to our experience, we still had a good visit without being part of a tour.
We did however buy a reasonably priced family ticket to climb the tower. This was well worth it for the great 360 degree views, and the experience of climbing the tower, which was refreshingly dangerous! i wouldn't suggest the tower for people with mobility issues.
After exploring the tower we wandered around of the rest of the free areas of the castle and took in some more amazing views.
We stayed in Cesky Krumlov overnight, so were able to visit the castle in the morning before many tour groups had arrived, so it wasn't too busy.

Czech,Sophia K,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We walked through the Castle courtyards and booked the guided tour of the Baroque theater. The exterior of the Castle is worth seeing, with the painted faux stone carvings and colorful tower. The only way to see the Baroque theater is on a tour. Note: there are very few English tours and these sell out very quickly. It is probably a good idea to reserve a few days ahead of time. The Baroque theater tour is short (about 40 minutes), with a 15-minute or so video. The theater is pretty impressive and worth seeing.",Oct 2017
Czech,Renee S,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We loved this castle and felt the castle and tours were better than the Prague castle. The castle complex is massive and stunning. We were very impressed with the completeness and decor of the rooms.

There are 2 main tours and a tour of the Castle Theater. We started with Tour 1, about 60 minutes. It concentrates on the original Castle interiors from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Tour 2, also about an hour, focuses on the history of the Schwarzenberg family. We were able to get the first tour in English (our guide was fabulous - very knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor). The second tour was in Czech and we were given a guide to read in English. It wasn't as comprehensive as the tour guide but we really wanted to see these areas of the castle. Tickets were not available for the tower on the day we were there (tower was closed for some reason). We wanted to tour the theater but didn't have time to do so. The gardens are well worth taking the time to walk even in October when the flowers are no longer blooming.

Photos are not allowed inside the castle rooms. Also, be sure to have coins for all public restrooms in the Czech Republic. Most charge 7-10 Czech Koruna per person.

I imagine in summer this place is mobbed and tickets should be purchased in advance so you don't get turned away and can get a tour in your language or choice.

Czech,Gregory D,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We weren't in a tour group unlike the majority of people there, so had plenty of time- in fact, 3 days staying in the town. The views of this massive castle from the town, over the Vltava river are spectacular, as are the many views from various vantage points in the castle. But the castle is not just views- it's extraordinary mix of architectural styles, it's complicated history with Rosenbergs, Eggenburgs and Schwarzenburgs also need to be appreciated, and the guided tours of the inside of the castle do this. Great guides, smallish groups. Tours in English do sell out early. The majority of the big tour groups never get a chance to really appreciate this magnificent building or its history. Do some research first- it is not just a selfie stop, as many tourists seem to treat it!!

Then I spent the time to climb the Tower while waiting for the tour to start.

Czech,Paul710,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"It is a massive complex. Beautiful views from inside and outside (a la Disney). There are 2 box tickets inside the 2nd courtyard. The 1st one is immediately to the left as you enter the courtyard and up the stair sell ticket to the tower and the museum. The second one is also on the left but a bit farther away sell tour to inside the castle. There are tours in different languages so make sure to ask for the english speaking tour. It is very limited and only held on the hour and sold out fast. So if you want the tour be sure to buy the earliest available time, tour the grounds and the town and come back for the tour. We didn't realize the limited availabilty so we missed inside tour of the castle. Box office staff was not very helpful. Unfriendly.

Czech,Jean C,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"We did the one day daytrip to Cesky-Krumlov with Martin Tours.

I read many reviews and I was uncertain whether or not it would be money well spent. I‚Äôm not particularly a castle visiting kind of person. It is about 2 1/2 hours each way on the bus. It was really great to get outside of Prague and see the countryside.
the town of Cesky-Krumlov is very small, quaint and walkable. Very little time to spend in the town which was fine for us.The tour of the castle is so good. The tour itself is about an hour long ‚Äî just enough time for my taste. It‚Äôs a beautiful place and unbelievably well-maintained and worth a visit. We were in Prague five days so for us it was nice to take a day trip. Beautiful riverside dining (Laibon) and luck was with us as the bear was outside as we crossed over the bridge going up to the castle.

Czech,Scottieboy,Cesky Krumlov Castle,4.0,"This turned out to be a great experience but for the lady on the ticket office.

if you want a tip, them read the big massive options for the tickets on the outside of the office and make your mind up on what you want to do. As our experience was the rudest, most degrading behaviour we had it the the whole of our visit to the Czech Republic.

I dont even want to go into how rude she was but lets just say if you buy a ticket then thats it, you use it or lose it, no refunds, no leeway. Nothing, we were treated like idiots and she even pretended not to speak English at one point, unbelievable!

So that aside, after Id calmed doen, we went on a trip round the castle, this is not open to anyone unless you have a guided tour, this is the second biggest castle in the Czech Republic, it big. Fairly impressive inside but the final hall, is just stunning.

You cant take photos but I will say it wonderful. It was painted in 1746, the details, the people and the work in just amazing, well worth it, for that alone it was worth the not the cheap ticket.

So i suppose what i'm saying is the guided tour, even after the appalling rudeness, was well worth doing.

Constructed on a large rocky tor, the castle is a sprawling complex of buildings and fantastic grounds. If there was a mobility-challenged entrance, I didn't see it--there are lots of steep ramps and stairs throughout. Lovely painted walls and ceilings (although photos not allowed) and great period furniture--one of the unique features to the castle is the Baroque Theater; I recommend getting reservations to see it as it's open limited times.It's one of the best of its time period in the world and definitely worth seeing.",Aug 2017
Czech,Phil_Dolliff,Cesky Krumlov Castle,5.0,"This castle is outstanding -- one of the best I visited in the entire world. The architecture of the castle is stunning from the renaissance tower to the many palaces with S graffito decoration. The location is also world class as it sits high above a beautiful town on a ridge lined with cliffs that sweep down the river below. The grounds including interior courtyards and gardens are open to the public without charge and are beautiful. The views from the overlook just above the Baroque theater are outstanding as you look down on the gorgeous town and the river curling through it -- top 10. The Baroque theater is unique in the world and stunning. The tour we took of it was excellent and the guide was genuinely passionate about it. We also took a palace tour and the interior rooms are superb and the woman who took us was knowledgeable and funny. (That said, I would not recommend these tours for children as they are long and the subjects would not interest them.) One other quibble is that the surreal art exhibit in the castle cellars (a separate paid area) is beyond strange -- I thought perhaps it would complement the mood of the vaults and barrels but it was far too much. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend visitors visit this sublime castle and, if possible, take at least two tours to fully enjoy this sumptuous and unique castle.
