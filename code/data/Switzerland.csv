Switzerland,Old Town,5.0,"Great old town with plenty of bars restaurants and sites to see. Runs along the river Limmat down to Lake Zurich

So many old churches and cathedrals which compete with each other when the bells toll resulting in an amazing cacophony of noise at certain times of the day which is great

Plenty of small squares with chairs left out to sit and enjoy life and people watch in the sun

Cobbled streets and old facades to wonder at and small lane ways to explore

Like any old town spend time here and fine some hidden gems in the form of old shops cafes and eateries

Just follow the main street and it will lead you right to the lake.

Being very visitor-friendly, you can spend long hours here watching boats, water birds, traffic and people rushing by. Definitely recommend.

Take a walk around the walk/cycle path as far as you want and you‚Äôll find cafes, restaurants, pedalo and boat hire which all allow you to maximise the experience of the lake. There are towns all the way around it so you can even rent a PubliBike and cycle to one for coffee.

In the main lobby no clear directions of the permanent collection 's different rooms on on many floors.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,5.0,"A really huge museum, I was not expecting it, it can be confusing at times! It is divided between the old and new construction and each of then has like 3 or 4 floors of exhibits. It is really a lot to see. I am lucky that the week I went there it was completely free because of the reopening of museums after Corona restrictions so I am super happy I could see so much for free. It is mainly paintings and some sculptures. Perfect for a rainy day!",Mar 2021

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"We've just come back from a long weekend in the Interlaken region and on our only full day we chose to visit Harder Kulm, as all pictures I had seen were stunning and it seemed a nice experience.
We are glad we did, and that we were blessed with an amazing sunny day.
We chose to only buy the tickets to reach the summit, paying 15 chf thanks to the region discount we got.
After arriving at Harder Kulm we decided to take the hike to the very top of the mountain, which took us approx 45 mins... But we were rewarded with lovely views.
After going back to the platform and taking the usual pics we climbed down the mountain for about 1.5 hrs before reaching interlaken ost and the train station.
It's tough even downhill, I still have very stiff calves and I suggest you to wear hiking shoes as twisting your ankles is very easy.
Overall a majestic experience that I'll gladly repeat in the near future.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"One of the tops of Switzerland""Harder Kulm "". Family friendly, economical variation of a Swiss mountain experience. Priceless view on"" Eiger, M√∂nch and Jungfrau """,Oct 2021
Switzerland,Harder Kulm,1.0,"BEWARE! I‚Äôm sure most of you are accustomed to keeping your train ticket with you after boarding as you may need it once you disembark the train to be allowed out of the train station. This was not my experience in most Swiss train stations but it is the case here. If you misplace your ticket (or your phone dies etc) after riding up in the Harderbaun you will need to pay again to be allowed to go down, otherwise you will be forced to walk down. This is assumed and therefore no heads up is given about this. I assume people walk up to Harder Kulm and can try to board the Harderbaun to go down, which I was unaware of before my phone died and my e-ticket was thus unavailable. I was thus essentially trapped on the mountain. Probably a rare occurrence. The Harderbaun operator was unnecessarily condescending and unhelpful about the situation as you can imagine with ticket checkers. I was able to return later with my e-ticket to get the extra ticket refunded (out of principle) so I‚Äôm thankful for that. Otherwise you should enjoy the visit in a clear day, except for being packed like sardines in the carriage. I just hope this saves some of you from unnecessary headache. Cheers

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"Harder Kulm is one of the easiest to visit and most accessible viewpoints in Switzerland.
We got our tickets for the Harderbahn from Interlaken Ost station. The Funicular(train) that took us to the top of the mountain is an easy 5-7 min walk from the Interlaken Ost station across the bridge. The funicular train is a great experience with a super view of the surrounding forest and the lake below.
There is a restaurant and a triangular viewpoint at the top of the mountain. The Eiger, M√∂nch, and Jungfrau mountains as well as Lakes Brienz and Thun can be seen from the top. It is an absolutely beautiful view.",Oct 2021

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,3.0,"It's a really nice view point between the two lakes. You can spend some time in the restaurant and take in the scenery..

You can of course walk up/down the 3.6km or so but most people take the funicular and that was the big let down for me.

We bought tickets back in town at the train station. Arrived to find a huge queue but then saw there are two routes 'pre purchased tickets' or 'no ticket'. Immediately this is crazy since there are ticket machines right there in the street..Everybody can have a ticket there and make on line. We took the much smaller 'pre purchased' queue and found that people were buying tickets further up the queue and the queues then merged.. It was just pretty chaotic. People in the wrong queue, people pushing in, general crush near the actual train.

Even buying the tickets in advance we waited an hour.. And yes, another hour to get back down.

If I went back I'd walk but the steep train is part of the fun.
