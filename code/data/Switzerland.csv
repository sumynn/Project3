Switzerland,Old Town,3.0,"The archaeological evidence suggest that there were settlement around Lake Zurich some 6,000 years ago. Neolithic and Bronze age artifacts have been discovered in the Zurich area. In more recent times the Roman Empire included a fortress on what is now the Limmat river which runs through Zurich in 15 BC. At that time the Romans called Zurich ""Turicum"".It is also note worthy that Zurich was the primary center of the Protestant Reformation in Europe in 1519. The Old Town (Altstadt) reflects the Medieval and Renaissance period were well with housing, contorted cobble stone streets, it's guilds and Rathaus (Town Hall).

The three notable churches in Old Town are Grossmuster, a 12th century church and site of the Reformation in Switzerland, Fraumunster, a church originally built in 874 AD and today boasts stain glass windows by Giacometi and Marc Chagall, and finally Peterskirche which has the largest clockface in Europe.

The Old Town has a walkway which takes you along the Limmat river, There are museums, public parks, restaurants and cafes, public markets and cruise offerings to Lake Zurich. Switzerland is probably the most expensive country in Europe and if you are a tourist from the USA, the prices are going to shock you. Hamburgers start at $28 dollars

Switzerland,Old Town,4.0,"Walking through Zurich Old Town was terrific. Morschach has a nice resort & Grindelwald is a MUST SEE. We rented a car so we could take an easy road trip to Grindelwald and beyond. We drove 2+ hours to spend New Years Eve & New Years Day in Milan, where we saw the major attractions including The Last Supper. We went castle-hopping in Verduz, Liechtenstein & Feldkirch, Austria which were both beautiful — always surrounded by the majestic, snowy Alps. We ended up at Lucerne which is very beautiful for strolling around the lake. Renting a car made the trip much more eventful and we could change plans & come and go as we pleased. It was a great trip!

It makes you wish to go back in time to before the shops were taken over by prestige brands. Though there were a few qwerky little shops to ponder over.
I followed the little map provided at hotel reception (mostly) and it seemed to take in most of the options.
Well worth the effort and the price (free).

Switzerland,Old Town,3.0,"This was one of our last days leisurely activities after we have covered all the snow clad famous tourist locations. Good thing about the Swiss are they enjoy their weekends. But this is to such an extent that they don't care enough to work overtime during peak seasons. Take for example this hilarious incident that my wife faced. We were approaching a big showroom and it was around 4 local time. The door won't open. So we kept trying to pull the door open. Seeing this a lady staff inside quickly came to us and started tugging the door from the other end. We thought she was to help, but in reality she was ensuring whether the door was securely closed or not. She politely signalled us to leave as the shop was closed. Felt uneasy at first and then we both laughed out.

The Old Town could easily consume two days, and if you just want to immerse yourself, even more.

The cobblestone streets, the small hills, the ""something new"" around each turn made for fun exploration.

We were there during December, and Christmas markets were high on our list of things - and Old Town didn't disappoint. From stumbling upon beautiful Christmas trees and smaller markets, to the ""Lucy"" lights on the Bahnhofstrasse, I found Old Town Zurich to be a joy to explore.

Overall, it is a very safe city and it's easy to walk in the city centre. There are loads of shops with high-end brands, but you can find a couple stores that are reasonably priced (e.g., C&A, H&M). It is an expensive city, so skip the Starbucks where a grande latte will set you back 6 francs and sit in a local cafe instead. It may cost the same, but you'll feel more like a local.

None of the restaurants are air conditioned and it was very hot when we visited. The highlight of our trip was going inside the Grossmunster, an old stone church with a green steeple that was the center of the Protest Reformation in Switzerland. It was beautiful inside and you can pay to climb up to the top to see a city view. You can reach the boat to tour Lake Zurich from Old Town.

Switzerland,Old Town,5.0,"I stayed 3 nights in Old Town and it was an excellent choice. It’s central to explore Zurich on foot, but it’s also charming and filled with great restaurants, bars, shops and cafes and many small alleys to wander through.
I stayed on Munstergasse, a few blocks off the Limmat River and really the main street for wandering the length of Old Town. It is lined with the most restaurants and you can bridge off it for others in small alleys and connected streets. Perfect location to stay.
It’s really a great, charming, CLEAN area that is wonderful to explore. The most crowded it got was on a sunny Saturday afternoon, and even that was not bad at all compared to other European cities.

Switzerland,Old Town,4.0,"The Old Town of Zurich needs to be enjoyed at leisure, forget time and step back into history. The cobble streets can be challenging, so wear comfortable walking shoes. Although a map is helpful, sometimes by following your instinct you can discover hidden gems; little shops with interesting wares, or a tempting cafe for a refreshing drink. At times you may feel you are walking in circles, but somehow it is difficult to get lost - the Limmat river is always there.

Switzerland,Old Town,5.0,"This is the reason you come to Zurich. I might think the Uetliberg experience was slighly better for our family but this is hairline behind. You have 5 Reformation era churches, a river, a hilltop park, and countless winding roads that undulate through a beautiful Gothic era city that has dozens of restaurants, shops, and perfect picture spots. Our family loved our day in the Old Town ""Altstadt"".

I recommend you visit the right bank in the morning for better pictures taking the Polybahn to the Polyterrasse for a great view, then come down to Neumarkt and Haus zum Rech to get a good orientation of the historic city. Then go to the Grossmunster, Wasserkirke and Helmhaus before walking back up Niederdorf to the a lunch on the northern end like Swiss Chuchi. Afterwards visit the Predigerkirche and cross the pedestrian bridge to left bank (afternoon sun now behind you) and Giacometti Hall before walking up to Lindenhofplatz. Rest and enjoy the view before winding through the Schifpe to Peterskirche and then down to the Weinplatz and Rathaus bridge. You then cross the bridge and walk past the historic Guildhouses before crossing back to visit the Fraumunster. You then are essentially at Paradeplatz and a refreshment stop at Sprungli. From there you can go to the waterfront for a afternoon boat ride or take a tram anywhere you would like to go.

However, you choose to visit take the time to enjoy Zurich's premier attraction. It is a Must See.

Very easy on the eye and inviting streets and small piazzas with water futures and corners . Yes the water on the streets is drinkable and very delicious straight from the Alps !
Zürich has the cleanest and most well organised Old town in Europe and you can see it easily. The high Swiss 🇨🇭standards are not in the price but in what you get for it and the Old town is up to the highest standards in Europe💯👍👍
Zurich has the cleanest air for European capital city and you’ll feel it referring !
Must see , must explore and must experience the Old Town by walking without rushing.
Take time to enjoy, to sit for coffee and admire the atmosphere around you .
Don’t rush in a 24 hours you can not see everything . Pick top 3 places of interest for the day and leave few hours to explore without planning and to enjoy!
For the romantics that’s the perfect place and there is the bridge where you can put your lock of Love 💕 🔒 discover it ! 😍👍
For the historical places tickets online to skip the Q are better options.
For shopping, boutique style of Local and High Fashion. For souvenirs few special shops only but no street junks . (No fast food , no any junks on the streets at all ) For picture perfect views of the Old Town- the University terrace, the high Square and the Cathedral Tower! It’s photographers place - no billboards on the buildings or streets no advertising no posters no commercial junk at all ! Beautiful clean well preserved architecture only! One practical advice - Comfy but smart wear it’s a must !
Swiss are very well smart dressed but understated and discreet (no flushing fashion and labels, no fashion statements)
Don’t forget the phone chargers, battery extenders and converts if you planing on photos all day (the weird non EU - Swiss sockets need convertor). Most coffee shops and restaurants have where to plug in and recharge but Swiss style only! They usually have free wi-fi too but you need to ask for the password.
One of the weird difference from other European capital City’s is that Speaking in high voice and making a noise is considered very rude and impolite! Do keep your voice down NO shouting and screaming in public places (it’s offensive)! Other than that keep it clean and be kind and you’ll be welcome everywhere ! Swiss in generally are very polite and welcoming for tourists 😍
Go enjoy,make happy memories and share with the World 😃😎💯🇨🇭📷👍👍

If you our a person that wants to know when and how things were built then I would suggest a tour guide. Numerous shops and very easy to do business with the shop owners. All seemed to take credit cards. I found that they do bargain which is nice because everything is so expensive. When we Americas look for a restroom we will not find one in Europe, as restroom is where you rest. Look for toilet. They are not everywhere but I found that the tram stations usually had restrooms. Also, there were a few public toilets that cost about 50 cents, the ones I used had an attendant that helped with change (this was in all the countries). Overall Old Town was enjoyablel.

Switzerland,Old Town,3.0,"...the Old Towns of big cities in Switzerland weren't my favourite part of the trip. In most other cities the old towns have a certain charm/allure, while in Switzerland they were nice, they weren't exceptional and the other natural beauty outdid the charm of the old towns. Also, for example District 1 in Zurich looked equally charming and more grandeur than the old town itself. I know it may not be right to penalize the old town because other parts are equally pretty and the natural sites are phenomenal but the old towns of Zurich and Lucerne didn't evoke the same excitement in me.

The High Street in Interlaken was very different from the rest of the town and even the old town of Thun was very evocative. My wife who visited Bern said that the old town there too was nicer.

That said a visit to the old town is called for if one has time on hand after seeing district 1 (Bahnhofstrasse) and the Lake. There are quite a few restaurants and bars here.

Switzerland,Old Town,5.0,"Altstadt is the old town of Zurich situated near Bahnhofstrasse, the famed shopping street that is the heart of Zurich. The location is often considered to be a preferred choice for tourists to explore Swiss history. The location is reachable through public transportation and offers a mix of dining and shopping options as well as the opportunity to understand Switzerland on a deeper level. Altstadt is a must see for all tourists and is an essential part of Zurich’s culture and architecture.

Altstadt offers many attractive destinations that center around the beautiful aesthetic of Zurich as well as a historical understanding. The three main locations in Altstadt would be Fraumunster, Grossmunster, and Lindenhof. Fraumunster and Grossmunster are two churches filled with stories and history while Lindenhof is a hill well known for its picturesque view of Zurich and Lake Zurich. In addition, another location to note is Augustinergasse. If you have seen pictures of Zurich, one popular picture and Instagram location is the street with many flags. That street is located on the Bahnhofstrasse side of Altstadt and cannot be missed.

Altstadt offers a wide range of shopping options with a focus on haute couture brand names as well as a mix of Swiss boutique shops. There are also many chocolate shops and souvenir stores to choose from if you are looking to take a piece of Zurich home with you. However, due to the popularity of Altstadt as a tourist destination, prices will be relatively inflated, even compared to Zurich standards. All the goods on Altstadt are high quality, but there are cheaper options in Zurich so I would not recommend shopping in Altstadt.

Altstadt offers many high-end dining options with a focus on European cuisine. Similar to Altstadt’s shopping choices, Altstadt’s dining options are quite expensive due to the popularity of tourists as well as it being a popular choice among Swiss bankers and their clients. A more reasonable option would be to go for a snack, coffee, or a glass of wine. A common scene in Altstadt is a Swiss with his/her cup of coffee bathing under Zurich’s afternoon sun.

There are two sections of Altstadt- one closer to Bahnhofstrasse and one across the river. The one near the city is smaller in comparison, but the one across the river is more casual and local. Make sure to cross the bridge at least once for a wonderful picture of Lake Zurich. I highly recommend visiting Altstadt, in fact, I could spend days exploring it.

The streets just off the lake are closed to traffic and are jam-packed with people, outdoor music events, food trucks and so much more. The firework display happens at 1220am not at 12 midnight like most places in the US. Theno outdoor holiday party ever happened. I strolled the same area the next morning and was quiet, peaceful and found some places open to eat but no shopping could be display occured for about 1/2 hour but there were low clouds that night and not the best for clear views for the high ones.

After visiting the Art Museum, we took a slow walk to China Garden along the lakeside. There were many locals and tourists walking along the lakeside, enjoying the lakeside views despite it was a cloudy day. Many vendors selling gelato, drinks and snacks along the lakeside. There were a few buskers playing violins enhanced the atmosphere at the lakeside. Along the Quaianlagen Park, nearer to Quaibrucke Bridge, there are plenty of swans and some mandarin ducks swimming nearer to the lakeside. We took lots of picture and had wonderful time looking at the swans and mandarin ducks. We spent a wonderful late afternoon along the lakeside.

From the start we enjoyed seeing the white swans in the lake at our departure deck. The boat was very comfortable; it was a very smooth ride. The lunch was surprisingly good as was the wine. Excellent Service.
At Rapperswil, we walked around, firstly to see the beautiful rose garden (still in bloom in August). Then up and around the old castle. It is situated up high, so the views are spectacular.
All in all it was a lovely day out; we would gladly do it again.

Switzerland,Lake Zurich,3.0,"We took the short round trip boat ride. First, after having done similar boat rides on Thun and Brienz, the scenery of this one was rather boring, but should have been a good way to escape the hustle of the city. Shortly after pulling out, a light drizzle started, which required sitting inside. That was our biggest problem. This meant sharing the space with 10 girls who appeared about 12 -14 years of age and who had no adult supervision and who screamed to one another across the room. In addition, there was a couple with 2 toddlers who screamed almost the whole trip. I have grandchildren and am normally not bothered by children's voices, but 90 minutes of a constant roar loud enough that my wife and I could not hear one another prevented this from being the quiet escape from the hustle and noise of the city.

Switzerland,Lake Zurich,5.0,"Which ever time of year you travel, the Lake of Zürich is a great place to be. If the weather is clear, you can see the Alps - sometimes it's so clear they look so close you feel like you can reach out an touch them. locals would then say that he weather is 'foenig' and bad weather will soon be on. If the warning lights start flashing on the end of boat piers around the lake it means a storm is approaching - the quicker they flash, the nearer the storm.

From near the Haupt Bahnhof you can get aboard the Limmatschiff ang enjoy a ride up the Limmat and across Lake Zürich. If you have a day card this is included as far as the Züri-horn - beyond there you need to pay a supplement.

Just where the river exits the Lake in Zürich, lake steamers depart on regular schedules criss-crossing the lake and taking you to Rapperswil at the other end. A great place to explore and enjoy lunch before returning. You can buy a ticket at the booth or you can buy a nunipass which is valid from 09:00 until early the next morning for travel on public transport in the whole of Canton Zürich - great value.

Lake steamers serve drinks and food but the prices are very cheap - take a picnic would be my advice or buy a sandwich in the nearby Lidl near the Rathaus.

Even in summer, the breeze can be very chilly but there is always plenty of warn inside accommodation to watch the wealthy suburbs along the lakeside pass by. Around the lake are many interesting places to see and things to do.

Lake Zurich is very well preserved!
It’s big and long and not overcrowded with boats and yachts like Lake Geneva !
We visited in January and it was cold but mesmerising experience!
Totally worth it !
In the winter they are only 2 Ferries every 2 hours the one is for 1 1/2 hours tour of half Lake and the other is 4 hours tour of the all Lake ! The price is very cheap compared with the rest of Zürich public transport!
Absolute value for money!!!
The tickets can be purchased on board and online too . They have always Q 15-20 min before ( especially in the afternoon for the sunset tour) check the timetable in advance and get there at least 15 min before departure.
The space in the Ferry is limited because they don’t allow overcrowding. The Ferry is not very big but has coffee , bar and food .
We had coffee and sandwiches and they where great . Very well organised and family friendly friendly. It has few stops on the Lake Cantons which give opportunity to explore how locals leave around the Lake and to see some Design & Architecture masterpiece Houses .
Easy to navigate around the Ferry inside or outside you can sit and enjoy the breathtaking views of the Lake and the Mountains !
Don’t forget comfy boots and few Ad ons as scarves hats gloves , after all is Swiss Alps and in winter is cold ! Sunglasses are must too on sunny days the Lake is very bright mirrored reflection !
Take as many photos and videos you can you’ll be happy to look back and remember the moments on the Lake and share with the World 😃😎🇨🇭💯📷👍

We sat on the upper aft deck, basking in the sunny 20 degree day, and watched the Alps slowly grow larger in front of our eyes. We returned to our starting point but could have stayed on for a second and third round trip.

Switzerland,Lake Zurich,5.0,"There are two trips around Lake Zurich, but I elected to take the short 90 minute ride. The boat served light snacks and beer and wine, and stopped at 5 or 6 strategic locations. Unfortunately, the Lindt Chocolate Factory was not one of them. As we traveled by the factory, and suppressing an urge to swim ashore, I reminded myself to read the tour stops more carefully. But the views of the snow capped Alps and the hillside vineyard, and the beautiful private homes made up for the lack of chocolate. This is a very pleasant way to see the shoreline of Lake Zurich, for under 10 Swiss francs.

There is a bridge that gives a great view of the lake, but to get a good spot you need to arrive at least 11:00 pm, otherwise you will star 3 or 4 “lines” of people far from the handrail.

An important information is that in Zurich the fireworks star 15 minutes after midnight due a religious tradition so stay where you are because many people think that some fireworks at midnight are the official party, get disappointed and leave... at 00:15 the street lights are turned off and the show begins! It is not wonderful like Rio de Janeiro but is a very beautiful show.

There are live music in some tents, food and drink.

Be prepared to the cold and wind!

Location: It is about 15-20 minutes walk from the central train station.

When you stay in one of the hotels in Geneva, you get a card that will enable you to travel for free in most of their transportation. With boats, you can travel with the yellow one. The boat will take you to the different areas around the Geneva lake.

There are many beautiful hotels along the lake. Try the Hotel d’ Angleterre for Afternoon Tea. One of the best in the world!

Price: It is a beautiful place to visit but quite pricey. This of course will depend on your personal preference when you travel.

I stole time from a busy schedule just to walk along the promenade next to it just relaxing and taking in the beauty and magnificence of this lake. It inspired Smoke on the Water, it inspires all travelers who walk along side it.

Switzerland,Lake Geneva,5.0,"Geneva

Trams, busses, taxi, train, bikes all close by and super efficient with regular departures. The travel card (handed out at reception in our hotel) got us access on the train to the GIMS 2019 (motor show). Geneva transport card.
The city is well lit and feels safe to walk the streets. Never harassed by anyone or beggars.
Zero litter or gum on the streets. It made for pleasure strolling without having to dodge dog doodie.
The scenery and views are stunning while the architecture and sculptures are breathtaking. We even found chess/draughtboards king size in the park in the old town.
The market was quaint with nice food and fresh veg. The stalls did not ‘haggle’ so I did not buy. “How much”,”chf12”,”10”,”NO”,walked.
The pub charged chf9.50 per pint and chf18 for gin n sprite. Tea (normal British) was CHF3.5. The entire place is the same. It’s not built for peasants like us who visit on a budget. We found an Irish pub (Lady Godiva) which had breakfast (full English) for CHF24 and a good portion ‘3 bacon, 3 sausage, beans, mushrooms, tomato, 2 fried eggs and 4 toast halves’ set us up for the day. With excellent table service, she liked the plates were clean.
Migros shops (like Sainsbury’s UK) sold food sundries so we made picnics. Other shops sold booze so you have to look for them. CHF10 for 6pk of 1664.
Visit again, definitely, once we’ve saved up again.
Recommend to other, definitely but remember it feels like your paying double the UK prices.

Switzerland,Lake Geneva,3.0,"Went on a Grey Line bus tour of the city - the one called an International Tour which cost 25 CHF per person. Got glimpses of the Old Town which can be done in greater detail on the Old Town Tour. Saw much of the city centre, some of the parkland area and surprisingly impressive, the international area of office blocks housing many of the world's major institutions. They take up a whole area of the city. The most impressive is the flag lined approach to the UN, which is not a public entrance - go further up the road to find the entrance for tours inside the UN - have done this previously and if you're at all interested in world events and politics is well worth it for the one hour tour (but allow three hours and time to get in through airport style security). You'll stop near the flag lined entrance which is by the large red chair with three and a half legs - a memorial to those who have lost limbs by land mines etc..
The UN is a good stop (doesn't give you time to go in on tour - do this another time). The ten minute stop at the Parc des Eaux-Vives, just five minutes into the tour is a complete waste of time.
Our biggest problem was actually finding the starting point of the tour - the signage was attrocious. It's actually just at the end of the Pont des Bergues on the south side of the river/water and the buses are only there for a few minutes.

You'll go down to the Lake for a cooling summer breeze or to wander along its promenades and watch the swans or the boats plying over the water. You'll enjoy the city scapes and the views of the mountains beyond. Above all, you'll get a great sense of space and light.

Of course you can go further. There are many cruise possibilities on the lake from the simple 'once around the pond' to longer journeys down to picturesque towns such as Nyon, Yvoire (in France) or to Lausanne. The views are beautiful rather than spectacular but if the light is good you can get a glimpse of snow covered Alps in the distance. Cruising is not cheap but nothing in Geneva is cheap and you'll enjoy the experience, especially on the paddle boats.

There is also the free alternative. If you pay for a stay in Geneva you get a free public transport card. This also allows you to use the little Mouettes, or yellow shuttle boats which operate on four routes. Hardly the last word in cruising but they will get you onto the lake as well as from place to place.

The first trip was from Hertenstein to Luzern 30 mins to go and 30 mins return, and we paid a stunning CHF 95 for two adults and two children. It was on a Sunday with beautiful weather and there was no place to sit on the boat. We found it disappointing and too expensive for such a short boat ride. The next day we did the 4 hour round trip around the whole lake, also starting from Hertenstein, where our hotel was located. We took first class tickets and paid CHF 214 for two adults and two children. Much more reasonable given the duration of the trip and the space available for first class passengers. We thoroughly enjoyed the round trip, despite the weather being less beautiful than the day before. Our advice: take the round trip; it is better value for money; as is a first class ticket.

We did a cruise - for an hour I believe and it was wonderful. We went in the afternoon so we’re sure to dress warm as it gets cold in December on the lake in the afternoon. The ride on lake was amazing with great views to take in and absolutely worth doing while in Lucerne no matter the season or time. The one hour cruise suited us in the afternoon allowing us to fill our days with other activities and not too long if you have kids/teens. Walking around the lake is a must as well.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"It was an excellent weather - clear sky, sunny and low wind...it couldn't have been better day for us to be there. The Lake is beautiful, one can swim, lot of places to sit and watch the Alps, busy area of train station, Yatch and cruises, there are some restuarants around the lake to have nice Wine & Food. We had good 2 hours walk at the lake... be sure not to miss spending enough time here either solo or with your loved ones.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"We took a boat ride from the foot of Rigi mountain back to Lucerne. It was a relaxing and the water was very calm, important for me because I get motion sick (it wasn’t a problem). The lake has many “fingers” it’s a very interesting shape. There are also a few “beaches” where you can get in the water called lido. It’s definitely worth the visit.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"I last visited Lucerne eight years ago as a child. My memories of that visit centred around the Chapel Bridge, Lion Monument and Old Town. But when I visited in mid Sep of 2019, I couldn't believe that I had missed on what was perhaps the grandest draw of Lucerne: its stunning lake.

Its clear blue waters flanked by green-topped mountains makes for many good photo opportunities. I'm especially partial to having photos taken of Mount Pilatus, brown instead of green but with a pointed and even shape, lending it a majestic air. We took a boat cruise out onto the lake to get even closer views - I felt it was worth the 20 odd francs per pax. The only caveat to all this is that the sun should be out and the day roughly clear, because the water best reflects the sunlight this way.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"At last a sunny day enabled us to go on a 5 and a half hour cruise around Lake Lucerne. We had done this 14 years ago and it still looks beautiful. The boat stops at all the stops around the Lake. We had hot chocolate and lunch and tea and cake in those hours. ! There were lots of passengers using the boat as a commute and lots of tourists as well. Service was good. This is the only gripe I have...the day before we asked about whether I could take my mobility scooter on board and the man said yes and there were no complications with toilets and so on. So the next day we went to buy the tickets and board when another ticket seller said it would cost 24CHF to take the scooter on board and no there was nowhere to leave it safely by the ticket booth. I and my friends were outraged as there had been no mention of this the day before. It was a good job I had the money on me.
All this aside it is a trip so well worth doing especially if the sun is shining !

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"I am a recent and new adherent for the pleasures of the lake boats and transports in this, my favorite tourist country. The boats are for scenic tourism and practical transport (part of the SBB national system).

Despite my numerous visits for hiking adventures, last year, I happened upon the boat across Lake Lucerne for a practical reason- best method of transportation,,, but what a great experience- please see my last year's review for the description of that experience.

So I decided that for this year's trip, a proper Lake Lucerne journey would be the start of my trip. The incredible crazy itinerary that I did was to land at Zurich Flughafen at 0810 and I was on the boat by 1012- fantastic quick 20 minutes from plane to train , and the boat landing is across the street from the train station.

Now I could not believe how many hundreds of people were admitted to that boat, but it did not sink nor collapse from the load. Being an overenthusiastic tourist, I did not sit for a moment- walking from one end to the other and one side to the other- taking all the photos that you can see her- linked to this review.

I can say it all in a few words- I loved it. It is so smooth; it is so classy; it is so professional; it is so romantic; it is so lovely; it is so scenic; it is so unique.

Hey- you can sit at a table and have a real meal (I didn't do that).

You can see the famous mountains from a different perspective (see my recent reviews of Mt. Pilatus and Mt. Rigi).

Note that the boat remains crowded until Vitznau, where about 200-300 people disembarked at one time.

I continued to Brunnen on a much more spacious craft.

Don't forget to go to the bow and the stern- to see the bell and to see the gigantic Swiss flag flapping in the breeze (see my photos).

I disembarked at Brunnen- another of the endless number of scenic Swiss villages (everywhere and including along lakes). From there it was a five hour train journey via the Bernina Express to St. Moritz (please read about that on my profile too).

What a glorious start of my annual visit!!

This lake boat excursion is so recommended... and if you can, go on the BAV- that is the paddle boat- you can see the machinery in action on the lower floor and you can also see the rapidly churning paddles that propel the boat.

We took the boat trip to Alpnachstadt as a part of the Golden Circle. Let me highly recommend the Golden Circle because you get the boat ride as well as the funicular train and cable car.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,3.0,"Lake Lucerne is beautiful but I wonder why people bother to take one-hour boat rides on it. A lake is a lake albeit that this one is situated among hills and mountains. A better option, in my opinion, is to go up to the top of Mount Pilatus and look at the lake from there. You also get to see all the elements of its beauty as you descend the mountain in a gondola.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,4.0,"Lake Lucerne is kind of at the center of the city... It's so beautiful that no matter which end and way you look it from it's mesmerising..One must definitely take the boat/cruise ride which is for 2 hours. It takes you literally to most of the corners or sides of the lake which has an awesome views ranging from snow capped mountains, to beautiful homes on the hills... We we're fortunate to see rain clouds at one end and could actually see water falling from it (rainfall) it was just awesome to see it from the cruise with a reaching distance...our hotel was facing Lucerne lake and the sunset would simply mesmerise anyone...

There were some swans on the lake that were a delight to watch. The water was clean and the snow capped mountains reflected in these pristine waters were what dreams are made of. There is a cruise on the lake which is peaceful as the scenery is to die for. A must visit.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"My daughter and I fell in love with a Lake Lucerne...Yes, I suppose it can be considered ‘just another lake’ yet what takes it to the next level is the cleanliness and the ability to walk along a good section of the lake. Located right across the street from Old Town, the end of the lake turns into the Reuss River where one can cross over via the wooden Chapel Bridge. The back drop of the Alps add to what makes this lake so appealing. The swans and ducks add to the charm and are all more than willing to beg for treats! We did the boat tour however not really necessary in our opinion (another review).

One evening after dinner we strolled along the lake with a full moon lighting our way...The views of the mountains lit by the moonlight and the swans leisurely floating as they settled in for the night made the evening very memorable....we had to finally make ourselves move back to the hotel for the night! Lake Lucerne is worth a walk both by day and night. The views are incredible!

The city is so clean - that if you see a wrapper on the ground - you feel compelled to pick up and put in the trash.
The roads are all cobblestone - small plaza's and charming buildings - Just a great place to visit and spend time in.

We were their during the start of Carnival - which starts at 5am with an actual canon going off on a boat. Constant bands, marching bands, parades, people getting dressed up in costumes - a really cool experience - except - it transforms the city from the cleanest to the direst in 1 hour - litterally at 5:15am the place was mess. The first day they partied until 3am (the Hotel gave us ear lougs - nice touch) - and I will tell you by 10 am the next morning - the streets were clean. Just don;t understand why they have to make a mess of the place during the party.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"The city of Lucerne seems to be on every tourist itinerary. It's beautiful, but was also the most crowded place we visited in our two weeks touring Switzerland in late August. So, a boat trip on this stunning lake in the late afternoon on a Friday was a welcome relief from the crowds. There are numerous private boats and tours that can be taken around the lake, but an inexpensive option are the SGV Vier Waldstattersee ferries that the locals use to get from town to town along the lake. Some of the Swiss Rail passes include these ferries in the pass (be sure to check before you buy unnecessary tickets for the ferry). You can ask at the ferry ticket building on the pier outside the train station. We took the easy one-hour round-trip boat from Lucerne to Kehrsiten-Burgenstock and back and had gorgeous views of Lucerne from the water and the beautiful wooded mountains that surround the lake.

We took the regular public ferry which makes stops at one set of towns as it wends its way to the other side of the lake and another set as it returns to downtown Luzern. The whole trip took about 6 hours without disembarking. The ferry boat was well appointed and had a sit down coffee shop. Beautiful as the ride was, it still became boring after a few hours. If I were to do it again, I’d take the train to the other side and catch the ferry back. The prettiest sections are at the other side across from Luzern. Alternatively take the ferry out and the train to return.
Train fare is cheap, ferry fare is not. There are numerous discounted transportation passes available for travelling across Switzerland that includes Lake Luzern crossing. The ferry website also offers deep discounts but these have to be purchased from the website ahead of time and are not available at the ticket counter near the time of departure.

Rigi but I ended up coming in from the other side of the mountain, so I took the boat only from Weggis to Vitznau and then across to the other side )on my way to Stans).

But it was so fantastic! So stunning! So scenic! Gorgeous!!

And such a pleasure to enjoy the ride!!

The boat is gorgeous and a pleasure to board and the ride was so so much fun!!

It was so worth it!!

The staff is so professional!!

Within less than a half an hour, I enjoyed the view, the sea, the breeze and the staff and observed the inner workings of the boat.

To go to Mt. Rizi- start @ Luzerne.

Overall: a great experience either before or after a full day of hiking Mt. Rigi.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,4.0,"The cost of the boat ride around the lake is pricey. I suggest, if you're touring, get a Swiss pass for all public transportation. Its a few hundred dollars, but you'll save in the end. You can only buy it outside of Switzerland. The lake tour is beautiful and you can get off the boat to visit the local hamlets. You are trapped on the boat. You can eat on the boat.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,4.0,"We took the 2-hr trip from Pier 2 (next to Luzern train station) to Vitznau. It takes an hour to get there, turns straight round and then an hour to get back. Ideal if you don't have lots of time to see the lake (and mountains if the weather is nice)
The boat makes a few stops along the way, but it is probably better to get on at the train station if you want a seat next to the window as it was quite busy.
2nd class is downstairs - a waitress comes and takes drinks orders, and there is a restaurant serving food upstairs in 1st class.
You can get off at Vitznau and visit Rigi mountain for the spectacular views or just stay onboard for the return trip.
Adults cost 28 CHF return and kids 11 CHF.
If it's cloudy, you won't see so much scenery obviously (you'll see the lake and the bottom of the mountains rather than the top), but it's still worth it.
For 'sailors' worried about getting seasick - it's a lake so it's a pretty smooth journey.

Unfortunately, it was very wet when we were there so we just did Vitznau to Lucerne return, with a little bit of sightseeing in Lucerne, which is a good choice in the rain because of the covered bridges. In the evening we travelled from Vitznau to Weggis by boat for a meal. The boats are very reliable and are timed to meet up with cable cars, trains and other local transport.

We have purchased tours all over Europe and this was bizarre. If I didn't have a smart phone with the advertisement for the cruise, I wouldn't have known where to go. The voucher didn't have information. When I brought it to the man at the Lake Lucern boarding doc, he looked at us like we were nuts and said just get on. There was six different parts to the tour so I just referred to the advertisement to figure out what to do next. Thankfully, Viator has that well written ---but very bizarre. They should give you something so you know what to do. Imagine if it was a senior citizen who wasn't able to look up information on phone, etc...... We found our way and it was a very nice day.

There are regular boat services available which can take you for a 60 minutes tour or can transport you to a scenic resort for half a day. The boat ride is covered in Swiss travel pass. A walk along the city centre area covering one side of the lake with small halts to feed birds is also a good experience.

We were very lucky to sail on a clear and beautiful day in June but I'm sure the lake would still be gorgeous regardless. Also great to walk around it and enjoy the landscape from the little beaches dotted about. The view of Mt Pilatus from the lake is just something you don't forget in a hurry. Definitely up there as one of my favourite lakes, my photos do not do this justice.

The best way to navigate the placid lake is to take a boat ride from Lucerne to Fluelen. Luckily, I've taken the time slot of MS Diamant, a new ship on Lake Lucerne which looked like a yacht (10 am).
On my way back, I took a steam paddle boat, claimed to be the oldest engine navigating on the lake. Look at how the steam paddle engine works in the interior cabin.
Nothing seemed more fascinating, refreshing and relaxing than simply sitting around, whiling away the hours and watching the world go by, especially if you've walked far and in circles for hours in Lucerne.

During the summer time and even into fall, there are a number of areas for swimming, paddle boarding, renting a very small boat and exploring, as well as taking the ""cruise boats"" for exploring the lake.

During the winter the lake is a bit cold for my taste for swimming, but you can still take a cruise which could include lunch or dinner depending upon what is available.

Best thing to do (in my opinion) is to hit the websites for Luzern and see what is going on during your visit. The tourist information office located at the main train stations is always helpful as well.

There are Swans and ducks among other birds found swimming here. Nearby the lake are various Hotels and restaurants where one can get down when required and small gardens and parks where people get together.
Must try the Sunset cruise at Lake lucerne.

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"We went to book a 1 hr tour and the man at the station said if you have a Swiss pass the tour is half price. But he said if we had more time, take the boat from pier 1 for free. There is a schedule and the boat goes all the way up and back down. You can hop off then get back on the next boat. We took it to the final town, round trip was 5.5 hrs, but very enjoyable. You see views you will not see except by boat. Get the first class ticket. It's a little more but only with a 1st class ticker can you go on the top floor. Way better views. Servers serve snacks and drinks of all kinds. For a charge of course but not bad for Switzerland . Pier 2 is where the boat goes to get off for Mt. Pilatus .

Switzerland,Lake Lucerne,5.0,"""You've got to see Lake Lucerne,"" the locals kept telling us when we asked them, on a visit to Zurich, what we should see while we were in the area. In other words, in addition to appreciating Switzerland's history and culture in the city's Altstadt (Old Town), we should also take the opportunity to admire the natural beauty of its mountains and lakes. And so one morning we went to the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) and bought same-day round-trip tickets between Zurich and Lucerne. (52 Swiss francs, equivalent to about the same in U.S. dollars.) When we got to Lucerne after a 45-minute ride, we walked the 100 meters from the train station to the SGV ticket booth. ""We're here for the day and we'd like to see the lake,"" we explained to the attendant. ""What would you recommend?"" ""How much time would you like to spend on the lake?"" she asked. ""Perhaps a few hours."" ""In that case,"" she said, ""I think you'd have time to get to Brunnen."" We got same-day round-trip ferry tickets between Lucerne and Brunnen, 63 Swiss francs each. The day had begun overcast, but clear skies were predicted. Sure enough, as we traveled across the lake, the clouds broke up and the mountains all around steadily became visible. They were simply amazing. While this was a commercial ferry, the crew made frequent announcements not just about upcoming stops but also about the history and features of the lake. When we got to Brunnen after about a 2-hour sail through marvelous scenery, we stepped off the ferry onto the dock to wait for a ship that would take us in the other direction back to Lucerne. We turned around to see how the lake continued to the north and we realized instantly why the ticket agent had been glad we would have ""time to get to Brunnen."" We were looking down the Bay of Uri at the peaks beyond the end of the lake. All of the views had been magnificent, but this one was the best of all. A Lucerne-bound ferry came in about 40 minutes, and we took it back to the city, admiring the scenery just as much on the return trip. When we got to the railway station, we found that a Zurich-bound train was just about to depart, so we made it back there in good time. For an investment of a little over $100 and about half a day, we'd had an unforgettable experience of Switzerland's outstanding natural beauty. A true highlight of our trip.

Being asymmetric in shape, surrounded by mountains with lush green pastures (in summer) and next to such a beautiful city make is truly amazing. This is very much a part of Luzern and if you really intend to explore Luzern, you must take a cruise on lake Luzern. It would be great to see some of the beautiful villages on the shores of the lake. If you are short of time, just take a cruise from Luzern to Burgenstock. Take the funicular train up and enjoy the view. If you don’t have even a few hours to spend, you can take a return cruise to Burgenstock. Sailing time between Luzern and Burgenstock is 30 minutes. The boat stops at Burgenstock for 15 minutes when you can enjoy the views of the lush green slopes with a few houses scattered over and watch the funicular train climbing up and down the steep mountains. You can return to Luzern in just an hour and a quarter. You would still enjoy it.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"The museum has lots of art, much of it by artists I know little about. It's well worth a visit. I was appalled, however, the large windows shining in on paintings centuries old, and it made them hard to see as well as potentially damaging them.We were frustrated in locating the periods we wanted, the toilets, and even the shop. The museum map simply lists rooms by numbers and so you don't know what's in each. We ended up going around backwards, starting with the more modern. There was a long long at the entrance. If you are staying in a hotel, don't forget to show your Basel pass as it halves the entry fee. Very good bistro and we ate outside in the courtyard.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"Very good collection, on the whole pretty well exhibited. Some works could benefit from better positioning. For instance, there should be at least one angle to view a statue without having other artwork in the background, interfering with the view. The two buildings have a very confusing architecture and signage. A lot of time and effort wasted finding your way up and down stairs and elevators. On account of the value of the collection the museum is a must see.

Had half a day to fill due to delayed flight and much enjoyed spending it here. Very well run efficient staff. Good lockers to dump coats bags etc so can wander round unencumbered. Good rand from old masters to impressionist and then on to the more modern stuff. Personally I dont really get most of the modern stuff indeed there was a cleaning trolley sitting unattended in one of the galleries and I wondered if this was in fact one of the exhibits it was more interesting than most. Definitely worth a trip a reasonably condensed way to see art through the ages

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,5.0,"It's not the Louvre. It's not the National Gallery. It's not The Met. But it IS one really good, not so big/not so small art museum that runs the gamut of art history, from medieval to present-day. The building itself is big enough that it feels like a major art depot, but small enough that you don't feel lost or overwhelmed. Sometimes, the 58th painting of Madonna and Child becomes too much, and you realize you still have 1000 years of art left to see - that can be overwhelming. Here, it's no more than a few rooms, with fantastic highlights from each art period. You can spend an hour, alone, just you and a technicolor Van Gogh self portrait. The foot traffic is minimal (at least on a weekday in February), allowing you to get up close to masterworks without fighting off crowds or having your eardrums ruptured by a thousand strained whispers and foot-stomps. The natural light of the building also prevents claustrophobia, which I occasionally get in darker, more crowded galleries (like London's National Gallery).
The new building, accessible from an underground tunnel at entrance level, is worth the visit, even if you are not seeing the (extra fee) special exhibit that is housed there. The architecture is stunning (modern).
I love that you get free lockers for your coats and bags (and it's an enormous room with probably 500 lockers). I went to Strasbourg for the day and had to carry my coat and backpack, in my hands, not slung on my shoulder, b/c their coat and bag checks were closed b/c of terrorism threats. In the winter months, a coat check makes all the difference.
If you are staying at a hotel in Basel, you will get a Basel Card, which will allow you to take 50% of the admission price, and Tuesdays are already half-price days, so you can get in for 8CHF!
There's enough to see to spend a good two hours or so. It's one of the best spots I visited while in Basel - a good respite from cold weather and a place to just soak in some great art.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"This is one of the first destinations one should opt for when in Basel.
There are very interesting exhibits from different eras and painters and we were really impressed by the phlethora of famous painters that are hosted here (Picasso, Miro, Ernst, Mondrian, Monet, Van Gogh, Cezanne to name but a few...).
The museum shop is also worth a visit, many items to choose as souvenirs and gifts.

Not at all family friendly though and this is an issue that the management has to consider. We went there with our 3 year old daughter and when my husband sat in one of the benches in order to feed her a banana (very far away from the paintings), the security employee told him to go to the groundfloor to do it, although there was a lounge area in the same floor.
I mean we' ve been to many real important museums before, never before have we met such a behaviour.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,3.0,"I had a couple of hours to while away before catching my return flight and since it was a cold and rainy Sunday, I thought of exploring this museum. I like to consider myself as an art enthusiast and have visited most of the top art museums in Europe. However, the Kunstmuseum left me a little underwhelmed. Although it's unfair to compare this museum with the Prado, Louvre or the Rijskmuseum, they do have a decent collection of the classic paintings including works by Holbein, Monet and Pissarro among others. They also have a sizable collection of works by Picasso. The works by the Swiss artists were also quite interesting as well.

However, the building itself is a bit sterile and I missed the warm atmosphere that I expect from art museums. Additionally, there is absolutely no description about the art works whatsoever. If you don't get an audio guide or really know your stuff, you won't get any information about what you're seeing. Also, the main focus of the museum seems to be on modern and contemporary art which I absolutely do not get or understand. But if you have a Basel card that gives you 50% discount on the entry fee and have a few hours to while away in bad weather, you may consider this museum.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,2.0,"The art in the Kunstmuseum is lovely, and this is a worthy stop in Basel. I particularly enjoyed the Swiss paintings of mountains and valleys I could recognize without resorting to the legend. However, our visit was marred by the rude docents that have an excessively authoritarian way about them. My wife began to feel faint on the second floor, so I had her lie down on a couch in a public area near the elevator. Meanwhile, I went down to the first level where I had checked my day pack, to bring her back her water bottle. The docent at the foot of the stairs stopped me and would not let me take the water bottle in, even though I patiently explained that my wife was on the verge of passing out. So I turned around, waited a respectful length of time, and made a second (successful) attempt at smuggling the water bottle in my jacket. So back on the second floor, another docent came over and told my wife to get her feet off the couch (even though she was visibly in distress)--not ""How are you?; can I get you anything?"" I considered this really rude and inconsiderate behavior, and it marred our experience at an otherwise nice museum. The docents on duty need to take a class in being humane. Teaching them a sense of humor would be a bridge too far.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"Not only the most important art museum in Switzerland, but one of the most impressive in the world, the Kunstmusem Basel is indeed quite a marvel. Located in the heart of Basel, it offers something for lovers of both classical as well as modern art. It's a spacious museum with a nice, pleasant atmosphere. I went there on the first Sunday of the month when the entrance is free, and it wasn't crowded. You will find all the big names here, from Monet to Van Gogh, from Munch to Kokoschka. It also houses one of the largest Picasso collections in the world, with paintings gifted to the city of Basel by the artist himself. Of special interest are also their exhibit of great Swiss painters, like Hodler and Böcklin, Valloton and Anker. I can't comment much on the contemporary art they feature, as my interest lies in the classical. A few paintings that had a special appeal to me were 'Three Women and a Little Girl Playing in the Water' by Felix Vallaton, 'Return of the Animals' by Kirchner, 'Seated Harlequin' by Picasso, 'The Fate of the Animals' by Franz Marc (partially burned in a fire and later restored by Paul Klee)', as well as several of Hodler's works, including two paintings titled 'Disappointed Soul'. I had a good time there and came out inspired, and will surely return.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,2.0,"The title of my review relates to the first installation you will encounter. This is a load of loudspeakers with random Americans saying the days of the We week creating a cacophony of noise. Tip: recreate this at home by inviting friends and family to randomly shout days of the week at you in english.

Then you enter the world of Georg Baselitz. Imagine your 3 year old niece let loose with charcoal. Congratulations! You have successfully recreated every G. Baselitz painting ever created. Except you might want to give it a pretentious title. Like”Ohne Titel”. Ingenious.

After having been in the gallery for 45 minutes I was accosted by a guard who told me my handbag was too large and I should have put it in a locker. I must confess, the temptation to steal some of the toot on the walls was tempting but I had resisted thus far...I went down and put my handbag in a locker lest the urge overtake me to steal an art piece like “dog-upright”.

The next installation was a video installation-woohoo! This was a black and white film of a woman pointing to her ears and saying vacantly “this is my left ear”. Bless her- she got it right at least 50% of the time...

The good news is that if you are inspired by a white canvas by three lines scratched on it entitled “three scratched lines on canvas” then this is the place for you!!! You will LOVE this! It’s totally worth the 52CHF fee (halved by the Basel card thank God). If you have an ounce of sanity, you’ll realise this is probably a massive April Fool’s joke by some Swiss entrepreneur who wants to know how far he can take this. There are canvasses painted blue which represents “the deep melancholy of the human soul” or- in my interpretation say “it’s Sunday and I’m hungover - screw it, it’s just blue alright?!”

The plus sides were: I got the locker for free that I left my handbag in and I had a bit of a laugh. If you want to use 50CHF of your hard earned cash gawping at a woman blinking then this is the attraction for you! Or alternatively you can spend 60CHF on cocktails at a nearby bar and have much more fun!

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"A ticket at the Kunstmuseum for SFr.23 will get you into the Kunstmuseum, the Neubau, and the Gengenwart Museums.

MUSEUM 1: The Hauptbau Museum has an extensive Medieval and Renaissance art collection of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The Swiss Mountains exhibit on the same floor (1) was very good. The 2nd floor has classic modernism and European postwar modernism paintings and sculptures which were very interesting. Some of the works are posted in the photographs section in this review. There were many more works that are worth seeing--Van Gogh, Albers, Picasso, Giacometti.

Be aware that the alarm system is very sensitive. If you touch the information plaque, the alarm will go off.

The information plaques are not consistent in format: sometimes the works are listed in German, French, and English, and sometimes not. The artists' materials are not listed in English, and often not even in German. And, there is no set order the titles are listed in.

The café has decent food.

MUSEUM 2: The Neubau has a special exhibit with sketches by Cezanne. They collected some of his sketch books (which had been sold or given away by his son) and put them in order. The process of collection, research, and display is very interesting. The sheer number of sketches covers almost an entire floor. There are also a few of his water colors and paintings. There is a short film in English and German in room 2 that is helpful. There are magnifying glasses you can pick up in room 6, which are very helpful to use when looking at the sketches.

The posted informational details and explanations are in German only.

The Cezanne exhibition was not well explained. In its current state we see it working much better for academic research or for a course through the university, rather than for an exhibition. If you love to draw, love to see and study other drawings, then you will definitely like this exhibit.

The 2nd floor of the Neubau was closed, so no ""Hola Bravo"" show.

MUSEUM 3: The Gegenwart is about a 5+ minute walk from the Neubau. Watch the signs, but use your map or smart phone to guide you there. The signs disappear.

The Gegenwart has several collections of contemporary art. The third floor has a collection by Joseph Beuys. I realize his performance art film ""How to explain pictures to a dead hare"" was a key work of his, it has many messages, and so on, but I just can't get past seeing a man carrying a dead hare around by his teeth. He also holds it, caresses it, moves it around. My feeling: Yuck. This piece took place in 1965, so maybe it rocked the art world then. I understand his interpretations, symbolism, thoughts, etc. he wants to convey, but it doesn't need to be done in such a (to me) grotesque manner. And...for three hours??

The other videos in the collection are not as disturbing, but also not interesting enough to sit and watch two people kissing and talking for 50 minutes; another of the same couple talking for 30 minutes, and so on. Other video artists share the space and offer their films or photographs. If you love film, performance art, long videos of mundane, scripted interactions, and photos of carts, garbage bins, and men's clothed crotches, then you'll like this museum.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,3.0,"The Basel Kunstmuseum is clearly one of Europe's most impressive art museums. It is understandably a world heritage site with the Hauptbau main building a fine example of conservative modernism dating from the 1930s. Despite its grandeur, however, it conveys more than a suggestion of the right-wing triumphalism which was the style of the era across the border in Germany.pressive art galleries and contributed to the overall feeling of discomfort which I was unable to shake off despite the quality of the work on display.

The museum has expanded in recent years to include the simply named Neubau and a third building further down the street. We had sufficient time only for two of the buildings which are connected by an underground passage. The new building is impressive with high ceilings, large rooms and the same feeling of vastness as the Hauptbau next door. Both exude a cold grandeur but it was hard to shake off the feeling of coldness about the entire place.The overall feeling of chill is exacerbated by the indifference of the staff, underwhelming signage and scant information. There is little or no explanation about the artworks in the galleries so you'll need either to know your history of art very well or buy the audioguide which we failed to do - certainly a mistake.

Like all the great art museums, it has an impressive collection of works by major artists and is particularly gifted with outstanding 20th century works by creative talents of the calibre of Picasso, Mondrian, Braque, Klee and Munch. It has also assembled a large collection of earlier European masterpieces but these were less to our taste than the modern work in the special exhibitions in the new building although we particularly liked a unique series of paintings of Alpine scenes which showed the evolution over the centuries in the relationship between Swiss artists and their mountains.

The current Cezanne exhibition, which required a higher entry price (and the appropriate sticker to identify you as as a premium customer), offered a well-presented demonstration of the artist's creative process through a series of painstaking reconstructed sketchbooks showing clearly how Cezanne developed his ideas and honed his technique: an excellent example of process for any aspiring fine art student.

Basel's Kunstmuseum is a must visit for anyone with more than a passing interest in fine art but, in my highly personal estimation, the ambiance, presentation and particularly value for money place it behind the Quai d'Orsay in Paris, London's Tate Modern, New York's Met, Bilbao's Guggenheim, San Francisco;s MOMA and LA's County Museum of Art.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,5.0,"We visited this museum, being in Basel, due to our interest in modern art. This museum houses the outstanding collection of not only the works of the modern artists,such as Picasso, Braque, Munch, Paul Klee, Chagall, but also the paintings from more older periods of art. So we saw here the works of famous impressionists, like Monet, Manet, Gauguin, Cezanne, Vincent Van Gogh and naturally the paintings from Flemish, Dutch and German schools, in 18th and 17th centuries.
Very interesting is the modern design of the building of this museum, which apart the main old edifice, nowadays, has also one new extension.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"I opted for the CHF18 basic ticket as my AUD was no match for the mighty franc! After affixing my ignominious pauper's sticker to my shirt, I made my way first through the Hauptbau which displays several household-name masters including Picassos & Miros.
I really enjoyed witnessing the evolution of styles in a collection of swiss alp landscapes that line a square hallway that overlooks the courtyard below.
I then made my way underground to the Neubau, a striking edifice that called to mind Melbourne's Federation Square, that held a fascinating documentary on 'Degenerate Art' during the Nazi regime. I also enjoyed the Otto Freundlich 'Cosmic Communism' exhibition, coming to realise the subtle propaganda in his works like 'Mein roter Himmel' 1933.
My pauper's sticker disallowed me from entering the Cézanne exhibit on level 2.
The third venue, the Gegenwart was a short stroll away in the ""well-tended"" St Alban-Tal Quartier, Basel's own ""little Venice"". This was one of the world's first contemporary art museums (who knew?!) and the exhibition running during my visit was a collection of video media by Richard Serra. I did my best to suffer through the material, trying to reconcile the abstract imagery with the program notes that accompanied it.
I was able to clear my head on the wonderful rooftop terrace with sweeping views of the Rhine and Kleinbasel.
Ultimately, I scored far better value for money & a more comprehensive experience of art at the Met in New York, but the Kunstmuseum was still a rewarding, though expensive, experience.

The building is modern but in a quite a classical style. It is easy to get around and wasn't too crowded on the day I was there. Usefully, there is a large cloakroom on the ground floor where you can drop off bags and coats in lockers for free.

I was there for about 4 hours (including coffee & lunch breaks in the cafes there!) but it's still worth going even if you only have a couple of hours to spare.

The physical architecture of the building itself is extraordinary, with smooth lines, creative angles and harmonising textures on the walls & floors. A must visit for architecture lovers (as is the city of Basel itself). As for the exhibitions, there are lots to see- I spent several hours and only saw 2 of the 3 buildings the ticket included- so the ticket price covers a lot, particularly for students. At the moment (Oct 2016) there is a Jackson Pollock exhibition on, and for a Pollock lover the collection is large and it is a must-see. The way the paintings intersect with the architecture of the building and the white space is really stunning. If you're not a huge fan of modernism, there is also a variety of other art; Van Gogh, Cezanne, Giacometti, Dutch masters, 16th century paintings and more. A small criticism would be the individual floors and sites should be signposted with more clarity, and a larger gift shop would probably bring in more income and be of interest to tourists.

Very few visitors, so we were by ourselves in most galleries (there are 15 for this collection). The paintings are ""artfully"" arranged, so that, for example, you can compare two Mondrian paintings, each with just 2 colors, next to each other.

We walked across the street to the ""new building"" (interesting architecture but it won't be to everyone's taste) and viewed the paintings (and sculptures) from the Contemporary Art Collection (post 1960) in the first few galleries before jet lag caught up with us, and we left. Again, very few people in the galleries (on a Friday between 11:00 and 1:30).

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,5.0,"For an art lover this is a first class museum. It has both modern works - cubist works by Picasso and Braque, some lovely Chagall, plus other pieces by Hans Arp, Dali, Fontana and others. So already this place is top tier.

Then there are the classic artists of the late 19th and early 2th century - Monet with his chrysanthemums, Van Gogh, Pissaro, Renoir.

Then something I have not really seen elsewhere - medieval paintings, including plenty by Hans Holbein - not really my cup of tea but worth seeing nonetheless.

A personal highlight was seeing a version of The Triumph of Death by Bruegel (similar to but different from the version in the Prado in Madrid).

You can then go underground and back up to the new building, which contains the modern pieces, including some spectacular items by Donald Judd as well as brilliant photography from the Beslers and Ruscha, plus abstract expressionism from Rothko and my personal favourite Barnett Newman.

In conclusion this place is an essential visit for lovers of 20th century art.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,5.0,"Like most art galleries this is a serene space where you can lose yourself for a few hours, which we certainly did. The entrance forecourt is spacious with a pleasant café, and then you enter the gracious old building of the museum. The collection is startlingly good, with representations from many famous artists from the fifteenth century onwards. Best of all, because it is small and uncrowded, you can get really close to the paintings. I found it very moving to see some of the most famous works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries so closely. We didn’t have the concentration to see all the works in the collection in one visit, but it would be possible to follow many different pathways.

The modern building is, as it should be, a complete contrast in building style, with strong sculptural concrete forms. It makes its artistic contribution by mounting exhibitions of contemporary artists, some of which made sense to me, some of which didn’t so much. However, I found it fun to guess whether these would become classics in the future.

Tram #2 stops right outside the front, and it wasn’t crowded when we went. Wonderful on either a hot day or a rainy day, or any day you are in Basel.

In June there is the annual exposition in one of Kunstmuseum's affiliate buildings called Sculpture on the Move that presents abstract creations based on ideologies, rebellions and so on in the shape of sculptures, collages, repurposed objects.

Take a break for an espresso or snack; you can also leave a dine off the museum property. The new museum is contemporary works. If you follow this medium, you will be amazed of the concentrated central greatness of artists.

The exhibition is spread out and every piece of art has plenty of room, which is nice. The art presented was not my taste, but obviously that is personal preference. While I am sure there are alarm systems, the art is just right there without visible barriers and I just thought of my kids and times when they were young and wanted to touch everything... this place would have been a living nightmare. Even in that group of adults I toured with, people almost knocked over objects...surely without intending to do so. Staff was very attentive, strict but very nice. Building itself is impressive, feeling kind of brutal in its materials and gigantic outlay. Not my taste and I honestly do not get the point of the whole new (grey) color scheme but yet again, personal preference. On a positive note: they house a rather big Giacometti collection which -if you like Giacometti- is absolutely worth seeing.

Unfortunately, it took several trips before I took the time to visit the gallery. I've been through my share of famous museums, and small artist dedicated museums (Andy Warhol, Picasso, etc), and skeptically thought, ""how good can this really be?""

I confess that I was proven wrong, and not merely with a handful of impressive works. I was proven wrong like an Indie Film smacks a Hollywood Studio Executive with critically acclaimed recognition.

I particularly found the collection of 19th Century Art worthy of rivaling the D'Orsay.

At present, some gems of the collection are on display at other Basel museums, although check this out on-line as these special exhibitions are about to close.
I hope that the modernisation will make this exceptional collection more interesting to the average visitor. Previously, no effort was made to explain the significance of the works on display, as for example, is done in NY at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The interesting history, for example, of the Picasso saved for the city by public subscription, and the additional paintings donated as a pleased response by Picasso, is surely worth describing. For contents, the museum should have 5 stars but for presentation (previously) only 2. Lets hope they make the needed improvements.

However, the Kunstmuseum provided a wonderful few hours of the one day I had to spend there - and was free of trams!

If you know anything about the museum you know it is the largest art collection in Switzerland, and has a great selection of paintings from the northern Renaissance - apparently a very large collections of Holbein. Having only a few hours to spend here, I opted to give the deep past a miss and concentrated instead on their excellent collection of art from the Impressionists forward. I originally wanted to go as I understood there was a good bit of Paul Klee's work - there was - but also a very representative collection of most of the big guns of the modernist movement.

Having made the decision to see only one part of this large museum I was able to stroll rather than rush through it - it's a real education (or re-education in my case) in every major school of art in the era mentioned, and very well displayed.

From impressionism, expressionism, cubism, to surrealism, all the modern masters are there. Picasso's works at various stages. It is a museum will excite any modern art lovers, but I do find the Holbein collection is a slight disappointment, as the best painter of that family, Hans Holbein (the younger)'s collection only consists a few.
The admission is 15CHF, lockers provided, needs 1CHF coin to operate, the coin will be returned. No photos are allowed.

My only knock, and why I gave 4 and not 5 stars, is that the modern art wing runs hot and cold. Some great stuff, but a lot of uninteresting stuff, and a couple pieces that really aren't even art. Sorry, but shooting spitballs at a canvas is not art, no matter how skillfully you chew the paper.

Oh, and do pay the couple francs extra for the guided headset tour. Well worth it.

This kind of thing can be as demanding as a triathlon, but the generosity of space here - often, there's just one painting on a wall, or even in a room - makes the experience a very relaxed one, as if you're encouraged to linger over each work, or just to pick out a few on each floor and devote all your attention to some individual items. The contrasts between modern and 15th-century collections, especially the way the older ones are unexpectedly clear and bright, and take themselves so much less seriously, keeps you on your toes. The audio guide (2chf extra) is fabulous. There's a splendid bistro here for a lunch or coffee break.

I could have spent at least two more hours there but it was hard with a 16 year old. We loved seeing art from the 1200's to the 1900's. We especially loved the Renoirs, Monets and Picassos. The older, religious art is also spectacular. This is great museum to see in Basel along with the history museum. The only downside is that you do have to check your bags...particularly if you have a backpack. I haven't been to a museum in the US in a while so perhaps this is standard now. I only had a small purse that I didn't want to turn in because our passports where in it. I had to argue a little with a woman to keep it on me.

Like the Louvre, you can get lost in there, and I still, after all these years, don't feel I really ""know"" the Met -- since, when I go, I go to see one or two exhibits. But the Kunstmuseum has a small but well chosen collection that you can view in a day. It'll be a long day, and you'll be exhausted, but still.... It is pretty well characterized by saying it is a museum of European art, from around the 15th century to the present. You won't find an Egyptian or a Polynesian collection here. The museum is arranged for the most part chronologically, so you can follow the centuries as you stroll. Everything is well presented. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the very nice Museum cafe. It's a good place to take a break, and you will need that break if you go through the whole museum. By the way, I put down ""2-3 hours"", but that depends on you, of course. I spent more than 3 hours, but some of that was in the Cafe.

There is a restaurant that serves full meals and desserts in addition to drinks and coffees, or you can sit in the courtyard of the museum and enjoy your own food (your entrance ticket allows you to go in and out for the day as you please).

This is a world class museum with one of the the best art collections in Switzerland. It's made up of work from the 1400's to the 1600's and art from the 19th to 20th centuries, which was what I was most interested in seeing. The galleries contained a who's who of the art world including; Monet, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Picasso, Gauguin, Kokoschka, Léger, Chagall, Rembrandt, Rubens and Brueghel. The work covered many different periods. In addition to the permanent collection there was a special exhibition of the work of James Ensor, someone I wasn't familiar with. Nice work though. All of the art was nicely displayed. Photography inside the museum was not allowed.

There's a lot to see, so give yourself some time. The museum has a cafe if you want to take a break or have a meal. And of course there's a gift shop. Price of admission was 21 Swiss Francs. One last thing I'll mention is that a Tram stops right in front of the museum.

Switzerland,Fine Arts Museum Basel - Kunstmuseum,4.0,"I greatly enjoyed a short visit to this gallery. I would make the following comments:

- the contents are a roll call of the most prestigious late19/20th century artists. Picasso, Monet, Mondrian, Leger, Marc, Braque, Calder, Lichtenstein etc…. A wonderful collection. But none of the pieces are top works by those artists. The Rothko isn't a patch on MoMA's, the Monets aren't the Orangerie, the Picassos won't move you like Guernica.
- the positive side of that is that you may have, as I did, rooms completely to yourself rather than being rammed by back-packers ticking off a list.
- I went at 5pm on a Wednesday during the last hour. Turns out to be happy hour for the main collection - entry is free.
- the first floor isn't well lit IMO. The ground and 2nd floors were more impactful because the lighting is much much better.
- agree with an earlier comment that the staff are a bit…. well odd. Not exactly unfriendly but not well suited to their jobs
- there is very limited curation of the works in the galleries. An audio guide, or some other information, is important as the works don't exactly 'speak for themselves'.

The size and atmosphere of the gallery is very comparable to Zürich's Kunsthaus (stylish, calm Swiss building). In fact, I prefer the Kunsthaus - my memory is that the collection was a bit more surprising and eclectic.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"Jun 15-17: The moment one is in Zermatt, it is impossible to miss Matterhorn. Matterhorn is overwhelming in this car free town of Zermatt. You can see it from the rail station, from the narrow lanes of the town and from Glacier Paradise, from Sunnega, just about anywhere.

Few of my favourite places to see this mountain is the Matterhorn Glacier Paraside, Sunnega and at sunrise. I was up before 5.30 am and was waiting in one of the lanes near my hotel waiting for the sun to rise and turn the Matterhorn into a golden mountain. This view is an amazing view as the mountain tip starts to turn golden as the sun starts to shine. It then flows down as if gold is running down the slopes. Its a view that can keep you mesmerized for quite some time.

While the views from the Matterhorn Glacier Paraside are stunning, do check it out at sun rise. You will not forget that view in your lifetime.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"I visited the Matterhorn via Glacier Paradise, which is located on an adjacent mountain opposite the Matterhorn. The visit is entirely weather dependent and so it is important to choose a season when the weather is most likely to be favourable. Often the Matterhorn can be totally enveloped in cloud.
The gondola ride is spectacular in itself, taking some 45 minutes each way in enclosed gondolas with great visibility all around. The scenery is simply spectacular and one of the best things I have experienced even though I am petrified of heights and gondolas!
The glacier paradise itself was not as interesting, but the views are amazing and the ice caves also interesting although we struggled a little bit due to the lack of oxygen at that height. However, we are in our 70s so a younger, fitter person wouldn't necessarily have the same issues.
I would strongly recommend taking this trip in preference to the railway (which I have also done). It is a photographer's delight and a once in a lifetime experience.

This time we had glorious weather and the marvelous cog railway to take us up to a crystal clear look at the mountain. The following day was socked in again.

Hike down to two lakes and past some wonderfully quiet views of the Alps and rejoin the train for trip on down. The train runs frequently, but do check schedule. Seeing the Matterhorn from the viewing area and then hiking part way down was THE highlight of our trip to Switzerland.

Some of the best views of the Matterhorn come from Gornergrat and from the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. We only had decent clear weather to view the Matterhorn from the Gornergrat summit station and the views were astounding. Please see our separate reviews of each of these two places. This famous mountain is a tremendous sight and should never be missed weather permitting.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"Years ago I lived in Switzerland, and one day we went to Zermatt to have a tour of the area, and to see the Matterhorn... Well, the weather was awful that day, and we couldn’t see anything more that a few metres in front of us, so seeing the Matterhorn was a no go... We went out for cheese fondu instead and went back home. Since then, I have always wanted to go back to see the Matterhorn! So, this year, there was an opportunity to go on a adventure in Europe with my son, & while doing some researching of where to go, what to see, he found out about the scenic train trip, called the Glacier Express...and it departs from Zermatt! So that is what we did! Yay...I finally got to see most of the Matterhorn! Will go back one day and see more...hopefully it won’t take me as long to go back next time...

The Ice Palace and movie were nice little treats. The advertised tubing was really nothing but an 8 foot slide on a rubber mat.

The restaurant and souvenir shop was crowded and as you would expect overpriced. Still the ride up and views on a clear day made it all worthwhile.

It was awesome to see the glacier, and people skiing in the summer. There is an ice tunnel right beneath the glacier which has some very cool ice sculptures.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"Zermatt in summer offers a selection of activities and if you have only 2 days, it is difficult to chose. For sure, you need a good weather to enjoy outdoors and views. I arrived to Zermatt on a rainy day when our Glacier Express was cancelled and in the morning the departing passengers found out that the train line from Zermatt was also overrun with rocks and water- do not plan the morning or mid-day flight when leaving from Zermatt, as the weather could be unpredictable. However, 2 days in Zermatt were sunny with great views. Many reviews mentioned that cable car Matterhorn Express is too expensive and tourist trap. I believe that it worth the money with wonderful views on the way, ability to stop at exchange stations and walk around, as well as you could chose hiking part of the way back to Zermatt. I enjoyed all of the above and especially the view of 29 peaks at the top. You also getting 50% discount with SwissPass, whereas Jungfrau offers only 25% discount (still recommend to go there on a nice day, as many activities at Jungfrau are included in the price).

The views get better as you proceed up the railway line, but for the best views of the mountain sit on the right hand side of the train when you're ascending.
There's a restaurant at the top with usual high prices but it's worth the price of a coffee to sit and take in the view.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"Seriously? Reviewing one of the most famous mountains seems a bit odd but, it gives me great pleasure to do so — simply to be able to rave about it.

From Zermatt, from the ski slopes, from our hotel, the mighty Matterhorn dominates the views. It photobombs every image. In clear weather, on a seemingly cloudless day, it’s summit may still be shrouded in a mysterious wisp of mist. On a cloudy day, it may surprise by revealing itself completely. In winter it rises up from the pristine snowscape in towering splendor; in summer, it challenges climbers to summit.

You can’t grow bored of this iconic image of Swiss beauty! There’s something that draws me to this mountain — and I can’t wait to return in January next year.

We had a lovely lunch at the Sunnegga buffet restaurant (it is not all-you-can-eat but self-service). The view of the Matterhorn complimented our meal perfectly.

There is Wolli Park Leisee right next to the funicular exit. Make sure you don't miss it. A free and self-service elevator will bring you up and down in 1min. Besides the playground for kids, Leisee which is one of the 5 lakes from the popular trail and its reflection of the Matterhorn are absolute must-see.

It took us about 2 hours to hike down back to the Zermatt village. Had a really good time. Highly recommend. Completely doable even you are not staying overnight.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"My wife and I recently were able to finally make it to THE Matterhorn - in person. As most of us have in the States, we grew up “knowing” about the Matterhorn, but far fewer of us actually imagine going in person to see it up close.

Well, as part of our recent tour of Austria and Switzerland, my wife and I DID actually get to see it. Up close and in person. It takes a few ski lifts and gondolas to actually reach the summit (or as close as we could get).

Let me back up.

The day we went to see the Matterhorn, we were blessed to have a sunny to partly cloudy day. In short, a wonderful day to visit. There were terrific views everywhere you looked - on the way up and the way down. I got some wonderful pictures.

After all the lifts, we went to the highest place open for non-skiing tourists, the Panorama Deck. Don’t let the sunny condition fool you. Even if it is sunny on your visit - like it was for us - if the winds are blowing fiercely - like they were for us - you will get COLD.

However, it was a unique and enthralling time for me. Not only did I get some incredible pictures, but I also took a 360-degree picture with an iPhone app I had. Also, with an app on my iPhone, I was able to record Longitude, Latitude, and Elevation (12,737 feet). Yes, I took a screenshot. I did have to keep my head, though, because the wind was quite fierce and I did not have any gloves. I do regret that I didn’t do a short 360-degree video as well as a picture.

After our visit to the Panorama Deck, we went inside the Glacier and saw the spectacular glacier - from the inside. There is even a short “slide” you can take inside the glacier. I must say, though, that the incline was not steep enough for it to be fast. I had to go down using my feet to pull myself down most of the way. I did, however, do a video of “my sliding down an incline inside the glacier” for posterity.

Well, if you’re like me and my wife, you may have heard about the Matterhorn your whole life and never thought you’d get to see it in person. Remember, it may actually happen one day. Do not miss out on the opportunity if it presents itself. You will be ever so glad that you did.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"There are adventures whos memories will stay with you and a visit to the Matterhorn via Gornergrat is one of them. Here is what you should know:
The town is called Zermatt. Its a Ski Resort town with many hotels and restaurants. Should you travel there by rail consider taking the Glacier Express. You train will terminate at the Zermatt depot. As you exit the station the cog railroad station will be on your left. You can take the train or walk up should you be in shape and have time on you hands. We took the train both up and down due to our short stay. Make time to get off the train at any of the many stops on its route. Check a map for stops that may interest you. I suggest take the train up and make stops on the way down. But weather may conditions might alters that suggestion.
When you get to the top the view is incredible, we stayed for several hours enjoying the view, having lunch and taking in the sunshine. The weather was beautiful and only a light vest was requires for outdoor comfort. In retrospect, we made an error by not getting off the train at one of the many stops. One of our friends got off half way down and walked to the bottom . There are other stops which may appeal to you, so before you go up, check out a map and see what stops appeal to you. Our error was thinking ""Zermatt sight seeing"" and shopping.... bad idea! Lots of pricy shops, ski resort buildings and restaurants. Use your valuable time in seeing all that the mountain has to offer.

You start after a brief train trip to the town of Zermatt after which you take 2 different cable car journeys to the 3884 m summit of this magnificent mountain. The first cable car stops at a lower level to allow you to acclimatize yourself to the thin air and you are recommended to have some hot chocolate and chocolate to assist in this process. We duly complied and then took the 2nd cable car which is a very new addition to this outstanding journey.

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"Pictures can never entirely capture the essence of an event or nature's beauty..... or in this case, the majesty of the Matterhorn. The feeling that seeing this dazzling giant rock in all its glory is something that has to be experienced in person. While I have seen pictures of the Matterhorn aplenty in the past, nothing compared to actually viewing this icon of Switzerland for the first time. It was pure unadulterated magic!

Yes there are literally hundreds of other mountains in the world but the Matterhorn's unique configuration makes it stand out and totally worth the time, money and effort it takes to visit perhaps arguably the most photographed mountain in the world.

So breathtaking and mesmerizing is it that we spent a good chunk of our time staring at it from our hotel room, in between ski runs and while exploring Zermatt. We were lucky enough to have had 3 clear days out of the 5 when we were there last month. Though it snowed for the first 2 days, it just added to the nostalgia of the holidays and when it finally cleared and allowed us to witness what we came to visit for, it was simply scintillating!

And while I still stand by my claim that pictures can't totally capture the essence of nature's beauty, that didn't stop me from taking photographs of such serene beauty that will forever be seared in my memory.

Photographing the mountain during sunrise and/or dusk (as you can see from the attached pics) produces some really stunning and rich colors and contrasts. Having said that, even daytime shots from any angle is sure to elicit ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" (maybe even the occasional ""wows!"") from even the most jaded of travelers.

For us who do not ski, we can go and view the matterhorn and take many good photos! there are 2 ways to see the Matterhorn: Taking the cable car up to Matterhorn Glacier Paradise OR taking the Gornegrat Bahn.

Cable Car up to Matterhorn Glacier Paradise allows you to see the Matterhorn super up close when you are in the cable car. It does not bring you to the top of the Matterhorn, however it brings to the Klein Matterhorn (another mountain top) to view the Matterhorn. There is also an Ice Palace at this place which contains of Ice Sculptures and an Ice tunnel where you can slide through. We went during winter and that day the tunnel was closed, we did not managed to try it. There is also a walk-way around the restaurant, however due to the heavy snowfall the day before, the walk-way was half-closed.

Gornegrat bahn is a train that takes you to another viewing point to view the Matterhorn from further away. It also allows you to walk around the area and do a hike down. highly recommend one to do the hike down from the Gornegrat (last) stop to the next stop.

We did the above two activities in one day! Because that was the only clear and sunny day we had when in Zermatt. It was just fantastic!

1. Check the webcam before leaving - no point in visiting for the day if the mountain is hidden behind the clouds.

3. Watching your francs? consider only going up to Riffelalp and walking out to the hotel there for a great view

Switzerland,The Matterhorn,5.0,"Both are great ways, especially for those not into winter sports or hiking, to go up higher from Zematt to in order to view the Matterhorn & surrounding peaks.The cog railway [ outside the main line train station ] is nearer most shops/bars/restaurants but the cable car is further out at the other end of Zermatt.
Cannot decide which one you would prefer to travel on?
You can do both separately and what is not that well known is that during the summer months you can do both in one trip rather than having to do & pay for 2 different trips. It is also cheaper than paying for the cable car & cog railway separately.
What you need to do is buy a ‘Peak2Peak’ ticket at either the cog railway or cable car booking office but it is important to check first that this option is available as it is only available in part of the summer.
I would recommend starting (as we did in July) with the cable car going right up to the top station - Matterhorn glacier paradise. [ 3,883 metres ]
Then after walking up to the spectacular viewing station you travel down to the cable car station at Furi where you transfer over on another cable car to the Riffelberg cog railway station and travel up the cog railway to the top station - Gornergrat [ 3,089mtres ] before returning on the cog railway down to Zermatt.
Also don’t forget your Swiss Travel Pass if you have one as it reduces the ticket cost by half

They are good for 30 days and cost around 120, but for our family they paid for themselves quickly. In Zermatt we were on the cable cars every day - lots of hikes, the mountain is even more amazing in person, the town looks like Disney created it. Lots of fun. Also there is a really neat salt mine tour about 90 minutes a way worth a visit

The half way station has a restaurant as does the top.
Take your time getting to the top as it 12,000 + feet and gets some getting use to.
At the top is a viewing platform, worth the effort with the altitue effects to go to.
The restaurant has great food to warm you up.
Venture into the ice cave and see the sculptures and go on the ice tunnel slide.
Dress WARM gloves hat jacket , even if its warm in Zermatt it will be freezing up there.

Travelled up the mountain in a cable car to the Matterhorn Glacier experience which was simply amazing. There is a restaurant and also toilets there which cost 2 euro to use.
The cost per adult to catch the cable car is 110 Chf per adult. We ended up getting off at Schwarzsee and walking some of the trek towards base camp which is fine if you go at your own pace. There are some areas where the side of the path is quite steep and if you have a fear of heights you may be challenged.

On the day we visited, the peak was hiding in the clouds so we had a look round Zermatt. This wasn’t an issue because the scenery all round is outstanding.
This is a bustling lively town with many interesting things to see. There are quaint old wooden houses and lots of shops to look in.
Zermatt has a small museum dedicated to the climbers and a beautiful church behind which many of the fallen climbers are buried. You can take a cable car up into the mountains. Also there is a train which takes you up to a viewing point where you can take some spectacular photographs.
Near to the church is a little park with specially designed viewing benches so you can recline and look at the Matterhorn whilst you relax.
Beautifully decorated buildings typical of the alpine areas with colourful window boxes help to make zermatt so attractive.
At the station there is a small shop selling amazing baguettes and pretzels.

We travelled from Montreux to Zermatt by train (about 2.5 hours) and checked into a hotel. Zermatt is at an elevation of 1,600 meters. Good weather is a prerequisite for viewing the alps. And the weather was predicted to be cloudy. Nevertheless, we took the famous cog-train (about half hour journey) up to Gornergrat (3,100 meters). The train ride is spectacular. And when you get to Gornergrat, the vista is breathtaking, even with clouds. The weather Gods were kind to us and after about an hour Matterhorn revealed herself in all her pristine glory. Wow!! What a sight.

There is a hotel up in Gornergrat, for those who want to stay there (Kulm hotel). They also have a cafeteria-like restaurant where you can buy food & drinks. You can then sit on the observation deck, sipping a glass of wine and enjoying the sights. But for a better view, go up beyond the observation deck - just be a bit careful because there are ice patches in the snow and they can be slippery.

For the best views on the cog-train, sit on the right while going up & on the left while coming down

We followed the advice of dranujkiran previous TripAdvisor review on this page. We headed beyond kirchbrücke bridge / church street onto the overhead passing of the Gornergrat train, and stayed there from 5am to 6+am when the sun rose fully.

A tip for those who came to zermatt before the sunrise trains (all routes to sunrise) start in probably early July.

The mountain it’self is definitely a five star visual, but so many days during the year clouds coverr up the mountain and odds are high that you could be disappointed, and in my opinion, while the town itself is interesting, spending more than a day or two would have had me going absolutely stir crazy. Sure, you can ski year round, but the conditions are not what I would call must ski conditions. There are so many other great resorts with better snow, better facilities, and quite frankly, less expensive. While staying in Zermatt can be relaxing, it is just such a small, tourist driven resort that after a couple of days should really should be out exploring and getting the full flavor of Switzerland . To summarize, yes if you are visiting Switzerland you must stop here at least for a day trip, but I can’t recommend an entire week trapped in Zermat with so much other great country to explore.

Jump off on the second to the last stop, Rotenboden station, for amazing views of the Matterhorn reflecting in the pond. Unfortunately, in May, the snow had not yet melted, the lake was still frozen and no reflection was possible. The day was not very clear as well, so this is the best shot I was able to get.

We chose to only buy the tickets to reach the summit, paying 15 chf thanks to the region discount we got.
After arriving at Harder Kulm we decided to take the hike to the very top of the mountain, which took us approx 45 mins... But we were rewarded with lovely views.
After going back to the platform and taking the usual pics we climbed down the mountain for about 1.5 hrs before reaching interlaken ost and the train station.
It's tough even downhill, I still have very stiff calves and I suggest you to wear hiking shoes as twisting your ankles is very easy.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,1.0,"BEWARE! I’m sure most of you are accustomed to keeping your train ticket with you after boarding as you may need it once you disembark the train to be allowed out of the train station. This was not my experience in most Swiss train stations but it is the case here. If you misplace your ticket (or your phone dies etc) after riding up in the Harderbaun you will need to pay again to be allowed to go down, otherwise you will be forced to walk down. This is assumed and therefore no heads up is given about this. I assume people walk up to Harder Kulm and can try to board the Harderbaun to go down, which I was unaware of before my phone died and my e-ticket was thus unavailable. I was thus essentially trapped on the mountain. Probably a rare occurrence. The Harderbaun operator was unnecessarily condescending and unhelpful about the situation as you can imagine with ticket checkers. I was able to return later with my e-ticket to get the extra ticket refunded (out of principle) so I’m thankful for that. Otherwise you should enjoy the visit in a clear day, except for being packed like sardines in the carriage. I just hope this saves some of you from unnecessary headache. Cheers

You can of course walk up/down the 3.6km or so but most people take the funicular and that was the big let down for me.

We bought tickets back in town at the train station. Arrived to find a huge queue but then saw there are two routes 'pre purchased tickets' or 'no ticket'. Immediately this is crazy since there are ticket machines right there in the street..Everybody can have a ticket there and make on line. We took the much smaller 'pre purchased' queue and found that people were buying tickets further up the queue and the queues then merged.. It was just pretty chaotic. People in the wrong queue, people pushing in, general crush near the actual train.

Even buying the tickets in advance we waited an hour.. And yes, another hour to get back down.

If I went back I'd walk but the steep train is part of the fun.

The only draw back from the whole experience was the funicular train getting up there, masks had to be worn which is good of course. Although this wasn't really being enforced and a few people did seem to have their masks on under their nose! Fair enough they can't police this - but I really thought capacity would be limited to half full maybe, just to help maintain the distance between people. But no, it was standing room only and they kept letting more people on! We felt very uncomfortable with the situation - so much so that despite buying a return ticket we decided to walk down! It took us about about an hour and a half, we weren't totally prepared but had sensible walking shoes on, so we went for it! Have to say it was tough but worth it (no way I was getting on a crowded funicular again!). Views were amazing on the walk down, so all in all amazing to do.

In a pair of boots, a jumper and a handbag, I wasn't equipped to say the least, so do your research before giving it a go. Needless to say, had we had the proper clothing and equipment, it would have been a lot easier to ascend, but nonetheless we enjoyed every minute - although it really does show you how out of shape you actually are!

Starting from the Interlaken Harderbahn, there were options of different gradient for the lower section. Generally the winding dirt road was less steep than the trail. The different routes eventually converge into a single rather steep trail that leads to the top.

Top section was muddy and slushy with a small amount of snow. Could be slippery. It was disappointing that the toilet at the top was closed.

The views of Interlaken and the two adjacent lakes were lovely and impressive, even after our visits to the 3000m high Schilthorn and Glacier 3000.

The second day, we took the funicular which was much easier and faster since we wanted the view. Definitely worth it since we had the Jungfrau pass and it was 1/2 off. It was rather beautiful! But, do keep in mind it's a bit of a tourist attraction. There was a traditional Alpine horn player and singers which was delightful. There was quite a crowd to navigate to get to the lookout for the view, and quite a long line for the Instagram shot people were trying to get, making it a bit tougher for those trying to take in the views.

The 8 minute drive up in the funicular was great. The driver was friendly and answered some other tourists questions in proper English. After arriving at the top of the ride, it's a short walk to the viewing platform which offers you amazing views over the surrounding two lake, Interlaken and the alps. We decided to walk down, which takes around 1 1/2-2 hours through the woods with plenty of benches to stop. There is a restaurant at the top, although we didn't stop there for lunch.

Also the menu said “fondue for 2” but when my Swiss friend questioned the amount of potatoes brought out suddenly the waiter said the “menu was wrong and this was fondue for 1 but he didn’t charge us for 2” however the price on our tab was the same as the price on the menu. If not for the view and the live entertainment this would have been a complete dud. The staff was RUDE. It would have felt rushed if not for the insane wait.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,4.0,"Harder Kulm is one of those places that, unless you are a regular to the Interlaken region, you are likely to visit only once. If you are not fit enough to hike up the steep hillside (getting down may be more painful on the knees), then you are going to have to pay for the cable railway to carry you up. It costs a lot (even for those of us with half-price cards) and therefore I highly recommend you only do this on that perfect day when the views across to the the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau and the Brienzer and Thuner lakes are uninterrupted. This may not be best to do in summer - when it is likely to be both hazy and crowded. We chose the ""perfect"" autumn day, clear, deep blue, cloudless skies and no waiting time for the cable railway.
Unless you are hiking on, a couple of hours are enough to enjoy the magnificent views and partake of the local food and drink on the sunny terrace.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,3.0,"Some things to know if going. First, it's pricey: 38 chif, 19 chf with Swiss Pass, and value will depend if you are going up only for the view or view and meal. Second, it can take a while to get up, and it can be crowded. We were there early and not peak time, and we had to wait for two lifts before we could get on, with about 15 minutes between each. The crowd at the overlook was so thick it was difficult to get on. With many taking 10+ selfies at the end of the metal overlook, it really wasn't worth the wait to go to the point. Third, check the weather conditions if going for the view. When we got to the top, due to fog/clouds, we could only see about 30 ft. Fortunately, we walked the 50 minute trail at the top, and the view had cleared by then. Fourth, as with any such attraction where there is a monopoly on the food, the restaurant and snack area are pricey. If taking your own food, know you will find no where to sit because signs at both the restaurant and snack area tables indicating no outside food is permitted. If we had not done the circle trail, which is shaded and offers other views of the area, it would not have been worth it. The trail takes 50 minutes, if a good hiker, and has both a steep ascent and descent. Like a lot of ""touristy things"", it is pricey and crowded for what you get. But, it does offer good views of the lakes.

The two way ticket is 38 CHF which in my opinion is expensive - you do get discounts with travel pass. There are web kiosk options which allow you to book tickets on your own. If you plan with good time - you can hike down from the top. and well if you are interested in hiking - you can do all the way up and down and save the 38 CHF. The hike down is indicated as 1H45 MINS in terms of indicative time there. You have to go to Harder Kulm Station near the Interlaken OST. You can't buy tickets at the Interlaken OST.

And it didn't turn out to be bad at all. We drove to the funicular railway in Interlaken and bought tickets (pretty expensive, a ride in a 1904 railway line, but chic, cost us 75 francs for 2 adults and a child, under 6's go free). Pretty easy to get tickets. It's about a 5-8 min ride up. We got out at just the right time and took all the good pics because within 15 min the place was all clouded up. There is a viewing platform where you can take nice pics of yourselves and the scenes around. There are several trails in all directions for you to hike, starting from 25 min to 5 hours. You also have the choice to hike down your way to Interlaken, it's about 1 hr 45 min. It was too wet and muddy to do the hike down so we did a short one upwards, around 1 km and back. There is a restaurant sande a small cafe. It was a good trip, but if the weather was sunny, maybe we would've chosen to do a proper hike down.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"Highly recommend taking the funicular train up the mountain to the top of Harder Kulm. You can buy tickets at the visitor centre in Interlaken or at the Funicular station. The station is a short walk through Interlaken town, towards the Ost train station, before you get there you turn off, walk over the bridge across the river, and the funicular for Harder Kulm is right there, and well signposted. 5 minute walk from centre of town.
The trains run regularly, up and down, so not much waiting.
At the top, there is a short walk, approx. 200-300m of mildly steep, and then flat to get the the Harder Kulm restaurant and viewing platform.
You do not have to eat at the restaurant, you can visit the viewing platform anyway.
The views out across Thunersee, Interlaken itself, the mountains in the distance and then Brienzersee are absolutely stunning. The lookout platform hangs off the side of the mountain. This was really worth doing. We took some amazing photographs from here.
There is a restaurant, a kiosk for drinks, and toilets. Be aware that it is very popular, so gets very busy.

While this is but a fraction of the elevation of other venues the placement in the valley is exquisite and we found ourselves staying much longer than anticipated. Even if you plan to explore the snow cap regions this is a ""Must See"" stop on any itinerary.

The more ambitious part of our group hiked up the mountain in a bout 1 hr 20 min. Either way you get to the restaurant you will be rewarded.

Anyway the ride up to Harderkulm fitted into the 'blooming expensive' category. Nonetheless, a great ride up (incredibly steep) and amazing views from the top. Is a slightly odd non-Swiss way, whilst the departure times were all marked on the TV screen the actual train departures seemed to be a bit more ad-hoc.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,4.0,"Lovely trip on the funicular, although very busy with tourist groups and crowded - we had to stand both going up and down, but managed to secure a window spot so we could take in the view. It is a short trip. The funicular was a great source of fascination for my five year old and staff were friendly in answering questions. On disembarking there is a short walk to the viewing point and restaurant. The viewing point gets very crowded at times and people were often queuing for a photo opportunity. We decided to go in to the restaurant and order some food. A short while after the viewing point cleared considerably and we went to take photos without queuing - try to time it just before another funicular is due to disembark and all the people from the previous one have dispersed. We visited in the evening and had a meal which was excellent. Waiting staff were friendly and attentive, and there was entertainment from local musicians dressed in traditional dress which was entertaining without being intrusive. It was nice to watch the sun go down from the summit. On a clear day it would have stunning views.

We didn’t expect the food to match the views but it came close. The salad was a standout, artistically arranged on large colored glass square plates and garnished with grated cheese.

It's really good for all the Uncles & Aunties, family with little kids, & those with disabilities who have difficulty hiking, walking etc. It's a short train ride up. You see a basic ""summary view"" of the whole of Interlaken which really is unbelievable. The cost for a full roundtrip price ($40) for the train ride I think is way too much (if you can hike up for free then good - like one hour). Probably not more than total 3 hours (including 8 min train ride up & down) as part of your day. Sunset is awsome & I believe the last train down is around 9:30pm so make sure you time it.

The funicular ride is fun in itself, but the real awe is at the top, where the Zweiseensteg (Two Lake Bridge) extends out 4,300 feet above the valley to give stunning views of Interlaken, Lake Thun and Lake Brienze.

Its about a 10 minute ride up to the top and if you are like me and decide to walk down the path back to the bottom just for the spectacular experience, it is about a 2.5-4 hour walk down. depending your speed of walk and how you handle the rugged terrain, but worth the experience.

Limited space in each car so if the line stretches to the rail crossing good luck to you. Fabulous views on top, signage could be better as there is a round the top circular walk, but it did not indicate distance nor give a time estimate. Not much to do atop Harder Klum except enjoy the views or have a beer/coffee at their inflated prices.

There is a webcam btw showing live footage and i thought i could use that to avoid foggy conditions but the weather changes so quickly that such planning is useless. We were fortunate enough to not have a foggy or cloudy evening. we stayed there for a bit til lights came out which was nice but view in light was better. The two lakes and the town in the middle looked superb from that height. unfortunately, people were so interested in taking selfies that it spoiled the other viewers time and mood. some yobs also were misbehaving after being drunk, jumping on the platform trying to shake it or bring it down maybe. but that was over soon thankfully.

There are mountains in one direction, and Thunersee and Brienzersee, the two lakes in Interlaken, in another direction. There is a platform you can walk out on and some lounge chairs where you can soak up the sun while watching many paragliders sail effortlessly by. You can also see the park where they land. If you want a drink or a bite to eat, the panoramic restaurant has a nice menu where you'll likely find whatever you want. My husband had a salad and I had a burger. Both were very good as were our beers. It gets very crowded and tables are first come first serve so you may have to hang around until one opens up.

The monorail takes you through a tunnel to scale a good elevation of about 40 degrees. At the top you have an amazing panoramic view of Interlaken. There is a restaurant as well and you better not smile at them for I think it is considered rude! Anyway, the restaurant offers good choices for all pallette. I can recommend cheese fondue.

However, don't be lazy and hike the mountain :) According to the signs it takes 2h20min (but if you are fit, you can do it in a half of that time) from the bottom station of the funiculaire and goes through a forest.
I have been there many times (also doing it as an evening hike).

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"Harder Kulm is Interlaken’s premiere attraction. When you arrive in Interlaken Ost Station, it is a 5min walk to Harder Kulm funicular station. Plan in advance as the funicular leaves every thirty minutes. For example, it leaves at 11:10AM and 11:40AM (and follows in this pattern). The ticket line can get quite long so get there early. Additionally, getting there early will get you a seat as the funicular does not have many seats and you may be forced to stand. Having a Swiss Travel Pass makes things easier and more affordable.

Once on Harder Kulm the view is stunning. There is a restaurant and a souvenir shop at the top.

Quite expensive fee at CHF 38 for a return trip.

It pays to prebook the tickets or buy them at the main train station as you will save time queuing. The signage is not good, but if you have tickets you can simply squeeze buy and get through first.
The view from the top is incredible, but I would only recommend it during fairly nice weather- definitely not in rain. There’s a nice circular walk which takes about 60mins, it’s not always easy terrain so good shoes are a must and the hike is not suitable for push chairs.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,4.0,"We went there by car and parked at the OST INTERLAKEN parking lot. Cost less than 10 for around 4hrs.
There are 2 options to the top.
1. Walk from parking to harderbahn station where paid 38chf return journey on the Funicular train.
Or pay 19chf one way to the top and return on foot (hike)
2. Hike your way up and down

Once the Funicular drops you at the top, there is a bit of a hike to the harder kulm.

We chose to pay the return. It's worth it.
The view and experience starts from boarding the Funicular. As it ascends, you get to enjoy the view of the town, lakes and mountains.

At the top 1320m above ground, the view is amazing. Mountain ranges, fresh air, some breeze from time to time, view of inter connected lakes etc etc.
Just flabergasting.

There is a restaurant but we settled for a slush and ice cream from stalls.

I believe it disable friendly. Just that after the Funicular drops you at top the hike is not on a smooth road and a little help pushing wheel chair wouldn't be bad.

Wonderful experience in all.

Children could make it if you take the road but the actual hiking trail is pretty steep and there are not many flat areas but the scenery is beautiful. We are semi-athletic guys and we made it in good time but it was definitely a workout. The food (particularly the swiss hashbrowns with ham, cheese, and a fried egg) was the best food I have ever had, not to mention ""the coldest beer in Interlaken"" with the most beautiful view you can get without jumping out of a plane. You can watch all of the people who are paragliding and see both lakes with ease.

The staff were not helpfull at all, also making me go downstairs to signal the ambulance since they did not want to leave the counter (to sell tickets).

We were participants of a train tour with strict time constraints, and our group was meeting at the train station at 1pm for departure. We had to coordinate the times for catching the funicular down to ensure we caught up with our group. My son and his girlfriend arrived at the very last minute, causing some angst on my part. Harder Kulm does have lovely views, and is worthwhile if the weather is good. It is best to go early to avoid clouds building as the day goes by.

The journey is really cool, the funicular train station is 5 min walk away from Interlaken OST (East) train station. The inclined train takes you to 1300+m height at a gradient of 64%... pretty steep... right.

Nothing to worry about, it’s very safe and you literally do not feel it. When you reach the top, you can enjoy amazing views of the Interlaken and surrounding peaks.

You can also enjoy nice lunch or dinner at Harder Kulm restaurant while enjoying scenic views.

Give yourself about two hours if you plan to eat at the top when planning.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,1.0,"Only one word to describe the experience here - disgraceful. For the price, the service we received was abysmal. The staff were rude, inattentive, unprofessional and showed a clear favouritism towards locals and certain groups. We never received any bread at our table, while a table of locals next to us were given 3 baskets with 6 pieces each for a table of 3. When we asked if we could have some bread, our table of 6 was reluctantly given 4 pieces and we were told we would have to pay for butter if we wanted it, although the table next to us received it willingly at no charge.

As far as the food was concerned, our mains were almost inedible. The cordon bleu was overcooked and chewy. The spaghetti bolognaise was disgusting and the Weiner schnitzel tiny and bland.

The service though was by far the worst part. We were constantly neglected, even when requesting the attention of the waitresses. They were too busy playing gags with each other and rolling their eyes at requests from patrons. If I could give this negative rating I would as it's the worst dining experience I've had and close to the most expensive (when taking into account the return trip up for 6 people). If it wasn't for the location this place would be out of business in less than a week.

The staff never asked how anything was, and I'll bet they're glad they didn't because they could see our obvious displeasure and were clearly used to it. If you do decide to go up for the view I suggest you AVOID the restaurant as it will leave a bad taste in your mouth...

My husband had beef tips with vegetable rice, and I had the grilled salmon bites with salad (Fitness Teller). The servings were quite generous, and both entrees were delicious! We desperately needed exercise after all that, and opted for the trail to Ringennberg (although we turned back after about a half hour's walk since it was very steep). There are many trails to choose from, with varying distances . Don't miss this enchanting experience!

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,3.0,"The short ride up a cog railway resulted in a fabulous panorama on a clear day! As much as we loved it and would recommend that travelers do this activity, it was very frustrating to see individual paying guests being pushed aside for tour groups. We (and several other families) had paid for tickets and were waiting to board the train when a very large tour group came in, had their vouchers collected, and then were allowed on train ahead of those already waiting. It was 1 small train with about 3 sections for passengers and the group took up most of the territory. That left us to try to find standing room together (up AND down mountain) for the train ride.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"If you are near Interlaken, Harder is a must. This is one of the oldest, steepest, and most interesting funiculars in Switzerland and not to be missed because of its remarkable panorama of Interlaken, Lake Thun, and the Oberland mountains. It’s also one of the most easily accessible attractions of its type.

By the way, if you have a Swiss Pass, this is NO LONGER free, but it is 50% off. The base is easy walking distance from Interlaken Ost Bahnhof. The restaurant at the top is very good and surprisingly reasonable for Switzerland.

It's not EMPTY either but I was afraid of crazy crowds on the platform, which there weren't any. The funicular runs every half hour and is very timely...so even if it's not completely full and there are loads of ppl on line, they will still leave at the scheduled time. You can buy tickets right at the funicular (if you have a Half Pass card, it is valid here so take advantage of the 50% off savings). The restaurant at the top is decent. Harder Kulm is definitely worth a visit!

While the scenery and views from the train were fabulous, the funicular to the top is the way to go unless you are very very fit. It’s a little pricey at 38 francs or so per adult, but after we were told it takes 1.5 hours just to hike DOWN we opted for round trip. Hardier souls might want to tram up and walk down.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,1.0,"The trail up was beautiful and quite an achievement with a gorgeous view on top. However, I had hurt my leg and needed to go down on the cable cars but me and my friends had no tickets because we didn’t know you had to pay and we didn’t have money b/c our hostel had just recommended this hike without telling us the cable ride cost money. So we asked the man driving the cable car if we could just go down and he rushed us into the car without even mentioning anything about paying. When we got to the bottom however he forced us to pay even though he hadn’t told us he would charge us. We explained our situation to the blonde ticket lady and she was EXTREMELY rude and threatened to call the police even though she could clearly see I was hurt and we had no money (btw with our hostel discount and only the journey down it was 12.50 chf each and we had 4 ppl) and it was a clear miscommunication by the man working the cable car. They are horrible people and couldn’t have been more rude and disgusting. I recommend not taking the cable car at all and just be prepared for a hike that will surely get you in shape.

All the aspects of the visit, from the train that takes you to the mountain top or the viewing platform , everything is just very nice. Travelling up the hill in the panoramic train or tram, whatever you may call it , is a very nice experience. Slowly with the rise in altitude, you start getting a birds eye view of the entire interlaken city and even both the lakes on either side of the city. When at the top, the viewing platform offers a breathtaking view of the valley and the entire city.

We had booked our ""Indian"" dinner at the restaurant, which was a disaster. But again that s not what it is famous for.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,4.0,"Make no mistake, the trail to the top of Harder Kulm from Interlaken is not a ""walk in the park"". The trail rises steadily from the Harder Kulm funicular station to the restaurant at the top, with an elevation gain of over 2000 feet in less than 4 miles of hiking. The signage is generally good, but I'd recommend having a GPS based guide like ""All Trails"" on hand as there were a few places where the choice of direction was not entirely clear. With those caveats out of the way, let me say the hike was delightful, passing mostly through forest but with the occasional meadow and periodic openings to look down on both the town and a few of the parasails gliding over it. We were fortunate that it was a cool, mostly overcast, but dry day. Nonetheless, we were all sweating from the exertion. The effort was worthwhile, though as we were rewarded at the top with a chance to sit down and enjoy the view and a few refreshments. We elected not to challenge our knees any further and took the funicular back down (you can buy your ticket at the station.)

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"Harder Kulm was our first discovery in Interlaken. We arrived in Interlaken with lots of daylight left. So, we dropped off our luggage at the hotel and chatted with the reception staff. We asked about places to visit and the man suggested Harder Kulm. Interlaken felt a little disorienting, but he gave us directions by bus and it was quite easy from there.

We could see the Harder Kulm mountains and lots of paragliders from the bus stop. Luckily, it was a nice sunny afternoon !

Arriving at Harder Kulm, we needed to get Funicular tickets to go up, which cost us around $60 Canadian. For starters, Switzerland is not a cheap place to visit and Interlaken is no different. Although the ride felt expensive, it was well equipped with huge glass windows all the way around. This gave us the opportunity to have an amazing view all the way up the mountain.

Arriving at the top, there is a trail which leads to a panoramic restaurant. It's really cool because you can have a drink or food, hot chocolate for example on the balcony overlooking the mountains and lakes of the region. At the top of the mountain, it's one stunning view after another !

If you don't care about the restaurant and your idea is only to get a nice view of Interlaken, you should head to the V shaped viewpoint. You'll know that you're on the right deck if you see a random statue of a cow near the edge. This is the ultimate viewpoint and it offers amazing views of Interlaken, the valley, mountains and rivers around.

According to Wikipedia, Harder Kulm is a viewpoint at 1,321 metres (4,334 ft) in altitude. Located in the Berner Oberland region of Switzerland, overlooking the towns of Interlaken and Unterseen. In case you didn't already know, Interlaken stands for between lakes. Because the town is right in the middle of two lakes.

Our Ratings
Serge: 5 Eli: 5

Recommend: Yes, really beautiful views across Interlaken and a great way to explore the city.

Tips:

1. We visited Harder Kulm during spring, and even though it was a nice afternoon (around 16oC) in Interlaken city, it felt much colder at the top of the mountain. Make sure to bring a warm jacket.
2. We felt the restaurant was on the expensive side. But if you the budget for at least a hot chocolate it’s worth to sit down, relax and get an amazing panoramic view.
3. The funicular accepts Credit cards, just check the opening and closing times on their website. When we left at the end of the afternoon they were almost closing. This way you leave yourself ample time.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"We took the funicular up, we met a guy later that hiked up, he was ex Army and said he would never do that again. let me tell you, I don't blame him, as we went up, it was almost a straight shot up, super steep. You have to pay to go up, we had the Swiss Travel Pass so we didn't have to pay. When you get to the top, the view is magnificent. I can't say enough, you have to experience it for yourself, there is a large fake cow that stands at the end of the walk/ ledge which is fun. You can just sit up there for hours taking in the view and trying to get pictures to show what it's like but you will never get ""that"" picture, it's just too beautiful. it is colder than below so bring appropriate gear.

We went there around 12 in the noon and there was a 45 minutes waiting time to board the chain pulled, trolley equivalent for going to the top. There is a nice restaurant on the top and some great spots for clicking pictures. Cool place to hangout when visiting interlaken.

Switzerland,Harder Kulm,5.0,"This is definitely a must while in Interlaken Switzerland. Its is a very easy excursion, located right in the city. You will take the funicular for an 8 minute ride to the top for only 32CHF for round trip, or if you have a Swiss pass, it is half price! Here you will get spectacular views of the Jungfrau region. Around 6 pm you may also be lucky to experience traditional Swiss music. They also have a hotel there on top, the Harder Kulm, meaning on top of mountain as well as a restaurant with fabulous food, a little over priced, but not more than you would expect.

We took the ost trail back and it loops into the original trail about halfway down. A good workout and easily doable for anyone that’s done hikes of that that distance. An option is to take the gondola up or back and hike the other way.

Alternatively, you can take the funicular up the side of the mountain and it will take about 10 minutes. It will cost roughly Fr.25 per person to take the funicular round trip and it leaves every half hour at 10 after and 40 after. Once up on top, the views of the Jungfrau are simply amazing. On a clear day, you can indeed see forever. To the right you’ll see the take off location for the paragliders and you can spend hours watching that activity. You won’t find this viewing area in many parts of the world. Be sure to include this on your trip. I would highly recommend staying there and finding a comfortable place to view.

You have to take a funicular to get up here (tickets are about 60CHF per person, but you would get 50% if you have a Swiss Pass). Absolutely worth it. In general, Swiss transportation is worth every expensive penny they charge for it and you realize this very quickly after just a couple of days in the country. Swiss pass is the way to go without a doubt if you are planning to explore for more than three days. It literally pays for itself in less than 48 hours.

The Harder Kulm funicular train station is just a short walk from the Interlaken Ost train station. Be sure to wear walking shoes, as the waking path from the funicular station to the lookout and restaurant is not paved and it is on an incline (not ideal for strollers).

We got to Interlaken, dropped our bags at the hotel & went straight to the Harder Kulm. We got up there about 4 p.m. and was lucky enough to be there for sundown and grabbed the last tram back down the mountain. IT. WAS. AMAZING! It was simply one of the most awe inspiring, breathtaking views I've ever seen. We built a little snowman up there as well. If in Interlaken, do no miss out on the chance to take this tram. ....and I was highly skeptical on the restaurant at the top since it's a ""tourist"" place but the fondue was deeeeelicious! and actually much better than the fondue we had in town the next night.

So I could not find much of interest as I walked through the entire museum in about 45 minutes. Hence the 3 stars. They have torches and medals from every year, uniforms/sportswear/items from many many athletes, some opening ceremony costumes, ways to test your athletic abilities. If you've ever been a fan of the games or any athletes, you might find this interesting. But if you're apathetic, skip the museum.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),5.0,"My girlfriend and I came here for the day and we had a great time.

The museum and history and role of the Olympics is very special to both of us as we were both Games Makers at the London 2012 Olympics. Whilst we did not work together or become a couple until after the London 2012 Olympics we both have a connection that will always bring us together. During the London 2012 Olympics my girlfriend was based at the aquatic centre and I was based at the main stadium.

Getting to the museum was fairly easy as we caught the train from Geneva and got off the train at Lausanne and walked across the road to the Metro which was also quick and easy where we got off at Ouchy Olympique . Once we got off the Metro there was no signage to the Olympic Museum which was disappointing but we did ask in the tourist information shop adjacent to the Metro station where staff were happy to help including they spoke good English.

As for transport in Switzerland I would advise people to purchase a Swiss Rail Pass before they come to Switzerland as this is easy given you can use the Pass on trains, buses, metros and to some museums and just ensure when using your pass you have your passport with you for each journey as on some trains my girlfriend and I undertook we saw some people who did not have a valid ticket and had to buy a new ticket and were also fined.

Once we found the Olympic Museum and climbed up the steps to the entrance we had a look at the view of Lake Geneva and the Alps and whilst the weather was inclement the view was simply stunning. As we climbed up the steps we noticed the steps were engraved with when and where past Olympics had taken place but the engraving was not easy to see/read and might need to be touched up. We did not look around the grounds/gardens due to the wet weather.

When we were inside the museum we did not have to wait too long before we started our exploring and we left our belongings in a locker and this costs 1 Swiss Franc for one locker and you might need to have some change with you unless you go back to the desk and get some change. When we arrived and started our tour we also both commented to each other the museum was not busy and could walk around at a leisurely pace.

I would also advise visitors to go to the toilet before they start their tour as there is only one set of toilets on the floor where you can leave items in lockers and yes you can go to them as and when needed but you have to go through the whole museum to re-join your party as there is only one way in and one way out to each floor and there are very few staff on hand on any of the floors to help or engage with. If you do go to the toilet please take your ticket with you as you will need this to re-enter the museum as the gate to the first floor has a barrier.

As we looked around the museum we were very impressed as there was plenty to see, read, learn and hear about the Olympics including the ancient Olympics in Greece. We also enjoyed how the story unfolded and saw many items of Olympics past and present including shoes, swimwear, kits and others items that money cannot buy but evoked memories of times that will live on forever.

We also enjoyed looking at the Olympic torches over the years and the medals athletes win if they medal as if there was ever a reminder of the dedication, commitment and energy these men and women give to their sport this is it as medal or no medal every athlete is a winner for my girlfriend and I as to qualify, compete and represent your country on the world’s stage is a huge achievement and to say you were there is an honour very few people do.

That said my girlfriend and I were a little disappointed as there were no references to some of the greatest Olympians like Jesse Owens, Mohamed Ali, Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis and not because these people are black but because of the stories that they told people at their times. We also noticed there were very tributes to people like Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah, Chris Hoy, Steve Redgrave, Kelly Holmes, Daley Thompson and many others and whilst there is always a dilemma on whose story to tell given we all have our heroes and heroines or even role models but the legacies of these people must be told and shared.

If that wasn’t enough there were very few tributes to the Paralympians such as Jacqui Freney, Sarah Storey, David Weir, Hannah Cockcroft and once again as with the above there is always a dilemma on whose story to tell given we all have our heroes and heroines or even role models but the legacies of these people must be told and shared as after all we all know the International Olympic Committee is based in Lausanne and the museum is the largest of its kind in the world.

We also felt there was not enough about the volunteers of the Olympics/Paralympics as without sounding bias or subjective as the former International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said at the Closing Ceremony of London 2012 “the volunteers are the difference between a good and great Games and the face of the Games” and volunteers work very hard and tirelessly to ensure athletes, coaches, the Olympic Family, the media and the public have the best of ourselves by giving up our time to help others day in day out no matter what the weather or unexpected events may arise at all venues including for long hours or early starts or late finishes.

On the final floor of the museum there is a chance for visitors to have a go at some of the activities and see how good you are at certain tasks. Once again there were very few staff around and due to the popularity of having a go at tasks they get very busy or even are addictive as people try and better themselves against others or themselves as individuals.

Regarding the museum shop my girlfriend and I found the shop very disappointing in that there was not a real choice of items to buy except keyrings, t-shirts, erasers, postcards and other small bits and pieces. There was also a small section selling items which might be sold at the next Olympics’/Paralympics in Tokyo in 2020 and both my girlfriend and I were very disappointed given the shop could have sold more items to take home with us and act as a reminder of how special and unique the Olympics/Paralympics is.

All in all the Olympics/Paralympics remains in our hearts not because the London 2012 Olympics bought us together but how sport can bring other people together from all walks of life no matter who they are, where they come from or what they believe and in a world that is often destructive or disturbed by events that change and challenges lives, values, philosophy, meaning or even its existence it is important to remember the times that unites us than divides us.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),5.0,"I've never been super into the Olympics. But I was in the area on a gray day, had free entrance from my Swiss Travel Pass, and since it's so famous, I figured, why not?

This place is amazing. The design is gorgeous. I was blown away. The exhibits were fascinating, and it was so cool to see all of the medals from every year, and all of the torches, including the Rio one signed by members of the refugee team.

I honestly teared up a little (probably partially because I was overtired, but still). The museum does an amazing job of showing what the mission of the Olympics really is, and what it means for the world. I was so inspired.

There are displays of Olympic memorabilia from all over the world, an exhibit of Olympic torches (displayed in chronological order), stories of amazing feats of athleticism over the ages, and much, much more. We found Swiss children gathered around a small monitor intently watching clips of the 1992 American Dream Team basketball win. Please see photos.

We loved our visit here and spent more than 3 hours here. The location is also perfect, opposite the beautiful Lake Geneva. The museum is split into 3 levels showcasing the origin of the Games, it's revival in modern times and the journey undertaken till it's present form today. There are so many fascinating facts and ideas that you'll not be bored for the shortest while. Even the kids did not complain- they enjoyed learning and playing the interactive games. For example, it was thrilling for me to learn that the Olympic torch is relayed from the ancient city of Hera in Greece to the host city by thousands of runners before the beginning of every Games and the route taken is never ever the shortest! This starts months in advance. I saw a video where the team was riding on a sled in the Arctic! Goosebumps!! Salute to these heroes!

My favourite part was the ""Olympic Spirit"". It's back breaking work that has gone into the conception, management and upholding of the basic fundamental values and to ensure equality, fair play, inclusiveness in the Games. The motto is simple, yet mighty in its ethos. Inclusiveness and excellence in sport over one-upmanship and victory over others.

The museum enthralls with over 7000 AV shots and slides. I'd highly recommend.

We worked with Vincent, head of hospitality there, and he was terrific to work with. Very professional and accomodating, and helped us put together a group tour along with a picnic lunch.

TOM (The Olympic Museum) should not be missed when you're in this region of Switzerland. We spent a morning there, but easily could have spent a whole day. The setting alone is worth it, with an expansive view of Lake Geneva, along with the garden and grounds around the building.

We loved watching every bit of the displays of athletic ability, determination, and accomplishment. My main issue is how much of a rah-rah booster tone there is for the IOC. The clear message is that every city that hosts the Olympics sees a long-term economic benefit, and that the Olympics improves human rights around the world. I guess I don't expect them to fully address the many instances where that isn't the case, but they could at least be more upfront that not everything is perfect. For example, if they acknowledged the bribery scandals, and talked about how they were moving forward more honestly in the future, that would help a lot with the public perception about issues with the Olympics. Also, when I see detailed displays about the 1936 Berlin and 1972 Munich Olympics that don't give even a mention about the major sociopolitical issues that most people associate with those events, it makes me wonder what else I don't know that has been omitted from this ""history"" of the games.

Lockers are available that are large enough to store suitcases or backpacks. A nicely appointed cafe, Tom's Cafe, provides great food and drinks. We left with a sense of awe and inspiration. For anyone who appreciates athleticism and competition, its a must-see.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),5.0,"We had actually heard from friends that the Olympic Museum was, to them, disappointing, so perhaps our expectations were low. We found the experience to be educational, uplifting, and fun. There are a lot of historical items, from Pierre de Coubertin’s own fencing outfit to Jesse Owens’ shoe to Jim Craig’s game jersey from the 1980 Olympics. We also enjoyed some of the interactive displays, like trying to shoot before and after exerting as in the Biathlon. The museum is in a park setting and the views of the Lake and the statuary and flowers are beautiful. I marveled at the height of the pole valuation and high jump bars near the entrances.
Overall, well worth the time and admission price.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),5.0,"The name gives it away, isn't it. :)
And it has more or less everything that comprise the Olympic spirit.
It is a place of special significance for me, as I work in Olympic sport.
The museum is wonderful and houses so many memorablia, simulation games, artifacts old and new - even a cigarette with the olympic rings from the mexico 1968 games, when such sponsorships were allowed!

While the inside of the museum (what you pay for to go in) is great - so is the outside, which is more like a park and can be accessed free.
The location is as good as it gets, 200 m from thhe Ouchy metro station overlooking the lac leman and the beautiful alps. you go up a spiral or can take the stairs - all the ways being aligned with bronze statues and sculptures related to sport and then you reach the main terrace - built in style of the Temple of Zeus of the ancient olympics.
There are several super-kid-friendly things - such as a 100m track - with a pole vault world record pole placed at the start (my 4 year old goes there and looks at how high that is for hours!), 2 short puts - 1 men and women to make you experience how bloody heavy those balls are, with the world record markers. Basically several stuff that gets the sporty soul in you (and the kids) to understand what level of performance would an Olympian need to throw that heavy short put THAT far!

There is the flame, of course.

For the locals, of which I am one, it offers a lovely escape of doing nothing on a sunny weekend afternoon!

I have always visited the inside for free (some invitations, and it was free for a couple of months/weeks when it was renovated). The price is 18 CHF for adults (16+ years); and 10 CHF for kids 6-16 years.

If ever at Ouchy - which I reckon you would be at least once in Lausanne - then do drop by and feel the Olympic spirit.

They have a lovely restaurant too, but then you are spoilt for choice when in Ouchy.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),2.0,"I do not care much for the present Olympic Games - so called. They are nothing but big money-spinners and the billions invested earn even more. I can recall 1948, when they were held in London where I was a child growing up after the war. They were open and honest. The Swiss, who kept out of it in order to bank the war profits, re-invented the games, all based on a soppy myth about Zeus. There were no games in ancient Greece. Just men learning to kill each other. This bland and expensive to enter museum reflects nothing more than pat on the back for a Swiss nutter and his close pal, a monk, who cooked up the whole idea at the end of the 19th cent. Kids might have fun. I saw a lot of kids there because it was half-term. They looked bored stiff. Kids like playing real games. Not seeing them in a dark lit museum. There is one area which shows how the images for the games have developed. This was well presented and worth the visit.

No doubt a lot of information can be found on the net, once you go there, you will be surprised to know that the Olympic was can conducted along with a city fair once upon a time as there were no takers and the athletes did not even know that they were participating in the olympics

The Olympic fire and the evolution of the torch, all the torches are displayed. Man no doubt has progressed. The medals too are displayed. I personally felt that mankind’s ego is always bloated, the medals have become bigger in diameter and weigh much heavier in the recent past. To know that the ancient athletes were give olive leaves crowns and were honoured by the city they represented.

There are a lot of audio video presentations which can be enjoyed on ones choice

Special applause goes to the exhibitory, giving the visitor an up-close look at present day relics from still active athletes. And don’t be afraid to include lunch with your tour, because the Museum’s restaurant is top-notch; good menu selection, good food, good service, and good price. A well deserved gold medal for a visit to remember.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),3.0,"I was a little underwhelmed by this museum. It was OK but it could have and should have been so much better.

It follows the current trend that every museum must have the lights almost totally turned off, what is that about?

Then its spread across multiple floors and really had to figure out (in the dark). We had a child in a pram. But there was only 1 pokey lift between floors. No escalator just steps as an alternative. Not very senior or child friendly.

The displays were pretty average, OK all the torches (yeah interesting), all the medals (fine), all the quirky mascots (really).

I think what was missing was any display on famous sportsman and achievements over the history. I guess that tough to pick winners and sports without offending......

But there was way too much on the people who run the olympics this was homage to the olympic federation rather than the olympics.

Could have been better, much better.......

This especially organized part on the Winter Olympic games of 2018 carried out by South Korea gave an extraordinary inside on the history, the today and the future of South Kora and its adjacent neighbour North Korea.
But also the rest of the museum is a wonderful, especially as it is often interactive with the visitor, place to inform oneself on the history of the Olympic Games, from its first steps to today’s political institution it has become.
It is worth every minute you spent in it, and definitely worth revisiting.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),5.0,"This is a ""must see museum"" if you are in Lausanne. It plots the history of the Games from Greek times up to the present day. It shows incidents from various Games. The Time-line gave great information regarding participation of various groups, the introduction of new competitive sports and incidents which occurred throughout the ages. On display there were photographs, mascots, torches and a wide variety of sporting equipment. One piece of equipment which created interest was the bicycle used to win a Gold Medal and then you can read how the technology used to create that bicycle was subsequently banned. Touch screens are everywhere. It is a great museum.
As you leave through the front door (after four hours minimum) you realize that you are walking under the Record Holder's High Jump bar -- a photographic record is necessary to show others how high the Cuban gentleman jumped. If you are short there is at least a metre between the top of your head and that high jump bar.
Now that is food for thought.

The museum itself is thoughtfully organized: one floor about the history of the Olympics, from its origins in ancient Greece to the present; the second, about the evolution of the games themselves, and the various competitions; and finally, a floor dedicated to the Olympic spirit (the Olympic village and how athletes train). Many exhibits and artifacts, well curated and presented. As we are from a city that hosted the Olympics in my lifetime the experience was especially meaningful. The only minor negative is the café: acceptable food and service but, even more than most museum cafes, overpriced.

Towards the end of the visit there are various tests and things to try, such as balance games, reaction times ect. Good fun but can get quite crowded in this area, as most people want to have a play.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),5.0,"We had a great visit to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. Our first stop was the museum café. We arrived after the brunch time on a Sunday (and the brunch was very popular and busy), so we had to order from the lunch menu, which turned out to be fine. We ordered panini and white wine, and we were satisfied with our meal. The lemon tart for dessert was delicious, and my husband loved his dish of the Albertini ice cream dessert, which turned out to come in a large ice cream dish with whipped cream and wafer waffles.

Since we arrived in the later afternoon (our train to Lausanne had unfortunately hit someone on the tracks, so we were delayed two hours while the investigation took place) we had less time than we wanted to go through the whole building. With the time we had, however, we went through each floor reading and watching as much as possible. Had we pushed every button that offered info, we would have been in the museum for another 3 hours, I'm sure! The bottom floor is the one most appropriate for those with young children--there are many interactive exhibits that will entertain kids from 3-4 years old on up. The higher floors are more challenging for youngsters. We didn't have any in tow, but by observing all of the families trying to keep their kids entertained on those other floors, we could see it was difficult.

The special temporary exhibition of sports photographs was interesting. We would have loved going through the exhibit at a more leisurely pace. The museum says it closes at 6:00, but they start herding people out of the photo section more than 15 minutes before that, so be aware. I think they should honor their 6pm closing time, and if supervision is an issue, make sure their spaces are better staffed. No visitor wants to make all the effort to come out there just to be kicked out before the advertised time.

The outdoor sculpture garden is beautiful. There are many bronze sculptures, photographs, and large visual art pieces that are fun to look at. Plus, the view of Lake Geneva from the garden is stunning. Bring your camera!

The exhibitions are slightly out of context - there's not much attention paid to the way the Olympics have been used as a political or propaganda tool in the past, so there's nothing much about Olympic controversies.

While it's appeal is inevitably going to be greatest for those with a specific interest in the games, it has considerable appeal to all of those who have experienced the excitement of the Olympics in our city.

The museum is set in elegantly landscaped gardens which include a fine collection of sculptures and which features the name of each Olympic venue on the stairs leading up to the museum building which is a fine work of architecture in its own right.

The museum features displays of the history of the Olympics from ancient Greece to the modern era and uses a full range of high tech presentation techniques to highlight outstanding achievements and explain the development of the games across its wide range of sports. High levels of interactivity enable visitors to test their own capabilities and proved very popular with the younger visitors.

Truthfully I was a little underwhelmed, as I guess I expected a bit more. Where was the memorabilia from Michael Phelps? Usain Bolt? I thought I saw Simone Biles's outfit but it was from a Chinese gymnast I've never heard of. The exhibits and artifacts seems to be presented a bit randomly.

Also, you're supposed to go through the exhibits in a certain order - take a little time to make sure you do so you don't accidentally miss anything.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),4.0,"We enjoyed the museum. Cost 18 SF + 5SF each including audio guide. We spent 2.5h looking at exhibits covering the rise of the modern Olympics: a fusion of UK Public School sport activities and insight into the loss of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The whole project was spearheaded by a visionary Educationalist, Pierre de Coubertin. The progressive development of the summer, and later, Winter Olympics is then told. The background development of proposals, bidding and fulfilling contracts, the finance derived from broadcasting and the political ambition to be a harmonious construct from the outset help contextualise the setting of the modern games.

Much is devoted to iconic sport figures and you can watch many video and listen to audio clips about stars from the past and present: from Jesse Matthews to Franz Klammmer and Husain Bolt to Torville and Dean. While all of the museum has interactive zones the final level has many interactive exhibits. This floor covers life in the Olympic village including topics such as diet, psychology and developments in equipment that have aided athletes in their quest for gold. There is an interesting section on drugs in sport and ethics if sportsmanship.

We went to the cafe. Stunning views across the lake: unusual at this time of year. Pricey and waiters not
particularly helpful. It good ambience and furnishings with a stunning terrace.

For those who like shopping I would judge ship as average.

For 5 stars include audio guide in cost and improve service in cafe.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),4.0,"A visit to Lausanne would not be complete, without seeing the Olympic museum.
It is relatively easy to find, located on Quai dOuchy, which runs along the banks of Lake Geneva (Leman).
The museum itself is located at the top of the hill, so be warned it is a relatively steep climb up the steps (I suspect will be a gold medal for elderly travelers to get to the top, but take your time, as it is worth it). There are exhibits as you make your way to the top, but the highlight is the 100m track at the top, at which you can pace yourself against Usain Bolt's world record time ... good luck!
It is not cheap to go into the museum, but we were able to get the family ticket, which made it a little bit more palatable. The museum is located over three levels, and you start at the top and work your way to the bottom. For me, the highlight was the second level, where they have outfits, shoes, equipment worn and used by a lot of well-known atheletes. Also there is a display of the different torches used in the relays for each Olympic Games, which is fascinating to see the different sizes, shapes and designs.
I would recommend leaving yourself at least two hours to go through the museum - and importantly get value for the ticket price!
Do yourself a favour and visit the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.

The museum itself is well-designed and very interactive. I went there with my significant other and we enjoyed it, but I can imagine that children would absolutely love it. It was quite expensive for a student budget (18 CHF for adults and 12 CHF for students), but the weather was dreary and the museum was warm and inspiring (even for someone who doesn't care about sports) so it was worth it.

The museum is easily accessible by metro (Ouchy-Olympique), so you can combine it with a trip to the center of Lausanne (Lausanne-Flon) which has nice shopping streets and loads of restaurants.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),3.0,"I am happy that we had a Swiss Travel Pass and didn't have to pay an admission. The top floor, which highlighted the revival of the Olympics in the late 19th century, was very well done but the second floor, which showcased actual Olympic athletes and history-making moments was lackluster and seemed an afterthought. There was no clear delineation between events and it was somewhat of a mish mash with an odd variety of equipment/uniforms from mostly less-than-famous athletes. They could have done so much more!

The layout is a bit unusual as well. One starts on the top (third) floor, which is the history, then down one floor to the second which is about the athletes and is actually, amazingly, smaller than the top floor. Then down to the lower level which is a replication of an Olympic village.

Unfortunately, when we left the second floor to use the restrooms, we had difficulty finding the appropriate entrance to the lower level and decided we'd had enough and left.

Switzerland,The Olympic Museum Lausanne (Musee Olympique),4.0,"It is quite educational if you can read and if you understand English or French. So for small kids under 7 there is no point to visit. It is a lot of written text about the history of the Olympic Games. On the -1 floor there is a few exhibits (2-3) kids 6-10 yos will find hands on. Otherwise it is a lot of movie clips and texts, really educational for adults.

In my opinion this museum should be a free museum. They get so much sponsorship from corporates. It is probably a non profit org which means it is not taxed. There is not a lot of people working on site, helping you. At 18 CHF a person, it is quite a rip off. Even kids have to pay 10 CHF. The Lausanne mibili card only gives you only 1-2 CHF discount.

A fantastic telling of the Olympic story with hundreds of artefacts from its history. Our 2.5 year old also enjoyed it.

There is also a lovely restaurant on the top floor with a great view of the lake. It gets busy so would suggest that, if you are there at a busy time of year/day of the week, you go straight to the restaurant to book a table and then go to the museum. Takes around 2-2.5 hours to go around.

We visited the museum just before the start of Rio olympics. The museum itself and the outside area are fun and informative and there were many Rio related features and an exhibition about the Rio olympics and Brazil, this was interesting, fun and artistic. admission to the museum and this exhibition were all free, there were several interactive exhibits the kids enjoyed and we did too. there's a cafe at the top with beautiful outdoor seating area and lovely views of the lake, we had coffee an ice cream there (very good quality) , this was a nice end to the day. we were too tired to walk back to the station instead we took the tram back to the top to main shopping area in Lausanne and the station.

The night before we were to leave for Lake Como, some of the veterans of travel approached our tour guide about switching locations to Lake Lugano in Switzerland. We all voted in the morning and paid $25 more for the taxes and we were off to Lake Lugano.
Lake Lugano is stunning. The mountains run down into the very blue lake. My wife and I had never seen anything like that.
We had lunch at the Tango restaurant. the food was good but I had the opportunity to see our waiter in action. His language skills were amazing. We talked to us in very good English and then talked with customers in German, Italian and French. He was amazing. I was told later that the language skills of the swiss very good.
We wandered around and took in the amazing views. We did a little shopping for Swiss chocolates (very good). We watched the locals play chess for a while. (see photo)
One thing to add was that the city was extremely clean. At a much higher level than we experienced in Italy.
Then, we got back on the bus and headed for dinner in Lake Como where we had reservations that we had to keep. Our experience in Lake Lugano was excellent. Our group made a good decision.

There are good facilities for boating and other water sports. A shipping company connects the various places along the lake shore, high frequency in summer, low in winter. There are plenty of things to do for old and young in its surroundings.

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,5.0,"Lake Lugano is a funny shape, several interconnected deep valleys that are flooded. Roughly speaking it wraps three sides of the mountain in the photograph (San Salvatore).
The area we visited was the promenade along the edge of Lugano city. This is pleasant, and has various points of interest such as the Parco Ciani and the fountain. We found it spectacular at night, when the lights of the town are reflected in the lake. There are several opportunities to get ice cream or coffee, and there are boat trips, or pedalos can be rented, at least at weekends. There is a large children's playground in the park (there are three interconnected parks) and a free bathing area. There is also a lido. This isn't a lake you can paddle or swim in, apart from that one 'baignard'. Frequent buses run the length of the promenade, and connect it to the station and the suburbs.
The rest of the lake shore is either small villages such as Gandria or cliffs plunging down into the water. We didn't visit the Italian side and so I can't comment on that.
I'd say the only down side in Lugano itself is a cluster of ugly buildings by the park and lido, with no opportunity to walk around them on the river side. But that's a minor point.

If you walk around the lake and look in the water, you can see many different types of fish. If you look carefully you’ll also see many different types of ducks and other water birds.
We bought a 3 day pass for Fr.59. One day unlimited pass is Fr.49. You can also buy one way tickets for around Fr.20 But I suggest you buy the unlimited pass as once you’re on the boat, you’ll want to get off and on.
On the weekends there are late boat rides bringing you back to Lugano and Paradisus around 11:30 PM. I have posted a picture of the ferry schedules as I could not access them online. Fare information was also quite difficult to find.
Sunset on the boat was amazing! There is drinks service and light food but we brought our own snacks. You can get off at different locations and pick the service back up. You can make dinner and lunch reservations at small restaurants that are only accessible via the ferry boat service. Many of these locations do not have roads that connect to other parts of Lugano. You can get off and also walk around the lake to access different stops and get back on the ferry. We spent the entire day driving the fairies and healing the surrounding areas.

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,5.0,"I'll be honest, it's a little confusing to work out which boat tour to take and which way (clockwise or otherwise) the boats will navigate the circuit (which includes Lugano, Paradiso and Gandria as the most popular 3 spots amongst many others) - just go for the ""Classic"" and I assure you a great day! It's so different experiencing Lugano from the water!

Unless you're on a very tight schedule, allow much of the day for this activity (plus others along the way) and you'll be able to enjoy it as it should be - tranquilly! You don't want to be panicking about timetables and rushing not to miss boats. Part of the reason that I loved this day was the reward for a little exercise and some ""chill"" time on a restaurant terrace and on board the boat. It can be slightly breezy on the boats, so consider a light jumper if you feel the cold easily.

I took the boat from Lugano to Paradiso (very short 5 min ride!) and got off to head up Monte San Salvatore (see separate review) and then got back on and caught the rest of the route to Gandria where I spent 2 glorious hours and then returned on one of the last boats home to Lugano.

If I had my time again I might take Rick Steves' advice (read it after, sigh...) and would go to Gandria first, wander around and have a drink/lunch then have caught the other ""half"" of the tour to Paradiso and been up at Monte San Salvatore around dusk for a lengthy ogle at the spectacular view (sun sets behind mountain about an hour prior to ""official sunset""). After that he recommends a walk along the lakeside from Paradiso to Lugano (1.5km flat walk) perhaps with dinner on the way?

Its probably also worth mentioning here that the boat ride is very pleasant and suitable for those with limited mobility (and glorious in its own right), but there's plenty of hills/steps/walking at both Gandria and at Monte S. Salvatore - requiring at least moderate fitness to enjoy it all. If you're not so inclined - still DEFINITELY do the boat ride, but perhaps get off at another stop other than Gandria for a nice lunch overlooking the water (maybe at ""Grotto Elvezia"") just before Gandria. Ask the pier staff if the boat stops there (or another recommendation).

They serve beer on board the boat and there's a perfect amount of time to enjoy a well-deserved one from Gandria to Paradiso!!! #justsayin

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,4.0,"We decided to spend the last two nights of our Swiss/Italian trip in Lugano partly as it is well positioned for the train route back to Zurich for our flight home (though equally you could fly from Milan). We were not disappointed. It maybe doesn't have the high profile of the Italian lakes of Maggiore, Como & Garda but there are less tourists as a result - or at least there were when we were there in mid May. The waterfront is very pleasant with a promenade and a very pleasant park to stroll through and it's possible to take a cruise on the lake which on a sunny day would have been on our ""to do"" list but not as we had low hanging clouds and some rain (unusual for the time of year apparently). We stayed at Albergo Stella (recommended - see my review) which along with much of the town is uphill from the lakeside). It's a very pleasant stroll through pedestrianised streets past lovely shops and plenty of cafes and restaurants down to the lake and there are buses or a furnicular to take you back up if you don't want to walk (free with a Ticino ticket provided by the hotel). There are some nice churches to visit, art galleries and concerts in the city, easy access by furnicular to mountain tops for great views (in good weather!) and lovely villages a bus ride away. We visited Morcote at the end of the peninsula (voted the best village in Switzerland in 2016) and took the bus to Gandria and walked back most of the way to Lugano on the Olive Trail. We would have liked to stay a day longer to do a lake cruise and go ""up high"" if the weather had been better. A very worthwhile visit.

This hotel is just one of the best in this area, maybe the very best. Smart, great rooms, wonderful views,options of where to eat, lovely grounds and peace and quiet.

I cant think of one reason not to like this hotel. In the many many years we have visited we have had no issues in any way., the public rooms are lovely, the bedrooms/suites delightful, especially if you have a balcony., many rooms have wonderful views of the lake etc. There is a great restaurant, just over the road over looking the lake, which is very good., the hotel has a good restaurant, and when the weather is good, which it is very often, dinner etc is served outside.

WE love it., it is a place we can relax, wander out if we wish, take a trip as well., and a hotel boat short ride to the little town across the lake, as a tiny basement but fabulous Michelin starred restaurant. We try to go ever time we visit Lugano.
On the same side of the Lake, a ferry ride away, are some tiny tiny villages on the lakeside, with some super restaurants, where you can often see them catch the days meals for the restaurants

We ended up going back to the bar by the jetty and had a few snifters in the sunshine whilst waiting for the boat back. We were very lucky the weather was so good it made the boat trip so enjoyable.

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,5.0,"We had a spare afternoon so decided to do the classic lake tour.
It takes 80 minutes but you can get off at any of the stops. The only catch is that you need to then catch the next boat 80 minutes later.
Many of the stops are small but most have a restaurant so you can get off for lunch and pick up the next boat.
The best place to get off is at Gandria. It has a few interesting shops and a nice pottery studio. We found the bar right at the boat wharf the best stop but we had walked up the steep hill to the top of the town.
The boat does serve drinks, ice cream etc and some cruises operate as lunch or dinner trips
An easy trip.

Thought maybe a cab might be a better idea, however cab driver said it MIGHT be 15 francs, MIGHT be 18 francs, but no more than 20 francs, for a 1 mile ride!! After asking a stranger on the street we were able to find bus stop. When I greeted bus driver and showed my Swiss pass I was waved dismissively onto bus. Then, when we were disembarking at stop went to exit at front of bus, did not know we had to press button to open door. Bus driver VERY rude and made a comment ( do not understand Italian) that made another passenger chuckle. Will be leaving Lugano earlier than planned. City itself very beautiful, would have liked to stay for jazz festival but service people have destroyed any desire to stay.

Lugano is quiet and laid back. There are a good number of fairly priced restaurants and a plenty of places to shop. After lunch we walked to a place the locals call the “coca cola bar” because it’s all red. It’s a little shack of sorts on the shores of the lake and about a 10 min walk from the funicular drop off.

There we rented a motor boat (no special license required) for 65€ and rode around Lake Lugano looking at the houses and mountains. We even jumped into the Lake for a quick (and cold!) swim (in late June).

In Summer you may also swim in the lake - or take a pedalo to conquer it on your own. Or take one of the cruise ships and discover the Lake Lugano directly on its surface.

Naturally, the first place to visit was the famed Lugano Lake.

Some places sort of let you when you actually see them. Lake Lugano does not!

As I walking across the road to the lake, I saw swans crossing the pathways on to a patch of green. So much different from seeing humans crossing pathways!

I sat at the lakeside for a while, just enjoying the gentle sway of the water and swans swimming by. I also looked around. Everyone looked happy and contented. No one seemed to be in hurry.

I was forced to look at my watch as I had only a few hours in Lugano and I had other places to see.

So with a sigh, I started walking, but the nice thing was that I walked around the lake to my next spot, which was the Parco Civico, which was also on the lake!

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,4.0,"We were planning on taking the funicolare from the train station and heading straight to the old city, but when we tried to get a ticket the machine wouldn't accept Euros of course, but there also was a huge cross on each and every credit card brand you can imagine. We tried to get tickets from the office upstairs, but the waiting line was huuuuge. So, we just took the stairs until we had no time to take more stairs (see photos)

The best thing about this place is how clean it is. Como is so close, yet in Lugano there isn't even a disposed cigarette on the ground. There were some very interesting chocolate shops around the train station area, but, again, no credit cards for some really strange reason. Like, 10 euros for 100 grams, I'm offering you the money for this hoping the chocolate is divine and not overpriced, and you're not accepting credit cards? The only place in which the accepted Euros was for going to the toilet. Yep. They really do want to keep the place striking clean.

My kids loved how people spoke different languages in Switzerland, how they'd sell chocolate and then near it pretzels, so even just for that our visit was worth it.

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,5.0,"Unsure how to spend our third and final day in Switzerland armed with a Swiss Pass, it was recommended we take a train to Lugano for a day trip. The train ride was included in a Swiss pass, and the journey there and back provided beautiful scenery of green, snow capped mountains and lakes. It took about 2 hours each way. Lugano itself is a beautiful city with a Mediterranean vibe in contrast to Zurich, Lucerne. Took the boat ride around the lake which was also included in the Swiss pass. Really relaxing boat ride. Plenty of shops nearby.

Tip: there is a fast train which is recommended if short on time. Also recommend using the local trains as oppose to the Eurotrains (packed with limited seating) as the local trains were mostly empty and provided for a quiet peaceful journey.

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,4.0,"We were on our way from Lake Maggiore to Venice when we made a side trip to Switzerland's Lake Lugano. It is a neat little town with its residents still speaking Italian and accepting euros at shops instead of just Swiss francs. However the resident quickly realises he/she is no longer in Italy because the prices are quite high (double) for most everything. We walked past the 11th or12th century Church, strolled along its many streets that had haute couture shops (Gucci, Hermes, Jil Sander), jewelry shops specialising in Swiss watches, fountains in piazzas, high-end hotels,and even stumbled on a produce market. One can ride a tourist train around the city (similar to Disneyland's monorail) or take a boat ride on the lake. We chose to walk around and stop for coffee somewhere overlooking the lake.

Switzerland,Lake Lugano,5.0,"We did a trip around a few of the lakes in Italy but I think Lake Lugano in Switzerland was our favourite. The area is pristine, the roads and parking are better organised and the scenery is simply spectacular with the backdrop of the snow covered mountain peaks.
It's a very wealthy area and a great place to people watch. We went in a bar called 7 which is by the entrance to the park at the end of the promenade. A perfect place to look at the lake, sip a nice cocktail and watch the endless stream of very upmarket cars go by. We lost count of the Ferrari and Porsche and McLarens, Bentleys and the rest.
We didn't realise we would have to pay 40 euro to enter Switzerland from Italy and this was for a sticker that goes on the windscreen as a road pass for 2017...
One word of warning is if you have come out from Italy for the day as we did then be prepared for the car park machines to give you your change in Swiss franc coins which happened to us so if you can have some francs already or pay by card then that's the better idea here.
Would love to go back.

Lake Lugano is close to the Italian border, north of Lake Como.
Visiting Lake Lugano, we found a gem.The lake water was clear & clean with a beautiful blue color. The mountains appear to rise out of the lake to towering heights which presents a beautiful vista. The town has been built around the south side of the lake and up into the surrounding hills. It is more beautiful that I could describe.
There is a wonderful walking path/park around the edge of the lake. The town is stunning with beautiful vistas.
One of the extras is that you can purchase Swiss Chocolates. We stopped at a wonderful place in the town for lunch. The ability of the Swiss to speak multiple languages was amazing. Our waiter spoke to us in precise english and turned to the table next to us and conversed in French and the table behind ours in German. As a one language person, I was very impressed.

After Bern we explored Old Towns in Colmar, France; Heidelberg , Rudesheim and Cologne (Koln) in Germany; Amsterdam The Netherlands and Ghent (Gent), Bruges (Brugge) and Brussels, Belgium. The old city of Bern is unique among this group. All are wonderful and fun to explore. Unlike all but Bern, the old city sections are many meandering narrow streets. The Bern Old Town is primarily a single main curved street with a single long over-sidewalk arched structure on each side of the very long wide street with beautiful center street water fountains. This aspect alone makes Old City Bern well worth seeing and enjoying the many unusual shops therein. Recommended. PS., Be sure to go downhill all the way through Old Town to the beautiful Aare River Bridge, cross over halfway, look down to the bank ahead for the live Bern City Mascot Bears roaming the riverside as seen on Flags throughout town.

Old City is all very walk-able as it is in a rather condensed area. We took a paid tour from the visitor center as we arrived after the free walking tour had started. Our tour guide was excellent and highly recommend using them. We started at Bahnhofplatz and proceeded to Zytglogge Clock Tower then on to Bundesplatz area and the Aare River and circled back around to view the Berner Münster and wander up Kramgasse back towards Bahnhofplatz.

theres three main parts to the city, the huge plaza, from there u go the famous clock, then a big Street goes down the hill towards bear pits, and then you can go up the hill to the Rose Garden.

There's trees for shade for going up to rose garden and a cafe at the top, so it's not too hot, but I wouldn't want to do it in the middle of the day.
you can also walk up hill from the main plaza, across the bridge to the Kursaal hotel at the top of hill and access their balcony for free and take some good pictures.

if you are feeling very energetic you can catch a tram to the forest and get a 360 view from there. I think it is number 9.

you can also walk along the River towards the point where there is the swimming pool, near the boats where floaters pull out. there is a tram that brings you back up to the top of the city and you can walk down towards the bear pits again

We did a self guided tour (from the tourist information at the train station) taking us around all the main points of interest. Managed to see one of the bears in the bear pit. An enjoyable day spend exploring.

This definitely limited our tour of the old city, sticking mainly to shaded areas. The arcades and shops were great, the Parliment/Gov. center building was lovely and the views from the terrace over the river were also lovely. Many interesting fountains, and yes they provide potable water. We happened to be near a clock tower near the hour, so got to see the little mechanical display. All in all a worthwhile trip and if it had been cooler would have toured more. Lots of restaurants and gelato places to satisfy hunger pangs.

It's little hard to me to find the way from Mc Donald at the Bern Station to the old town, because i'm bad at finding way. Ah, be careful when you go on the old town because of tram.
I like the Zytglogge so i waited to 5pm to see the clock rang. Many people waited with me. But i wonder the western clockface including some tram cabling can harm to the Zytglogge.
The town is so peaceful, cute :) you can buy many lovely souvenir from the shop around there. You also can visit Einstein's house.

Switzerland,Old City,5.0,"My parents and I spent three days in Bern with impeccable weather - cool mornings and evenings, mild afternoons. Bern is a wonderful town for walking, but you can get anywhere you want to go on the excellent tram/trolley system. We spent a lot of time on the Spitalgasse/Marktgasse/Kramgrasse (one street that changes names), walking along the colonnaded arcades (out of the sun). There's enough to see just walking this path: the historical fountains down the middle of the street, the dormers and window flowers (red geraniums are the business to be in!), the shops: watches, Swiss Army Knives, markets, supermarkets, bookstores, gelaterie, clothes, jewelry, chocolates, pastries, restaurants, cafes. But there are many sites available on this street alone: The Holy Ghost Church, the Prison Tower and Bärenplatz, the Clocktower, the Einstein House, the Cathedral, the Bärengraben, the Aare River.

We would wake up at the Hotel Schweizerhof, have breakfast at a pastry/sandwich shop a few doors down, and then I would put my parents on a tram, and meet them at whatever we were seeing that morning. We'd grab lunch somewhere, and head off for more sightseeing. (Caveat emptor: Unless you want to spend $25 for two coffees and a tonic water, do not dine or even sit down for coffee near a popular tourist site - The Einstein Museum, the Cathedral, etc. As in many places in the world, the closer you are to something people want to see, the more you are going to pay for food and beverage.

Another walk (or tram ride) takes you to the Kirchenfeldbrücke, a bridge crossing the Aare, and to a bouquet of museums: the Kunsthalle Bern (modern art), the Alpines Museum (Swiss alps), the Einstein Museum and the Bernisches Historisches Museum (Bern history), the Schweizer Schützenmuseum (firearms) and the Naturhistorisches Museum Bern (natural history).

And that was just three days!!! Wonderful food, people, culture, and whether you like to walk or not, effortlessly navigable.

PS. Get a Swiss Travel Pass!!! It will quickly pay for itself 2x over.

The view from there of the city was quite incredible. Such beauty of the mountains in the distance made this stop worth our while. When we went, the tulips were in bloom, but not the roses. Hector told us it was too early in the year for them.

We also saw so many incredible sights in Bern - old buildings, interesting architecture - overall it was a fascinating tour of this fine city. Oh, I almost forgot. Hector not only told us about the connection of the naming of the city with the “bears”, but he also took us to see the “bears” themselves. Although it’s a sad situation for the bears, it was a nice treat to be able to see them.

If you are planning to come to Bern, it might be worth your while to hook up with a local tour guide who can show you and explain to you all of the great parts of their city. Hec-tor did a good job for us.

Make sure you remember were you left your car, since it can be confusing. Lately, I take a picture of my spot. Parking in Bern is expensive, however with limited spaces on a street, I felt train station was worthy instead of driving around city to find a spot. We did not see all fountains, but we were able to stop at Zytglogge (clock tower) and listen it chimes in addition to someone playing alphorn. The old city has its charm even at the rainy day.

The town gets crowded in the summer especially during the ""buskers"" festival but even then it's only small portions that are crowded, the rest of the city is easy to get around. To the east of the city is the Bern bears attraction while in the middle is the market area on weekends. There are also ""pop up"" villages created during the winter months and an awesome little ski challet built for drinking local hot wine in the evening times. There is tons of shopping and all the store fronts are very pretty with most having flowered pots hanging from their windows. The best part of old town is all the outdoor seating at the restaurants. It really makes the city feel alive. In the winter there is an ice skating rink in the Bundesplatz. This same area also has a light and sound show in December which is really cool with projections on the capitol building.

Switzerland,Old City,5.0,"As fate would have it, we were in Bern for two days -- one really hot and intensely sunny, the other threatening rain and cool. In both cases the arcades throughout the old town were an absolute Godsend: shade when you needed it, out-of-the-rain when you needed it.

For my part, I wish I had realised what a shopping town Bern is. Had I, I would have booked in more time for just shopping -- not that I'd buy anything or could afford much, but the arcades give a great canvas for setting up beautiful shops.

If I had a wish, I'd want it to be more pedestrianized. It's one thing to work around the busses and trams, or to work around the cars, but to balance them both takes a lot of attention. For my part, I'd have been happier with just the busses and trams.

I was surprised how quick it was to cross the width of the penninsula and how long it took to walk the length of the penninsula. The proportion of the town's dimensions didn't really clue in until it was too late.

The town market is quite fun and in particular to watch the street version of chess and another game with pegs and grids that I had never seen. I was shocked how quickly and quietly the market folded up and the restaurants flowed out onto the platz -- all while we were having an early beer.

Having just come from the size and mayhem of Paris, Bern was such a relief. I have a feeling that it's a delight at any time!

Also make sure to go down to the river level and casually stroll along the river, there are great restaurants down at this level as level.

In the evening, the town comes alive with locals and tourists having drinks at the outdoor cafes and bars, musicians playing, and folks just out walking.

My favourite part is the view from the other side of the river and also from the old town overlooking the river. There are a range of boutique style shops along the Old Town main street, and it was not overly busy on a Friday late afternoon. It had a cobbled street though be careful of the large open drainage gulleys which are a bit of a health and safety hazard! The buildings are very uniform in style and appear of a mildly dark colour, which may not be to the taste of all; it's worth a pleasant walk, but the UNESCO world heritage site tag seems overly generous. The large clock at the end of the main street is covered behind architectural canvasses of the clock faces for refurbishment which will be a disappointment for some visitors currently (March 2018).

Information on my ratings:

5* I give relatively few. Has to be a place I would either go to regularly and consistently provide a cut above the rest, or a place that I may have visited just once and offered a particularly memorable experience or be exceptional value.

4* is a place I enjoy and would tend to go back to if the opportunity was presented. Probably a good level to aim at for a catering/hospitality business, as too many 5* suggests you may be underselling/undermarketing.

3* places - are adequate and I would sometimes go back to but other choices are generally preferred; normally there is obvious room for improvement, usually in the offering and value. It's a brief stop off but worth 30mins or so to look around.

2* places - have issues that make the experience below par,

1* places - hope I don't end up in one of these!

Undeterred, we took a scenic walk along the river and by the time we returned (around six), the city seemed much busier and more lively. Several underground bars had opened their doors and would have tempted us in, had we not been with our very tired 3 year old. Maybe next time.

The city has world class art and culture. The people are so friendly and welcoming. It all seems very intimate. I highly recommend a visit!

It is very well connected to the fantastic Swiss Railway Network, served by both of the main railway companies, the SBB and the BLS.

The old city center is just fantastic, a fact that is well know tho the many tourists coming to Switzerland every year.

On a Gastronomic level, one can say that everybody will find a restaurant that caters for his craving,

Whilst German is the official Language spoken in Bern and the surrounding area, nearly everybody speaks English, as well as French and Italian.

As Hotels can often be fully booked or simply too pricey, just look a little further afield and take the train into the city.

You will be hard pressed to find a better train system anywhere in the world, so, check out the special ticket offers and use it!

During the warmer summer months it's great to just sit outside and enjoy a coffee drink or a beer and just watch the world go by as you relax with an amazing view.

There are some main attractions in the Historical Center so I would recommend picking up a map from the office if you're interested in visiting somewhere more specific otherwise you can just walk around and explore the Beautiful architecture and historic neighborhoods without any Destination in mind.

If you're driving then I recommend parking in one of the many parking garages throughout the downtown area or you can just park further out of the city and take the tram if you're hoping to save a little bit of money.

Switzerland,Old City,5.0,"Bern is an extremely unassuming place for a capital city. It has its modern busy side to it, but walk through that from the train station and eventually it starts to reveal its charms.

Firstly you come to a pleasant cafe / pub part of the city and then a lovely open air market to wander around. Once through this area of the town you walk through the old walls into the old town area.

The buzz of the city you've left behind quickly recedes and the peace and quite of the old town takes over.

Not that the old town is traffic free it isn't. So don't get too complacent when walking in the roads. Also bizarrely every so often there seems to be an uncovered section of drainage in the roads so keep your eyes peeled when walking around.

The old town itself has street after street of every shop you can imagine from high end Lacoste to local seamstresses. All accessible via the lovely old covered pavements that run the length of the streets.

The character of the old town is summed up in these streets as while many are at street level, many more are accessed by going through doors down into a cellar level of shops underneath those on the street above. So there are hundreds of various shops to explore.

There are also numerous views to be had of old churches and clock towers as well as peaceful parks and viewing platforms down to the river below.

With the old town positioned in the bend of the river, bridges afford some of the best views. From one you can see down into the Bear enclosure by the river, but for the most stunning views do not miss a walk across Korenhuisbrug where the snow capped Alps form an amazing chocolate box backdrop to the city's skyline.

I loved Bern. It doesn't inspire the awe of Rome or Athens, and it doesn't ooze the charisma of Paris but in its own way it is very captivating if you get the chance to visit for the day as we did.

You will not be the only one. On the hot days of summer you will see hordes heading upriver to float down the cold (!) and powerful (!) river to any point downstream.

The best float is actually not the most popular- head downstream of the water works and you will be able to float past the best sights of the old town.

Important: the river is very cold, between 19 and 22 celcius. The current is also very strong! This activity is for strong swimmers only.

It has everything you could ask for in shopping, including specialty shops selling stuff that is genuinely Swiss, from wooded toys, to fancy chocolates and watches. The famous clock is there as well as many places to sit down for lunch and people watch. You could also walk over to the bear park and put your feet in the fast moving river after you watch the bears. It's a great way to spend the day if it's raining because most of the shopping is covered. There are a lot of stairs, though, so it's not very accessible to wheelchairs or strollers.

Check out all the fountains and learn about the various designs of the fountains. All the buildings are constructed out of a greenish-beige sandstone. Learn why. Look into the shops on both sides of the arcades on both sides of the street. Go into the various churches and compare the architecture. View the Alps on a clear day from the terraces. There is a lot to see; shops and restaurants abound.

This place attracts a lot of tourists during the day and a lot of business people out on the town at night. Busy, busy. The busyness detracts from the ambiance, I feel.

Switzerland,Old City,5.0,"This was my first visit to Bern and seeing that this is the Swiss capital, I should have made this my first port of call to Switzerland, years ago.

The city can be explored on foot, although anyone staying there a night or more you have the Bern Card available, which means you have unlimited use of the entire transport system for the duration of your stay, and that includes buses, trams, trolleybuses and trains. It is extremely efficient, safe and well kept. Transport runs on time, like clockwork.

There are many fantastic buildings to visit and places to see. The city is extremely clean, something that comes with the territory as it's Switzerland.

The River Aare has special areas for bathing and swimming, and the water is beautifully clean.

If you come across any fountains in the city, you can drink freely from them, and fill your empty water bottle too, again free of charge.

Bern is highly recommended and you will enjoy your visit and stay there.

Behind the arcades some will have just a door to the building some other will have nice little stores. Something that called my attention was a significant number of long staircases leading to a basement containing a store. Got to some of the bridges over the river and enjoy the view from there.

Counted among Europe's best-preserved medieval towns, it is compact and easily explored on foot. With its network of ancient cobbled streets, historic churches, 250 ornamental Renaissance fountains with colorful figures, and arcaded sandstone houses, it is a gem that has barely changed since the Middle Ages. Not to be missed are the Zytgloggetum, the Child-eater Fountain, The Zahringer Fountain, and the picturesque arcades with their low vaulted roofs that extend to the edge of the sidewalk along miles of Altstadt streets.
