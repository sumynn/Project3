Nyhavn,Denmark,"We spent time in this area in our 48 hour city visit. Luckily we had a local friend to guide us. A boat ride is a great start. See a lot of the city from water. (And mermaid!) plenty of coffee shops to try, we didn‚Äôt find a bad one. Evening restaurants probably better away from the front tourist traps. This is not a cheap destination for brits, so take care in selecting where you eat. Some very up market restaurants available if your pockets are deep enough! Shop wine is plenty full and reasonable, but massively marked up in bars. Enjoy, but watch out for fast silent bicycles at junctions and traffic lights. Enjoy.",4.0,Oct 2021

Nyhavn,Denmark,"The harbour is just so quaint. All the colours of the buildings, the multiple boats and the pumping energy just gives Nyhavn a very cool vibe.

Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,We came at Halloween and it was brilliant! I booked entry with unlimited plus tickets online the night before in the hotel. Rides were great and even missed some as I was too dizzy. Rollercoaster was fab. We done both haunted houses and my 12 almost 13 year old loved the whole day/night. Food was reasonable and nice. Smells and decorations really was brilliant. They spend so much time with pumpkins. We hit it lucky with weather as no rain. Had amazing time. Thank you! I also felt safe as some theme parks I don‚Äôt ( apart from disney and universal) .,5.0,Oct 2021
Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,"If I tried to explain this park, I think no words would be enough. I was there during the Halloween season, and can say that it is just magical. The whole decoration is unbelievable. I went there with a friend, and we took the unlimited pass ticket, which was 50 euros, together with the entrance ticket. We went inside in the morning, than went out around lunch and came back in the evening (with the same pass) to see the decoration during the night again, and I think that was the best decision we made. We could not get enough of the whole Halloween experience, even if we traditionally don¬¥t celebrate it.
The rides are fun, not really scary, but children would love them for sure. I am 22 and I loved the whole experience inside, and would recommend the visit to a person of any age for sure.

Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,"The Tivoli Gardens is not what it used to be.

They're now a profit-above-all business that are willing to fill the park way above capacity. Selling expensive free-pass wrist bands while there's a 30-60 minute line for even the basic rides cannot be a sustainable business as there's a limited number of fools in the world.

Getting a proper meal is only possible with a reservation a day in advance, and you're left with basic fast food options, obviously also with a 15-30 min line.

Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,A return visit after 45+ years.

Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,"Tivoli Gardens is a delightful little amusement park, well worth a full afternoon or evening. Although it sits in smack in the middle of downtown Copenhagen, you would never know it. We pre-purchased the ""Skip the Line"" option, but there was no line at midday, mid-week in August, which is the height of Denmark's tourist season. We toured the delightful garden-like setting before spending the rest of our day on the thrilling rides, including their big upside-down roller coaster! We ended having dinner in Tivoli's traditional Copenhagen pub. It was a wonderful way to sample Danish food and drink. Affordable and delicious!.",5.0,Aug 2021
Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,"Tivoli Gardens is a beautiful place but I wish I had imagined it primarily as a garden and not as an amusement park.

As a garden, it's truly worth the price of admission. The old buildings are beautiful and there are flowers everywhere. A lovely place to take pictures and I think the price of admission was worth it for the setting alone. I went at 6pm so I could take daytime shots and then wait for blue hour for the famous shot of the Chinese Pagoda behind the lake. Pics came out great.

As an amusement park, this place, however, is seriously overrated. Maybe I'm just accustomed to more, but the thought of having to pay $15 to ride a C-list roller coaster left a bad taste in my mouth. I've paid $30 before to enter Hersheypark in Pennsylvania and ride ALL attractions (including 14 roller coasters).

Honestly, if you come in expecting Cedar Point, Hersheypark, Disney World, King's Dominion, Busch Gardens, Carowinds or any number of American theme parks, you'll leave horribly disappointed. The main attractions are a small number of mundane roller coasters (again charging $15(!)/90DKK to ride) and then kiddie rides. There's really no in between.

Personally, I'd recommend you pay for admission, walk around and then decide if you want to do the Unlimited Rides ticket. There's a kiosk inside the park where you can buy an Unlimited Ticket, so there's no need to decide at the gate. Pay for admission, walk around, and see if there's enough to justify an Unlimited Ride ticket.

Personally, the gardens are worth it, but the rides are not. So pay the 135DKK for entry, spend 2 hours walking around (it's not as big as other reviews make it out to be), see the daily programming (which I enjoyed a lot), take photos of the old pavilions representing all architectural styles, and grab some food (I'm happy to report the theme park's street food is the same price as outside fast food/street food, which was good to see). It's worth a visit, but come in with proper expectations.

Tivoli Gardens,Denmark,"Well, I mean, you can - but why would you want to? I was lucky enough to attend on a warm, sunny afternoon - on the one day all year that dogs are allowed in - purely by chance. That made the experience even better for me. The place is truly fun with all kinds of games and rides and things to observe. So many people enjoying themselves, really beautiful landscaping, crazy fun things to see and do. A large range of food and drink choices. I am not sure about the price, as it was free on my Copenhagen Card (as was most of what I did on my trip. ) I actually did not ride any rides so cannot comment on those. The park seems well-maintained and clean. If I ever return to Copenhagen I will certainly visit Tivoli again.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"I recently completed a trip to Legoland Billund as part of a specifically organised trip from Scotland. I could not find good information on this in advance, so have provided some here.

I hope other readers find this useful, as overall I had an enjoyable family visit.

Travel options:
- Direct from Edinburgh to Copenhagen with car rental
- Direct from Aberdeen to Esbjerg with car rental
- Transfer via London to Billund or other Jutland airports.

Each option carries with it some level of downside. I opted to travel to Legoland Billund via Copenhagen. This carried the additional cost of car rental at ¬£150, a tank of fuel at ¬£60 and bridge tolls at ¬£60, which was less expensive than the other choices. The car journey from Copenhagen was straightforward, navigated with good mobile data coverage and took ~2.5-3 hrs.

Parking
Daily parking is available at Legoland Billund in multiple car parks. I was visiting for multiple days so took advantage of a ""season car parking"" pass at 160DKK which can be held on your mobile electronically. The alternative is a 60DKK daily rate or 55DKK daily rate in the nearby Lalandia.

Park Tickets
I was planning on visiting the park for multiple days. Daily tickets are available at the entrance for 399DKK or in advance for 329DKK. I would recommend purchase of an annual ticket. The mid-priced Awesome Pass cost 649DKK. This provided considerable flexibility and meant numerous short or half day trips to the park combined with other activities. Tickets were held on my phone in the Legoland App.

There are numerous other ""Awesome"" season ticket benefits, the ones appealing most to me being 10% off the lego shop, children eating free at the family buffet, discounts on tea / coffee at selected park outlets and 50% off the price of the lego driving school.

Reserve and Ride tickets were available were time slots could be booked on specific rides. I did not purchase these and neither did the majority in the park. I would not buy these next time either, as none of the queues exceeded 35 minutes.

Opening times
The park opened precisely at 10:00 am each day and rides closed at 18:00. In October, on rainy days arrival at 09:30 allowed us to park less than 50m from the park entrance and to be the first in line to scan through the gates. Arrival at 09:45 meant a longer walk and a queue of ~8 families per entry gate before gaining access.

Having gained access we found that we could complete about 3 rides with no or minimal queues by accessing the park first of all. The only ride not worth getting to early was Emmett's flying adventure as this waited to be filled up before starting.

Rides
All of the rides were included with the exception of the ""fairground"" style entertainments and driving school at 99DKK (44.5DKK with an Awesome pass). Specific time slots for ~25 children are available each hour of the day and are sold out quickly. On the day I wanted to buy tickets, this was my first stop in the park.

I was pleased that I waited to visit the park until my children had reached 120cm of height. At this height all except 1 ride was accessible (Apocalypse Sky Battle @ 130cm), although some needed adult supervision. The staff were disciplined in measuring children's height and had accurate cm measures on some rides to assist.

For younger children (6-7) the faster rollercoasters (Extreme Racers, Polar Explorer, Dragon) may be too extreme. Throughout my park visits the slightly less extreme Flying Eagle was the most popular and consistently had the longest queues.

A full day at the park would allow you to ride all of the rides desired, but is fairly intense. I preferred taking 4x half days to explore and enjoy the park.

What is there to do for adults?
For adults with younger children <120cm I think the experience would be very poor and cold in October with a lot of waiting around at ride entrances. I saw a lot of adults pushing around prams looking cold and fed up, waiting for the next hot drink stop.

At the >120cm level adults should expect to be able to ride with children and this is a lot more enjoyable. All of the larger rides are enjoyable for adults for the first 2-3 attempts.

Food in the Park
I was expecting strict no picnic rules in the park. The opposite was the case and the park encouraged picnics with set aside seating outdoors. Despite going to the park when it was raining, I found properly sheltered seating where I could enjoy a picnic, but would not want to do this on a day <10 degrees. This worked well to help keep the costs down and allowed a budget of ¬£125 for food for 4 per day to be kept to.

I had visited the large ""Bilka"" in Kolding on the way to the park to buy food in advance. We discovered a variety of good quality bakers in the 30km circle around the park, which opened early and offered sandwiches and cakes. If I hadn't already provisioned, I would in future buy things fresh from these types of vendors daily.

There are numerous hot food outlets in the park. On a colder day I ate in the family buffet, which was free for children with an ""Awesome"" pass per paying adult (219DKK per adult). The buffet was plentiful with salad, soup, hot adult and childrens offerings, drinks and ice cream. I though the quality of the food was average and would not want to eat there for multiple days in a row.

Accommodation
There are various Lego specific (Hotel, Castle Hotel, Village) and non-Lego specific (Lalandia holiday village) options available.

I decided I wanted to be able to travel to and away from Billund each day. Without a car, I think I would have enjoyed the experience less, as I would have felt trapped. I stayed in a small bed and breakfast, which I hav e reviewed separately, 25km from Billund.

As a result, I can only make a cursory comment on the Lego and Lalandia options, which whilst looking fairly glossy and upmarket on the website in reality did not appeal to me. The Lego hotel restaurant, for example, had a very similar feel to the Family Buffet, where I would not want to eat multiple meals a day. The Lalandia holiday village had a strong centreparcs vibe, which does not appeal to me.

Other attractions nearby
- Lego House (15 minutes walk from main car park or pay for alternative parking) Recommend 4hrs
- Lalandia Aquadome (5 minutes walk from main car park or pay for alternative parking). Recommend 3 hrs
- Ribe Vikingcentre (60 minute drive from Billund). Recommend 3 hrs.
- Ribe Watchmen's tour from Weis Stue 20:00 each evening.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"I came with my 6 year old daughter on the train from Amsterdam via Hamburg. Quite an adventure! We stayed in the LEGOland Hotel and spent 2 days in the park with a day at LEGO House sandwiched in between. You have to be strategic if you are going to make the most of it. If you are going midweek and the Danish holidays are over (as they were when we went) then you will likely have short queues and this makes a big difference. Use the app to monitor queue times for your preferred rides and go there when the time drops. On busier days, it‚Äôs worth paying a bit extra and getting the ‚ÄúReserve & Ride‚Äù pass. This allows you to virtually queue while you are elsewhere and when your time is up you can go on the ride and skip the whole queue. Note: this is not available for ALL rides but it makes a difference for a few of the good ones like the dragon, extremes racers and Ninjago. If you are smart you will pack your own food (take a container to the buffet breakfast with you if you are at a hotel - and just be a bit sneaky!). Some tips there that can make a big difference to your adventure! Legoland is great for smallish kids!!! We had a lovely time.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"I was very disappointed to see that Corona situation does not affect this facility! No masks no measures, many people gathered in small indoor places without any protection and no safety distances!
As a park, we really enjoyed all the games and activities. It was a unique experience. We would like to have a second visit, because the time was limited and we did not try everthing.
It is a very nice experience for children and adults. The toilets are very clean as well as all other commonly used facilities.
Very baby friendly also. There are outdoor specific smoking areas, so as all other areas are smoke free.
Even though there was a lot of people, waiting for the games and activities was not very high.
We enjoyed every minute!
After corona, we would definitely recommend that every family should visit Legoland at least for one or preferably for two days!
Check the weather before scheduling your visit.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"Kids 8,12 and 14 started to be a little too old for the park. We visited Tivoli in Copenhagen just before visiting Billund. And Tivoli is more interesting for children who are taller than 130 cm. Besides that fact, they did have a great time. Most raids starts from hight 110cm up to 130cm in Billund",4.0,Aug 2021
LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,It was a fantastic experience. We had 9 rides with my kids and they loved it. They said they wanted to live in Legoland üòä We had hot dog for lunch and it was not as expensive as I expected. Everything was so worth the price. We are planning to come again next year with my sister and niece. But this time I will use coupons üòÖ You can always find some coupons for free entrance for kids during the year.,5.0,Aug 2021

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"We went together with my boyfriend, we're in our 20s and had a wonderful and fun day. For adult programs go to the back side of Legoland and Miniland in the front worth a visit too!",5.0,Jul 2021
LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"We had two days in Legoland, parents and two small children. There is no doubt that Legoland is good for kids, however, the weaknesses are starting to show: 1) the experiences and rides are dated and don't really offer a LEGO differentiation beyond the standard Danish amusement park (sommerlande) 2) 60-80% of the time is spent on queueing 3) service level is mediocre and the best food venues have a canteen feeling to both environment and meal quality, not price. In general, it seems like the resort is optimised for making money rather customer experience e.g. in case of rain, you can pay 20 DKK to get dried in a booth with infrared dryer - well, why not install roofs where you visitors are queuing, so they don't get wet in the first place. It is an OK amusement park but I would recommend to go for the alternatives. it is definitely not worth extensive travel, way too much ""tourist trap"" for such investment.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"We booked advanced tickets as advised by Legoland Billund (park tickets and the restaurant) for a much anticipated August holiday. This was under the guidance that we could enter Denmark if vaccinated. Sadly, the rules changed 10 days ago which forced us to cancel our trip.

Legoland refuse to issue a refund and very generously suggested we come back in 2021. What a great suggestion Legoland Billund. You shut over the winter and it‚Äôs not like we can just jump on a plane whenever for a day-trip to Denmark!

Shame on you.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"I live close to Legoland, and have been a regular visitor for more than 30 years with my children and now my grandchildren. I hate to write this, but Legoland has developed into a real tourist trap. The latest (last?) visit was on a sunny Saturday in the beginning of school holidays. They had one (1) ticket booth open, and we waited in the queue for 30 minutes. We couldn't book online, as we had a handicapped person in the party. After that we waited in line for another 20 minutes to get our negative corona test examined - again only one entrance open. The corona craze is not Legolands fault, but they could have opened one more gate. Entry fee was 499 per person. 1500 DKK, or 200 EURO, the disabled person got in for free.
We got in at 13.30, and had dinner at 17.00. During those 2¬Ω hours we tried 2 of the attractions - each about 3 minutes, the remaining time was spent waiting in line.
Dinner consisted of 3 burgers, one was a kids menu, and three small cola's, and set us back 587 DKK, 79 EURO. The burgers were OK, but the price was not.
On leaving we paid 60 DKK for parking, another 9 EURO. How a family of four manages this, beats me. The only place we have seen longer queues and worse crowd management is Alhambra in Spain.
We regularly visit DOM in Hamburg, and although it is not the same, we get much more for our money there, it is even cheaper driving to Copenhagen and visit Bakken. Disneyland in Paris is cheaper all-round.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"It was easy to book online and even saved us 5 % on the price of tickets. We got 2 children's tickets for free through LIDL. We called Lego to change the date and they were very happy to help.

We arrived 1030 and it was easy to find a parking spot and the entrance was but a leasurely stroll away. We had printed the tickets and entering was fast and efficient. Reviews said that the food was expensive, of varying quality and the waiting time could be long, so we brought all our own food, saved a bundle and snacked between activities, so we did not spend valuable time on waiting for food. We stored a bag of clothes and food in the locker just inside the entrance, but as it was a warm day we ended up not needing it, although we got quite wet during the pirate activity.

The weather was nice and sunny without being too hot, all the staff were very friendly and cheerful and waiting times very low, only one activity took ~ 15 minutes to get to, all others were 0-5 minutes and some we were even able to stay in the activity for several trips.

The app was very helpful in planning the day with regards to wayfinding and waiting time, and there were maps available too.

There were hand sanitizers before and after all activities and the staff were very good at nudging us to use them every time.

All in all an extremely enjoyable day, and we look forward to coming back another time, outside the high season. I believe the key to a successful trip is going when there is not too many people at the park.

LEGOLAND Billund,Denmark,"We we are a family of 4 coming from Copenhagen to visit Legoland and we are very disappointed with the lack of information we receive before booking this trip.
We booked a two day trip with you on the seventh and eighth of May an upon arriving we noticed that all the interior all the indoor activities at closed.
this is quite disappointing because these are the favorite activities of our kids ( 5 and 8) we understand there are Covid restrictions but you should have clearly stated on your website when you put on your website so we can take an informed decision .
I called customer service and they mention that this is detailed on the Danish websites but it is not detail on the English one under covid restrictions.
To know about it I will have to check each one of the rides and the check if all of them are applicable . There is nowhere written i‚Äùall indoors activities are closed or check the rides availability...it is just not fair !

It's becoming a kid again, it's getting as much creative as you can, it's discovering the endless possibilities of creating and learning through LEGOs. My kids were amazed and me too: it was a journey in time, through the values driving LEGO group, in the museum, and a journey through the different sides of creativity in the different areas. And the LEGO restaurant is truly an experience and the food was very good.",5.0,Aug 2021
LEGO House,Denmark,A lot of amazing Lego builds to both enjoy and teach you a bit about Denmark. Furthermore it also has a lot of amazing rides for children as well as some great rollercoasters.

LEGO House,Denmark,"Despite writing slot about it on their website, the actual safety measures are none-existing. Too many people are being let in, and the different areas are not regulated, so there are large crowds where distancing is impossible. Nothing is done by the staff to ensure that distance is being kept, and that people use the dispensers. Given that a large part of the visitors are Danish kids up to 15, a.k.a not vaccinated or tested, i can only reccomend this if you and your children are fully vaccinated.",1.0,Jul 2021

Incredible art and furnishings as well as textiles and jewellery from different centuries. Excellent docents- especially the long-haired gent in the Rose- provide fascinating historical context. All spoke English very well. There is an English guide you can pick up at the till that provides a good snapshot of each room (as room placards are only in Danish).

If it hadn't been for the Crown Jewels (which were so beautiful) in the basement, I'd have been a bit disappointed here (especially given the high admission price).

As for the exterior, the garden shots are free to take and the postcard shots are from the free area. And you can also get fantastic shots of it from the Round Tower for free in the late afternoon (when the sun hits it). So no need to pay to see the exterior.",3.0,Sep 2021

The museum itself has a small cafe and shop with two exhibitions. One on the vikings in the area and the other on geology and wildlife.
The staff in the museum were knowledgeable friendly, helpful (looking after my bag) and even booked a taxi at the end of the day.
The highlight were the ruins outside. A peaceful windswept hill, with burial chamber remains of granite boulders and houses.
A truly special site!
