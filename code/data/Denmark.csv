Denmark,Mikael F,Nyhavn,5.0,"Nyhavn is a port area from the 1600s. It was constructed by King Christian V from 1670 to 1675.

Now it is more an entertainment center with colorful old houses, bars, cafes, and restaurants.

The area still serves as a traditional harbor with historic wooden ships on display. Also as a hub of canal tours.

On our visit at the beginning of November, the area was filled with a Christmas Market.

Denmark,Roger O,Nyhavn,4.0,"We spent time in this area in our 48 hour city visit. Luckily we had a local friend to guide us. A boat ride is a great start. See a lot of the city from water. (And mermaid!) plenty of coffee shops to try, we didn‚Äôt find a bad one. Evening restaurants probably better away from the front tourist traps. This is not a cheap destination for brits, so take care in selecting where you eat. Some very up market restaurants available if your pockets are deep enough! Shop wine is plenty full and reasonable, but massively marked up in bars. Enjoy, but watch out for fast silent bicycles at junctions and traffic lights. Enjoy.",Oct 2021

It is very popular especially with people who don't go off and explore the city but just visit the main landmarks. Consequently it is very busy and packed out with people.

As with any city icons, this place was very busy with tourists and also everyone seemed to be doing a photoshops ready to post online.

Denmark,grebnesi2020,Nyhavn,4.0,"If you want your photo opportunity in Copenhagen, get out from in front of the camera and just take a nice view of Nyhavn. It is the picture postcard street in the city, if there was one.

Back in the day (until roughly the early 90's), it used to be a fairly rough and tumble neighborhood- in the eyes of the Danes, who tend to exaggerate such things. There were a few tattoo parlors- which were only for sailors in those days- and a couple of prostitutes, perhaps.

Regentrified, it became the tourist mecca and property values went through the roof. It is all tourist restaurants. You may stumble across a few Danes but they will probably be the ones bringing you your beer.

There's the crazy difficult-to-walk side of the canal and there's the quieter side. Take your pick. Nyhavn will be mobbed on a sunny day.

It's a tourist ""hole"" but still rather quaint and pretty to look at- and worth a visit, in any case.

Its a lovely place to sit down and have a beer/wine and people watch but like the rest of Copenhagen, its not a cheap place to dine.

Denmark,thepattersons2014,Nyhavn,4.0,"We visited the Nyhavn region both by ourselves and on a bike tour. It was a very busy part of Copenhagen with lots of tourists getting the perfect picture of the coloured buildings. Other than that we found very little else to so on the area but it is a must see on your trip. Shops and food are more expensive in the area too which was off-putting it was definitely a ""tourist trap"" kind of area. Our bike tour was fantastic and the guide told us about the area itself about the palace and royal connection, we saw Hans Christian Andersens home and he told us about the original purpose for the area and how it was originally more like a scene from pirates of the Carribbean than the beautiful tourist spot it is today. Well worth a visit to see this iconic Copenhagen site.

I am much less impressed now.
The Danes have built a nice city in poor/average landscape. Nyhavn is beautiful for walks and photos mostly in the night when buildings and boats are lighted. But in the Mediterranean sea there are numerous small physical ports that are spectacular to behold. They say God made earth and the Dutch made Holland. For the Danes it accounts the same.

You will see other coloured and ancient houses around the city, but not so well aligned, and not so well posted as if they were posing for a picture. And this is what we tourists do: take thousands of pictures from all sides, from all corners and immortalise this beautiful spot in front of the canal, with some wood ships completing the postcards. Nyhavn is also the place where H.Ch. Andersen used to live (nr. 18 and 20) and when you go there you can imagine you are entering in one of his fairy tales.
Unless you can stand with crowds of tourists buzzing around you, don't miss this place!",Dec 2019

Been to Copenhagen and Nyhavn many times and is so lovley in the summer to sit and people watch.
Two Christmas markets one in square just acorss from Nyhavn and the other as you stoll down the Nyhavn,
Outside seating at most bars and restaurants along the Nyhavn with heaters and blankets to throw over your knees whilst people watching with a hot drink....or two...
Food was amazing at the markets and so much choice too - all kinds of meats - waffles - crepes - sweets - candies - christmas decorations - bars selling hot wine.
Great atmosphere.

Very touristy so do expect some crowds.",Dec 2019
Denmark,Julian09,Nyhavn,4.0,"You've seen it a hundred times in almost any article about Copenhagen, the photo of boats in the canal framed by colorful buildings in the background. This area is close to Kongens Nytorv and the Metro stop of the same name. It's worth a stroll, especially during Christmas time, but probably even nicer during the spring and fall. If you get here, it's about a 20 min walk to the statue of The Little Mermaid. If you walk along the water, you'll pass an art museum with a reproduction of David and an incredible sculpture called I am Queen Mary. Also you'll pass by a fountain and beautiful sculpture next to St Alban's Church. Very much worth the walk. The Little Mermaid is indeed, little. But since you came all the way to Copenhagen, and you know the story, you pretty much have to see it, right?

Denmark,Nevermoor,Nyhavn,5.0,"My wife, mother-in-law, and I arrived in Copenhagen on the 24th of November for a week of holiday. We took the Metro (M2) from the airport to Kongens Nytorv station and walked to Nyhavn a few blocks away. As soon as we turned the corned on to Nyhavn we were struck by the festive lighting and Christmas (Jule) market set up. We rolled our bags to Hotel Bethel where we were staying for the week and vowed to get out to check out the market. We checked in with ease and ventured back out just as evening was coming on. We walked the market---enjoyed some Glogg and Aebleskivers (donuts) before going on to dinner. The little harbor was gorgeous. We couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in Copenhagen during this time. Not only is there the market at Nyhavn which is small but suited our needs as it was very close to our hotel---but there was also the Christmas market at Kongens Nytorv (King's New Square)---which was a bit bigger and allowed us to stretch our legs. There were also another four or five other markets around town that we checked out during our stay. Also at Nyhavn we enjoyed pizza at Gorm's Pizza just down from Hotel Bethel...pizza was awesome as was the wait-staff---and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. We also had a couple orders of fish-n-chips at Restaurant Havfruen---delicious! Service was good---as was the food---which can't be said for a number of other places along the same strip. This restaurant had a wood mermaid over the bar---when you see this---you know you've come to the right place. :-)

Denmark,Hyggemeister,Nyhavn,1.0,"I love walking along Nyhavn but had a bad experience tonight. I was walking on the quiet side of the Nyhavn canal when a slender tall man walking with a map in his hand came over and asked me and my partner for directions. We told him we didn't know and he proceeded to ask us questions like ""are you a tourist?"", ""where are you from?"" Then he asked us to take a picture of him on his phone. He made a ""thumbs up"" pose. Then after the photo was taken, he asked for it to be retaken portrait style. Suddenly, two men came over and said they were the police and flashed a ""badge"". They asked for our passports and id's. The ""tourist"" guy gave his wallet openly to these 2 men. They claimed that they were after the ""tourist"" guy and he was allegedly trying to sell drugs. However, their standing positions appeared that they were trying to surround us. We didn't show or hand over anything and asked them to explain what was going on and for their id. We asked if we were required to stay around and they said we were free to leave. In hindsight, all 3 men were probably in on it and trying to get their hands on something valuable to us so they could rob us. Be careful and if you're not sure call the police ""114"" or the emergency number""112"".

We used the Hop-On-Hop-Off buses and there was a convenient stop right in the heart of Nyhavn. It's also walkable from the city centre, being around 1 mile from Tivoli Gardens and around 20 minutes' stroll from the Central train station.

Nyhavn is a colourful area, with pretty 17th and 18th Century townhouses lining the canal, loads of bars, restaurants, cafes, etc so it was busy with both locals and tourists - eating, drinking and wandering around, and it had a real buzz.

It's a pleasant walk down to the bridge which takes cyclists and pedestrians across the water to the Christianshavn part of the city. As the social hub of the city it's well worth a visit - and lots of pretty photos to be had of the colourful houses reflected in the water.

Denmark,Michael,Nyhavn,5.0,"Nyhavn is _the_ place that is most likely to be found on postcards from Copenhagen - just next to the Little Mermaid.
It shines especially during the summer - both at day and night - although getting some Christmas wine there in the winter time also has some value.
Apart from fantastic views and atmosphere you can find there things like:
- a large bunch of restaurants (it might be expensive)
- free toilet
- at least two canal-tour operator stations
- house where Hans Christian Andersen used to live
- live music (summer)
From there you can take the kissing bridge and visit the Street Food hall on the other side of the canal - but I mostly recommend taking the walk from there and going all the way to the Little Mermaid. You can visit the Marble Church and Amalienborg on the way.

The views of the Nyhavn canal and boats are what you will find on postcards as both sides of the canal are lined with colorful houses and stylish yachts and old wooden boats are moored in the canal. This is a beautiful district and close to everything.

Nyhavn is where Hans Christian Andersen lived in house No. 20 and wrote many of his fairy tales. He lived for 20 years at No. 67 and 2 years in No. 18.

A highlight is the Inderhavnsbro inner harbor bridge that opened in 2016 connecting pedestrians and cyclists between Christianshaven and Nyhavn.

This area is very reminiscent of the Vieux Bassin along Sainte- Catherine in Honfleur, France. Rather expensive as my wife and I spent 355 Danish DKK, equivalent to about $50 in US, but we both had lunch and drinks, so $25 per person is not outrageous , considering where we were in such a popular tourist and local area.

The city is full of tourists from all over the world, and no wonder that Copenhagen has been one of the hottest tourist cities in Europe in recent years. Of course, the first tourist attraction in the city is Nyhavn. We took the train to Copenhagen that day, so we walked directly from the train station to the Nyhavn attractions, about 15 minutes away, you will be arriving there. It can be a little longer, depend on individual situations. People are overcrowded on weekends, so not recommended to go there on weekends. However, I think this famous attraction should be crowded at any time. Personal, I'm recommended to go to Nyhavn in the afternoon. You will be able to enjoy afternoon coffee time outdoor there with your friends and enjoy the sunshine and the Europeans lifestyle. If you don't like too many people, you can also go to the end of the port of the art gallery there. There are also have restaurants inside, you can also enjoy the coffee there. I think there are different port views. So, coming to Copenhagen, it is worth to visit Nyhavn, one of the world-famous sightseeing spots.

Denmark,TWal1,Nyhavn,4.0,"Nyhavn is accessible from the centre of Copenhagen and is a relatively short walk. We passed through the area a couple of times during over five day stay in Copenhagen and found it to be busy on each occasion. There is a good selection of restaurants and cafes but the menus have a similar feel. The canal and hop-on hop-off bus services frequent the area. The architecture and coloured facades is a pleasant touch, and early morning would be your best photo opportunity. A fun place to visit, but remember it thrives on the tourist dollar.

The whole decoration is unbelievable. I went there with a friend, and we took the unlimited pass ticket, which was 50 euros, together with the entrance ticket. We went inside in the morning, than went out around lunch and came back in the evening (with the same pass) to see the decoration during the night again, and I think that was the best decision we made. We could not get enough of the whole Halloween experience, even if we traditionally don¬¥t celebrate it.
The rides are fun, not really scary, but children would love them for sure. I am 22 and I loved the whole experience inside, and would recommend the visit to a person of any age for sure.

They're now a profit-above-all business that are willing to fill the park way above capacity. Selling expensive free-pass wrist bands while there's a 30-60 minute line for even the basic rides cannot be a sustainable business as there's a limited number of fools in the world.

Although it sits in smack in the middle of downtown Copenhagen, you would never know it. We pre-purchased the ""Skip the Line"" option, but there was no line at midday, mid-week in August, which is the height of Denmark's tourist season. We toured the delightful garden-like setting before spending the rest of our day on the thrilling rides, including their big upside-down roller coaster!

Well worth seeing if in Copenhagen as part of the walking tour of the city.,Oct 2020
Denmark,AG Reyes,Tivoli Gardens,3.0,"Tivoli Gardens is a beautiful place but I wish I had imagined it primarily as a garden and not as an amusement park.

As a garden, it's truly worth the price of admission. The old buildings are beautiful and there are flowers everywhere. A lovely place to take pictures and I think the price of admission was worth it for the setting alone. I went at 6pm so I could take daytime shots and then wait for blue hour for the famous shot of the Chinese Pagoda behind the lake. Pics came out great.

As an amusement park, this place, however, is seriously overrated. Maybe I'm just accustomed to more, but the thought of having to pay $15 to ride a C-list roller coaster left a bad taste in my mouth. I've paid $30 before to enter Hersheypark in Pennsylvania and ride ALL attractions (including 14 roller coasters).

Honestly, if you come in expecting Cedar Point, Hersheypark, Disney World, King's Dominion, Busch Gardens, Carowinds or any number of American theme parks, you'll leave horribly disappointed. The main attractions are a small number of mundane roller coasters (again charging $15(!)/90DKK to ride) and then kiddie rides. There's really no in between.

Personally, I'd recommend you pay for admission, walk around and then decide if you want to do the Unlimited Rides ticket. There's a kiosk inside the park where you can buy an Unlimited Ticket, so there's no need to decide at the gate. Pay for admission, walk around, and see if there's enough to justify an Unlimited Ride ticket.

Personally, the gardens are worth it, but the rides are not. So pay the 135DKK for entry, spend 2 hours walking around (it's not as big as other reviews make it out to be), see the daily programming (which I enjoyed a lot), take photos of the old pavilions representing all architectural styles, and grab some food (I'm happy to report the theme park's street food is the same price as outside fast food/street food, which was good to see). It's worth a visit, but come in with proper expectations.

I was lucky enough to attend on a warm, sunny afternoon - on the one day all year that dogs are allowed in - purely by chance. That made the experience even better for me. The place is truly fun with all kinds of games and rides and things to observe. So many people enjoying themselves, really beautiful landscaping, crazy fun things to see and do. A large range of food and drink choices. I am not sure about the price, as it was free on my Copenhagen Card (as was most of what I did on my trip. ) I actually did not ride any rides so cannot comment on those.

Denmark,Emma K,Tivoli Gardens,2.0,"The gardens themselves were stunning and the rides thoroughly enjoyable. However, the entry into park itself was difficult. This is because the barcode on this skip the line ticket was unreadable. The park staff did not recognise it and almost did not let us into the gardens. It's not clear on any of the correspondence that a special barcode is needed - I only received the TripAdvisor barcode which was not accepted at the park. When originally booking, I stated that we were going on a Monday, but seem to have been sent a weekend ticket. I'm not sure this affected anything, but it's not what I booked. It's about the same price to book direct with Tivoli, so I'd do that instead of bothering with this skip the line. There was no line to skip on a Monday afternoon anyway!

Denmark,Mejuffrouw,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"Tivoli Gardens/amusement park was high on our list of places to visit in Copenhagen, and let me tell you: it did not disappoint! We visited on a weekday, outside of (summer)holidays, so the park was not too busy with people. Tivoli offers different kinds of entree tickets, which is great because this way you can choose what suits you, instead of always having to buy a very expensive ticket even when you will not use any of the rides in the park for example. We bought entree tickets just to get inside the park. When you‚Äôre inside the park, you can buy seperate tickets for every ride, in case you do want to ride one. We had a lovely time walking around the park and seeing everything there is: the attractions are amazing to see and look at, there is so much attention to detail everywhere, from attractions, to food stands, to staff uniforms! You can have a lovely walk and admire the attractions and greenery in the park. We come from Holland, where there is a great amusement park centered around fairytales (the Efteling); Tivoli reminded us of this!

We cannot count the number of times we looked at eachother and said something like: ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs so beautiful, isn‚Äôt this amazing?!‚Äù (During the day AND the evening when things are beautifully lit up). We ended up going into one of the attractions (the guy working there was very helpful and friendly), which was Den Flyvende Kuffert, where you can see some of H.C. Andersen‚Äôs stories acted out buy puppets: this was great!! (Especially since the legacy of Andersen is not widespread in Copenhagen)

There‚Äôs food everywhere at the Tivoli Gardens. Of course, it was quite expensive, but we very munch enjoyed a great sandwish from Frank‚Äôs Toast, some nice donuts, and dessert in the shape of a unicorn bubble waffle, which tasted soooo good. To end our day, we saw the Illuminations show (very cool, with lights, fountains and fire). A staff member recommended us the perfect spot to watch this, which was great.

Connecting to the Tivoli gardens is the Tivoli Food Hall, where you can get some great food. This is also an exit, where you can get a re-entry ticket/or bracelet from a friendly security staff member, so you can re enter the gardens whenever you want. Perfect!
(We went to the Tivoli Gardens, then went on a canal tour, ate at the Tivoli Food Hall and went again to the Tivoli Gardens with the re-entry bracelet; definitely a day we'd recommend to anyone)

We used our Copenhagen card to get in but we could have downloaded the app and bought a ticket that got 3 people in and 3 free ice creams for DKK 565. You will also need the app for the virtual queueing system, this was really easy to use, just book which ride you want and then turn up when it tells you to. Scan your phone on the gold diamond by the ride and on you go. We didn't queue at all. Masks are needed on some rides but they are given to you as you get on. Hand sanitiser everywhere and floor markings in areas that may be busy. You can get your ride photos on the app as well - just scan the QR code.

Denmark,stevlee78,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"I paid for entry on the app (the app is needed) and then when I reviewed the ride ticket costs inside Tivoli I bought the unlimited ride armbands, for an extra 500kr

So point one is buy a ticket that includes rides, I think the family ticket is the best value

If you drive it‚Äôs a nightmare to park so suggest not to drive

Ok, so arriving at the park at 11:15 there was no queue, easy to enter and you‚Äôre immediately entertained with magic mirrors and sideshows, games and shops

The park is pretty big so we took a good walk round before going on any rides (I hadn‚Äôt at this point bought any ride tickets so couldn‚Äôt ride anyway)

We ate at wagamama, which was nice enough

After we then decided to go on the rides, we went on most of them, minus ‚Äúbaby‚Äù rides and one dropping tower thing that I didn‚Äôt think my lunch would appreciate

It was a lot of fun on the rides, the queues very short and you are offered a free task mask if the ride is close situated
A lot of the rides need online booking, which makes sense on a busy day but on this day just delayed things
The app is good though so not delayed by much but ensure you have a fully charged phone for the booking shenanigans

There are hand gels everywhere, from the highly smelly tequila ones to sticky ones and a nice fresh foamy one, we went back to that a few times

There are tons of places to eat and drink in the park and there was a live brass band and picnic areas to relax

There was also a dress rehearsal for a later stage show, but too busy on rides to stop and watch
In the park there are also a lot of arcades and most machines are on, some were off for COVID but nothing we missed

We spent around five hours in the park and as it was a three hour drive there and back I decided to hit the road again (again don‚Äôt drive if you don‚Äôt have to!)
The aquarium was an added extra and possible the biggest waste of cash of the day, it‚Äôs one level, two tanks and literally three minutes of interest, don‚Äôt do it unless it‚Äôs free

Denmark,alekta89,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"We really enjoyed our stay in Tivoli Gardens. We ended up purchasing Unlimited Rides ticket, as we calculated that it is cheaper if you want to have more rides. In July there were no waiting lines as would usually be, you had to download the application to your phone and sign into a ""virtual"" line, which let you know how much is the approximate waiting time for each ride and when you signed into the waiting list, you were informed by the app when you can move into queue. Since not all rides required the virtual check-in, while waiting for some rides with longer wait times (30-60 minutes at the time of our visit, we were there on a Sunday), you could do some rides that did not have the virtual wait. The only thing that surprised us was that there is a separate ticket you have to buy for the entry into the Tivoli Gardens only and the rides tickets were extra - in the unlimited rides tickets the entry to the Gardens is not included. We enjoyed riding on all the rides we did. I recommend to visit early (possibly as soon as it opens) and ride some of the most popular rides before there is a long waiting time (for example The Roller Coaster, The Demon, The Milky Way Express). On some rides you were required to wear a face mask because of COVID-19, but they provided you with one before boarding in case you didn't have it.

Denmark,Pernille I,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"Visiting Tivoli during these Covid-19 times is definitely different from what it usually is - but with some preparation and patience it can be an even better experience where you actually avoid too long lines!

1. INSTALL THE APP AND BRING MULTIPLE MOBILE PHONES
First of all you should download the app from home - this will allow you to know before arriving which rides are open; as some are closed for maintenance or other reasons.
Familiarize yourself with how the app works so you do not get confused when standing on the inside. The app will however only work once you are physically inside the garden and have your Bluetooth on.

Also think of bringing multiple mobile phones, as you can only have one booking at a time in the app. You need Bluetooth activated - so also be aware that your battery will probably face some issues at the end of the day. Bringing a charger might not be a bad idea!

Having multiple phones allows you to book subsequent rides with long waiting times and plan ahead. We had 3 phones, and thus were always a step ahead without stressing ourselves either. When on the point of entering one ride, we simply booked the next - also to not book unnecessary rides we knew we could not do.

2. ARRIVE EARLY
The garden opens at 11AM; we did not buy tickets online - and it turned out to be quicker going through the ticket desk and get the admission + bracelet at once. If you order online you still need to pass a check and then exchange your ticket for the bracelet - where there was quite a line.

3. START OUT WITH THE RESTRICTED RIDES
Some rides need a booking in the app; this is clearly displayed with an estimated waiting time while others will say 'Booking not needed'. This does not mean there is no line for the other ones - or even for the ones with booking. But the lines will grow steadily during the day. We arrived at 11AM and did the The Golden Tower, The Star Flyer, The Monsoon, The Mine, The Milky Way Express etc. all within the first few hours.

When you book the ride, you get a time estimate before you should go to the line - in grey; when it turns green you can go to the actual line, and have a period of 20-30 minutes to get there. Do not enter the line before your app goes green!

While you ""wait"" for your restricted rides to become available you can do all the other rides, where you simply line up.

We stayed from 11AM till 7PM including breaks, lunch etc. and did some 15-20 rides per person. But in the afternoon lines started being +2 hours for the most popular ones - this can be avoided by doing them early in the day.

4. FACE MASKS AND MUTUAL RESPECT
On some rides - normally the restricted ones - you also need to wear a face mask. These are handed out while you stand in line, and this works efficiently and everybody respects that you should put it on.

There are sanitizer dispensers in many places; but it can be a challenge to keep distance if i.e. you wish to sit on a bench. Some sit-down space is lacking, and this of course is for you to evaluate how close you wish to be to other people.
Social distancing in lines worked very well, and overall it was less crowded than on an usual summer day.

5. THE NEW TIVOLI?
I can definitely see that this system can become the new standard; it seemed as if all rides are already equipped with the technology to be activated. So maybe this is the new way of doing things.

It can definitely work - people will get used to it too, and avoid the most common mistakes of lining up without a ride booked, or too early etc.

But it will require a little fine tuning of the app functionality.
It eats up your battery way too fast for one; secondly it does become a bit unsteady at times, so you have to close down and reopen.

But these are early days, and they had little time to prepare this - I am sure there will be a better system soon, and we will all do it this way and actually enjoy that we do no queue for hours, but can walk there to our reserved rides!

Very convenient for a city that is expensive in many ways. It was a weekday and there were not too many people during daylight hours and we thus had a great walk around, we were not really interested in the rides.

After asking s staff member we were told to stand in one of the lines, but it turned out to be the wrong line. There were no measures or initiatives from the Tivoli to handle the crowd outside in regard to the Covid-19-situation. It took a long time to enter the Tivoli after they opened the gates. When we finally got inside we had to pick up our ride passes from an automat, which meant having to stand in line again. It took us one hour from the gates opened until we were ready for using the rides. The app we had to use for booking a ride was a complete disaster. You could only book one (1) ride at a time. If you tried to book another the first booking was automatically cancelled. Waiting time for the rides was 2-3 hours so we were unable to use most of the rides. The only positive thing about our visit is that it was easy to find a place to eat - that saves Tivoli from getting a terrible rating from me. Barely.

My boyfriend and I payed for the entry + unlimited rides. We were at the park for 4 hours and during all this time we weren't even able to get on one rollercoaster! And yes, we tried hard.

Tivoli introduced this remarkably annoying queuing app where you can only book one rollercoaster at the time. The waiting time for these rides were between 2 - 3 hours... Theoretically that means that you can get on maximum 2 rides in 4 hours spent at the park. But 1 Tivoli hour is equal to 2 Earthly hours as they kept extending the waiting time. Once it's finally your turn you can start queuing at the attraction. Queuing for queing!

We were watching a show while waiting for our ride (it said an other 85 min wait on the app). We checked our ride-status again after 30 min had passed. Status: EXPIRED!

Do not pay for the rides!

Tivoli is a huge waste of money unless you just pay for the entry.

During the COVID-19 Tivoli Gardens has created an app for ‚Äúdigital queuing‚Äù to their rides.

It is created in such a way that you can only book one ride at a time, and the average wait time, on an evening with virtually no people in the park, is 75-85 min.

Only after the ride is over, can you book your next ride.

In short you can at most get three rides in one evening (if you arrive 18:00).

Denmark,grebnesi2020,Tivoli Gardens,3.0,"Every tourist brochure touts Tivoili to the skies. It's the Mona Lisa of Copenhagen, but not half as interesting. That doesn't keep the crowds from flocking there, Danes and tourists alike.

Pay Disney World- or Great America- prices to go to a (granted, old) amusement park with most of the rides as old and old fashioned as the place is. So, in other words, don't go for the entertainment.

Sometimes there are headline acts on their sound stage and if you pick a lucky day (well, night), you may get to experience that.

If you're a huge fan of flowers, well then, hey... it's not called Tivoili Gardens for nothing. Lotsa flowers.

Personally I think the place is terribly overrated and far too expensive for what you get. I think your time and money can be far better spent in other ways, such as just wandering the streets, grabbing a beer on Amagertorv, by the Stork Fountain, the most central part of the inner city, on Stroget. Pay a visit to Illums Bolighus while you're there if you enjoy Scandinavian design items.

Basically, just walk around. That's the best thing to do while visiting Copenhagen.

However, if you insist upon visiting Tivoli anyway, you may wish to save a little time and go visit the New Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum around the corner. It was built by Carl Jakobsen who founded the Carlsberg Brewery, the brewery which owned an entire country. Jakobsen was a tireless collector of art and antiquities. This beautiful building houses quite a fair collection.

The National Museum (nearby Frederiksholms kanal and Gammel Strand) is also worth a visit. The Statens Museum for Kunst (a short walk from N√∏rreport station) not as much so.

Denmark,Ronnie Adventurer,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"On December 22, 2019, I left my hotel for the five minute walk to the Orestad train station to visit Tivoli Gardens. I had heard from various sources that on any visit to Copenhagen, Tivoli Gardens was a must-see. I was not disappointed.

The gardens were decorated well for the christmas season and there were many activities for everyone. During the walking tour, I saw rides, shops, restaurants, bars and an entertainment area. There were also plenty of locations to visit for dining options.

As I was walking around, I spotted a stall with an extremely long line of people being served relatively quickly. I asked a resident what was the popular item and was informed Churros. I had never eaten Churros before so I decided to purchase one which came with icecream. The warm Churros paired with the icecream was delicious.

I spent approximately three hours in Tivoli Gardens and on many occasions got lost in the atmosphere and magic of the place. While the gardens may be an excellent place to visit during the summer months, I believe Christmas adds another dimension to the location.

I would recommend to anyone.

It is so close to the station as it appears on the map and is literally in the middle of the high street. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe opposite before entering, not realising there were so many good food establishments inside!

We visited during the winter lights season and the place was decorated with snow and snowmen. It was magical.

The rides are lovely with an ‚Äòold fashioned‚Äô feel and are all clean, in good working order and different to the usual.

Loads of food establishments and beautiful grounds.

I would highly recommend this for a trip. We spent a few hours of an afternoon there but could have spent much longer if we‚Äôd had time.

I would really recommend this place. Perhaps if you are there for the day, the unlimited ride pass would be worth a purchase, we spent ¬£13 on just three rides.

The park is open till late at night. My wife and daughter enjoyed the rides during the day, and I joined them in the evening. There are a lot of rides for both young and old, though I myself didn‚Äôt go on any of them. Although it was still mid-November, however the park was ready for the Christmas season, and was a most amazing sight at night, with lots of lighted trees and decorations throughout the park. Since you get a day ticket and re-entry to the park is allowed, I would recommend it that you experience the park both during the daytime as well as after dark. A must-do activity when in Copenhagen!

Denmark,HerbertEdgewood,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"‚ÄòEllo chaps! Tivoli is said to be the world‚Äôs second oldest amusement park in operation (behind ‚ÄúBakken‚Äù, also located in an area near Copenhagen). Tivoli opened August 15, 1843 and features several dozen attractions and rides and many food/dining options. It‚Äôs a quaint park with rides that have been running for decades but appear to be well maintained. Tivoli is also where many say Walt Disney visited to build inspiration for his own theme park. Among Tivoli‚Äôs two dozen rides, include four roller coasters and two water rides, many appealing to thrill seekers of all levels. They have the wild rides and they have tame kid friendly rides and everything in between. It was easy to spend a full day at the park, although it is smaller in size than say Disney‚Äôs Magic Kingdom, for comparison. PRICING: There are two main price points you should be aware of. It is ONE PRICE to enter the park and to wander the grounds of ‚Äúthe gardens‚Äù (or the park itself). It is an ADDITIONAL COST to ride the attractions themselves, which you could do by buying an Unlimited Ride pass or a la carte, paying for individual rides as you go. There are pay machines at each ride. If. You‚Äôre going to ride more than 3 or 4 rides it‚Äôs probably more worth your while just paying for the unlimited pass. Just know you‚Äôre going to pay a premium price for food and souvenirs inside the park. Overall I give Tivoli five stars out of five.

It can seem expensive as Danish prices are generally higher than average but admission and Unlimited Rides Ticket is worth the money as a whole day is easily spent there.

Want to save a bit of money? - bring your own sandwiches and drinks, as this is where the majority of spend money goes, plus there are plenty of areas to enjoy your home made meals.

Historical classic theme park with up to date facilities.,Dec 2019

Denmark,Bruce J,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"This is where Disney picked up many ideas. It is old school amusement park with some excellent rides suitable for children for 1 - 99 years old.

Nice restaurants, although, I would choose the food court over them since it has opened. Good selection of rides from young kid aged to super scary or thrilling! Scary for me! Beautiful gardens. The whole park is actually very pretty. Flowers everywhere. Live music and concerts sometimes. You have to look at the schedule. We've seen some big bands play there. WE LOVE TIVOLI.",Jun 2019
Denmark,Kelsey M,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"You cannot miss Tivoli if you visit Copenhagen. It's one of the oldest amusement parks in the world, and it's a magical place. I've been here twice now - once in summer and once in winter. I recommend either time. The summer weather is wonderful and the Danish days last forever, but the Christmas lights and snowflakes make this pretty place even more charming. You don't have to have kids to enjoy yourself here, I went as a solo adult and had a great time.",Dec 2019
Denmark,Alan B,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"I've traveled to many countries, and to many amusement parks. No where have I seen such a transformation of an amusement park from Summer to Winter. Tivoli is NIGHT and DAY. In summer, it's a classic first-in-the-world park. In Winter, it is a fairy-tale, with lifelike snow, ice, and lights galore...and of course...the best seasonal food and drinks! And...get this...many of the rides ARE going in WINTER! I've ridden the rollercoaster in Summer and in Winter! What kind of park does that?? Tivoli! The inspiration for DISNEY! Where it all began. What more to say?",Dec 2019

Denmark,BenjaminCT7,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"We were lucky enough to be staying at The Nimb which entitled us to free entry and wristbands for Tivoli on New Years Eve and New Years Day.

New Years Eve was magical. Cold crisp and really atmospheric. Tivoli really is a feast for the eyes. Snow, lights, beautiful shops bars and kiosks and just a really amazing atmosphere. It really did make me feel like a child again!

Fireworks at 11pm were amazing. The park was packed and they went on for ages.

New Years Day we took advantage of a less busy Tivoli and went on some rides. Almost no queues so no waiting. The mountain rollercoaster is fantastically on fashioned. The Deamon scary and quick. There are a whole host of rides for all ages - I‚Äôm sorry to say that I didn‚Äôt have the head or stomach for a lot of them but they all looked amazing.

What Tivoli gets right is the theme. Everything appears old fashioned but that‚Äôs not the case. There are some real white knuckles opportunities.

On top of that the staff and operators were all friendly and helpful.

All in all a highly recommended way to spend a good few hours in Copenhagen.

It is just a very expensive Luna Park (as in Sydney) and with a price tag of $70 Australian for two to enter and this was entry only, no rides. Maybe for people with children and more money than sense it would be okay? Decided to buy coffee but changed our mind at the price tag of $11.50, take away in a paper cup (one coffee only). We found it an absolute waste of money. The Prada in Vienna is much the same but with free entry",Dec 2019

Denmark,MissSK2018,Tivoli Gardens,4.0,"Everyone knows about Tivoli, so on our first day, we decided to spend the day there, it was just before Christmas, and really magical, fake snow everywhere, which my son enjoyed using, to make snowballs, to throw at me ha ha, Christmas market stalls, Christmas trees, and games such as burst the balloon, where if your lucky enough, you win tokens, which you can collect, to get bigger prizes
We wasn't interested in going on rides, which I found to be quite expensive, one tip, you can only pay for ride tickets, with a card, no cash accepted on the machines.
If you want to return the same day, you need to get your hand stamped, in the food hall, before leaving, we did this, and returned in the evening to visit Santa!
I think everyone should visit at least once, a good experience!

Denmark,RMS68729701,Tivoli Gardens,4.0,"Used our hop on hop off Tickets and paid a little extra to include the entrance to the Tivoli. Nice warm welcome from the uniformed concierge which is a nice touch from a guest engagement perspective. Although no snow, Tivoli had sprayed some strategic cover around the tree-lined photographic areas and souvenir huts just near the entrance. We arrived just before sunset and I would say that Tivoli is best viewed at night, although those with kids would naturally prefer to do all the activities and rides whilst the daylight is available.

The venue itself is Ikea style directional wandering, with a nice smattering of restaurants, coffee bars, cake and pastry places and good old hot dog or burger places to keep everyone inside happy, whatever the age. There is also an adjacent food court, serving the usually urban and artisan mix of sushi, taco , tapas and smors.....we did eat in there, but nothing memorable to be honest. We had a pastry and coffee in a small cafe which was fine, again to serve the purpose. It was not overly busy, but the rides appeared entertaining and well organised, although not cheap, along with everything else in Denmark. Don't expect fast food to be 'cheap' food! . We wandered around for approx 2 hours, reminiscent of Disney in the evening, nice buzz and pleasant atmosphere. A good venue for kids to enjoy after being dragged around the museums, but in essence, a one visit (and Selfie) only destination as part of your Copenhagen 'Experience'.

We also went to the aquarium, though we were disappointed to have to pay in an extra fee, considering its really just one big fish tank. But still nice to sit and watch the fish, we also caught the feeding of the piranhas which was fascinating! Would definitely recommend coming here on your trip to Copenhagen!",Jan 2020
Denmark,Dbdeen84,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"Tivoli Gardens in the winter time really is a magical winter wonderland, we were totally blown away by it! We were staying in Copenhagen from 30th Dec 19 to 3rd January 20 and visited the Tivoli Gardens a couple of times, one of them being New Years Eve. The garden is massive, you think it's never going to end. Some lovely shopping huts to browse round and plenty of restaurants. The garden was decorated with loads of Christmas Trees, snow, Christmas lights, just magical.
The New Years Eve fireworks were something else, brilliant display. When we came out of the Tivoli after midnight at New Year the streets were packed with people letting off their own fireworks among the crowds so do watch yourself.
We had dinner in the diner which is located in the Tivoli, it was fab, really tasty burgers!

We didnt go on any of the rides, that not for us, but the experience of walking around, with a warm hot chocolate, a bite to eat and visiting all the shops, the food hall (where we had to eat something) and enjoying the numerous experinece is well worth the admittance price five times over. It really is a magical place, whilst busy its quite a slow relaxing environment, the rides looked amazing, but having over indulged all day at the Christmas markets I didnt want to risk it.

Denmark,Tuz73,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"We decided to visit on New Years Day with most of the attractions open and arrived late afternoon. This was impressive until it turned dark and then it was a different level - the lighting and style (art deco) of the park was outstanding.

It cost less than I was expecting just for basic entrance (130DKK/¬£17) - this is worthwhile as the park is huge but tickets for the rides were expensive (30DKK/¬£4) as some need 3 tickets. I would definitely recommend buying a wristband (295DKK/¬£38) as there is plenty to do but make sure you allow enough time.

We were lucky to visit just after Christmas so it had a magical feel to the park and wasn't that busy - just a shame we didn't have more time to explore the park. I would advise getting there during daylight but leaving in the dark - the best of both worlds.

So glad we got to visit, a must visit attraction - even our 12 year old had a fantastic time and loved the rides

The only thing that‚Äôs an issue is security for most rides you can‚Äôt take anything with you and you have to place it in open sort of cubby holes and there is no sort of security watching. For international travellers you usually have cameras, phones, passport and money so that‚Äôs a bit annoying maybe a key system as nobody would forget unlocking their belongings at each ride! The haunted house was also extremely scary so good on the staff for hiring great actors but the floor was quite uneven so not super suitable for when you are travelling with elderly parents. Wasn‚Äôt advised of the uneven floor until right before going in whereas most other rides were very well set up with signage. Good choice of food outlets available the waffle ice cream dessert was awesome.

This place is beautifully decorated and Christmas themed throughout. Lots of ""Christmas Market"" vendors with beautiful and unique items. The ""skip the line"" pass is helpful, but doesn't let you skip the line(s) on rides. If you are a ride person , get an unlimited ride ticket as there are both ""3 ticket"" rides (the really fun ones) and ""1 ticket rides"" (also fun, but less demand) . If you have never been here , do try the ""Glogg"" (warm wine with rum or schaps , + add raisins) . Most of the ""street food"" here is good including roasted nuts, hot dogs, carmel corn etc...

There is a mix of over-priced souvenir shops, restaurants, rides, theatres and an aquarium amongst other things.
It is very well laid out and, even in the middle of summer, it didn't feel busy or crowded. Unfortunately there were no outdoor shows scheduled during the time we were there but there is plenty to keep a family busy for a few hours.

Denmark,Dawn B,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"If you are planning to go to Tivoli Gardens then buying tickets in advance is worthwhile. There is a small financial saving (about ¬£3) but we were able to go in without queueing. Some days had very long queues!!!

Booking online was very easy. But do watch out for t&cs. Our tickets were all day but there are tickets for 2 hours with a saving of about 50p.",Dec 2019
Denmark,Stellayyl,Tivoli Gardens,4.0,"I went during daytime in December, it wasn't too crowded as weather is cold. It is certainly festive with christmas decoration - I didn't do any of the rides but the place is nicely decorated and with stops of coal burning to keep warm. There a lovely curated gardens for you to sit near fireplace. I like the fact that they retain the old games from childhood to reminisce and to play. F&B are more expensive as expected, food hall was good - with variety of options. Didn't feel the need to return in the evening - it is not as big and grand as one claimed - unless you intend to do the rides, otherwise, a few hours to walk around would be more than enough.

Denmark,Michael3288,Tivoli Gardens,3.0,"For the price we expected more than there is to see and do. Parts of it are beaiutiful, but others are showing age. They say Walt Disney used this as a model for his theme park. If this is so, then he has a lot more inagination than what we saw here. Pricey and not worth it.",Sep 2019

Denmark,mtbsamjames,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"My partner and I decided to enter Tivioli mid afternoon expecting to be there for a few hours. We were so wrong, we ended up spending most of the night there. The place was amazing at Christmas, with all the lights and decorations made the experience extra special. We decided to go for the unlimited ride pass which was worth the money. We concluded, despite being expensive, it was worth it for the amount of time we spent in there. The queues for the rides were approximately 10 minutes and there was a place to leave your belongings at the start of every ride, not being accessible to the general public whilst the ride is operating, I would still be careful about leaving any expensive items unattended (as with anywhere you travel). The Christmas market was lovely and we enjoyed going from stall to stall.

So many different ticket types, the most expensive one being access to the park and all the rides.

Denmark,LnpSmith,Tivoli Gardens,4.0,"Tivoli is one of the most beautiful theme parks I've visited.

Queues were as expected for this time of year. Only problem I had was the ride harnesses are on the small side. I am not small but don't have trouble at most European theme parks but was almost too big for a couple of the rides here.

The old rollercoaster is so unique and great fun, definitely a must try!

Plenty of options for food from quick grab-and-go snacks or proper sit down meals. The food hall is also excellent.

It was truly beautiful experience, and the rain didn't negatively impact our day. All of the rides were open, and there were essentially no lines. The 20,000+ pumpkins made it so fun to wander around, and the peacocks were even out in the rain! We had a fun time cooking pretzel dough (or something like that) over the fires, and the blankets helped in the rain. Tivoli food hall was fun for lunch as well.

Denmark,Sam3005,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"Really quirky park, interesting mix of old and new. Loved the old wooden roller coaster, the guys who drive it need a special mention, unbelievable skill and very nonchalant showboating. Very nicely dressed up for christmas too.

Denmark,James H,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"We visited Tivoli in December in the evening and it was fab! Looks amazing at Christmas at night. They really do a great job of decorating it all.

We had a 9 and 12 year old who loved it. We purchased the ultimate plus pass... have to say we didn‚Äôt do the VR ride so probably could have just purchased the normal unlimited pass. It‚Äôs definitely worth doing that as even when it‚Äôs busy you can easily get to do enough rides to justify it if you have a few hours.

We didn‚Äôt realise how many food options there were as we thought most would be kiosk style so we ended up in Wagamama as it was the first proper one we saw and needed to warm up, but actually there are lots of restaurants including more traditional ones... there‚Äôs also a food hall! So that was our only regret.

If you are in Copenhagen for Christmas you must go, even if just to wander around it all.

Christmas markets inside to sip mulled wine or baileys hit chocolate (around 50dkk)
Lots of permanent food stalls too.
You could pay for entry and just walk around (big lake there too). If you are adventurous, try out some rides.

We didn't go on any roller coasters but some looked terrifying and there were bumper car rides and much else for children.

Denmark,Steve-and-Andie,Tivoli Gardens,4.0,"Wasn't quite what we were expecting, but there again, if you haven't been before you wouldn't know what to expect!
Lovely set up with wood cabins selling all things Christmas. Wonderful fountain and light show on the lake. Decorations and lights throughout were second to none.
This is also a theme park so if you aren't bothered about the rides just buy the standard entrance ticket.
We were expecting items for sale in Tivoli Gardens to be more expensive than outside but surprisingly we were wrong and picked up several items there instead of buying from the main Christmas Markets. Food also appears to be good value...just wished we had known that before we ate outside.
If it wasn't for the ¬£15pp entrance fee with no rides we would rate this higher, but don't get us wrong, it's still a lovely place to visit.

But Xmas attractions were very good ,variety of themes with artificial snow.
If you‚Äôre into fairgrounds this is for you,cos it‚Äôs a huge venue especially for children.
If you go in the food hall you‚Äôll go through a barrier and staff will stamp your wrist so you can return the same if want go outside you‚Äôll need a stamp to re enter.

We sipped hot cocoa and snacked on cinnamon and sugar roasted almonds we got from vendors along the way. The park and it‚Äôs shops were quaint and we enjoyed stopping by the standing fire bowls to warm our hands. Every now and then we would catch a glimpse of our boys taking off on rollercoaster or spinning spaceships. We snapped up fun pictures and treated the boys to Belgium waffles before the night was through.

We ate at the diner and quite enjoyed my burger. We also finished our day with a cake and hot chocolate at Cakenhagen ... delicious. Overall we spent around 7 hours in the park. Spoilt for choice with the various shops and prices not overly inflated. Also don‚Äôt miss the illumination show on the lake. Overall we loved it.,Dec 2019

Denmark,Ricast,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,This amusement park is a must when visiting Copenhagen.

Denmark,WalesTron,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"The Tivoli Gardens was the unexpected highlight of our short break to Copenhagen. We expected an old-style fairground in a small garden park, but we couldn't have been more wrong. The Tivoli Gardens feels like a fusion of a theme park and beautiful gardens. There's a sense of magic in the atmosphere, which makes it feel like Disneyland. Everything looks stunning and the whole place is so well looked after. The rides are actually nothing like fairground rides, and more like thrill rides you'd find at theme parks. The height and speed of some the rides are shocking! Not for the faint hearted!

It looks beautiful by day, however at night it comes alive as the whole place is lit up like magic. We were lucky enough to visit at Christmas and so the Gardens were beautifully themed. There were also Christmas markets inside.

There were plenty of different places to eat too, including a Michelin star restaurant. Plenty of choice for all ages and budgets. Most places are unique, however there's even a Wagamama inside. We noticed a large concert hall too but we did not attend, although it looked fantastic.

I'm not sure if it's on all year round, but we also watched a dancing fountain light show which we knew nothing about initially. It was brilliant! Seems to be on several times every evening.

I would recommend getting the ticket which gives unlimited ride access if you want to enjoy the rides, but be aware, they are generally quite intense thrill rides. It might not seem really cheap but it's worth it!

If you are visiting Copenhagen, this is an absolute must whether you're a couple, friends or a family with kids.

Tips:

- You can get a stamp to re-access the gardens if you decide to leave. I understand this is only within 24 hours. You can actually easily access the attached food hall restaurant easily and get stamped to come back in.

- Make sure you visit when it's dark as the place comes alive at night.

- There are more thrill rides than children's rides, so if you have small kids then they may not take advantage of the unlimited ride ticket. You can just pay for individual rides separately anyway.

- You can spend a few hours walking around and enjoying the rides, stalls and food. But don't forget you can come back to visit within the same day. An hour might not be enough.

It‚Äôs such a lovely day out, a bit expensive given the entry ticket into Tivoli and then the unlimited rides tickets but it‚Äôs all totally worth it as you can go ride as many rides as you want and as many times as you like without a care for the money. Each ride falls in the category of either DKK 30,60 or 90 and the unlimited ticket at DKK 450 more than covers you for value for money back. We also went to grab a bite at the tivoli food hall which was fab - 9-10 different restaurant stalls (flatbreads, sushi, tapas, ramen, burgers and so on) in a covered area with a great buzz and vibe around the area. Also a special shout to Franks Toasts booth out in the gardens next to the rides as it was great grilled sandwiches.

One of the most famous attractions in Copenhagen would close but they do between Halloween and Christmas they close the park for maintenance and putting up the Christmas decoration. This is unheard of, can you imagine they would close Disney land for a week or any other world renowned attraction such as the London twoer or the Louvre museum ?

When I first arrived in Copenhagen, the gardens were closed, while undergoing redecoration for Halloween. Fortunately, they re-opened just before I was to fly home, so I had a chance to visit on a Sunday afternoon, along with what felt like half the population of Copenhagen. Tivoli is nearly 200 years old, and it feels like an ""old-fashioned"" amusement park, but in a good way. Even stuffed with crowds of people of all ages, it was a pleasant place to stroll, enjoy ice cream, and watch Danes having fun.

Check out the highly decorated toilet facilities!

We bought day passes at 130k but do be aware that an all day rides pass is around 24k on top of the entry fee. A few rides required a surcharge - the 3rd mask version of the demonstration roller coaster and the hospital.

There are snacks and food available in the gardens. If you'd rather eat out they have a wrist stamp procedure to allow entry and exits throughout the day.

It's worth seeing at night with the illuminations and sound and lighting show on the little lake.

Having said this , we felt so fortunate to have our first visit to Copenhagen on the day before Tivoli Gardens opened for Halloween. We went in the evening of the second day and spent hours in wide-eyed amazement.
Tivoli doesn't have the famous characters that the other parks have or the iconic rides but it did offer us so much that we can't wait to visit it in a different season.
We wandered throughout the park seeming to find different Halloween sites at every turn and laughing children on rides they didn't have to wait an hour to get on.

I didn't care for the amusement park rides area, but the green space all a-bloom with flowers centered on a large pond was so restful & beautiful.

The High-drop tower was broken (bad start for a premier night) and the swing ride was very tall, giving a great view of the city.

Rides are rather tame by UK theme park standards but will keep the pre teens happy. Lots of food/drink outlets. If you visit the food Hall ensure you get a stamp on your wrist so you can return to Tivoli Park.
Easy to walk from the centre and Nyhavn.
See the peacocks strutting nonchalantly around, including the white one.
Fun to see the prize winning pumpkins. So heavy!!!

They were ready for Halloween. There were families and school kids visiting. It was an enjoyable experience as there was a relaxed, family friendly atmosphere.

The food hall had good food and friendly staff. We also have cakes in Cakenhaven, also very enjoyable.

We spent about 3 hours wandering around and eating. In part because it wasn't crowded - I could sense Tivoli Gardens can get very busy during peak season. Also we didn't go on the rides. All a whole day to visit, maybe two days, if going on the rides during peak season.

The people at the box office have perfect english and take time to go through the options. Got a 2 day pass with unlimited PLUS pass for the older teens who wanted to go on the bigger rides and the Hospital. we also got photos included. You download the app and scan the pictures on the screen by the rides where photos are taken. For some of the rides you need to click on the photo on the screen by the exit of the ride and click print to get the code to scan.
We went Saturday and Sunday. Saturday was extremely busy, and got busier after 3pm. Sunday evening and night was much quieter (presumably people returning home for work on Monday so left park earlier). There are different prices for the weekend and Monday to Friday.
Be careful about where you eat. In Woodhouse burger restaurant the chicken burger was undercooked and when we googled afterwards, other people had flagged this. We considered going to the pirate restaurant the following day, but again saw the same comment on some of the reviews re chicken. So went to Tivoli Food Court instead which had a great choice. We liked pizzas in Gorm and the burritos in Mexican counter. Cheaper than eating in the restaurants. You get hand stamped to return to the park. We also got waffles, icecream and popcorn from the stands as a treat for the kids which they loved. There is a fab Italian where we ate dinner both nights La Vecchia.
We have 2 teens and a 6 year old, with plenty of rides for both age groups.

Denmark,LovetoWalk51,Tivoli Gardens,5.0,"Rides, beautiful gardens, fountains, winding pathways, restaurants (big and small) and entertainment make Tivoli a very unique place to visit. For our September visit the entrance ticket was about $20, ride tickets were $5 each (rides take 1-3 tickets) or a ride bracelet is $35. Tivoli offers dynamic pricing ‚Äì meaning the prices above vary from season to season. Check their website for information. In any case, you do math for the experience you want. It was the ride bracelet for us! Compared to US amusement parks, Tivoili‚Äôs price is very economical! You could easily spend a whole day enjoying everything offered!

The afternoon/evening we visited, the park was fairly empty (great!). We are roller coaster enthusiasts as we live close to Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio the roller coaster capital of the world. Our first ride had to be Rutschebanen, a wooden roller coaster that still has a break man in the middle of the coaster to control the speed. Oh my gosh! Best ride ever!! It was smoothest wooden roller coaster we've ever ridden on! We also rode on the ferris wheel, two different merry-go-rounds (one was two stories and one with HUGE animals with ladders to climb up on the animals), antique cars, the Star Flyer (a swing ride that takes you high in the air), the boats by the pagoda. There is a Hans Christian Anderson themed ride, where many of his stories are are captured in scenes as you ride by in a ""car"".

Those are just a few of the 28 rides. After we finished the rides, we wondered through the beautiful gardens checked out the restaurants (beautiful and all different price ranges) and admired the many fountains and buildings. When the lights came on at dusk - it was a whole different experience. I didn‚Äôt even mention fireworks, concerts, theater, light shows, aquarium (separate entrance fee).

The rides cater for all ages and thrill stages - our teenager loved ""The Demon"" rollercoaster while our little ones had fun on the more gentle rides. There are so many different rides that I recommend getting the unlimited pass so you can try them all - especially if you're visiting with kids as they will likely want to go on the same ones again and again (our youngest went on ""The Camel Trail"" ride four times in a row because he loved it so much) There's also so many different places to eat and drink - and the standard in each seemed to be so much higher than at other amusement parks.

To be honest, we were in doubt. Paying roughly 20 Euro‚Äôs pp for a theme-park where you pay for each ride within the park...that could not be true right?
We read on forums (even here on Tripadvisor): ‚Äúit‚Äôs worth it!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much more than a themepark‚Äù. So we convinced ourself and visited on a Saturday afternoon (and evening). Foolish us...

It‚Äôs small, it‚Äôs crowded, kids and buggies everywhere and lines for attractions as far as the eye could see. Where did we pay money for again? It‚Äôs very commercial, spent spent spent money everywhere! In 15(!!) minutes we walked (in a crowd of people) through the entire park, feeling betrayed and sad.

Okay, the Halloween theme was cool and in the evening the lights where cool. But not 20 Euro‚Äôs-walking over peoples‚Äô heads-crushing kids and buggies kinda cool.

If your visit Copenhagen with (small) kids, it‚Äôs inevitable to visit so good luck! BUT...
If you‚Äôre there as a couple (regardless age), with friends or alone...AVOID!. Spent your hard-earned money elsewhere! Copenhagen is beautiful and expensive...choose wisely.

I don‚Äôt like rides so I love that I can attend with my family and only pay $20. The unlimited ride ticket was worth it for the kids and my husband.
We did a canal boat tour the day prior and bought the combo ticket for the boat tour and tivoli entrance. Not only did we get a discount but we didn‚Äôt have to wait in line at Tivoli. I highly recommend doing that. Also we loved the boat tour.
There are many food options and the food hall has many high quality options. The food was much better than the options in American amusement parks.

I did have one strange experience, however - in the children's toys area. Physically, I was by myself, but yet there were children around me. Their voices and actions were very clear!

Denmark,Franzson,Den Gamle By,5.0,"If you're around you HAVE to visit this one. First I thought it's a bit overprized, but it's totally worth it.

With rooms and workshops you can explore

We learned about unexpected house plants in the greenhouse, sixteenth century roofing techniques, we saw how the poorest lived in the 19th century and even took a tour of a 1970s commune. All this was thanks to the great contents of many of the buildings.

We visited in November, so the Christmas drinks and food really helped to sustain us.

Den Gamble By gets a review from me because there is just so much there, all of it imaginatively presented. Children and adults alike will have a great time.

It's super easy to get to being in the town by the Biological gardens. However this location is a tad weird when you are looking around a 1600's building with a tower block looking over you.
The place is divided into 3 zone 1690's, 1920's and 1979's. The 1600's physically take up the bulk of the area with lots of buildings. The 1920's feature lots of toys and the 70's area more human life with recreations of people's flats.

There is also a fascinating museum below the streets showing life in Aarhus from Viking era to modern day.

There is so much to see and do. Be warned of the cobbles you will need to walk on. Good shoes are important. It is not really accessible for wheelchairs (other Viking museums in Denmark that we visited are very wheelchair friendly). Watch your feet and your head as you go in and out of the buildings. Not all of them are very old: it goes up to buildings from 1970s. There were a few real people in some of the houses who were happy to talk about what they were doing. A young lady in the 1927 house did a great job of pretending it was 1927 except for the fact that she spoke excellent English - an unlikely scenario a century ago. An upright piano stood in the living room and I fortunately remembered a Danish piece to play on it (Scherzo by Gade) for which I was rewarded with a cup of coffee. There are horse-drawn carriages to ride on if you feel rich enough (I saw one young lady going along in a carriage engrossed in her iPhone. Ah the youth of today!)

Den Gamle By is essentially an old reconstructed town but through the ages...there are old houses set up displaying the various aspects of life in the 1300s, right up to 70s Aarhus at the other end! The exhibits are a mix of displays with information boards, clever interactive projections and hands on bits and pieces to try. Other attractions include an 18-1900s play park with ‚Äúpirate ship‚Äù swings and various other old games to try for free, horse drawn carriage rides around the site (fee payable) and botanical gardens. There are also various period and modern shops to try such as an old sweet shop and a 70s tea room as examples!

Denmark,Elizabethadvisor,Den Gamle By,5.0,"Den Gamble By is next to the Botanical Garden in Aarhus, Denmark. You could easily combine the visit to both places, but you will want to plan to spend most of the day at Den Gamble By.

I have visited Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia, a recreation of colonial buildings from the 1700's.
Den Gamble By is far more impressive, because these are the actual buildings that were moved from various locations throughout Denmark and reassembled here in Aarhus.
There is an exhibit on how the buildings were actually constructed in the 15th century. It showed how the bricks, tiles and lumber were made. Also explained how the houses were first made in a carpenter's workshop, dismantled and then reassembled at their final location. These buildings were expertly constructed, which is why we are able to enjoy them today.

Don't miss the exhibit about the history of Aarhus including during WWII in the 1970 section of the town.

Everything has English translations.

Be sure to check out the Aarhus Museum under the streets of the 1970's section of the park, It could be easy to miss! The restaurant was pretty good too. We were expecting it to be expensive and really bad food like at an American theme park. But it was pretty good traditional Danish food. It isn't fine dining at all, but pretty good for the price.

While the cars and the motorbikes were a part of the 1920's and 1970's sections of the park they were a really loud annoyance in the old town part of this park.

The park is a tourist type thing to do. But it is pretty cool! Our friends who live in Aarhus, who have kids, have season tickets, so the locals enjoy it too.

Denmark,Tsung Wei W,Den Gamle By,4.0,"I'll be honest. We didn't have high expectations. WIth two young kids in tow, we were simply trying to find something to do for the afternoon.

We walked around in circles for about 20 minutes, trying to find the location. Google Maps was not a big help. Den Gamly By is going through some renovations, so we just couldn't find it's entrance.

Once we got there though. Here's where things got interesting.

From the photographs and the bland description on the internet, Den Gamly By sounds like a typical tourist trap. A couple of old looking buildings? Check. Random references to 'heritage' and 'history'? Check. And so on. And initially, it did feel that way. But Den Gamly By also showcases buildings that aren't reconstructions, but are actually made of the same structures as buildings and architecture that existed centuries ago. It attempts to recreate a picture of the past. Some of it is admittedly cheesy, but most of it is mostly interest.

We also really loved the staff that work there. The mini playground was a good escape for the kids, and the gentleman that worked there laughed with us, teased and told my 4 year old wild stories, and played tic-tac-toe on the sandy ground with my 8 year old (he lost). The storekeeper at the old-style toy shop was also an absolute class act.

Other parts we enjoyed was the 'time machine' that showed us the history and evolution of Aarhus through a series of small exhibitions by date. It was surprisingly fun and interesting.

One last warning, don't even attempt to bring your stroller. The cobblestone streets will not be kind to it.

Denmark,Sa-i44,Den Gamle By,5.0,"Den Gamle By is an Old Town Museum, an open-air museum of urban history and culture with 75 original Danish buildings from 1597-1909, all brought over from all over the country. They literally rebuilt them each stone by stone to recreate the villages of the past. There are sections from 1864, 1927 and 1974. The streets were cobblestones and narrow, just like in the olden days, and the houses were all are half-timbered. There are usually people playing characters from the appropriate times, in the appropriate clothes portraying a functioning pre-industrialized Danish village. But I was here more off-season so we only saw one or two.

We were taken on a trip to the past, from the first Vikings to the present day, all with the appropriate houses, manikins in the clothes of the time, shops (both models of bakeries, carpentry shops, groceries, etc, as well as real shops selling souvenirs) and restaurants. I particularly got a kick out of Poul‚Äôs Radio Shop filled all types of old radios and tape recorders that I grew up with. There was a car repair shop and we watched as they tried to back an old car into the garage. We stopped at a bakery for some traditional Danish sweets made from historical recipes, and we ate them as we continued walking around the museum.

My favorite part was a separate exhibit on the 1200 year history of Aarhus, called the Aarhus Story. We entered an elevator which slowly took us down one level. And during that ride we watched a video which set the stage for the rest of the museum. The video was 360 degrees, all around the walls of the elevator. We stepped out into the time of the Vikings and continued walking through the life of Aarhus, continuing with Middle Ages, the Market Town period, the Industrial period, the German occupation, to today, the City of Smiles and present day Aarhus. Each period was characterized by the furniture of the time, videos with ‚Äúpeople‚Äù living then, artifacts and interactive exhibits.

The museum inside the old cinema building is an attraction in its own right. Time here was time very well spent.",Jun 2019
Denmark,SteveDMountainman,Den Gamle By,4.0,It's a great way to spend a few hours. It looks deceptively quicK to get around but there is something to see in nearly every building. We spent a good 4 hours here and had lunch. Luvly place to visit. Very photogenic,Jun 2019

The 3 different historical periods shown through architecture was great although we (like everybody else) seemed to spend the longest time in the oldest period. The buildings in such a beautiful setting are so photogenic. But the one special note we would add here is not to skip the very last area where the museums are. The √Örhus story tells the history of √Örhus through excellent use of technology and some great old photos. The presentation works well to do so seamlessly in Danish and English. Though not really for younger kids, teens and adults would do well not to skip this great museum when visiting Den Gamble By.",May 2019

Denmark,PNWtraveler,Den Gamle By,5.0,"A must-see stop when in Denmark! They are saving and rescuing historical buildings around Denmark and moving them to this one open air walkable museum. Saving buildings of all types and ages, from the lowliest farmhand bedroom to the grand mansions and everything in between. See how a tailor might have lived, a shoe maker, a hat maker, a cook. All authentically rebuilt. Some have mannequins to help visualize, some do not. The mansion offers guides in both Danish and English. The cobbled streets are not easy to walk on, but authentic. There are areas to sit and relax, several public bathrooms, and even a fabulous restaurant you can stop for lunch in the ""wine cellar"" of the mansion. The atmosphere alone is worth the stop there and have a cup of coffee and some Danish cookies. The most surprising stop was an entire city block recreated as it would have looked circa 1975.

Denmark,Susan A,Den Gamle By,3.0,Visited the city by cruise ship. We had a free shuttle to the entrance of port. Then were told to walk to the Den Gamle By as it was not far. Boy were they wrong. It was two miles there and as we walked up others from the ship were brought over by the shuttle bus. We were a little dismayed at that. Well by then we were tired but did walk around the old village and buildings were well restored. Make sure you stop in the bakery and try the Danish cookie in there. yummy.

By the way, children & teenagers are entirely free to bring along, which is great.
Den Gamle By is very unique, as there's no commercial agenda being pushed while you're there. You can stay for an hour or 4 without feeling anyone is pushing you to spent money or do something specific, which I really like.
I always feel reinvigorated, enriched & relaxed after visiting Den Gamle By",Dec 2018

There are animators dressed up accordingly and visitors are welcome to interact with them. Most speak English, too. One can spend a full day in Den Gamle By. There are enough places to get something to eat and drink, as well as restrooms. Be prepared with comfy shoes as there are cobble stones to walk on, and stairs inside buildings to climb.

Denmark,Stenvoid,Den Gamle By,4.0,"Aarhus is perhaps a victim of its own success. There is so much to see and do, that it's inevitable some places only have limited time if you're only there for a couple of days. Den Gamle By (The Old Town) was the last museum we visited on our second day - and we arrived when it only had an hour until closing (it was due to close at 4pm, which is early but probably because of natural light restrictions at this time of year). I had used an Aarhus card, which meant I had no problem with paying for an hour visit as I had already paid. My two children (16 and 12) were free- so I could essentially walk in with them. We zoomed around and the key thing was to visit as many of the indoor living exhibits as possible - we saw a bakery from 1974, houses from the same period, and older history of Aarhus and Danish life. The house with bugs (large and small) was amazing, and gave a different twist on what real life is! What might seem quite dry as a concept was actually fascinating - to be immersed into the relatively recent history of a different country was really educational but also fun. The boys loved it, and the only disappointment was that we had to leave after an hour. Not their fault though!

There are buildings, such as bakeries, bars or shops, which are representative for their times and inside you can find people dressed accordingly that are willing to serve you and offer more information about their era.

Also there are people walking on the streets of the old city that are dressed as they used to to hundreds of years ago, also there carriages driving around.

Whilst most history museums brings you back in time virtually, this museum lets you experience what it is like to live in the past, with actual furnished buildings from the past complete with horse carriages galloping through the cobblestoned streets and costumed stage actors role-playing certain activities from a different era. The museum covers era from the Viking age till the 17th to the 20th century, depicting how life is like in those eras through the experiences of real-life individuals. Even the restaurants give you a feel like you are dining in a medieval tavern. A truly 5-star museum bringing you a 5-star experience! Worth every $$$ of the entrance fees.

Food, beverages, toilets, miniscooters and wagons can be rented as well as lockers. The cobblestone streets can be treacherous, however and some are sloped. Use great care when walking them. Map was a bit confusing and it took a while to figure it out. Be sure to stop by the bakery for danish. There is a good variety and all was delicious, especially the sugar pretzels. We had about an hour which was not nearly enough time so be sure to allot more time. You could easily spend an entire day here immersing yourself in the history. Or, better yet, return a second day. We visited on Sunday but the crowds were not too bad. You could still get around. And, there is a horse carriage if you choose to see it that way.

Denmark,sunseeker2016,Den Gamle By,5.0,"They keep on improving ""the old town"" in Arhus. I've been here many times (once lived in Arhus for a few years with my young family) I was back on holidays over Xmas last year, and was very happy to walk through the 1960's-70's installation for the first time. You really felt like you were back there, with a few memories of the culture of the times in vivid colour- the furniture, the fittings, the wallpaper, the art, the music, etc, etc.

Of course, being Xmas, most of the historic shops, and other attractions were manned, the Xmas market in the square was in full swing and the large Xmas tree was colourfully decorated. You could see how life was lived and Xmas celebrated in the past in Denmark, and buy your glugg (mulled wine ) and aeble skiver (very tasty). The horse drawn carriage clattered over the cobblestones, with it's in-character driver, and you could buy home made pastries from an old fashioned baker, and hand-made sweets from the old-fashioned confectionery. You really do need at-least half a day here. So much to see, and now, so much nostalgia. A real walk down memory lane, and back into history too.

Apparently, the old shops and houses were relocated here from all over Denmark. Even the flats from the 60's and 70's. Lucky you if you are going to be in Arhus over Xmas 2018!! Not to be missed.

Denmark,nardiagolder,Den Gamle By,5.0,"I'm not entirely sure why some previous reviews have rated it so poorly as I thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Den Gamle By. First of all, yes there is contruction going on at one end, but those parts that were open were fantastic. I loved that you could walk into the buildings and get a feel of how people lived in certain times.
The new museum (The Aarhus Story) is amazing - what a great idea. I also loved the detail - so much has gone into each house/building with regards to decor and such. It really was a wonderful way to spend a few hours. I thoroughly enjoyed it. As for the ticket price? I felt it was quite reasonable.

TIP - The roads are cobble stone and there is a lot of uneven ground and stepping up/over thresholds when entering houses. Some houses/buildings have more than one set of stairs and uneven areas of ground. So this might be something to consider if you have young children in strollers or mobility issues.

You can go in different houses. There is even a museum, where you can learn about √Örhus(Aros) history and there is a steam engine/train in there aswell. During summer, there are actors in the street pretending there are from another lifetime, it's hilarious. During x-mas time it's so cosy, you can buy typical danish cakes, hotdogs, √¶bleskiver made the traditionnel way and so on. But it's also the Danes favorite place to go during weekends, so aspect to stand in line before getting in. Inside there are to bakerys and the lovely Simonsens Have, where you can have a nice danish meal for instance Stjeneskud or Tarletter or Sm√∏rrebr√∏d. I highly recommend this experience.
You can easily spend a half day in the gamle by, because the museum has expanded the last couple of yours. Some curiosities are: Bents Jazzbar and the house from the seventies. There is also and oldfashioned playground for kids. You can also pay to have a small trip in Hestevogn/horsecarrier in the old city. I think it cost around 30 kr per person (remember cash).

The minute you step in through the gates, you feel as if you have been transported to a village somewhere back in time. You can go into all the houses and see how people lived, you can discover the conditions of the working-men and also learn how new inventions in food, medicine, machinery etc. were made over time. It is like walking through the history of daily life and learning how Denmark has grown to what it is today.

One tip: I have been there twice in the summer and once in the winter. In the summer the place is quite lively. The museum workers are role-playing and you see people out and about. In the winter the place was quite deserted and I saw only a couple of people here and there and so I felt it was slightly less fun. And since it is an open museum it was quite cold to walk around and explore things. But I have heard that the place is quite lively during Christmas time.

Loved the old bakery as well as the 1970's one where you could sit down and have coffee, also loved the old radio house and the turn of the century style shop complete with the shopkeeper and assistants in white aprons. Nice touch with the staff dressed in period clothing, coming and going and doing errands, driving horse and carriage etc. Really appreciated that you can go inside most of the houses, look at the furniture and really imagine what it was like to live during that period of time.

The only downside I would say is that most of the streets are Stone paths. They well represent the old town of Aarhus but not so friendly for people with ankle problems. A more flat sidewalk would be great.,Sep 2018
Denmark,Justin Yu,Den Gamle By,5.0,"This is a must-see stop if you're visiting Aarhus. This small open-air museum covers three main time periods: ~1700's, ~1900's, and ~1970's. Each of these have very unique and interesting pieces and information, and you can clearly see where the temporal separation happens. You can enter almost every building, and there are plenty of places to eat and shop, all with period accurate goods and food. It was a blast having some afternoon tea in a 1970's tea shop, and to shop in what would be a late 1700's/early 1800's general store. I could have easily spent the entire day here.",Aug 2018
Denmark,Timski4u,Den Gamle By,5.0,"Went here in the morning just as it opened and spent 2+ hours walking through history. This is a very interesting, indeed fascinating place where history seems to come to life and actually does through costumed characters found throughout the area. The shops are also themed to the appropriate period with static shop window displays of the period. Try the cakes from the traditional bakery! A very relaxing and enjoyable place to visit.",Aug 2018
Denmark,Robert D,Den Gamle By,4.0,"While visiting Aarhus, Denmark, my wife and I enjoyed a partial guided walking tour of the Old Town (Den Gamle By) on June 1, 2018. It is an open air museum of how it all used to be. There are houses and businesses that are full of history and nostalgia and preserved as they were from 1500's to 1950's. The staff are very knowledgeable and dress in period costumes. There are even horse and cart rides, and free clean toilets. The old town restaurant serves good quality Danish cuisine. It is a nice experience and highly recommended.",Jun 2018
Denmark,SMGoRo,Den Gamle By,4.0,"This history geek really enjoyed her leisurely stroll through 3 different time periods at this living history museum. If I had kids or teenagers with me, though, I would have needed a few more costumed interpreters and a bit more explanation than was offered. The best part was the variety of craftspeople and small shops - in each of the 3 time periods - illustrating ""this is how we made a living"" and ""this is how we make things/repair things"". Don't miss the 1927 black & white animated short movie in the auto repair shop - it was great with the interactive machinery in the shop!",Aug 2018

We walked along the canal and reached a town of living human history. It took us back to before 1900's and got us up to today.
The presentation of the time and culture is stunning.
You can even enjoy the street games of those days yourselves.
Wonderful experience.
You can taste the cookies of those times and actually live the history yourselves.

Denmark,Catharine O,Den Gamle By,5.0,Don‚Äôt miss this fascinating living museum. The plan to rescue old buildings due for demolition and bring them to this site has been ongoing for years and is a fantastic idea. A large part is dedicated to houses dating from the time of Hans Christian Andersen (one of which he visited). Actors play the roles of people who lived and worked in the houses and are only too delighted to engage in conversation with any visitors and answer questions.,Aug 2018
Denmark,Max_Argentina2014,Den Gamle By,5.0,"If that were possible, it has been added a new attraction to this place: its is an underground exhibition featuring life in and around Arhus since year 800 AD recreating a typical Viking Village, to current day Arhus.
It offers wide array of artifacts multimedia effect to immerse visitor in an authentic experience.
Worth to comment the set up of a real steam locomotive!
Also, it has been added some newly brought houses to make even more enjoyable the visit.
I warmly recomed it, as it is kind of unique in its sort. If possible, take a guided tour for deeper understanding of not only exhibited houses, but also life around it and the efforts done to bring them (REAL houses) up to this location.

In fact, the consensus was that we wished that we had a lot more time to visit. Den Gamle By is a fascinating place to visit tracing traditional Danish homes and business from the early middle ages through the 1970's. The facility is well maintained and it is absolutely fun place to be. If you are in Aarhus or even the general area take the time to visit.",Jul 2018
Denmark,butterfly00,Den Gamle By,2.0,"We were at the park for over an hour before we found a character in costume. And the person was totally unengaged and didn‚Äôt bother to stay in character or really interact with our 4 year old (which is why we came). Then the two ‚Äúmerchants‚Äù manning the shop totally ignored our kid other than to hand him a piece of candy. The only characters who actually talked to our son were the women in the kitchen. The place required a ton of walking on cobblestone streets and was not wheelchair accessible. Lots of stairs and bumpy cobblestone with no smooth paths (which was really rough on our travel stroller and basically requires us to carry the baby by hand the entire time so he didn‚Äôt get constantly jostled).
The ‚Äútime machine‚Äù exhibit from Vikings to 1970s was interesting but set up as an old fashioned (ie not interactive) museum exhibit that required a lot of reading (which our 4 year old can‚Äôt do).
The old fashioned carnival was cute.
We went to this because we thought it would be good for the kids but it was surprisingly boring and not family friendly.

I expected to spend there just a few hours (maybe 3 at most), but I was actually there for around 4 or 5 hours and hadn't even seen everything yet!

The Old Town (Den Gable By) is really fascinating and there is loads to see. I loved how there where three eras in time represented in the town. It's like traveling through time, starting in 1864, going through 1927 and ending in the 70s. Also, there were some really interesting museums and exhibitions within the park, that are definitely worth a visit (such as the poster museum, which I really liked).

I didn't expect to enjoy Den Gable By this much, but it was awesome! Definitely recommended.

Denmark,Jerandnanc,Den Gamle By,3.0,"We found the place fascinating and were impressed by the ""Priest and his mother"" in the first house we visited. They were codial, helpful, knowledgable and fun to talkj to. At this point, based on their outstanding start, we were looking forward to learning more. Unfotunately, most of the exhibits do not have human docents to help explain individual houses. We saw the doctor, smiths and gardeners but most locations had no one. The signage was adequate and a few semi-holographic characters were fun. The cookie/bee shop had some tasty treats. The gift shop was surprisingly small.

Bottom line, the park needs more ""priests and mother""-type docents to explain the village. Tbis park could then be more than satisfactory.

We especially liked the more recent parts to show our kids how it was in the 70s. Also the playground with ancient toys was very nice. If you come with a baby or toddler, I would recommend to use a baby carrier / sling / wrap to carry your child. The roads are very uneven (in the old parts) and you cannot take your pram or stroller inside the houses. Another suggestion: if you want to park your car on the free places during summertime, you really have to be there at 10am. In addition, realize that you only can park there for 5 hours, we had to leave earlier than we wanted because if the parking limit.

Denmark,GayMafiaBoss,Den Gamle By,5.0,"I went to visit a friend in Aarhus and as always, wanted to check out the local scene. I know that most of Denmark was spared the ravages of WWII and was looking to see some great old structures. What I wasn't prepared for was the area called Den Gamely By. Its a small town created within Aarhus that encompasses the history of the area. It showcases streets that are reproduced to amazing detail of a specific time in their past. From a Viking village to a 1960's beauty parlor its quite a sight to see. There is a gated entrance where they charge approximately USD $20 per person (depending on the time of year) for over 18 years old. As you walk down each street the shops and homes (which you may enter) are designed with period pieces, decor and some are even working shops. Many of the shops have actors who are dressed in period clothing, speak period language and in a few areas, they were making food from that time. Some areas were museum like and others were actual stores. In the photo, we were buying some sausages that were made like they were 100 years prior. The sausage was made on site and other than the credit card terminal hid under the counter, you would never know you were not in the 1800s. Each street you turned down was another period in time and regardless of your age, you will find something that will amaze you. One of my favorite areas was an apartment building that was moved to the location and restored with the original furnishings. The original apartment dweller donated the pieces and they were placed in the same position they were in 50 years ago! They even have photos and videos taken by the original owner hanging on the wall which shows the apartment exactly as it was. There are so many fantastic things to see and do I rate this as one of my favorite hidden gems of Europe!

Denmark,Eva Campos,Den Gamle By,5.0,"I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend the experience to everyone: alone, couples or family.

Den Gamle By imitates a mid XIX century town. Some houses are real but built and transported from other places of Denmark. It's like coming back in time. You can go inside of the houses and find actors. Also there are shops and work places.

Moreover, you can travel to the 1970's.

Sometimes you can coincide with special events (unfortunately, not our case) or temporary exhibitions.

In any case, the entrance is worth it. You can spend the hours perfectly trying to discover all the houses opened.

This was MUCH BETTER.
Combining really old buildings (1700-1800) and some from 1920's and -70's gives this place much more depth.
We spent there 5 hours (with a lunch break and some playing time) and if it wasn't that hot could have spent some time more.
Personnel playing their characters added some atmosphere, but without knowing the language we missed some of it.

The old town itself is amazing. The entire city is recreated and takes you back to 1970's.

Furthermore, one museum is dedicated to exhibit the gowns worn by Queen Margrethe II, which gave me a new insight into her personal preferences.

There are several possibilities to get something to eat, however most closed at 1600, the museum is open til 1800 most days, so if you plan a meal the you should try to get there earlier than 1600.

We spent around two hours, strolling leisurely, we did not get to see everything in that time, so I would recommend around three hours, with a break for refreshments. The area is quite large, so wear good shoes as the cobbled streets can be a bit tiresome to walk for hours.

There are some truly magnificent buildings and historical artefacts on display, and some specially themed exhibitions there.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs even more fun when the museum is open so you can go inside buildings, see the reenactors, etc. Even so, it‚Äôs well worth a visit after closing time too.

I‚Äôm so glad the operators trust people enough to leave the area open so you can stroll through the picturesque buildings without the crowds. (I suppose this is a country where hardly anyone locks their bikes.) It‚Äôs also a wonderful opportunity to get outstanding photographs without other people in the way. I barely saw a soul, just a couple other tourists, plus some locals who were jogging or walking dogs.

The museum is absolutely huge and is fairly unique for its type in covering city rather than country life. There are some medieval and Renaissance buildings, lots of 18th- and 19th-century structures, and several 20th-century neighborhoods.

Each building has signage in Danish, English, and German, so you can still get a lot out of your visit if you go after hours. (Another bonus, it‚Äôs free, compared to a pretty hefty daytime admission!) I spent almost two hours there enjoying the views.

The museum is connected to the botanical gardens. It‚Äôs just outside the main city center but is still very close to major sights. It was a 10-15-minute walk from my hotel on N√∏rre All√©.

All of the information and displays provide interesting details into how the city was established. The display of the Queen‚Äôs gowns and clothing was quite interesting and I was surprised to learn that the Queen repurposed her clothing.

The grounds feature three distinct periods in Aarhus history and provide an idea what life was like for both the well to do as well as the poor. The carriage ride adds enjoyment for children but the facility lacks other displays which would appeal to children. The plexiglass, although allowing visibility, does not provide a hands on experience. To improve the facility, I suggest a hands on experience such as a school with desks where children could actually sit and use the slates and do some of the assignments typical of the era. Another sugestion would be to provide toys of former days and let the children play with toys. The amusement area with the boat ride and games is hands on but the area needs more displays to enhance the experience.

The saving grace in my honest opinion is the underground museum of √Örhus. Very well designed and curated. Had lots of history and interactive booths and displays. This was good. Other than that I much preferred the circle museum.",May 2018
Denmark,Ali_Mughal,Den Gamle By,5.0,"We figured 2 hours would be enough time to spend here, definitely not. We didnt get to finish it and we're not sure if we got lost but it was serendipitous. We began just sauntering around the old homes of the shoe makers, carpenters (i wont give it all away) They had these manniquins/wax models that were scarily realistic, sound effects, actors and it's huge. it's not like a visit to a museum, it's like they've frozen an entire village. Then after visiting a typical shop, hairdresser we went to this time travel building which takes you through a chonological order of what happened in Aarhus. because it was so big we thought we must have got lost but actually it's just impressively huge. We stayed an extra half hour after closing. I enjoyed Aarhus more than Copenhagen

Denmark,Vekster,Den Gamle By,5.0,"Amazing place. Well presented and maintained. Kids (9 and 11) found it interesting enough, with enough to explore to keep them entertained while us grown ups read the signs. Lunch was an interesting option.... the kids option in the restaurant didn't float our darling's boat, but we were allowed to leave and re-enter with our ticket (see FFood review for a good local spot).

One can bring in a picnic, but in mid April that's a chilly option!

Overall, a tiring day but well worth the entry fee. Coming soon...a 2014 housing zone and a dockyard setting. :-)

Denmark,Susan,Den Gamle By,5.0,"One of the most unique attractions in √Örhus and simply a must when visiting the city. You are taken several centuries back in time, where you will meet people who lived many years ago. You can talk to them, and they might ask you to do something. You get such a clear picture of the time. I was particularly interested in exploring the 1920ies, the time when my dad was a little boy.

I was there in the beginning of December, so very inspiring to see how Christmas was celebrated. In the caf√© I tasted cookies etc as they made them many years ago.

Highly recommended, but make sure to spend at least 4 hours there.

I can only imagine how lovrly it would be on a summer day, with loads of people and activities around.

There are also some more contemporary re-created buildings, including a number from the 1970s. We qactually found these the most interesting to visit as each tells the story of the people whose real-life flats/shops and apartments these have been based on.

There are cafe and restaurants on site and even a recreated jazz bar that closed in the early 80s only to find new life here. When we visited there was soem building work going on as they are creating a new harbour area.

To me perhaps the most interesting part was the juxtaposition of the old buildings with the modern city skyscrapers that peer in from the real city outside.

Even on a Monday there were artisans working in most of the workshops and all the buildings were open that should have been.
The site is cunningly split into 4 different periods rather than into a chronological sequence.
The transitions can be interesting when a couple of hundred years are involved.
The Teahouse was in lovely setting with lots of outside tables. Unfortunately service is hit and miss at best or downright disorganised. Having lost our order they did however discount the bill by way of an apology......certainly sweetened the bill.

Denmark,jensg69,Den Gamle By,5.0,"By visiting ""Den gamle by"" you experience a fascinating, and potentially time-consuming, time travel back in time, starting from 1864 over 1927 to 1974. I write potentially time-consuming, because the whole museum is quite extended and, on top of that, it is really easy to get sucked in to the lifes of people of another time. The amount of information, presented in small texts next to many of the rooms in the historical houses, is surprising, and can fulfill the history-buff, and may overwhelm the not quite so interested, but it is also easy to plan your own itenerary - fx. go through only the 1927-part of the town - and choose what you want to see in that area. With the brain full of impressions you can enjoy a cake and coffee in the historical caf√©, a variety of beverages and something to eat in a cosy backyard/ garden called ""Simonsens have"" (where you also may enjoy a acting performance on a little stage), og visit the old cellar, ""Winekes vinstue"" designed as a 18th century bar, where a local beer may be enjoyed, besides coffee and cakes. Besides those places, the most impressive houses is the royal minters palace-like home, the old apothecary and a long range of craftsmen homes/workplaces. And the latest addition to the museum town is another time travel within the time travelling experience; the underground museum telling the history of Aarhus focusing on the viking-age, the industrialization in the late 1800's, and the Second World War in Aarhus 1940-45. Lots of interactive thing to be entertained and informed by. On top of that, the museum town is also made even more alive during summertime and Christmas through staff dressed in historical clothes (some playing historical roles), the possibility of a ride with the horse carriages, the historical shops (bakery,candyshop) - and much much more.

Denmark,Wellgrove,Den Gamle By,5.0,"I expected to be bored and was very sceptical - but was instead impressed.
How can you not be charmed when a perfectly dressed vicar passes by and takes off his hat to greet you? Or when a shop offers to sell you all sorts of old-fashioned Christmas decorations in July?
Everything is impressively well done and there are so many different buildings (and gardens) from different parts of Denmark that you could easily spend many hours there.
A friend had told us not to miss the new exhibition ""Aarhus fort√¶ller"" (i.e. Aarhus tells its story), which is all underground - or actually it starts in the lift taking you downstairs - and very enjoyable. (Near the back entrance).

Denmark,snail888,Den Gamle By,4.0,"This is one of the strangest places I have visited in recent years. However it was interesting and quirky and worth the entrance fee. The basic idea is that old and historic buildings have been moved from their locations to here. There is such a mix of eras from 17th century to a modern day flat. There are shops with historic interpreters correct for the era of the building. We ate some lovely biscuits from one of them. By the entrance is a history of aarhus exhibit which in itself takes a good hour to go round and was very interesting. I thought the houses of all eras were well laid out with good room interpretations and furniture this includes the more modern ones too. We ate lunch in one of the cafes very traditional danish. We had the open sandwiches with odd toppings and certainly not to the kids liking but nice to have something traditional.

It is important to go here on a sunny day to enjoy the exterior and interior architecture of the buildings. You will find several diners, cafes and shops in this town with staff dressed up in traditional outfits playing roles.

Denmark,Aryeh B,Den Gamle By,5.0,"For over 100 years the museum of Den Gamle By (by is pronounced boo!) has been relocating buildings from all over Denmark to this hillside site in Aarhus. Not only have they become expert in reconstructing the originals but the buildings are placed as if naturally built in the area. Helpful and friendly park employee in period costumes abound with stories, and shows that make each period come alive through explanations and demonstrations. Having been to many other such parks, we were not expecting much, but were very taken with the extent that the museum has gone to make you feel the history. The Den Gamle By App works very well with additional explanations of almost all the buildings on your smartphone, and at the old post office you can have your postcards and letters hand canceled and sent anywhere in the world. Goods produced in the park in authentic ways are available for sale including food goodies. While the 1864 and 1920's exhibits were very interesting (the former for its buildings and rustic life scene, and the latter for the toy museum), we were most taken by the 1970 reconstruction of 6 apartments showing how people lived in the post war years. We learned that, where for most Americans it would be unheard of to for 2 families to have shared a toilet, this was common in Danish cities. The lives of a couple of school teachers, hippies, working people, a school principle, a student from Greenland, Turkish immigrants and a blind man were opened to us in a fascinating manner. Plenty to do for kids and adults.

Denmark,ngg2118,Den Gamle By,4.0,Den Gamle By was rather fascinating....it really takes you back to the time of Hans Christian Andersen and what life was really like in Denmark back in the 17 and 1800s. I found it remarkable that all of the buildings were original as were all the artifacts inside. There are guides in most of the buildings acting and dressed as they would have been in that era and the stories are fascinating.,May 2017
Denmark,Wajo,Den Gamle By,4.0,"It is interesting, that objects that existed in our family house when we were small children, in the sixties and seventies, are not just considered as old curiousities, but has become part of history, worth while showing to younger generations . An example of a 70th Kommune looked just like our 80th Students Home, though, but may be we missed the point there üòâ. Most people would be more interested in the buildings of older age, what impressed me there again is all the examples of old craftmanship, nowadays not so visible anymore when many products are made in far away places.

Denmark,Good food lover The Original,Den Gamle By,5.0,"OK, so it is official, my time is now history!!!
This is a great town with Aarhus. The houses brought in from different centuries have been beautifully rebuilt into what looks as though it has always been there. When we went the streets were set up as 1927. So interesting to see what imports were used and sold at the time, while much of Europe was at war. No, I'm not THAT old, as there was a new section of the town set up as 1974! A new museum that looks like a 1960's shop from the outside hides a wealth of interesting exhibits. From Vikings, Georg Jensen's Jewellery, a little on some of the resistance in WWII. Very interesting, and not known so well as the French and Norwegian. Films, artefacts and interesting individual stories are abundant.
Then comes the 1974 street. With a bakers selling real 1974 styles of bread and cake to have with a coffee, or move a little along the street and see the apartment blocks wet up with the families' suggested belongings that lived in them in 1974. So very interesting. The toilet on the kitchen stairs for example, was a new one on me. So brave of the authorities to finance such a wonderful capsule of time.
Too much to see all of it, so pick your route carefully. Eat walking distance from the town centre. Lots of places to eat and snack. Friendly, interesting caretakers that man the buildings. Definitely something for for everyone to enjoy, from young children to the oldies like me, that thought 1974 was recent!

Denmark,Veronika660,Den Gamle By,5.0,"I came across this place when I was wandering in Aarhus, waiting for the check-in time at my hotel. I checked the map and thought, well this will take me about 30 minutes. In the end, I stayed there for almost three hours and I came back several days later to spend there other two hours.
I generally love open air museums and this one is very well done.
The museum has three parts documenting three different periods in the Danish history - 18-19th ventury, the 1920s and the 1970s, if I remember correctly. A new part is now in construction, so maybe another period will be added.
A lot of houses have expositions inside and there are also several museums - on Aarhus history, clocks, posters, jewels, toys etc. It is also possible to take a ride in a carriage, try to walk on stilts, sit down in one of the gardens or have lunch/coffee in one of the restaurants.
The museum is quite compact, so you do not need to walk too much. At the same time, the place tends to be crowded or, rather, overcrowded, which is the only thing I did not appreciate. In all other respects, I found the museum absolutely amazing.

This has created a time-travel journey for us from the 1600-1974. Once you get over your childhood being viewed as history by the school children on a visit you'll slip into a feeling of awe.
I'm a history buff, but even I was filled up to the brim with information, sights and sounds.
This place is well priced, although I went on a weekday which I believe may be slightly cheaper. There are cafes and shops within the museum selling food and drink at reasonable prices (no price hikes that are usual when the audience is captive). I enjoyed a wonderful pot of tea in the 1974 themed cafe for 25 krone- it would have done nicely for six of us!
Allow at least two hours, but more for a full treat.

Historic buildings from all over Denmark have been relocated to this site next to the Aarhus botanical gardens. The 'Aarhus Fort√¶ller' exhibition would in itself take half a day to do justice to.

My boyfriends loves taking photos of the houses outside.",May 2017
Denmark,Istayedthere,Den Gamle By,3.0,"Interesting and pretty open air museum. I thought it would be a bit more hands on, but mainly they are buildings that you can enter but then are faced with perspex screens to look at the interiors from a distance. Information boards outside each building. I found the Toy Museum a disappointment as mainly just a collection of toys behind glass, little information and no staff on hand. It was more a collection rather than a museum. I do not have difficulty walking but found the cobbled streets, especially those on an incline, quite difficult to walk on. I understand that this is of course in keeping with the whole concept, but just a word of warning to any elderly or infirm people as I did notice many people with walking difficulties, especially those walking sticks, were having trouble, but I saw no warnings outside.

Denmark,terrionly,Den Gamle By,5.0,All the reviews were right! This is a must see when visiting Denmark. Amazing buildings and museum exhibits from the 16th and 17th centuries. Very educational if you are looking for that Denmark history. We found it fascinating. Give yourself at least two hours if you want to experience it all and more time if you want to enjoy any of the dining options.,May 2017
Denmark,MarinaAagaard,Den Gamle By,4.0,"One of the most popular museums of Denmark, if you are into history and cobblestones it is a must-see. In season open shops/workshops.
Recently a not-so-old-attraction, a popular 1970's section has been added; disturbs old-town idea somewhat, but seeing it will bring back memories to some. Nice, but crowded during summer. Also nice, but cold, in winter around Christmas.",Dec 2016

Denmark,KatieSmithExplores,Den Gamle By,5.0,"An amazing place to walk around and even when they close the doors to the houses and shops at 5pm you are still allowed to wander around the streets which is great. We found this out as we turned up at 4.20pm and had 40 mins to have a look inside places before just taking a more leisurely stroll through the amazing streets. I think there might have been the odd thing we missed so I'd definitely allow a couple of hours at least, for the full experience, not including stopping for lunch/coffee/cake! But the set up is amazing, it looks like a movie set, but you know this is how it would have looked! And we more or less had the place to ourselves on an April Monday evening. I'd definitely love to come back for the full experience and would recommend to anyone as a highlight of Aarhus!

In the 70s there were old fashioned phones in each building. You could ring other places like the hairdressers or the bookshop etc. In the 20s there was old bakery's that were open and running. There were horse and carriage you could ride on also.,Apr 2017

Denmark,Jude C,Den Gamle By,5.0,"Having shops stocked and workshops with equipment in them, plus homes furnished reflecting the time period, makes it very real and very interesting.

In fact the focus on three eras is very clever. And if you are a certain age, the 1970s era properties are scarily familiar...

The all year cafe is good and I would imagine that in season, when the staff in character costiumes are around and the beer garden are open, would be even more fun.

Denmark,Angela C,Den Gamle By,5.0,"This is an open air museum meaning ' The Old Town' in Danish and is located in the botanical gardens. It was opened in 1914 and was the world's first open-air museum. There are 75 historical buildings, some from as far back as the 16th century, and collected from all over Denmark.
Divided into time zones, there are workshops, a herbalist's garden, a post office and a jazz club, as well as museums dedicated to posters, toys, timepieces and even 20th century jewellery ( in the Danish fashion : the unbligiest bling!) The attention to detail is astounding. Some of the museum staff work in the roles of town figures to make it even more realistic. Particularly interesting are the Mayor's House and the Coin Master's Mansion. The effect is wonderfully eerie calling to mind the TV series ' The Prisoner'.

Even dogs are allowed inside the grounds, but not inside the houses. There are about 5 cafes and diners for refreshment.
The entrance fees vary according to the seasons, but free for the under-17s. On weekdays it is DKK 110=‚Ç¨15, but at weekends goes up to DKK 135=‚Ç¨18. It is open from 10am until 5pm, and is definitely worth seeing.

Denmark,Luke Y,Den Gamle By,3.0,We went here earlier in the morning on our last day in Aarhus. When we arrived the ticket clerk laughed at us when we approached which was kind of odd and when we acually got inside the complex it started pouring. Besides us there was a group of children from a local school on a field trip but that was really the only sign off life around the whole place. The Poster museum and the silverware museum were pretty neat and the buildings were very picturesque but there really was nothing going on. I hear that in the summer it is a lot more full of life and they have a lot of events and festivals. It was cool but at the same time it is not a must see.,Mar 2017

When I was told to go there, I was like..Yea Yea and bunch of old buliding what's new.
But once you are inside, it's not just a couple of old bulidings. It's a well thought out museum.
All the staff/actors polite and lot of them do speak English, which is very helpful as my Danish isn't good.
It's nice to spend the day just wondering around, seeing how live and work was like in Denmark.
There is a cafe, bakery (Yum!!) and outdoor food/drinks wagons dotting around, which you can enjoy hot or cold.
Apart from the houses, there is a period garden (which you can even buy some plants) and playground that you can play in.(No just for the kids lol)
They are currently add ""The 70's"" to the site.
They always have events like Christmas, Easter and others. And at these times I would you should book/buy tickets in advance, as it does get very busy.
They do cater for the elderly, disable (wheelchairs I think you have to pay for rental) and families with small children, but please do remember that these old bulidings with lots of uneven stairs/steps.
In a whole, it is a great day out from everyone not just families come rain or shine.

It made it a bit dangerous to walk at some spots because of the stones and no lights. Next time I would make sure to go there when it is a bit more light outside so I can enjoy it more.

However there was a fanfare playing music, a fire show and a lot of small wooden houses to buy some delicious warm drinks and snacks for good prices, but be aware of having cash since they do not take card or have mobile pay.

Denmark,Ys_Sol,Den Gamle By,4.0,"Very interesting type of 'museum' showing Danish craftsmen & aristocrats' living conditions from the 16th century onwards. The place offers a close insight into their daily lives with surprisingly intricate detail, often mixed with an element of surprise.
You may find an actual farm boy running around, followed by half a dozen geese or an old bakery clerk selling real cookies and pastries in her little shop.

For those with strollers or wheelchairs, keep in mind that the streets are mostly made out of cobblestones and might therefore be a bit of an uncomfortable ride for those concerned.

great venue for an all day experience....",Sep 2016
Denmark,sebhoff,Den Gamle By,5.0,"This is a huge open air museum just outside the center of town (but within walking distance from most places). There are old and not-so-old houses to visit, and the attention to detail is great. I particularly liked the section with houses from the 1950s, 60s and 70s - you can visit complete flats, e.g. of a 70s commune or a gynaecologist's practice (and listen to stories told by former inhabitants), and there's also a HiFi shop that displays the ""most recent"" Bang & Olufsen apparel. I spent about 2 hours here, but you can easily spend much longer without getting bored!
And a more general tip:
The 24h Aarhus card doesn't really seem to be a particularly good deal, unless you manage to visit all three major museums of the city (ARoS, Den Gamle By and Moesgaard Museum) in one day - all of which offer 30% off the regular entrance fee. This may be just about possible on a normal day - but I recommend scheduling this for a Wednesday or Thursday, when the Moesgaard Museum has extended opening hours.

Denmark,Lucian Pal,Den Gamle By,5.0,"Den gamle by (The old town) is maybe one of the most beautiful places in Aarhus, where you can see and even feel the life, like it was one o two centuries ago. Beautiful old houses loaded with history and exhibitions, from and old school to a clock museum, from a bakery which produce and sell all kinds of cookies (after old/traditional recipes) to a store that is selling old tv's and many other old electronics.
Den Gamle by is devided in 3 areas: the biggest part is the one representing the years 1700-1800, the second part is the one around 1927 and the newest one is the one from around 1974.
Beside all this old houses and exhibitions, there are a lot of other atraction you can see starting with all kinds of festivals and events organised in the spirit of old town, but you can olso see a wind mill, or you can just walk through the botanical garden next to den gamle by (by foot or with a horse cart) and you can even eat and drink like in old times.
Overall, it's the best place you have to visit in Aarhus, alone, with your friends or with your family.

Denmark,Westport76,Den Gamle By,5.0,"The museum is a literal walk through history. Just walking among the multiple buildings, which date as far back as the 1500's, is interesting in itself for just the architecture. Exploring inside shows multiple aspects of how people have lived and worked in Denmark over several centuries. One grand old house shows how room furnishings have changed over centuries (such as beds disappearing from ""living"" rooms). There was a toy museum, various workshops, and even an old museum within the museum. The museum tracks changes into the 1970's. It can feel strange to see familiar objects in a museum because of having grown up in a museum era, but it makes sense to preserve the sixties and seventies for future generations. All in all, a fun and educational time spent for two to four hours.

The museum can be combined with a walk through the Botanical Garden. If going to the ARoS museum, there is a good sandwich shop on the way (see VW Cafe).

Denmark,Garry Keyes,Den Gamle By,5.0,"It might be hyped up and well advertised. But this is a real stand out experience for all and well worth a major diversion and the most of a day. Remember if you're just in Aarhus for a short stay, then make the most of it, by strolling through the place the evening before a visit. All the houses close with the museum - but outside of the museum's opening hours - you can experience a something really magical - just wandering around the streets and taking in all the architecture, buildings. The sheer scale, detail and beauty and completeness of this place will really take your breath away. It can be soo much to take in, when it's full of guests - that it can be nice to have a prior idea of what your most interested in. A typical walk will take you on a time-travelling mind warping trip from the 16th century on all the way through to 1974. Everything is so well thought out and executed. The museum is a real power house of traditional building methods and research into town life through the ages letting you delve into everything from social issues, farming! changing food, style, music, home interiors, architecture. You name it - it's here! The only thing this museum doesen't have is a church as all the buildings have been moved here from somewhere in the country and rebuilt in a new artifical townscape; which is extremely true to what you would have experienced. Kids are free. Remember if your driving - try and park in the botanical gardens. It's a really nice view to come over the hill and see the museum spread out before you. The staff are really attentive and knowledgeable. Don't be afraid to approach them directly and ask a load of questions. This is one of Europes very best open air museums. A real gem!

Take the left path as you enter and walk through time and how life was in Denmark.
It is exciting to explore the old houses with authentic furnishing (no touching please). As well as see the people dressed up to fill in the ""daily life"" of times past.

You will be going by or into a blacksmith, carpenter, bike shop, bakery with geese waddling about, to an old Hi-Fi store to see the coolest record and even have the possibility to see an old collective.

Though my memory is a bit sketchy on the details, I am pretty sure that many places have plaques with english explainations. Even if not it is worth a visit just to exprience the atmospher.

Denmark,Learmonthwanderer,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"I recently completed a trip to Legoland Billund as part of a specifically organised trip from Scotland. I could not find good information on this in advance, so have provided some here.

I hope other readers find this useful, as overall I had an enjoyable family visit.

Travel options:
- Direct from Edinburgh to Copenhagen with car rental
- Direct from Aberdeen to Esbjerg with car rental
- Transfer via London to Billund or other Jutland airports.

Each option carries with it some level of downside. I opted to travel to Legoland Billund via Copenhagen. This carried the additional cost of car rental at ¬£150, a tank of fuel at ¬£60 and bridge tolls at ¬£60, which was less expensive than the other choices. The car journey from Copenhagen was straightforward, navigated with good mobile data coverage and took ~2.5-3 hrs.

Parking
Daily parking is available at Legoland Billund in multiple car parks. I was visiting for multiple days so took advantage of a ""season car parking"" pass at 160DKK which can be held on your mobile electronically. The alternative is a 60DKK daily rate or 55DKK daily rate in the nearby Lalandia.

Park Tickets
I was planning on visiting the park for multiple days. Daily tickets are available at the entrance for 399DKK or in advance for 329DKK. I would recommend purchase of an annual ticket. The mid-priced Awesome Pass cost 649DKK. This provided considerable flexibility and meant numerous short or half day trips to the park combined with other activities. Tickets were held on my phone in the Legoland App.

There are numerous other ""Awesome"" season ticket benefits, the ones appealing most to me being 10% off the lego shop, children eating free at the family buffet, discounts on tea / coffee at selected park outlets and 50% off the price of the lego driving school.

Reserve and Ride tickets were available were time slots could be booked on specific rides. I did not purchase these and neither did the majority in the park. I would not buy these next time either, as none of the queues exceeded 35 minutes.

Opening times
The park opened precisely at 10:00 am each day and rides closed at 18:00. In October, on rainy days arrival at 09:30 allowed us to park less than 50m from the park entrance and to be the first in line to scan through the gates. Arrival at 09:45 meant a longer walk and a queue of ~8 families per entry gate before gaining access.

Having gained access we found that we could complete about 3 rides with no or minimal queues by accessing the park first of all. The only ride not worth getting to early was Emmett's flying adventure as this waited to be filled up before starting.

Rides
All of the rides were included with the exception of the ""fairground"" style entertainments and driving school at 99DKK (44.5DKK with an Awesome pass). Specific time slots for ~25 children are available each hour of the day and are sold out quickly. On the day I wanted to buy tickets, this was my first stop in the park.

I was pleased that I waited to visit the park until my children had reached 120cm of height. At this height all except 1 ride was accessible (Apocalypse Sky Battle @ 130cm), although some needed adult supervision. The staff were disciplined in measuring children's height and had accurate cm measures on some rides to assist.

For younger children (6-7) the faster rollercoasters (Extreme Racers, Polar Explorer, Dragon) may be too extreme. Throughout my park visits the slightly less extreme Flying Eagle was the most popular and consistently had the longest queues.

A full day at the park would allow you to ride all of the rides desired, but is fairly intense. I preferred taking 4x half days to explore and enjoy the park.

What is there to do for adults?
For adults with younger children <120cm I think the experience would be very poor and cold in October with a lot of waiting around at ride entrances. I saw a lot of adults pushing around prams looking cold and fed up, waiting for the next hot drink stop.

At the >120cm level adults should expect to be able to ride with children and this is a lot more enjoyable. All of the larger rides are enjoyable for adults for the first 2-3 attempts.

Food in the Park
I was expecting strict no picnic rules in the park. The opposite was the case and the park encouraged picnics with set aside seating outdoors. Despite going to the park when it was raining, I found properly sheltered seating where I could enjoy a picnic, but would not want to do this on a day <10 degrees. This worked well to help keep the costs down and allowed a budget of ¬£125 for food for 4 per day to be kept to.

I had visited the large ""Bilka"" in Kolding on the way to the park to buy food in advance. We discovered a variety of good quality bakers in the 30km circle around the park, which opened early and offered sandwiches and cakes. If I hadn't already provisioned, I would in future buy things fresh from these types of vendors daily.

There are numerous hot food outlets in the park. On a colder day I ate in the family buffet, which was free for children with an ""Awesome"" pass per paying adult (219DKK per adult). The buffet was plentiful with salad, soup, hot adult and childrens offerings, drinks and ice cream. I though the quality of the food was average and would not want to eat there for multiple days in a row.

Accommodation
There are various Lego specific (Hotel, Castle Hotel, Village) and non-Lego specific (Lalandia holiday village) options available.

I decided I wanted to be able to travel to and away from Billund each day. Without a car, I think I would have enjoyed the experience less, as I would have felt trapped. I stayed in a small bed and breakfast, which I hav e reviewed separately, 25km from Billund.

As a result, I can only make a cursory comment on the Lego and Lalandia options, which whilst looking fairly glossy and upmarket on the website in reality did not appeal to me. The Lego hotel restaurant, for example, had a very similar feel to the Family Buffet, where I would not want to eat multiple meals a day. The Lalandia holiday village had a strong centreparcs vibe, which does not appeal to me.

Denmark,Lisa R,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"I came with my 6 year old daughter on the train from Amsterdam via Hamburg. Quite an adventure! We stayed in the LEGOland Hotel and spent 2 days in the park with a day at LEGO House sandwiched in between. You have to be strategic if you are going to make the most of it. If you are going midweek and the Danish holidays are over (as they were when we went) then you will likely have short queues and this makes a big difference. Use the app to monitor queue times for your preferred rides and go there when the time drops. On busier days, it‚Äôs worth paying a bit extra and getting the ‚ÄúReserve & Ride‚Äù pass. This allows you to virtually queue while you are elsewhere and when your time is up you can go on the ride and skip the whole queue. Note: this is not available for ALL rides but it makes a difference for a few of the good ones like the dragon, extremes racers and Ninjago. If you are smart you will pack your own food (take a container to the buffet breakfast with you if you are at a hotel - and just be a bit sneaky!). Some tips there that can make a big difference to your adventure! Legoland is great for smallish kids!!! We had a lovely time.

Denmark,iokasti_8,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"I was very disappointed to see that Corona situation does not affect this facility! No masks no measures, many people gathered in small indoor places without any protection and no safety distances!
As a park, we really enjoyed all the games and activities. It was a unique experience. We would like to have a second visit, because the time was limited and we did not try everthing.
It is a very nice experience for children and adults. The toilets are very clean as well as all other commonly used facilities.
Very baby friendly also. There are outdoor specific smoking areas, so as all other areas are smoke free.
Even though there was a lot of people, waiting for the games and activities was not very high.
We enjoyed every minute!
After corona, we would definitely recommend that every family should visit Legoland at least for one or preferably for two days!
Check the weather before scheduling your visit.

Denmark,ArntH,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"We had two days in Legoland, parents and two small children. There is no doubt that Legoland is good for kids, however, the weaknesses are starting to show: 1) the experiences and rides are dated and don't really offer a LEGO differentiation beyond the standard Danish amusement park (sommerlande) 2) 60-80% of the time is spent on queueing 3) service level is mediocre and the best food venues have a canteen feeling to both environment and meal quality, not price. In general, it seems like the resort is optimised for making money rather customer experience e.g. in case of rain, you can pay 20 DKK to get dried in a booth with infrared dryer - well, why not install roofs where you visitors are queuing, so they don't get wet in the first place. It is an OK amusement park but I would recommend to go for the alternatives. it is definitely not worth extensive travel, way too much ""tourist trap"" for such investment.

Denmark,John J,LEGOLAND Billund,1.0,"I live close to Legoland, and have been a regular visitor for more than 30 years with my children and now my grandchildren. I hate to write this, but Legoland has developed into a real tourist trap. The latest (last?) visit was on a sunny Saturday in the beginning of school holidays. They had one (1) ticket booth open, and we waited in the queue for 30 minutes. We couldn't book online, as we had a handicapped person in the party. After that we waited in line for another 20 minutes to get our negative corona test examined - again only one entrance open. The corona craze is not Legolands fault, but they could have opened one more gate. Entry fee was 499 per person. 1500 DKK, or 200 EURO, the disabled person got in for free.
We got in at 13.30, and had dinner at 17.00. During those 2¬Ω hours we tried 2 of the attractions - each about 3 minutes, the remaining time was spent waiting in line.
Dinner consisted of 3 burgers, one was a kids menu, and three small cola's, and set us back 587 DKK, 79 EURO. The burgers were OK, but the price was not.
On leaving we paid 60 DKK for parking, another 9 EURO. How a family of four manages this, beats me. The only place we have seen longer queues and worse crowd management is Alhambra in Spain.
We regularly visit DOM in Hamburg, and although it is not the same, we get much more for our money there, it is even cheaper driving to Copenhagen and visit Bakken. Disneyland in Paris is cheaper all-round.

Denmark,Lars N,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"It was easy to book online and even saved us 5 % on the price of tickets. We got 2 children's tickets for free through LIDL. We called Lego to change the date and they were very happy to help.

We arrived 1030 and it was easy to find a parking spot and the entrance was but a leasurely stroll away. We had printed the tickets and entering was fast and efficient. Reviews said that the food was expensive, of varying quality and the waiting time could be long, so we brought all our own food, saved a bundle and snacked between activities, so we did not spend valuable time on waiting for food. We stored a bag of clothes and food in the locker just inside the entrance, but as it was a warm day we ended up not needing it, although we got quite wet during the pirate activity.

The weather was nice and sunny without being too hot, all the staff were very friendly and cheerful and waiting times very low, only one activity took ~ 15 minutes to get to, all others were 0-5 minutes and some we were even able to stay in the activity for several trips.

The app was very helpful in planning the day with regards to wayfinding and waiting time, and there were maps available too.

There were hand sanitizers before and after all activities and the staff were very good at nudging us to use them every time.

All in all an extremely enjoyable day, and we look forward to coming back another time, outside the high season. I believe the key to a successful trip is going when there is not too many people at the park.

this is quite disappointing because these are the favorite activities of our kids ( 5 and 8) we understand there are Covid restrictions but you should have clearly stated on your website when you put on your website so we can take an informed decision .
I called customer service and they mention that this is detailed on the Danish websites but it is not detail on the English one under covid restrictions.

I still enjoy seeing the miniature dioramas (which the kids hates ü§™)which appears to be the last true Lego experience left in Legoland. The rest of Legoland has become a undersized theme park with long queues, way to short (and boring) rides, and an abundance of unhealthy tasteless and expensive fast food.

I was amazed that close to the entrance, there is this big restaurant, advertized on their website as well, and the food was terrible.

For such a huge investment, and such a great reputation, I feel like Legoland should not host such rip off restaurants like that Family Buffet. I went there with my kid, ordeted a pizza for him, and he was offered a micro waved pizza, for 15 euros, that looked disgusting and tasted even worse. After 2 bites, we had to leave and eat a hot dog. It is a shame that Legoland let's a so called restaurant, rip off it's clients. Dissapointing..

Go to the farthest point and work your way to the front. The park closes at 6pm. So a strategy for exploring the park is needed.

There was good handling of Covid in the park, but no place to eat either in the park or at the hotel.

The restaurant was fully booked the whole evening We ended up eating a sandwich in the bar. For breakfast we stood in line for 20 minutes and were kicked out after less than 40 minutes.

I contacted the hotel afterwards, and just got a sorry - but we are not going to do anything about it. Legoland is not cheap, so I was quite dissapointed in the service.

Denmark,David,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"There are a lot of mixed reviews and we understand that. We were lucky when we went and were well prepared:

- Went outside Danish summer holiday
- Brought our own food, only got and icecream on the side
- Had a discount voucher (50%), they seem easy to come by with things like Groupon (ours was from a cereal package)
- The weather was great

I think if we went in July or another busy time, or forgot to bring food this day could have been very different. We hardly had any queue time: 0 to 15 minutes. And the rides were great for our kids (4,7,10). Would not recommend going without kids, as half of the rides is aimed at smaller kids.

The park is somewhat outdated, but they are incorporating more modern things like Ninjago and the LEGO movie (2021). But I also saw some of the same stuff I saw 30 years ago as a kid. Not sure if that is bad or nostalgic :) Also, there is a lot of LEGO everywhere, but it's not perse all about LEGO. Not like a Disney park where everything is clearly themed.

The personnel was professional, friendly and helpful.

So, all in all: we had an amazing day in this park but we can imagine it could have gone otherwise. So prepare yourself in terms of how busy it is likely going to be, bring your own food and lookout for a discount.

There is so much for them to do and there are so many options and play areas for younger kids. We had a really great time.

There are many attractions for kids of all ages and the lego constructions are fascinating.

However, this years visit was disappointing.

We researched their covid-19 measures prior to visiting and it seemed very good. When arriving in the park there was a lot of signage about social distancing, but it was in now way followed up.

The combination of guests not respecting the measure and that Legoland had zero staff guiding or enforcing social distancing made it an unpleasant experience.

Cleaning of attractions and food serving areas seemed to be non-existent.

Then, it was a great experience (we went after the Danish holiday season) but today was.... terrible. Arrived at 09:45 the park was already open and busy. We first went to the Eagle coaster. Waiting line was approx. 20 minutes so for us: ok. After this ride, the park was CROWDED so much, we couldn‚Äôt go anywhere without waiting at least 30 mins for mini rides, and 50/60 mins for a rollercoaster or water attraction. Nobody (talking about the visitors) here seems to care about Covid19, they bump into you and stand really close in line, block paths with strollers...Annoying! At lunch time, we wanted to grab a bite. No way... everywhere, at least 45 mins waiting time. Even at the hotdog stand. (Don‚Äôt even start about food and drink prices) So we decided to leave the park really early. Did 2 attractions. I might as well just throw my money in the bin instead of visiting Legoland in July or August. On top of it all, it just felt unsafe, so many people crammed together in a park like this! Will never visit again in summer holiday season.

Denmark,Banz92,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"Typical theme park and really long queues. I suppose the long queue is due to school holidays and the sudden opening up of borders after Covid-19 lockdown. My kids enjoyed it so it was worthwhile in the end. The miniature European cities were lovely and some of the activities were fun. Bring your own food if possible otherwise you stand in long queues to get ripped off for very basic quality food. The quality of what you see doesn‚Äôt blow your mind. It‚Äôs okay, but I suppose the kids will disagree with me.
Some Tips: if you plan on buying anything at the Lego store do it a few hours before the park closes because the line to enter the store went all the way to the entrance gate.
Some of the rides can be reserved ahead of time. Check online and do this. It will be worth it on these type of busy days.
Use your phone to take a map of the area when you get inside. It will help a lot since maps were not being handed out due to the Covid-19.

The original part right at the main entrance is still great we still love to look at all the miniatures. The rides, lunches, coffees and basically everything else required long waiting times.

These parks need a new concept to make the money worthwhile again.

When we made the booking, the website said they were operating with limited numbers to reduce capacity. I noticed on the website a few days ago that it said you no longer needed to book in advance. I‚Äôve been to Legoland a few times before and I have NEVER seen it so busy. The Covid policy seemed slack and confused. Eg:

- hand sanitizer everywhere - very good. No complaints
- keep distance markers in queues - ok in theory but hardly anyone took notice and staff did nothing to control it. Even if you did keep distance from the person infront there was someone directly to your side due to the zig zag queues.
- reduces capacity on rides (good idea) but no reduced capacity in the park just led to the most ridiculous queues for everything

We thought we would enjoy mostly the Lego exhibition, but we were surprised when we discovered how many attractions are suitable for adults. It was beyond our expectations, and we were so thrilled. The queuing time was so short. The thing that spoiled our excitement is that only one or two restaurants were open. We were hungry and we were walking around the place for at least 30 minutes until we found an open restaurant - maybe due to corona. There are many hot dog stalls, ice cream, slush and other things, but no proper food. Also the wayfinding was really bad, the maps that they have on site only show attractions, online map (app) is totally useless. It's difficult to plan your trip because there are so many ways and we didn't know what to do first, for that printed maps would be useful but we didn't find any.

Denmark,stevlee78,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"On day two of the park reopening, We arrived at 10:15, there was no queue, friendly people on the gates, spaces marked on the floor for standing and hand sanitizer

Entering the park was a bit strange, only saw cleaners and about half a dozen guests, everything was pretty much closed at this point, rides, shops and attractions

We noticed the rides mainly said closed until 14:00, with some open at 11, so we had a good 40 minutes to kill and walked around the model village .. twice

The rides that seemed to be opening at 11 were for small children so grabbed a coffee and walked around, there were some bigger rides starting to open way before 14:00 so was unsure if the plan was working better than they thought

We went on a couple of rides and they thoroughly cleaned them down and was asked to use sanitizer at each ride, sometimes twice but not complaints, glad to be safe

The park has rethought out lots of things for safety, plastic guards at the shops, signs, gloves for the carnival games and the staff were all great, friendly and positive when reminding people about the safety

It was normal but not normal, still a very good day out and applaud Legoland for their efforts

The haunted house was closed for some reason and a new area they are building is closed off, but still most things are open and at a much smaller amount of clientele they handled things perfectly

Denmark,Joyman L,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We purchased our tickets online so we were able to go straight to the turnstiles without queuing at the ticket counters prior to entering.

Nice park with several rollercoasters for the thrill seekers but most rides were designed for children being the target audience.Plenty of rides to keep the whole family entertained for the whole day. Unfortunately the pirate attraction was closed during our visit otherwise everything else was operating. Queue times for popular rides were averaging 30min which wasn't too bad compared to other major theme parks like Universal Sudios or Disneyland. There were no fast passes or priority queues.

Plenty of gift shops and theme park food stalls. Several different food options available from italian to burgers, buffet to set meals. Lockers for baggage storage were also available. And the biggest Lego store was here with a few exclusives however for those keen on purchasing from the pick-a-brick, payment will be based on weight of bricks instead of per cup (filling up a cup).

Overall it was a pleasant day however it might just be me but it seems the park was showing its age and looks tired in some areas such as several facilities and infrastructures.

Denmark,Santa,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Very nice park. Some tips for those who wants to visit the park:

1) In the begining go straight to the furthest sides of a park- than they are not crowded, and You can get to popular attractions only waiting 5-10 minutes( Like Flying eagle)

2) It is a good idea to bring food with You. There are nice places for picnic and quite expensive food in restaurants

3) Miniland is amazing! But it is better to visit it when the attractions closes, so You spend more time on attractions.

4)All the shops has the same things so it is better to visit the biggest one -near the entrance and do not spend time in anothers.

5)Take some extra closes cause there are chance to get wet- or bring cash ( There are dryer machines)

Denmark,Francesco Vannini,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"I have waited 38 years to visit Legoland in Billund and frankly didn't quite know what to expect. Legoland is only partially LEGO group and it is owned and run by Merlin Entertainment. The park is a big commercial cauldron designed to get as much money from its visitors as they possibly can. Areas like Miniland which are the historic core of the park itself are in fact rundown and not looked after well enough. We had previously been to Legoland Windsor and found that this was quite an exact replica. The shops sell the sets for more than you would easily found online. I'm wondering why these shops could instead come up with discounted sets or special editions not found elsewhere or even re-editions of older sets, that could make these shops a bit more worthwhile visiting. I don't think I'll visit another Legoland park. What a blow to my inner child.

The reason for not giving it 5 stars, is the waiting time at the rides is simply to long, and the prices in the restaurants is simply to high.

If you have any children with lactose, gluten free or any other particular allergies, this is ABSOLUTELY not the place to stay as the dietary requirements section of the breakfast was on both days empty.
Accordingly, there was no compensation given for this, only a sharp email saying that as we compensated you for the first issue (being a crappy room with crappy beds) then we can't do anything about it.

Denmark,Sem,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"This was the second time I went to Legoland Billund, the first was about 6 years ago. If you want to go there purely for the attractions you are better off at another park like Disneyland or Europapark. Not that the attractions are bad, there are some really fun ones, all in a specific Lego theme of course. A big part of the park is the Lego village: literally a village made out of Lego, with little villagers, famous buildings, cars, etc and then some other models on display, like the star wars section. To my disappointment it hasn't changed much over those six years since the last time, there were only a few more additions. That being said, it's still a fun day out, kids will definitely enjoy it. Also, the new knights joust was very entertaining. The park can be very busy during high season and holidays, so expect long queues for certain rides. And unless you want to buy some exclusive sets or clothed, you are better off buying Lego online as prices are (slightly) higher in the shops and unfortunately they don't accept the Lego VIP card.
I would advice going here first, in combination with the Lego House on a following day (combi tickets are cheaper as well).

This park is mainly built for kids (the roller coasters, for example, are not the thrilling ones you'd expect to see in a classic roller coaster amusement park), but nevertheless everything in this resort is so beautiful that I had a blast while visiting even though I'm 26.

There is a huge area with miniature neighborhoods built of millions of LEGO pieces, with all sorts of machinery that actually moves (busses, cars) and make realistic sounds. There is a sealife aquarium as well, a huge LEGO store and, as I said earlier, loads of roller coasters - I rode them all!

The concession stands aren't cheap, as we found out most of Billund isn't, but as it was a one-off visit we didn't mind especially as the Candy-Floss (Cotton-Candy for those stateside) was as big as him.

Denmark,Altug,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Well, for Legoland at least you need two days I think. It looks not possible to join all attractions in a single day. In addition to that, I recommend sunny day for your visit. During summer, rainy days looks not long to cover all the day and suddenly can stop and you can continue your attractions but vice versa, it can be rain suddenly. Therefore try to be there at least on August.
Rather than weather, park is good and if you or your child like Lego, this is the place you may visit at least once in your life. It was also very good experience to stay in Legoland Hotel. Especially your kids will love that much. Even in the Hotel, many attractions available and after your Legoland visit and dinner your kids still play. Also, it is in the Legoland and very good for parents to stay there after a very tired day instead of to drive to another Hotel. It is a little expensive but worth. Also open buffet in panorama restaurant is good and worth too.

The park is well kept, the rides are all up-to-date and the staff is very friendly, no matter where you go. On the Saturday there was a lot of queues, on Sunday, it was much better! Getting from one end of the park to the other was quick and easy, even though we realised in the evening how much we had walked....

Our kids are 14,12 and 9 years old, and there was something in favour of every single one of them - they all had a ball!! We did many different activities, but the highlights were the 4D Movie with the police officer following the bad guy, the Silver Eagle roller coaster and the big waterslide.

All over the park you could find some sweets and shops to buy things, prices were quite high though.

One point deducted, because the food choice for vegetarians is extremely limited (just one restaurant selling a veggie burger) and expensive. This is not modern at all!!!

Denmark,S√∏ren C,LEGOLAND Billund,1.0,"I wanted to show my boy Legoland and was tolled I should wait until he was tall enough. I measured him to 100 cm and though it would be okay, but they measured him to 99 cm and he was not allowed to try anything, eventhough he had to pay full price since he was more then 3 years old. The few things he was allowed to try I had to pay extra for. Legoland advertise that everything is free when you have paid the extremely expensive ticket, but that is far from true. I will never set my foot in that expensive place again",Aug 2019

Denmark,Louisa Tina v,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Was here in the eighties with my parents and wanted to show it to my kids now, also wanted my 7 year old to get his Lego drivers license. I was prepared to buy a Q bot to reduce or skip waiting times, but as we visited everything was so manageable! Waiting times 5 minutes on average and 15 min at the max. The money I saved for not buying the q bot I spent well on Lego t shirts for the kids and engraved Lego souvenirs
We all loved the two day visit. The park is extremely well kept and clean and the staff is super nice and eloquent
Visit was a dream after having read all the scary reviews about people having to wait for hours and hours. I think end of August is not high season

Denmark,Tribe93,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We're in our late 40s and went to Legoland as it's the original Lego theme park and we had such great memories playing with legos. Even though we don't have kids, it was fun to walk around and see the park. All of the famous monuments, cities, and characters made out of millions of lego bricks was fun to see. One thing we did notice was that folks were bringing in their own picnic lunches with them to enjoy in the park. You won't find that at Disney World. The rides were definitely geared for the younger kids. Teens would probably find them a little on the tame side. For us, visiting for a few hours for one day was very enjoyable.

The park the next day had lines which were manageable - at most rides, there was a big lego area to play so they were gainfully employed reducing the stress of waiting. The following night we stayed in the Holiday Village which was amazing. Clean, high quality and well thought out. This was then followed by visit to Lego House - we had no idea what it was but we were truly impressed. We will come back!",Aug 2019

Waiting for more than 30 minutes for most rides. One ride we waited for around an hour. We also waited for food and snacks. And paid over prices for bad quality. The only thing we did not wait or pay extra for was going to the toilets. I really had a feeling that I visited a very greedy person who did not care much if I enjoyed my visit. I will still buy my kids LEGO, but I will not visit LEGOLAND again.",Aug 2019

There are numerous rides for all ages and we enjoyed them all!
There are lots of places to eat and have coffee, lots of shops for Lego merchandise.And there is Legoredo, always a favourite with me. This time I toasted bread by the campfire. The boys - Grandpa, his son and his grandsons, panned for gold.
Altogether a wonderful, though expensive, visit. It will live long in the memory.

Denmark,Christine X,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"First of all (having read a previous comment): this is a theme park. It has rides. That‚Äôs the point of it. And since it‚Äôs based around Lego, its target audience is pre-teens. Bearing that in mind, it‚Äôs an absolutely fantastic theme park. There are gentle rides for the young ones and some more challenging rides for the older ones. But it‚Äôll never be a theme park that excites a teenager who wants scary rollercoasters. The park is full of impressive Lego creations to look at, Lego to play with in the queues and a generally child friendly theme. For those of us who have brought our children up with annual passes to Legoland in Windsor, this park is far superior. It‚Äôs all flat, has more rides, and more rides that appeal to the slightly older kids. Word of advice: go straight to the driving school and book your slot (yes, bookable slots!) so that your child doesn‚Äôt miss out. The driving school is also better than Windsor and the ‚Äúlicence‚Äù looks much more genuine. As with all theme parks the food is overpriced and underwhelming, and with this being Denmark it‚Äôs really overpriced. We‚Äôve finally learnt from our previous visits and saved ourselves a hefty food bill by bringing a packed lunch.

Top tip: try to make your visit coincide with Scandinavian kids being in school and go midweek. It was still busy with lots of German, Dutch and Italian kids but we didn‚Äôt have to wait more than 25 minutes for a single ride (some we could just walk straight onto), which was a huge improvement on the time we went there on a Saturday in July.

Since it‚Äôs all about rollercoasters and our son doesn‚Äôt like them there is not too much to do.. and for adults the rides don‚Äôt seem that impressive... we thought there would be more opportunities to actually play with the LEGO. It was nice that they put some Lego to play in the waitinglines so it‚Äôs easier for kids to wait, but apart from that there is not too much opportunities to build with Lego. The Lego House met our expectations much more! The buildings are more beautiful and you can play and build with the Lego all day!",Aug 2019
Denmark,AegidiusNielsen,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"You don‚Äôt have to be Young or a great play-child to visit LEGOLAND - because here are experiences for everyone - regardless of age.

It was a nice reunion with LEGOLAND - and this time it was in connection with a corporate event where LEGOLAND was the organizer of the event with all incl.

A great experience, good food, great themed rooms and fun tasks/competitions for teams.

Should I mention a little to improvement of the event, water could well have been available during the 3-hour long team competition in the park, the opportunity to try out rides in the competition - in addition to the 2 different rides we had available in a full hour later - the experience of LEGOLAND had been total.

And then maybe a little more control/or certainty about who does what and where, so that you as a Company can stay ‚Äúfree‚Äù and relaxed - and just enjoy the Day when you have now bought yourself an all-inclusive stay.

Overall a good experience.

Denmark,Eveliina,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Big thumbs up for Legoland! It is a definitely a good vacation spot for different aged children. The whole park is stroller friendly and there are quite many bathrooms around and even a doctors office if needed. There is a ‚Äúdublo‚Äù playground in the middle of the park which was a big hit with all of our 3 children (2, 4 and 6). There are some rides also that are suitable for even the youngest children. It seemed that there really is something for everyone.

The park is full of many activities and places to eat. I recommend to spend minimum of 2 days in the park. We spend 3 days and that was just right. I also recommend to go see the ‚ÄúKnight show‚Äù with real horses and also the short play with great tricks and entertainment.

One point that I did not know was that in Billund it was very cold!! Kids needed hats and small mittens on as well as hoodies and jackets. So please pack warm clothing also for the summer time.

Denmark,Chris M,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Amazing family trip. We went at the end of Aug which is when the Danish schools go back. As a result the park wasn't too busy so much so that we could pretty much walk onto any ride. (Reading the reviews this doesn't often seem to be the case, which is a shame).

Most of the rides are great, predominantly aimed at kids (over 100cm tall) and great fun. Lego Ninjago, is a bit style over substance. The Polar Explorer ride is great and generally quiet as it's at the back of the park and you need to be over 120cm.to ride so discounts most kids.

My top tip is, get queing for the rides early and head to the Flying Eagle ride as this seemed to have the longest ques all day (I think because it is the most extreme ride kids can do).

The park drops points as anything else costs money and LOTS of it... Food/souvenirs... They also seem to have zero Green credentials so no recycling, disposable cups and one water fountain* to refill bottles for the entire park.

*It's located in the wild west area with NO signs advertising it.

Given the cost of entry etc... These things seem just a tad penny pinching which seems unnecessary.

Check the map before visiting and make a plan about the attractions you must visit. We visited during peak season and the queues were long. We managed to do all the rides, except of two that we didn‚Äôt like, in two days.

Also, an advice is to check the closing times as they vary.

Only con is that for some of the attractions you need to pay extra, eg gold mine (10 euro), driving school (15 euro), photos are so expensive (10 euro each).

It is magical to be in this place though as it is the first legoland ever build in the same village the creator of LEGO was born.

Denmark,AriannaB,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"I am not a fanatic of entertainment parks, but once in a while it can be acceptable to go. Though at this point of history, I would love to see a park that actually is more sustainable and less oriented to just spill money out of people. There is a difference between Legoland and most of the other places that I have been too is that at least the rides are included in the ticket.
But still, there is a big push on making people pay for whatever.
Let's start with the positive things. There are many things to do and they are quite different from each other. From shows, to small calm attractions, to rollercoasters, to very detailed beautiful Legos to admire, movies and so on and so forth. Some of the activities are collaborative, like the pirate war or the firefighters and it is nice when the whole family can engaged together.
The park is not too huge and it goes quite well to walk from a part to the other one, however, is a bit badly planned as there are not so many passages and there are some areas that are a ""must"" to be walked through and I can imagine they can get quite crowded.
The area that was my favorite is of course miniland. The legos are just fantastic to watch and my kids could stay for hours observing the details and losing themselves in it.
One of my favourite attraction was the maze in the Ninjago area, although the queue could have been a bit annoying.
I wish we would have done more of the calm activities, but one of my kids was very much into the more extreme attractions and we enjoyed those. The polar rollercoaster was actually the most scary one and despite being a bit out of context in a sense (sure there must have been some Polar expedition inspired Lego) it was well thought.
The mix of Polar expedition + Egypt + Medieval tournament was a bit of a clash. I think other areas of the park were better melting with each other.
I was very disappointed to see penguins in the park. I really don't understand what is the purpose and what do they have to do with Lego (although I see the connection to the polar expedition).
I was also disappointed that in a country like Denmark there was just one fountain of water where to refill the bottles, otherwise there were plenty of places selling still water!
For not mentioning the fact that the trash bins were not planned for sorting anything at all.
Shouldn't we start to think in those terms already now?
I also believe that the park, considering the image that Lego wants to give of being innovative and so on, could push for clean energy in form of wind and sun power.
Given that, I think the park close a bit too early even if it is not anymore at the peak of the season, the queues can still be a bit disturbing (we decided to skip some rides that required 30 minutes waiting time).
Ultimately what disappointed me most was the food offering. It was over priced and bad quality. Slow even although we were just buying an hot dog!
It should be so easy to have some not too expensive place offering more organic and locally produced proper healthy food. Why does it have to be just ""crap"" and extra processed food for matching a theme park??
We went also to the Lego shop and there were some sets that were a bit hard to find, though the general price was not convenient at all. Of course they don't need to, but it should be more inviting to have better prices especially there :)
For us, this is more like a once in a lifetime experience as Billund is not behind the corner. I do not regret going there, but although we had a lovely day and there were a lot of enjoyable things, some things are clashing a bit with how I would love to see a theme park today.

The park is very family friendly. We went on a few rides they were fun, but they are your typical amusement park rides with a Lego theme. The mini viliage was wonderful. Lego set up a large varitey of Lego villages, shipping ports with moving boats and cars, even a couple of locks, airport with heliocopters and planes, NASA launch pad with rockets and launch sequence, a few Star Wars fight scenes and my favorite a farm with the cows moo'ed, pigs onik'ed and chickens cluck'ed.

A lot of things that was there when I was kid is still around, like the impressive city replicas built in lego. They have of course expanded the park a lot since then as well, and there are a lot more ride attractions now, but I think they have managed to keep the lego spirit pretty well. There's a lot to do, and if you only have one day there you might have trouble seeing/doing everything, but for us it was sufficient.

It was busy throughout the park but the queues for rides were not too bad -if any were a bit long, we just came back later when they were quieter. The rides are mainly for younger children with a few roller coasters and water rides (which were our favourite) but for us the highlight was the Lego models -the large displays as well as the smaller models throughout the park.
We ate lunch at the fish & chip shop (falafel options for veggies) which was good (we had fairly low expectations being at a theme park) and took pizza away when we left at the end of the day from the pizza restaurant near the entrance. Being fans of Lego we really enjoyed our time there and would recommend a visit.

Denmark,rmorandinideoliveira,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"I must first admit am not a Lego super fan but do love a good theme park. If you experienced anything from Disney or Universal, am afraid this is quite far from that experience. The rides are roller coaster type with minimum enhancements the lego theme is given by the figurines and ornaments outside, many of which are in requirement of maintainable, repair or cleaning. The Q bot line speeding system works well, but at a rather hefty price of over 30 euros per head for the medium tier time saving option.
The Legoland H√¥tel is fun for children given LEGO ornaments inside but the level of comfort is lacking, no air conditioning, no proper black out curtains ( when it‚Äôs light at 0400 in Denmark in summer) and very limited dining options.

Lots of rides for the kids - even a roller coaster that my 3 year old could try (Eagle - must be over 100cm).
The park is huge, I doubt we saw more than 50% of it.
There are typical theme park attractions as well as games and things made out of Lego everywhere. The Lego Friends and the Dino were particular favourites. The kids even got to meet some princesses :-)

There is a lot to eat, but it's very expensive (Bring your own lunch/snacks!!). In fact everything to buy is expensive - which is bit of a disappointment. I would have hoped that at Legoland, given that the entry costs so much to start with - there would be some special deals on the Lego etc. None of that to be found! And the Lego Outlet....well that is a must skip. Looks like a bargain basement that has run out to stuff to sell. There is almost no lego and some very old clothes. Lego - come on...you can do better than that!

If you get the tickets on a deal - as we did - and you bring some of your own food/drink.snacks - it's still a good day out.

What we parents are most happy with the legoland concept is that alle park rides are completly free of charge. Payment is offcourse where there is a toy involved with a activity such as cold mining for kids. Where all kids get a gold coin as necklase.
All inn all a fantastic park where all families collect nemories for life.

Denmark,ToniLii,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"the expectations were high but thank god Legoland delivered. Even on a rainy day it was all smiles and joy for the kids (5, 5, 7 yrs), but also fun (and nostalgia) for the parents. Spend there one whole day. A pilgrim for all lego diggers!

The only minus is actually the shop. One would expect something bonus from this kind of place but basically the items and prices are pretty much the same than back home in the toy store. They could easily set at least e exclusiver price for a the Legoland visiters.",Jul 2019
Denmark,Justin R,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"I had wanted to go to Legoland for years and I finally got to go there. I will say I was a little underwhelmed but I still had a good time. I went with just my wife. We got there in the afternoon after spending the morning at the LEGO house, which we enjoyed more. We went on a Monday and it had been a cool morning with a little rain. But the afternoon cleared off. The crowds were not too big. I don‚Äôt think we stood in line for more than 20 minutes for any ride. And the lines got even shorter as the day went on. None of the rides were too exciting but were still fun. I was disappointed in the lack of exclusive legos or souvenirs there. I was hoping to find a unique LEGO set there but only saw one that was too large to bring home. I would say don‚Äôt set your expectations too high and you‚Äôll have a good time.

On the other hand, we did not have a good experience. I believe this is mainly because we chose the wrong timing to visit. Tip 1) do not go on a very sunny day. Tip 2) do not go during weekends or public/school holidays. It can get horrendously crowded which will spoil your day and may extremely disappoint you. Bounce tip: it is not Disneyland, so lower your expectation.",Aug 2019
Denmark,Jimbo0412,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"My family spent two days here in late July and it was a big success.
It was very busy and we had to queue for most rides (up to 45 minutes for some of them) but the children loved it.
We stayed at the Legoland Hotel, so were able to access the park when it opened on the second day, meaning we could get on some of the rides before the masses arrived.
At Legoland in the UK, many people had bought the Q-BOT queue skipping option, but this didn't seem so popular in Denmark. It is very frustrating queuing and then seeing people go straight to the front with the Q-BOT.
The staff are very helpful and friendly although there could have been a few more of them. I was looking for more than ten minutes for someone to ask directions to and eventually had to ask a staff member who was working on a ride.
Nothing seems tired or out-of-date, which was what I had feared.
The food options are limited and expensive, but then we expected that.

Overheated rooms!!! Lack of ventilation. And I paid 4000 danish kroner per night for a room like this. One of the biggest ""sins"" I have committed in my life was to choose to go to this hotel. Unforgivable choice.

Breakfast was a shame. Poor variety and poor taste.

When I complained about the heat the reception worker could only say sorry. Can't we get a bigger fan or at least one more little fan just to be able to sleep at night, I asked. The answer was: No, sorry. Unbelievable! Don't go to this place! Value yourself and your money and choose a place where you can get equivalent service for your payment.

There are lockers, but you need to pay a fee everytime you open it. There are buggies for hire. Which can be placed outside the riders. The fee is 50kr. However you must pay 150kr via card. Most main attractions have a camera opportunity. Where you can buy the picture afterwards. If you plan to go into at least 4 of those. It might be an idea to chose the 300kr option. 4pics with magnet and keychain in 6 attractions or from the profesional photographers in the park.lots of attractions are equiped with a legobox for kids to play. Adults its ok for kuds to push though towards the playarea, where you keep the space in the queue. Shows can be viewed even if you dont speak Danish. It is advised to have a bit of a plan before going since there are somany things to do and see and trafik skolen is booked out hours in advance. This can be booked in advance from the website and is an aditional fee.

We bought the family buffet ticket and the food was lovely, you are shown to a table which is perfect as other parks let you fend for yourself trying to find a table.
All the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and I didn't find it too commercialised and an emphasis on a great experience rather than trying to extract as much money as possible from you.
Getting into the park was very quick too.
My son and myself (a usually grumpy cynical 51 year old) absolutely loved Legoland Billund and would love to go again sometime.

Denmark,Mette P,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"+ Attractions are amazing. There is such a diversity in rides and activities that there is no problem finding several to enjoy.
+ More then a full day of different activities. In fact, we were there two days, and we still haven‚Äôt gone through all of them.
+ Activities for children (and grown-ups) of every agegroup.
+ Details! Everything is made of lego. Even the light posts. It is so cool!
+ It seems likely that if you want to spend money to WIN prices, there is an actual chance you may win (purely based on the amount of won stuffed animals in kids arms around the park though).
-Food is expencive (as always in this kind of park). On top of that, the food is kind of bad (tasteless burgers, soft French fries, soggy fish‚Äôn‚Äôchips and so on. A simple handwash should be available at every diner, but it is not.
-Opening hours are poorly advertised. Since they vary with several hours from day to day, this turned out to be a bummer. A huge sign by the entrance saying ¬´Today the park closes at XX¬ª and some grief could have been avoided.

Denmark,Mona K,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"I love the creativity LEGO bricks bring, and for any LEGO lover this place is a must. The mini town is very inspirational, also for adults.

The place is in build in the middle of the hay (or similar) fields. There is an airport, so you can fly right in, but we decided to fly to Copenhagen, spend some time there and drive to Billund to widen the experience.

If you want to maximize the LEGO experience to the full, book a LEGO themed hotel room next to the park. Often, the entrance fee to the amusement park is covered in the hotel price, but that is good to check in advance.
We stayed about 20 km from the park, and the change of scenery after a day in the park suited us well.

My tips to any visitor are here:

- The first and the last hours of opening are the slowest, and the queuing time to rides are cut by approximately 75 %.

- Normal ticket does not allow you to exit the area...so that usually means you must eat there or bring your own lunch.

- The eateries are not of good quality. Sure you can get your supersized fries and everything deep-fried and hamburgers and cokes and all-you-can-eat pizzas and/or pastas, but healthy and delicious options are hard to find. Also atmosphere is busy, most of the places we checked were a bit sloppy with dirty (and rickety) tables and empty ketchup bottles (and I realize that this was because of the huge amount of visitors compared to staff), but staff everywhere was very nice. Danes seemed to bring their own lunch. If you or your kid needs food at precise times, be very early as there are queues everywhere.

- There are a lot of discount offers on tickets, for example on back of maps, in some magazines etc, so a pro tip for pinchpennies.

- I would recommend 2 days for just for exploring the Legoland park, excluding water park and other attractions.

And then I wanted to share some improvement ideas for the park should someone from the park read this :)

- please improve your entrance experience. Now you have a herd of people queuing randomly, without any clear lines and grownups behaving badly in front of (their own and someone else‚Äôs) kids trying to keep their space on the imaginary line. This can be easily fixed. Please, please have separate lines for families with strollers and huge groups an actual person validating their tickets and letting them smoothly in. I saw that someone had printed their ticket to an A3 size paper. For some reason, the bar code was so huge that you cannot find any scanners on this earth to match it. Maybe this could be coded differently as well so that the bar code is always certain size, no matter what kind of sheet you try to print the tickets on?

- loved the online purchase over phone, BUT it was very confusing to buy the tickets: Bought a family ticket for two days, and the ticket showed same day for all tickets. Luckily there were no problems, but an explanation could easily be coded on the site/ticket.

- more benches for adults to sit and wait, pretty please!

-oh, and healthy and delicious food options. Thanks!

Overall we sprint there a pleasant time. However it was not a dreaming time. On several occasions it was visible that many models (of cities, cars,...) were old: the color of Legos was not as new LEGO bricks.

Denmark,Egle D,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"It was probably a 'dream come true' for me, a thrifty+ year old, rather than my kids aged almost three and one üòÉ

But baring that in mind, I would give tips like these:
- bring your own food. There is nothing to eat, except junk food in the area, and the only two restaurants serve nothing better as well. There are plenty picnic areas, so come ready.
- use the LegoBillund app. It makes life easier, though it lacks filters for height.
- My toddler is like 98-100cm tall, so some rides of 100cm he got through, then some. we lost time standing in line and had to walk away snubbed. They could give a pass for another line in such cases, 'cause it sucks for the kid and parent. Especially when you go on one ride and you pass and on the other one you're snubbed.
MEASURE YOUR KIDS AT THE ENTRANCE and ask the staff to note their height on advance, this way you skip such experiences as ours with he failed waiting in line.
- take a rain proof poncho for everyone I your group üòÉ it takes up little space, but will be a valuable item on several rides. The local ones are costly in comparison.

Denmark,Blorrn,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"Yes, it's a lego-themed amusement park; yes, it's in the town that is the Lego Group's world headquarters; and yes, it has lego-themed rides, plus variously lego-themed accommodation. But.

The rides/attractions are a mix of the good (a smallish roller-coaster accessed through a castle well fitted out with some large scale lego models) to the ordinary and -very- ordinary - a couple of underwhelming water slide rides; some limited interactive rides that are just themed shoot-em-ups; and, oddly, some toss-and-win stalls. Also, some splendid lego models of famous buildings; some less impressive other models - a motorised dairy plant, anyone? - and an enormous lego model of a Star Wars X-wing that's ... a big and fairly plain lump of lego bricks. Plus long queues - if you have to go, have the money and don't mind the glares, it's worthing paying to use a queue-skipping device, though many people didn't.

Food options are execrable - terrible (but expensive) burgers etc; ordinary (but expensive and slow) icecream; a pancake stall that ran out of food; and nary a natural ingredient in site. Plus there are large designated smoking areas because a children's adventure park without the waft of greasy food and cigarette butts would be ... a good idea?

There's also a huge lego shop with the aesthetics of your local bulk-buy, plus many stressed parents, plus lots of foam swords and other similar high quality merchandise. And many demoralised staff.

Spend a day or even two at the nearby Lego House instead, then perhaps go to the adventure course at nearby Lalandia or the Tivoli in Copenhagen instead.

I recommend booking an advanced 2-day ticket for great value, but don‚Äôt book food at the same time as you don‚Äôt save any money. Eat at the family buffet. The food is great and they have good allergy information. Make sure you mix the days up with rides, shows, 4D cinema, and Mini Land. Do this for 2 days and you will have seen most of the attractions.

Denmark,Maria S,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Everything was perfect during our 3 day visit, except... We did have 2 unpleasant experiences at the same ride with the same staff, because of one staff. We had a platinum Q-b, and that staff did not want to let us pass at our booked time (as all other staff on all other rides), and once she finally agreed to let us, she started yelling at me in front of the big queue and my daughter as she did not like the seats we have chosen. My daughter was completely embarrassed and did not enjoy the ride so much, because of that. We returned later on the same day (full with positive experiences) & the same staff did the same thing (without yelling this time) asking us to change our seats, because ""there were too many people"" (what kind of reason is that to ask people to change seats??), and, while explaining that, let an entirely empty canoe go on the ride in front of the amazed queue. That was ridiculous and self-contradicting for everybody to see. I think then she got the message, and we went 3 more times (with the platinum Q-b: no waiting times) and she did not say anything those times. So thanks to Q-b, I saved my daughter's experience as she fully enjoyed the last 3 times.
It was only 1 ride, only 1 staff and only one day! Everything else was excellent both one the day and the other 2 days. But to be yelled at in from of child and queue is definetly costing a star!

I recommend to follow the performances that take place in different parts of the park at different times. We were at the castle of the princess, in the 4D cinema and knights' tournament. Revelation.

The rides are fun and they have a good mix of rides and attractions for all ages.
I would say the weakest part of the park is the food. There were no really good food options. Things like hot dogs and hamburgers dominated the choices. I would have liked to have seen some more variety.
All in all it was a good choice to go out of our way to get here. Not owned by Lego anymore is a shame and we will have to get to Lego House on our next trip for more building fun as the park seemed to be more commercial.

Favorites included: Polar Xplorer (WOW!), Ice Pilots School (so cool to design your own ride), the canoe ride, Dragon ride, Vikings River Splash (raft ride). The park is clean, well laid out, adequate restrooms and food options. All employees were friendly and helpful. We loved that while the rides closed at 6, the park stayed open until 8. This allowed us time to focus on rides and shows during the day, and then have dinner and have time to visit Miniland and the shops between 6 and 8. We ate at the Grill House all 3 evenings for dinner and loved it. (I wrote a separate review for that. 5 stars!) Plan for a full day. Go for more than one full day if possible.

Denmark,Meredith B,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We took our 8 year old grandson to Legoland and I think this could be the optimum age to fully appreciate the range of rides, activities, interactive games and displays provided by this delightful theme park. A number of rides are more suited for teenagers and older and our daughter thoroughly enjoyed the more thrilling nature of these. We saw a jousting show which demonstrated the superb skilled horsemanship and jousting skills of the riders. This was the highlight of the day for me and I recommend you try to include it in your visit.
While designed for children, moments of humour for adults appear in some of the clever LEGO constructions.
I definitely recommend this place for a whole day visit.

Denmark,brennenv,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"This was our third visit to a Legoland park, the first being Legoland Malaysia and last year Legoland Germany.

Given our previous experiences we expected similar kind of rides, and that is exactly what we missed. The rides here are less intensive and therefore less interesting as well.

The Polar X-plorer is very nice and has a good surprise, but the other ones are just 'OK' only. This was a bit disappointing when we visited. Although it wasn't crowded at all and although we could do the rides multiple times in a row we would rather visit Legoland Germany again before coming back to this park.

Therefore Legoland is like the best place to be in for me, especially during/after rain, when there isn‚Äôt much people there, because all rides and other activities/stuff have very low wait times, for example, I waited 10 minutes for a ride, but my dad‚Äôs friend who where there the day before, when it was sunny, was shocked when he heard about we only had to wait 10 minutes.

The 'play' by the mini castle was a real hit! We saw it 3 times,...and the battle of the brick was also great! The only thing I would change is information about the rides. 'Temple' for example.....well, what is it? The only way to find out is to do it.

You may want to get a pass for more than one day as a single day is probably not going to be enough to take it all in. The process for the passes is a bit slow and old fashioned so it takes awhile to get it sorted - again, it is worth it. The rides and shows are included with the exception of the driving school for kids. It is another 90 dkr pr kid.

Parking is 50 dkkr./6,5 euro.

If you got loads of cash you‚Äôll be able to pay (a fortune) and skip the massive lines. And people in line will absolutely hate you for it.
You‚Äôll be able to dine in one of their restaurants which obviously is insane expensive (a burger and fries for 169 dkkr. = 23 euro and I‚Äôm not sure drinks are included...) and buy merchandise with prices off the charts.

If you‚Äôre a normal person with a normal saluary, be prepared to stand in line at each ride between 20-50 minutes. The rides last between 30 seconds and 1,15 min.
We checked üòå
Also keep in mind that their waiting time estimat is worth zero, because they dont include the people skipping the line. And as far as we observed - they are not satisfied trying the attraction only once.

~Bring your own food/snacks and drinks~

That said; there‚Äôs nothing wrong with Legoland. It‚Äôs a cosy theme park and their staff are kind and helpfull.

It‚Äôs just ridicously expensive and I would not recommend ordinary people to visit. There‚Äôs sooo many other places to visit in Denmark - better and cheaper üòä

Denmark,fatboyabroad,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We got to the park late on a Friday about 4.15, we were let in for free.
Managed to get on a few rides before they ceased running at 5pm, the park closes at 6pm.
We arrived back early the next morning about 10.15 and was greeted by a huge crowd, probably 50 or 60 deep.

For some reason the ticket I'd been emailed only let 1 person through, it was for 1 handily and the child goes free.

I spoke to a lady called Ditta, and told her what had happened, I pointed out that my son was at one side of the barriers and could she let me through to stand with him while it was sorted out, sadly she was having none of it and refused me entry despite showing her the email and purchase receipts which showed I'd paid for 1 adult and child goes free.
My son was naturally worried, as I was too as the vast crouds were just swarming through the barriers.
It took about 10 mins to sort and during this time Ditta had come back numerous times to ask questions I'd already told her the answer too.

We eventually got in and thoroughly enjoyed the rides and the models, once youve paid and got passed Ditta then everything else is free with the exception of the driving school.
We did queue for most rides, but probably no more than 10 mins.

It was an enjoyable day, nice to see a place so well kept and clean, theme parks in the UK could do to use this as a bench mark.

We went in May but not during school holidays and it was very quiet, we hardly had to queue for anything. Miniland was fantastic, the attention to detail in the models and the movement of the trucks, trains, canal locks, etc. is really good. We also really enjoyed the fact that there are lego sculptures everywhere, not just in miniland, but all around the park. The rides are good fun, mostly aimed at children but fun for adults too. The lego sculptures around the rides add to the interest and quite a few of the rides and picnic areas have tubs of lego for you to play with whilst waiting or eating. The staff were all very friendly and although the cafes were fairly expensive the lego was not a lot more expensive than buying it elsewhere. We had a 2 day ticket and this was about right. We were able to look at all the models in detail and have another go on our favourite rides the second day.

The rides are a similar selection to Windsor, with a few that are quite different.
We had two days in the park which was a perfect amount of time.
The children said it was the best theme park they have been to (aged 9 and 5).

Denmark,thepetridish,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"A reasonably sized amusement park with a nice mix of rides that trend toward the younger side. I took my 12 year old (almost 13) and he was right on the edge of being too old. The vast majority, being roller coaster or water ride, is the equivalent of a float down a lazy river. The most unique, exciting, and entertaining ride was the Ice Pilots School. It consists of a pair of roller coaster type seats with over the shoulder restraints attached to one of those large mechanical arms you find on an automobile assembly line. Once strapped in, the arm flings you around, often leaving you suspended upside down. To add an extra layer of fun, you actually get to program the movements of the arm before you climb aboard. No two rides are the same, if you choose.

But even if many of the other rides were a bit pedestrian, it didn't matter because of all the LEGOS! My son loves them so he was completely mesmerized by MiniLand and the Star Wars dioramas. He studied every detail of these complex models as we casually strolled in and out of the various LEGO neighborhoods.

We visited LegoLand in May. Although it was still a little chilly, there were almost no lines for any rides. We were able to do everything we wanted without rushing around and rode several of the biggest attractions multiple times. It was the perfect way to enjoy the park.

Once we got inside, my 9 year old daughter was excited! She tried all the rides and the longest we waited was 25 min, otherwise it was about 10-15 minutes at each ride.

Park is a tad outdated. She didn‚Äôt care, just my opinion. Restrooms were clean so that was good.

Denmark,rebihari,LEGOLAND Billund,2.0,"We have visited Legoland the first time in April 2019 with 4 kids, age between 3-6. Kids were dreaming about this adventure for weeks - so did we, adults. So we purchased 2 days tickets for the entire family.
When arrived not much later after the 10 am opening time, there was already a long queue- luckily we had pre-purchased tickets which I really recommend!
Queues all over, with 4 kids not very optimal.
The technology is outdated, you can only buy junk food in endless volume.
To the positive site, toilets were clean and within easy access everywhere.
All in all, Legoland stopped innovating itself in order to keep up with modern technology or with Lego‚Äôs high brand position in terms of quality - so it became a third class fun park by the roadside.
We decided not to use the 2nd day tickets, children did not even ask for it.

Denmark,SJLinPSJ,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Spent 2 days exploring the park. Although queuing is a requirement of any theme park, the queues were not long as some of the rides are continuous and keep moving. Wonderful models of Denmark‚Äôs finest landmarks, look forward for all the little details. Usual gift shops throughout the park and places to eat, all quite pricey. Went with 2 children aged 4 and 6, they loved it.",Apr 2019
Denmark,TransferTraveller,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Park at Cargo centervej, you may save 50 DKK (i admit it is not much). You will find it down firhoejevej when pass lalandia on your right.

Usually i start with the train (the oldest attraction) and work my way down

Avoid july and the open-air family concert if you dont prefer 45-75 minutes time in line. If its an option then i would go on tuesday.

From last years experience i will reccommend restaurant panorama and knights bbq. The pizza buffet is too much factory.

You better bring good shoes as 10 km walking is not uncommon.

Denmark,Luka K,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"If you have children below 18 than you have no doubt had a pleasure of visiting the hell hole that is Legoland. We have had the joy of visiting both UK and Denmark one and without a doubt Denmark one is far superior both in terms of rides and Lego creations. As expected, everything is overpriced with plenty of money wasting opportunities at every corner. We visited it out of season so waiting times were acceptable, however I dread to think what happens in July here, as even in April over weekend some rides had 30 minutes waiting time.
A word of wisdom - buy tickets ahead and print them out, as the ticket cues are long and tedious.
You can‚Äôt really fault it from a perspective of a little people. There are rides and activities suitable for all ages. Plenty of picnic tables and toilets that are reasonably clean and stocked at every corner.
As an adult the main thing that will hit you is the cost of everything. Before you enter Lego land you might as well take your cash and just burn it there and then, whilst at it, upload your bank details on FB including all your security data.
Now I know that we have a pleasure of Brexit and the exchange rate of krona to pound is pretty pathetic, however it would take a Brexit deal of a century to recover the exchange rate to the level where the cash spent at Lego land is palatable. Two ice creams have set us back ¬£10. They were pretty decent ice creams but not the sort that should cost a tenner. Be prepared to pay ¬£10 per child for the driving school. Woo hoo - have my money please! A candy floss has set us back more then ¬£4. Sugar is clearly expensive in Denmark!
Atlantis was highlight really. It is interactive and there is plenty of species of the fish on the show. The mini land is also a sight to behold - it is elaborate, plenty of interactive pieces and it is really what Lego is about - building!
If you are sucker for torture and are looking to enter the seven levels of hell that is Lego shop, for God sake go early. Carrying around a massive overpriced Lego box around the park will be worth it. Trust me -carrying around a stone wheel is worth it if you avoid the spectacle that the ‚Äòend of day visit to the shop‚Äô is. If you have never seen a chorus of tantrums - this will be the moment. I have never seen so many little, exhausted people having ‚Äòan episode‚Äô at the same time. There were children marching out, refusing to move and acting as if possessed. There were so many parents desperate parents throwing their wallets at the cashiers that it would of been funny - only if I was not one of them. At the end of the day if you are ‚Äòdoing it for the kids‚Äô this is a great way to prolong your mortgage term!

Denmark,Katarzyna B,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"I've wanted to visit Legoland since I was a kid. When my own children were big enough for the experience we finally decided to go on the trip. We came in the first week of may - iw was a bit chilly but not too crowded. We enjoyed the miniworld and all of the rides very much. In my opinion the only one not worth waiting in a 45 min line was the Hounted house.
I recommend getting online coupons and using them at ticket office on site - that way we only paid for 3 tickets instead on 5. We got 2 day tickets and it was a great choice - we tested all attractions on day 1 and only went to the ones we liked again on day 2. However, the park is not very big so one day is enough to experience all attractions as long as it is not too crowded.
If you don't want to spend a fortune on dining it's good to bring your own lunch - there are multiple picnic sites where you can rest and eat your own snacks instead of paying 10 EUR for a hotdog and soda.

Denmark,familytravelsguy,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Legoland Billund is fun for kids up to perhaps age 12. With lots of rides and ""observation"" attractions themed around legos, our kids had a great time running from place to place and experiencing everything. Perhaps the highlight of our last trip was our oldest driving her own car on the themed lego track. Pulling into ""gas stations"", going through a moving ""car wash"", and trying to follow traffic lights and signs all while other young preteens do the same was a thrill for our oldest, and made our younger ones want to come back and get their own ""drivers liscense"".

For the adults, there really is not much here. There are a few rides in between that seemed to draw interest from adults in our group, but with all the over the top lego theming and/or short length of the rides, there really is not much there for adults. Added in that food is vastly overpriced with long wait times (we waited for 1 hour for small portions of burgers and french fries), and we can justify it for short periods of time. The only real fun for adults is in watching the kids light up and enjoy themselves.

We happened to get the timing perfectly as this weekend in October was Halloween and the weather was fantastic with about 22-23 degrees! The whole place was decorated with pumpkins, spider web and ghouls and ghosts everywhere. There was also some kind of small houses you could go to using a map you buy, then at these houses ou got something for free, a small LEGO-set, candy, soda and some other things. The queue for the small houses was sometimes a bit long, but the kids still loved it. Unfortunately, it took a lot of the time away as you had to be at these places between specific times printed on the map, so much of the time spent was put to walking around to get to the different places and then standing in line. How ever, the children got to see a lot of fun things and ride most of the things they wanted, so all in all it still was a success!

We went in UK half term for some counties but it was school time for Denmark and as a result there were no queues at all. This made all the difference and the children (aged 10,9,5) absolutely loved it. The rides are better than Windsor with four roller coasters.

The people there were incredibly friendly and the whole town felt very clean.

Denmark is very expensive as the exchange rate is so bad compared to the pound. We booked a place a mile out of town, which was great. But then we had to get taxis to get back, which were very expensive. It cost ¬£20 for each journey for two miles. We walked from the airport, which was only a mile or so to Legoland and then caught the bus back which was about ¬£5 for all of us instead of ¬£20 by cab They run pretty much every half an hour - 143 and 43. Eating out is also very expensive.

The famous miniworld looks run down, a modern miniworld is clearly missing (modular buildings are nowhere to be found) and the food is not just extremely overprized, but also disgusting. It's solely the ""American menu"", designed to supersize. Only fats and sugars, and for drinks only sugared soda's. We couldn't find a single healthy item in this entire entertainment park for small children. Not even a piece of bread. So better bring your own food.

Oh. And the Lego shop is about 30% overprized.

The rooms are spacious and the kids have their own ‚Äòcorner‚Äô. The bathroom is modern and the cleaners do a wonderful job keeping it all clean and organised!!
The breakfast was very good, with a good variety of sweet and savoury choices, although the kids would go for the pancakes all the time.

We didn‚Äôt eat in any of the snack bars/restaurants at the park, but the popcorn and cotton candy were really expensive. But that‚Äôs how it is at any attraction park!
TIP - If you are by car, there is a supermarket (Netto open everyday 8.00-22-00), really close to the Lego house. Go there for water and snacks for the kids.

Three days he kept on going at that ride.
There was also a traffic school with autos costing 30 euros
The place is not that big, it has many themes, lot‚Äôs to do and every night we had some firework fun for haloween
I would agree with the person that complained regarding food variety. It is a burger pizza style place...not that many alternatives.

If there is one thing I was missing in the area, was a supermarket to get things.
Prices were a bit rough...any three person meal was in the region of 100 euros and the most idiotic thing was that bottled water was only in 330 ml costing around 4 euros.....imagine how much I needed since am drinking at least 4 lt a day.....

I went back the next day with my daughter and it was completely different and so much better. No line was more than 5 minutes. We got there at park opening and stayed on roller coasters for multiple trips in a row. I have no clue why one day was so different - but it might be worth strategizing and asking about how busy it will be when you consider visiting. Obviously even one day can make a big difference. We got so many rides that I didn't think we needed to stay for the whole second day, but my 8-yr old believed differently and so we were still there 10 am to 5 pm. Lots of fun.

She also did the ""driving school"" that you have to pay extra for. That was the highlight of her day, so it was worth it. Hilarious to see 8-yr old drivers on a real, imitation course of roads in an imitation town.

So many great rides and experiences catering for the whole family - roller coasters for the thrill seekers and gentler fun rides with lots of LEGO characters and attractions. Miss 9‚Äôs favourite was the Ice Pilots ride - where she tortured me with programming a simulation at Level 5 (maximum) with so many twists and turns I nearly puked. But it was really funny. Master 7 is not much of a daredevil and hated it - his favourite rides were Dragon and the LEGO Ninjago ride.

Denmark,HW62,LEGOLAND Billund,2.0,"Legoland is a playground for kids with lot of activities and things to do. Foodwise however, Legoland is not for the fussy. There are several restaurants to choose from, including ones with a buffet, were you for a fixed prize can eat how much you want. The standard of the food is however sadly rather poor. The whole place is a kind of fast food paradise. There are no quality restaurants to find. You are almost doomed to consume french fries, pizza, or pasta. I do understand that that kind of food is aimed at kids and their preferences. But it is harder to understand that for instance the additional sallad bars are a sad story of even sadder vegetables.

So I miss two things in Legoland. First, a broader spectrum of restaurants to choose from, and secondly, a better range as to attract both kids and adults.

My only problem is my family and I attempted to do family pictures on the safari ride because no other ride could do 6 people. The ride had no max limit written on the front like the other rides did. The first attempted, the picture didn‚Äôt turn out good (our fault not the parks). So we went back in line and waited in line for 15 minutes. Two families of 6 went on before my family and they had no issues and neither did my family 15 minutes prior. We started to get back on and the girl at the ride says we cannot, that only 5 are allowed. I said it wasn‚Äôt written and I pointed out that there were others family members doing it at that same time. She acted like she did not understand. I went to complain at the information desk and they put me in contact with a manager named Mr. Claus. He told me twice that I was wrong and that it is written on the ride that only 5 people can be on it. I told him it says only two adults at one time. He told me I was wrong for third time. I said fine and said I was going check. The manager took off and raced me to the ride. I am handicap and I‚Äôm using a cane. There was no need to race me. He beat me there, read the sign and walked backed before I got there and apologized. I repeatively said ‚Äúwhy did you say I was wrong and you didn‚Äôt look‚Äù he said he didn‚Äôt tell me I was wrong and said yes you did, multiple times.

This is unacceptable for a manager to tell a customer this without looking or knowing. I‚Äôm glad he apologized but no where does it say 5 people. All the other rides say max people allowed and this ride did not.

Other than this incident, the place was really good. I would give it 3 stars out of 5 due to customer service.

The Only 2 negatives was the food options there. When staying at Legoland the buffet was the same everynight and its just not the best. Also they should introduce fishburger to their menu outside instead of just reglular burgers and meatmeals.

With our children (14, 11 and 7), we spent a full 8h day in the Park. With the Extreme Racers ride under deconstruction, the kids loved Polar Explorer, Ice Pilots, Jungle Racers, The Eagle and Dragon (in that order). We all enjoyed Miniland, but mostly me (amazing number of moving objects, including several working locks, and super attention to detail). It was an overcast day, with intermittent showers, but that didn‚Äôt impact us significantly. With no context, crowd levels seemed very low - we mostly did not queue for rides.

Denmark,sallychambers2018,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We visited Legoland Denmark as we have already been to Legoland Windsor and we also wanted to check out the relatively new Lego House which is just down the road. We were astonished that there were no queques for any of the rides! We went end of August so I think that the Danish school
holidays must have ended. It was so nice not to have to stand for a long time in line! Lots to see and do and quite different to Legoland Windsor. My only gripe would be with the overpriced food selection. Non of it particularly healthy and really not cheap....but otherwise a great trip and worth a visit.

We went primarily for the mini land and it did not disappoint - the engineering and precision involved is just amazing. There's mini versions of places like Bergen, Edinburgh Castle, Nyhavn, etc and they make all the vehicles and boats move. There was even a mini airport as well! The rides were pretty fun as well - not crazy rollercoaster but still pretty fun!",Jul 2018

Having been to the Windsor UK park on several occasions and there were useful comparisons to be drawn. Billund was cleaner and flatter and there were more rides for younger children.

Denmark,marcowy,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Went there with the 3,5 daughter. Overall there is a lot of fun and very positive excitement but we have missed the aeras which provide a bit of slow down. Normally one would expect that in the garden, but there was a welcome from the princess, then the pinguins aera was quite vinrant with the music as well. Picnic area is close to the wet sailing with lot of screams. Park offers a lot of quality joy and plays but somehow it seems to miss the chill out aeras where the small ones may drop for a moment to take a breath and cool down before another round of the fun.",Jul 2018

I would encourage anyone to go here out of peak season the longest we waited for rides was about 10min.

Denmark,Peter C,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,We have been here twice once in 2013 and again in 2018. Always have great days out with family here queues are much smaller than Legoland in UK so you can get on all rides easily in one day (in late August). Good ranges of rides for all ages.,Aug 2018
Denmark,Jess H,LEGOLAND Billund,1.0,"It is such a shame but I can not recommend Legoland in Billund at all. There are so many rides which either cater for the small so rather tame or the adrenaline junky so scream worthy. Although those of us that did take part in the latter rides were underwhelmed. There is nothing for those that are more wary and no signs to explain what the rides were. If you weren‚Äôt sure, you may join a ride that is absolutely not to your liking but it would then be too late. Some of it is fun and you can get quite wet which is always worth a laugh, but for a day out it can be quite stressful.
The Lego builds were great though and the staff were busy but helpful.
The food is extremely expensive so take a picnic!
As one of our party rightly said, Legoland is okay for those that like to look at lego. We would rather get involved and immersed in it.
Won‚Äôt be visiting again in a hurry.

Denmark,Helen C,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"I visited this without children, and I loved it! The park was so quiet (blame rainy weather and a weekday) which meant that were no queues for anything, just walked straight onto the rides. This meant I managed to do most of the rides/attractions in a short space of time. Lots of kids weren't even getting off the ride, just staying on and going around again! All the rides are child friendly; nothing too scary!
There were toilets around every corner, all very clean. There were also loads of eating places. The lego shop was also great, but I feel like they need more tshirts for adults as most of their range is for children.
The map of the park wasn't that great, and I wasn't entirely sure which attractions were located in which section of the park. But I soon learnt my way around. Would have loved for the park to stay open slightly longer.
Managed to do Legohouse and Legoland in the same day from Vejle. Definitely recommend a visit.

Denmark,Moorpool,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"I took my sons here over 30 years ago, now it was the grandsons who are totally dedicated to Lego.
We‚Äôd got an inclusive deal from Hotel Propellen which meant we didn‚Äôt need to queue for tickets. We spent two days here, remember to go to the office next to the shop to get your tickets extended for subsequent days.
On the first day we arrived at the advertised opening time only to find people already in so next day we went earlier and headed for the far side.
It was good to see so much was still there in terms of displays and the Driving School, always a big hit. It is extra though. The car wash made them all giggle as they drove through. I did miss the museum of 19th and early 20th century toys which I enjoyed last time. There are many more rides and experiences. I foolishly let my 11 year old choose the options for the Pilots School, never again! If you do the Pirate Boats you will get very wet, the adults take over with a vengeance.
The queues are airport style and can be deceptive, you can‚Äôt always see their extent. Most have Lego on the way to help keep the children amused.
Loos are good, food not bad but pricey. The shop is expensive ( so is Denmark) , look for things you can‚Äôt buy at home. Same goes for the LegoHouse.
The displays around the park are impressive, immaculate gardens, everything works, the locks are particularly good. All the displays kept the 9 and 11 year old fully involved many times over.
I expected that the leaflets would be in multiple languages but they weren‚Äôt. Not too much of a problem though. The site is generally flat and there are plenty of benches. It is a dry weather venue, we were fortunate it was dry and very sunny if a bit too hot.
The whole place is clean and tidy, thoroughly recommend it for families of all ages.

And it leads by example.

This is a cleaner, shinier and more extravagantly impressive relation to the Windsor Legoland.

We spent hours with the kids wandering though the Lego towns, villages and scenes. There was something new and surprising around every corner.

Queues at the end of August are manageable and the staff are superb.

If you like your gardening then you will be impressed by the amount of work that goes into keeping this park looking so good.

Denmark,Lesly P,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We a family of 4 with 2 kids of 5 and 2 and just came from a 2days visit to legoland and we are very happy with it.
The good
-5 to 10 minute queue on everything, worst case scenario and you find a crowded park you can spend quite some time on the duplo land or on the LEGO exhibition
- queue goes quite fast , means you are always walking , and there is a LEGO play area for your kid while they wait
- a lot of games for small kids ,so we could keep both of them distracted
- bathrooms everywhere and they were always perfectly clean , there is even a baby area if you are breastfeeding.
-several playgrounds around the park

The not so good
-most of the signs were in Danish ! So quite difficult to figure out some special offers
-a bit difficult of find yourself on the park, we came across those typical maps around the park , but they don‚Äôt have the red mark that says ‚Äúyou are here ‚Äú
-don‚Äôt download the app, it is quite useless, can‚Äôt not even tell you where in the park you are located.
-food is a bit pricey, but quality is good .it is Danish standard.

We will for sure return! But 2 day trip seems good enough for our kiddos .

Denmark,hlbbartlett,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Surprised by the amount of variation between here and our usual Legoland haunt in Windsor and relieved to find more ‚Äúthrill‚Äù type rides here too to keep our 8&10yo boys entertained.

Most innovative ride by far was Ice Pilots School tucked into the corner of Polar Land - where your upload your own ride onto a car, selecting the level of intensity and the actual sequence of movements and then get strapped into your robotic arm to (hopefully!) enjoy the ride! New Flying Eagle ride was neat and meant there are 4 larger rollercoasters to chose between.

Great tip for those nationalities that can is to visit after Danish school holidays have finished in later August.

Show Consideration pass system for those with hidden disabilities was brilliant and very straightforward to organise at the Information kiosk. Made a huge difference to our trip!

Denmark,butterfly00,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Great for young kids (probably less so for kids over 8 years old). It‚Äôs basically an amusement park for little kids. We went for two days and did everything other than the three rides our son was too short for, and both days were relaxed. Other than Miniland, where they have built cities and landmarks out of Legos (which is amazing), it‚Äôs mostly rides. LEGO is the theme but it‚Äôs not really about Legos or building (for that, go to LEGO House, which I highly recommend!!!). I very much liked that even in August, it was not too crowded. And it is not commercialized like Disney, where there is a store and an opportunity to spend more money every ten feet. Instead they just let you have a good time and enjoy the park, and the number of stores is surprisingly limited. I was surprised by how few food places were actually open though - we really had to search in the mid afternoon for. a place to get lunch.

Denmark,Vladimir O,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"We went on a Monday and expected some queues as specified by the Queue Barometer. It was exactly like that. 20 minute wait time on the most popular attractions. Most of the rides had a 5 minute queue, which was great since we took our 6 year old son. We spent the full 7 hours on rides and the miniland (park was opened from 10 to 17). Didn't go to see Ninjago and the movie. Our son wasn't really interested.
We also had a meal in the Saloon restaurant, which was great. Not too expensive and the food was great. We had spearibs and our son had the chicken nuggets.
Suggestion would be to go to the Lego shop before the rides close, otherwise be prepared to see everyone in the Lego shop at the same time. Surprisingly, we found what we were looking for and waited only 10 minutes in line to pay.

Denmark,Dovydas Z,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"1. Size: 1 day park.. within 1 day everything is possible to see and try at least 1 time...Although you might want to spent 2 days because if following reasons:
- better price for 2 days instead of 1 day ( for example if you stay in Lego Hotel the price is 280dkk for 2 days, while if you would buy at entrance it would be 380dkk for 1 day per person)
2. Reachability: it is in the middle of nowhere (Billund nithing else tobsee except Lego), but in that middle of nowhere you will find several accomodation possibilities, some 5+ supermarkets and 5+ restaurants to eat...
3. Entrance: max 5minutes to enter from hotel...
4. What you find.. you will find as it is written - amusements for all ages of children.. best height 120cm which opens entrance to all rides.
5. What I liked/didnt like:
- liked: it is very well maintained place;
- liked: lots of toilets;
- liked: lots of places to eat and quite good variety.
- disliked: prices for the food. You should be ready to spent somewhere arround 150-200eur per family per day on the food
- liked: quite acceptable price for entrance, but high ti be in (expences for food)
6.TIPS:
- it is suggested to bring some food with yourselves;
- it is suggested to get 2 days ticket or seasonal pass if you are considering to come at least 2 times in seasons..
- it is suggested to swap tickets while leaving which will open entrance for next time..
- it is suggested to come earlier and start from POLAR area.. this will give you a possibility to use this ride for some 5 times till the queue becomes long..:)
Final evaluation: good park to start your journey of visiting parks.. :)

Today we returned for her 25 birthday to revisit the land of the Lego chips. Same place, same service and same food.
Except for the guy outside doing his best to clear away empty plates whilst fighting with a swarm of wasp, this on its own deserved a medal for the bravery and entertainment value.
It was only however when he came inside that the real fun began. This guy (Martin) had the restaurant in stitches, the children squealing with delight as he relentlessly ran after, played and made riot with the youngsters allowing the parents much rest and great entertainment watching their kids having fun.
Martin was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
I am way to old to have joined in and so were my guests, but at least one of us was on the verge of jumping in.
Legoland go to the family buffet restaurant, find Martin and give him a big medal because he is one of your biggest assets.

The rides are easy to get round , the staff friendly and the prices not a rip off.

They always say the original is best and with Legoland Billund that is so true. My husband went just after the original opening so was keen to see what had happened in those years. Lots of new rides and expansion but still a wonderful experience.

Go away from the European School holidays , we went over the UK bank holiday weekend in May. The Saturday was a little bit busy , but nothing over 40 mins. We thought about a Qbot on the Sunday but did not see the point the longest time we saw was 25 minutes. On the weekdays the Qbot office did not even open ! I think the longest we queued for was about 10 minutes . This is quicker than using a Qbot in the UK.

We will be back to Billund as it is so lovely just to walk around only 10 minutes from the airport. So if you time it right you can do a day trip from the UK.

Denmark,MDE_Bass,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"First, if you love Lego, go to Lego House. It is only half of the money, but double the mount of fun (see my review of Lego House).

We went to Legoland on a Thursday in summer and the waiting lines are really long then. You easily wait 30-40 minutes (even if the signs say 20-25 minutes) for a ride that took less than a minute. I would recommend to go on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday (these days are more quiet), otherwise it is a lot of money for a lot of waiting. Also, there are many nice things to do for kids from 3-5 years, for my 6-year old this was already a bit boring. Luckily she was long enough (>120cm) and not afraid to go into the more exciting rides. What is very nice is that they really put effort to make waiting more enjoyable as you can watch some lego sculptures or your kids can play with lego while parents keep standing in line. What I didn't like, was that in some rides the employees were not very proactive in making sure that every wagon was full. For example, cars were occupied by 2 people, while it was designed for 4-5. Of course it is nice to have a car for just you with your kid, but this really could reduce the waiting time significantly (probably, this is also why the waiting time as displayed was often incorrect).

Another recommendation: there are many possibilities to get a free ticket for your kid, for example in each Lego brochure you can find a voucher for this. The waiting time for the tickets was not long at all, so it is not a problem is you do not buy in advance. Parking is the same price for every parking area. When we arrived (around 10.15h) Legoland people were already inviting us to park on P3, while P1 was still half empty. We though that it might be cheaper, but there was no difference in price, only a 15-minutes additional walking time...

Denmark,RomseyChechy,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"5 children aged 12-8 and two grandparents had two very happy visits here. We all enjoyed it much more than Windsor. The displays and models all looked fresher and newer. The park was very clean and there were good food options. Prices were higher generally in Denmark but not noticeably in the park. 30 Kroner for nice ice cream as example. We did get the q bot which was fairly simple to use, you book next ride as soon as you get on present one. It meant we did not wait long at all. Must be frustrating for those who cannot afford the extra K 249 each though.
The model world is fabulous, a reasonable number of rides, none of them very long. It did close promptly at 6pm so our second day ticket combined with Lego House, was not good value.

Denmark,bumps94,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,Took 5 grandchildren (12 to 8) who all loved the time there. Queues varied from 5 to 45 mins so a Qbot was useful but expensive at over 200 Kroner each. Signposting of slides was poor and map not as clear as it might have been. Otherwise a great experience enjoyed by grandparents and children.,Aug 2018
Denmark,Stephen P,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Second visit with family (technically my third but 25yrs later). We love it. Miniland for a stroll to look at the landmarks mixed with rides, a movie and the diving show. Oh and not to mention the wonderfully random penguins in the Arctic part. Queues can get long for some rides but nothing compared to UK parks. Definitely rides for the younger kids rather than adrenaline hungry teens but all great fun. Probably helps that we all love Lego!!",Aug 2018
Denmark,CatlynK,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"We had planned this a long time so expectations were pretty high. They were also high on the commercial aspect that it will probably take all of our money. Well, we kept some.

Overall, the park has a lot of things to do. We don't do rollercoasters and there were many other things for us, lots of boat rides, shooting games etc. Could have been more and not all of it was great but more than most amusement parks. We happened to have short lines as well so no long waits. The food was not that great and was on the expensive side but you could fill your waterbottle for free and there were many options for things. The miniland was great and overall, we had a good time.

One negative, though. The store sold a lot of stuff you can buy somewhere else (cheaper) and not enough legoland-based stuff.

Overall, still recommend.

Denmark,thomassjoblom,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"I haven't been to Legoland since I was 12 yo. Me and my kids love Lego even though the ridiculous prices for sets. That's why we always buy it 2nd hand.

We had some problems going down and contacted their customers support as we thought we would miss our check in time. These guys I have to give a 13 out of 10 for their quick, nice and excellent support! <3
Also everybody that works in the park and camping are VERY nice, fun and gives excellent service!

The park itself is OK for kids. It's clean, not to big and most of the rides are pretty fun but VERY short. Please stay away from the ""Aquarium"". We've had more fun visiting the local Zoo shop. Promoting king crabs and petting zoo that my kids very mostly looking forward seeing and doing. But they had neither. And the 5 min they make you spend watching the intro movie, is just a line event to make you waste more time as the whole ""ride"" is a joke.

We tried the family buff√©, and that was the only place the service was really crap. We where 3rd in line to pay, and it took 15 min. The food was ok for kids, but for adults forget about it. And the ""All you can eat""-ice cream buff√© was 2 soft ice machines with 3 different toppings to choose from. NOT worth the 560 DKK!!!

We stayed in an RV at the big camping site. This was VERY nice with loads of fun for the kids.

But.....it is 2018 and most of the western world are (sadly) depended on Internet/Wifi. If you are promoting ""Free wifi"" it has to f***ing work all over! I'm touring the world in my job 150 days a year. And I've had better, faster and more secure Wifi in small caf√©s in places and towns I couldn't even pronounce if I tried (as a swed). Loose that crappy german supplier and get a real supplier and some proper routers to boost the signal. For real. I've tried to login to my Gmail for 3h, and the signal drops every 30 sec, that made me so f*kkin mad so I wrote this review.

Denmark,samtheosasha,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Ahhhh such a magical place! Rides for all ages and a huge variety too so if your kids are not too keen on the high flying fast paced rides, they can go on so many other rides less frantic. Most of the rides had a max 30min wait but they tend to have plenty of things to look at and chat about while you wait. So many fun rides for the whole family too - our favourites were the pirate boats (firing water to folk on the shore who could also fire water at us!!) and the fire engine race, soooo much fun. Staff were very friendly and the facilities were clean and abundant. Plenty of eateries too but you have to consider there's a little variation of the Danish version of some foods.
In terms of parking, it was well signed and easy to find, plenty of parking, short wander to the main gate, leaflets in a good few languages and the staff spoke good English. All in all I would totally recommend going! If you're looking for a cheaper way to do it too, don't go for the hotel and park package. We stayed in an airbnb nearby and bought day tickets. Having said that, we really could have done with 2 days!

It is a nice garden but we did not like it very much, maybe for people with very small children.",Jul 2018
Denmark,apactraveller,LEGOLAND Billund,3.0,"This is a fairly inconsistent park - some decent attractions such as the Ninjago area (even with the ridiculously short Lazer Maze, which has a 30-minute wait for a 30-second experience) but also a lot of tired-looking ones, including the really dirty and depressing Miniland where most buildings and other vehicles seem in dire need of replacement - even the fairly recent Star Wars display is grimy and unattractive.

Overall we traveled from Asia expecting a superb experience at Lego's first and, we assumed, best park only to find a slightly run-down version... in keeping the Hotel Legoland which is an unmitigated disaster. I would not return nor would I recommend this visit to anyone, close or far.

We did this park with 3 children in the age of 2,4 and 6 and they loved it.
We were here in the summer period where the temperature was pretty high.
They had some water taps available that was a good thing.
The queues were pretty long but yes it is a famous park so you can expect it and it is well informed at the beginning of the queues.
The queues I expected to be more covered for rain/sun (last one we had a lot).
So the waiting was with kids in this age a bit to long in the heat.

The rides are fun and the Lego miniature displays are magnificent. The first day, a Friday, was not that busy and the lines for the bigger rides were not that long (20-50) minutes and we enjoyed the rides and the wait in the lines is made more fun with Lego displays and play areas for the kids.

The second day we bought the q-bot, to skip the lines. That day was much busier and we spent essentially no time in lines and all of the time on rides and fun. Expensive but so worth it!

Denmark,KathyS13,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"I first saw Legoland, Denmark in a Brownie annual as a child and have long held a dream to visit - it has taken 43 years to get there and it was well worth it. The lego cities was the highlight for me and I could have spent even longer taking all the detail in. We went on a few of the rides, but were truly dismayed to discover all of the rides including the tall tower overseeing the whole park closed promptly at 6pm which we had not anticipated as the park we understood was open to 9pm. The legoland park is beautifully planted with creative ideas for making the town scenes come alive and it felt like a really lovely park that is not too large that feels like you are never going to get round. Staff were unfailingly lovely and the free water taps for filling up water bottles were also really appreciated especially as it was so hot and humid. All the shops are full of lovely lego products I thought that there might have been more unique things for it being Billund and perhaps some special offers too given it is the original home of lego. It has fulfilled a dream, we had a wonderful day there and found the queues for everything moved quickly and were never too long a wait. There was a lovely buzz about the place and I for one am glad that it has not gone too far into becoming a theme park and that there is still a very strong sense of lego.

Denmark,twickers11,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"We stayed at the Hotel Lego which is literally across the street from the park. It opened at 10 and we joined an orderly Scandinavian queue (no queue jumpers here as there are for buses in other parts of Europe) from within the Hotel to get in. Tickets bought in advance. I won‚Äôt go into what‚Äôs in the park because the website does that far better but suffice to say our grandchildren, our son and daughter and son-in-law loved the experience. We went on most of the rides which were busy (Saturday in the middle of school holidays) but not too bad and had a whale of a time. We loved the fact that smoking is banned and that the other guests were largely Scandinavian so everyone just got on with having a good time-not always the case in other countries. Safety and queue management seemed to be very well done without the awful Elf and Safety overkill you get in some places. We felt safe both on and off the rides. We got almost all the rides done without Q Bot so probably not worth the extra outlay and as a little tip, we ended the day with a trip up the big pole viewing ride which was relaxing and allowed us to remember all the rides we‚Äôd been on as they were laid out beneath us. All in all a memorable visit.

Denmark,Susanne S,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"We had a good time at Legoland, both children, parents and grandparents. Some annoyance at the fact that the queue times given at the start of the queue were not correct. I timed the queue for the Laser maze. The expected wait time was given at 10min at the start of the queue. The real waiting time was 30min. This was the worst, but some other attractions also had longer real waiting times than promised ones. The algorithms for the measure the system need to be improved.
One good thing in the queues was the addition of a Lego build area, where the children could build lego while waiting.
I found the signposting to be not very good. We walked in the wrong direction several times. I think that signposts should be available at every crossing.
The choice of eateries were good, from sit down restaurants to quick eateries. One major disappointment for the grandparents though : we did not find a single place offering Danish pastries, nor did we find any red p√∏lse (sausage).
The choice of Lego wares in the shops were good, although I did not get the impression that it was significantly less in price than in any ordinary shop. I would expect outlet prices for Lego at Legoland. Especially at Billund.

Denmark,Brian L,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"I would classify this definitely as an amusement park with a Lego theme.. having said that, literally everything IS Lego, but with all the rides, roller coasters, and water rides, a bit of the Lego is lost. I don't mean to digress; almost everything is definitely made of Lego, but this is definitely a theme park. I had the privilege of having come here back in the late 80's. My oh my how things have changed.

My friend and I came here early-ish and tried to do all we could. We probably did about 80% of the things the park had to offer, skipping a couple things here and there that we could do without. Most of the rides are not ""scary"" roller coaster, but some are definitely fast and jolting and thrilling. BUT.. the rides are so short! They only last about one minute or so.

I've been a Lego geek since I was a kid. I'm 37 now, and I still love to see Lego stuff. The mini Legoland near the front of the park is always the highlight for me. So cool to see a (scale?) replica of famous streets and towns in Europe. There are also functioning bits, some of which you get to operate and some which simply continue on a loop (i.e. ships sailing around the canals or trucks moving on the roads) It is so cool!

If you really love Lego, you might want to spread your time here into two days. We saw a lot and did a lot, but we also got a bit lucky with short queues. Conveniently, there is a ""estimate"" displayed at the end of each line so you know whether you want to wait or not. I think there is a two-day pass, so if you want to do everything in the park.. definitely spread it over two days.

Denmark,scrapheapchallenge,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"We had a great time, obviously it was busy as it was the middle of July, so restaurants were packed, best to get your lunch early or take a packed lunch. We chose the pizza/Italian place and the portions were well made, tasty, generous and filling.

Billund legoland is far superior to our local Windsor version (Windsor is tired, worn out & not very accessible). Billund on the other hand is very accessible, I used my powerchair but even with a manual chair it would be easy to navigate as it‚Äôs mostly flat.

There are accessible bathrooms around the place (not changing spaces ones so no platform to change adult/large child but still good for wheelchair access and transfer across to toilet) BUT unfortunately even when these are NOT marked as baby change places, we still found them often occupied by abled people changing kids despite the regular bathrooms having baby change facilities. (They just couldn‚Äôt be bothered to wait, so inconvenienced disabled people). It would be helpful if legoland could mark the doors to remind parents not to use them to change kids, but to use their own facilities for this purpose and kindly consider that disabled people may need the accessibile bathroom more urgently.

Overall the quality of the place is good, far better than Windsor. The exhibits are more fresh or maintained rather than old and faded, and we enjoyed ourselves very much.

HOWEVER: the next day we ALSO visited the nearby Lego house. Each venue definitely requires a whole day each, do NOT try to do both on the same day! If you only have the time to visit one, I recommend Lego HOUSE as the more fun, interactive experience that kids and adults will enjoy. Lego house has more opportunities to play hands-on with Lego, plus it‚Äôs all indoors, so better if the weather is bad. If you prefer fun rides then Lego LAND is better, for interactive experiences and fun Lego building, Lego HOUSE is better.

Pros:
- A wide set of rides for kids age 7+ to enjoy.
- The haunted house and polar-X rollercoaster was really fun.
- Make your own mini figure wall was fun but crowded

Cons:
- If you exit the park and want to re-enter during the same day you have to get a stamp on your wrist, you can't just use the ticket again. And there's no staff informing you and not clear enough signs for this when you exit.
- The app charged me twice for tickets and didn't provide an email receipt on either purchase. (Customer service did fix and refund.)
- You can prepay for parking in the app, but there's no guaranteed parking space.
- There is a fastpass option called Q-bot, but you have to pay for it.
- The number of rides you can bring small children (0-3 yrs) on is somewhat limited.
- When riding on the mini boats your boat can get stuck, and the staff rarely helps you. The entire ride just gets stuck and piled up instead...
- The main shop is too small, and closes an hour after the rides, making it super crowded and impossible to visit. Plan any lego shopping for mid day!

Would highly recommend going straight to the back when you first walk in of you want to hit the rides. We hit 3 of the main rides in less than 40mins and then the longest wait we had was 45mins for the newest ride, the Flying Eagle. The rides were fun, they won't be setting any records as for heights or speed but that didn't matter. They had several interactive rides where you got to play a game, which was different than normal amusement park rides. Food was good, we bought the ticket that included a lunch buffet which worked out good so the only other thing we bought was water, but come to find out you can bring that in yourself if you wanted to.

Denmark,Nicolai W,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Celebrating its 50 years anniversary in 2018, Legoland is a must-see attraction for LEGO-fans of all ages. It is a big theme park based on the popular bricks with plenty of amusements for the entire family - from boats and train rides for smaller kids to state-of-the-art rollercoasters for the tweens and teens.

The park is well organised, well kept and with plenty of opportunities to eat and drink. But in the school holidays in can be quite crowded. So plan your trip and book your tickets in advance. Booking +2 days will earn you a discount.

Download the parks app. It will help you see queuing times for all amusements - and if the waiting time is long, consider spending money on the Q-Bot - a device that will hold your place in the que, so that you don't have to stand there waiting. But notice that the Q-Bot is only for the bigger amusements. If you are going for the amusements for smaller kids, there is no alternative to standing in line.

If your kids wants to take the Legoland drivers license in the driving school (for kids between 7 and 13), go there as the first thing you do in the park and sign up for a time slot. Note that though the park is open until 20.00, most people leave around 18.00 - so you can get a lot of the bigger rides with no waiting at the end of the day.

Be aware that Legoland can be an expensive outing for the family. Some of the attractions (fx Driving School, Goldmining) will cost you extra, and food and beverages in the parks restaurants is generally on the expensive side. The Lego Shop doesn't offer any discounts, so don't count on making a bargain.

If you want to save, the park has a couple of nice picnic areas, where you can enjoy your own lunch pack. And if possible, bring your own stroller for smaller kids. The park charges 50 DKK for renting you one.

But don't let waiting time and prices discourage you. The park is well worth a visit.

Denmark,SKP70,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"There are many amusement parks, and there are other Legolands too, which may be bigger and newer, but this is the original Legoland. Nothing can change that.
The day we visited, Legoland Billund was celebrating its 50th birthday. Clearly, the park is old but they have refurbished many parts so that it does not look dated.
It is amazing that this park lead to construction of an airport in Billund - a small place of a few thousands of inhabitants. So, Lego and Legoland are central to Billund.
The park itself has a variety of things to do. There are shows, the miniatures of famous buildings, penguins (bred at Legoland Billund), roller-coasters, gentler rides, games, rides in which you end up drenched with water....basically all that you expect in a theme park and if you are a Lego aficionado your bucket list will stand shortened.
We stayed two nights at the holiday village and got park-entry for two days. Perhaps, one day would not be long enough to do all that we wanted to. Over the two days we did it all at our pace.
I felt that it was a bit expensive but then everything in Denmark is.
Also, I have seen better shows, been on better roller-coasters but then this is the real Lego deal - you cannot have it anywhere else.

Denmark,B7608VEmichael,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,Truely Enjoyed our 4 hour visit to LEGO Land in Billund. All staff extremely service minded and friendly many of whom showed a genuine interest and ability to engage at kids level. Extremely well maintained park and facilities. Food quality and price levels however was disappointing. Had our car parked at P2 big sign parking automat but when we wanted to pay for the parking there was no parking automatic at P2.. so Long walk back again to main entrance to pay.. ... Irrespective a great experience and the park is highly recommended for sure.,Jul 2018
Denmark,Andreas Isengaard,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"LEGOLAND is a place that all kids dream of at some point during their age.

Don‚Äôt wait too long because then it will be dull, don‚Äôt go too soon because it‚Äôs height limit of the rides. Our son was 115cm at the time which was perfect and he could everything except 1 thing.

U only pay entrance fee and then can use all the rides which makes it very affordable. Make sure u tag the children in case they get lost because it can be very crowded, and a tired child can easily get lost and confused. Denmark can also be very cold and windy so bring extra clothes.

Go there early (around 9 in the morning) and go during the weekend because then it‚Äôs less crowded.

U can get here by plane, BUT going here be car means u can buy a lot of fairly cheap Lego stuff at a reasonable cost and also rare items that is not being sold in other countries.

Denmark,samiprintamaki,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"What to say, it is Legoland. Enough to see for two days. The kids better be over 120cm though so they can access all the rides. The best rides will have long queues so it may be beneficial to buy the pass that allows you to VIP entrance.",Jul 2018
Denmark,michal t,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"0. Legoland is nowhere near Copenhagen! For some reason we thought it was and booked plane to Copenhagen Airport to find Legoland is 260km away to the east. Out mistake for not checking.
1. Billund
Don‚Äôt be mistaken, entire town sole purpose is to offer services around legoland. Don‚Äôt expect any other entertainment other than legoland, lego house or lalandia (waterpark). If you expect more that you wont find it. You go to Billund for legoland, period.
2. Qbot - we visited Legoland on one of Sundays during July. Can‚Äôt say if it was busy or not for us it wasn‚Äôt. We purchased qbot- gold option. Our maximum waiting time was 10 minutes but only in one case, rest of rides we could get on to within minute or two. If you are with small impatient kids like ours don‚Äôt hesitate. You will save 2,3 hours out of your visit. You basically will get small tamagotchi like device which you book your ride on, when your spot is due you will get message on it and you can go to a ride using qbot dedicated queue. There is 12 rides (out of 20?) that you can use qbot on. If i was going to legoland again, qbot no doubt. However 90% people or more didnt have one.
3. Legoland - brilliant with qbot, very good rides for small and bigger kids and adults however most of them are very short ( in some cases you were glad they were ). Our favorites were Ice Pilot and Viking River which we visited 3 times each. Kids were delighted and there was something on each corner. 8 hours spent there were great, exceeded our expectations about place. Staff was brilliant, helpful and smiling and chatting all the time.
4. Prices - Denmark is expensive already, Legoland is no different. Food is expensive, additional services also. Be prepared to spend extra 150‚Ç¨ or more on pictures, snacks, toys etc.
5. Food - plenty of places within park to get all kind of foods. Prices at smaller booths ok, restaurants which i think all of them are all you can eat are charging > 200 dkk per person with some discounts on children. We ate at one of places at the entrance and food was fresh, tasty and with plenty if choice. Nice addition was room filled up with lego blocks so kids could play as you ate in peace.
Overall it was great experience. Kids will remember this trip for a long time.

Denmark,Jesper L,LEGOLAND Billund,2.0,"Visited Legoland July 2018. A nice sunny and warm day. Many people. Nice atmosphere. Quite clean. And it should be. With the astronomic entrance prices. Dkk 795,- (incl a 33% discount for booking online) two adults and a teen - And furthermore: Legoland charge you 50,- for using a worn out parking lot. Why 50,- ? Why any charge at all? It seems too greedy!
I will recommend that you, if you can, to park somewhere around Billund. It‚Äôs a small town, so the walk to the park is not far from wherever you park. And it‚Äôs safe as well.

Furthermore the service in various shops is way to slow!
It seems like the (much too young staff/crew) doesn‚Äôt care at all.

Legoland should be all about Legoland. Right?
And a tivoli should be a tivoli?
Legoland is sadly slowly transforming itself into a tivoli with these hideous teddy bear t√≥mbolas. It‚Äôs ruining the spirit. But again: it‚Äôs money. Nothing wrong with earning money. But...

Just reconsider the LEGOland concept. (?)

One day Legoland will suddenly turn into a cheap looking plasticpink mishmash of oversugered candy floss discount tivoli.
That would be a real shame.

Also because it‚Äôs not cheap at all...

Some might say: ‚Äò well just stay away then..‚Äô

Sad, but yes. Because I (use to) like LEGOland. So Actually that could be the end of it..

A great day for the family.",Jul 2018
Denmark,netsriks,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Book online at least 2 days before for cheaper tickets!!! This was my second trip to Legoland, first with kids in tow. Is MUCH larger now although a lot of the same Lego constructions & they are starting to fade/show their age. In saying this my 4 year old loved everything all day & this isn‚Äôt something that you get kids would notice. We arrived at opening & the ride lines weren‚Äôt too bad. Would definitely recommend staring at the rides that are at the back of the park as the lines were quite long for these later in the day. We didn‚Äôt bring food in but saw a lot of families who did. Looked like you were allowed to bring in eskies & there were heaps of picnic tables & areas to sit. I would do this if we go again as the lines were long, food was not that great & quite expensive. If it‚Äôs cold avoid the pirate ship ride as you get super wet!! 10 seconds into the ride it was evident why there was no que up for this ride!! There is a drying ‚Äòbooth‚Äô you can use for 20 kroner.
If there is a long line for Lloyds laser maze don‚Äôt waste your time in that line as you are literally only in the maze for 30 seconds before it turns off. Not worth waiting for.
Parking is 50 kroner for the day.
This was the Highlight of the trip for our Lego mad 4 year old & will have the kids super excited but be ready to spend some $$$$ for sure.

Splashed out a bit for the Legoland camping village which included legoland tickets for two days. We have been to Legoland Windsor a few years ago when kds were younger, and it was basic enough, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything different from this Legoland. I was blown away. From the moment we arrived on the campsite we were entertained. The park itself was brilliant. Lots of thrilling rides (a bit of queueing here and there) amazing displays from all walks of life. Kept us going and very happy for days. We visit theme parks everywhere we go, and have voted this one the best theme park in the world. We will definitely return when we get a cheap flight.

Denmark,hki_traveller,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"This was my first trip to Legoland with my 6-year-old child. We opted for a two-day ticket which was a good choice since the area is huge and full of things to see and do.

Although there is a great variety of different rides to be explored, our favorite proved to be Miniland, the village of miniatures at the heart of Legoland. I loved the great detail of the builds and the 6-year-old was fascinated with watching the trucks, boats and trains move around the Miniland.

As for the rides, I appreciated that the queueing times were clearly displayed next to the ride entrance. You can also check waiting times in the Legoland Billund app which I recommend downloading.

The only disappointing part of the trip was the food offering in the restaurants which was not up to par with the rest of our experience. On the first day, we ate at the Italian Pizza & Pasta next to the main square. I ordered a salmon pasta and a children's pizza. The pasta was an overcooked mushy mess with hardly any salmon in it. Pizza was ok but nothing special. The food was heavily overpriced for it's poor quality.

On the second day, I opted for the classic Danish hot dog from the Hot Dog Company and coffee which was fine. I'd recommend bringing your own picnic lunch like many of the visitors seemed to do.

Nevertheless, Legoland is a great place for Lego fans of all ages. The low quality of food drops the rating from excellent to very good.

We were lucky that we had lovely weather while we were in Legoland and we thoroughly enjoyed our day. Our kids are 15,12 and 10 and there were lots of rides for them to go on. We went on all the rollercoasters etc and it was great fun. We didn't eat dinner in the park but we did have ice-cream from the Ben 'n Jerry's stand and it was fab.

Denmark,crazysquares,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"As someone of a certain age when play meant making and breaking physical stuff (not messing with computers) Lego was king. (OK let's not forget Meccano too).

How many implausable towers were built not to mention other weird and wonderful things with what a basic set looked like in the 1960's.

So it was inevitable that some day I must make the pilgrimage to Billund.

The pilgrimage was not remotely disappointing. The part of the park with all the small buildings and representation of locations and structures from round the world was fantastic.

Windmills, oilrigs, trains, boats, skyscrapers, and of course spaceships, since that was the big thing back in the 60s. Everything I imagined as a wee lad there in all its glory and more.

If you ever owned a few bricks, you have to come to LEGOland Central where it all makes sense, and I suppose you see where you went right and wrong with your epic constructions all those years ago.

Oh and it was an additional bonus that it was the Billund Park's 50th Anniversary this year, 2018.

If nothing else, the sculptures of buildings and the many animals made Legoland stunning! They had built replicas of places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen and other towns and cities as well. My favourite was the Nyhavn replica!

Denmark,Erik L,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"To be honest I did not expect to be even mildly amused by this visit... I mean how exciting can it be to look at LEGOs, no matter how they are presented?
As it turns out it is unbelievable. The mind has a hard time grasping the amount of work and planning that must have gone into the design and construction of the extraordinarily intricate scale models of cities, building, vehicles and landscapes.
Many of the displays are of culturally significant sites or buildings with informative and educational signs explaining the facts related to the displays.
The area is loosely divided into many different genres such Wild West, Medieval Castle, Wildlife Safari etc which also have exciting rides. Now, if you are a hard core ride junkie forever looking for the most extreme experience you need to bear in mind that Legoland is geared towards the younger folk.
I love fast and scary rides, but did actually really enjoy these rides because there is more to them than just the ride. Most are informative and entertaining as well.
There is a lot to see and to do and my only disappointment was that amongst the dozens of restaurants and food outlets we did not see one offering vegan food, so if that affects you, take your lunch with you.
We found that we were hard pushed to get through the facility in one day, an exhausting but enjoyable day.
The park is within walking distance from Billund airport or you can catch a train to Vejle and then bus 143 to Legoland for about 62 local money per person each way, you need to pay the bus driver with cash.

Denmark,MphsQueen,LEGOLAND Billund,4.0,"Expensive but we had a great time!

1 year old could go on a few rides but mainly excluded due to being unable to climb / walk on any potential escape routes on his own. This included many rides in duplo land, which are supposed to be for small children.

4 year old loved being able to do rides on his own (made him feel grown up). He really loved panning for gold, and the way they ‚Äúconvert the fools gold into a gold medal‚Äù in brilliant. My wee boy really thinks it‚Äôs been melted and pressed into his precious medal he proudly wears on his neck. It‚Äôs a must do!! There‚Äôs a separate fee but cheaper if you buy gold coin online in advance.

We got stuck on the legotop ride at the top. Worker says it happens once a month, which is a bit worrying. Was anxious as we were wenched down. They gave us a voucher good for a free soft drink or soft ice cream as compensation, but nowhere was open that could take it (snack vendors only). Maybe in the summer these places are open but it was a bit frustrating trying to redeem. We never did get our free ice cream!!

Denmark,BenJosefB,LEGOLAND Billund,5.0,"Lego is fantastic, and to see with how much detail the did the many many attractions, figures, mini-worlds, etc. is amazing. A family must-visit attraction.

Anyway: it was expensive, even with a 50% offer from Kellogs. But worth having a go depending when you are visiting.
Take your food, pick nick is recommended.
Consider the size of your kids and the size requirements of the different attractions. 100 cm is the minimum for many things.
Take extra clothes or good rain cover, as there are some rides were you will get wet. (e.g. pirate bay).
We spent 8 hours in the park and still could not do everything.

I think we were lucky in terms of crowdedness: because although it seemed like we often skipped 70 % of the possible arrangements for directing a queue, we still had to wait 20 min for some of the attractions. But most of the other attractions had around 5 minutes to wait for. But I would not be there if all parking area is covered, and food places are not just 70 % open.
If the park is full, the Q-BOT (a system to schedule your attraction and skip the lines) seems to be a must.

I loved the show at the castle.
The polar explorer rollercoaster ride had a real suprise!
The lego brick areas in the queue are a very nice idea that other amusement parks should copy.
And the Lego Movie was great as well, never seen 3D effects implemented so effectfully before.

would I do it again: most likely not for this price. Once is fine.

Denmark,Anna T,LEGO House,1.0,"Even though the place has english all around, the staff are quite unhelpful. And even the ones who can, speak english with a very heavy accent that hard to understand. We tried to ask one of the staff about lego house and we were passed around. Some even turn away the moment we say we dont understand danish. If you want to attract more people especially internationals, please do as all a favour and hire someone who can actually and happy to speak english. It was so awkward! Will never go there again. Such a waste of money.",Apr 2021
Denmark,Simon-DNK,LEGO House,5.0,"After having been to Legoland for one day (which was generally a sad experience - see my review) the visit to Legohouse blew us away üòÉ- We spent an entire day there.
Did only a few of the experiences, because we had so much fun with each of them, had lunch at MiniChef (something that I would recommend - see review), and was finally kicked out when they closed at 1700, just as we had found out that there was a historical area and a movie theater as well.

Explaining what LegoHouse is all about will take too long (go to their homepage), let me just shorten it down by saying that, if you are into Lego it is an amazing experience ü§©for the whole family and one day is not enough. We will definitely return as a family for many more hours of true Lego Experience and to continue our exploration of LegoHouse.

Denmark,lonewolf44,LEGO House,4.0,This is an extraordinary building. It looks like lots of stacked lego bricks (actually it's thousands of white ceramic tiles clipped to a steel frame) and it's full of lego and lego-related artefacts. The cafe is really good too and an elevator takes you up to the roof terraces with lego sharks and dinosaurs and a terrifying perspex roof that looks down in to the atrium below ( I'm too much of a coward to try that).,Aug 2020

The kids were kids were so excited, they couldn‚Äôt take it in at first. The whole place is really friendly and supremely well organised. For me it was much better than Legoland and has much more of the creative spirit that you expect from Lego.

Denmark,Banz92,LEGO House,5.0,"You cannot come to Billund or Legoland and not visit Lego house. Personally I prefer Lego house to Legoland. The place was made to get your creative juices flowing and expand your mind to see so many possibilities. It‚Äôs for all ages and the amount of fun you have is a function of your imagination. It‚Äôs a spacious building with different zones, so it was not crowded and there were people to help if you needed it.
The mini-Chef restaurant is an experience on its own if you‚Äôre willing to pay the price. Otherwise, there are places to enjoy your own meal inside and outside....if you remember to eat.
It is important you get your ticket to the experience zones ahead of time. We came during the school holidays and thankfully we had bought our tickets early because tickets were sold out for the next 4 days after our scheduled visit.

Denmark,Runevester,LEGO House,4.0,"If you aren‚Äôt a fan of the product the place may come as a disappointment as it isn‚Äôt a regular amusement park. As the name indicates most of the activities are indoor making it ideal for a rainy day. The architecture is spectacular and dominated by a huge LEGO tree rising three floors. There are some pretty neat models to look at but the concept is very much based on interaction with bricks in various play areas. These are good but there could be a few more variants. We especially liked the one where you make stopmotion films. The exhibition of old models were a bit disappointing as I hoped that they had more from the real archive vault. The staff are friendly and helpful. Tip: visit the mini chef restaurant where the dining experience is quite unique.

Denmark,Joyman L,LEGO House,5.0,"Allocate at least 5-6 hours as you will need it. We visited the LEGO House, located in central Billund, in the afternoon upon landing in Billund. We purchased our tickets online to save time (although at that time there wasn't any queue at the kiosks). Upon scanning the ticket barcode, each ticket gets a wristband with a unique code which stores all the information that you save playing in the LEGO house which you can retrieve/view later with an app.

The house is divided into 4 zones with each zone engaging the audience to think differently with LEGO bricks. Thouroughly enjoyed zone and there was plenty of bricks and areas for many people to play. The only queuing activity required were the movie-making booths and arctic explorer robot-programming (highly recommend trying this!).

Also a unique experience when dining in the LEGO resturant, as you built your dish and get served based on the bricks that you built and scan. Be mindful that the restaurant has operating times different to that of the house.

Big shop on the ground floor with several exclusive sets, mosaic station and the usual pick-a-brick and minifigure station.

The external is open without a ticket access and there were stairs going all the way to the top for a nice view of surrounding Billund.

Different sections had a different theme and it was fun seeing my kids having a blast with the legos. We ate at the restaurant and it was cool that we ordered using legos and the food came on a conveyor belt to two robots which is where you pick up your food. There was more food than we could eat but it was definitely over priced in my opinion. For 2 adults and 2 kids meals plus drinks we paid nearly $100 (USD).",Dec 2019

We spent 3-4 hours having fun and both my 8 year old son and my 4 year old daughter had things to do and loved it.

Denmark,Pabi_8,LEGO House,5.0,"This is the most interactive experience I've had in a theme park. From the minute you step in your automatic bracelet will allow you interact and enjoy your own Lego creations.

Dive into a pool of Duplo, create your own character and see if displayed in the front cover of a magazine, and create your own fish and see it swim away in a giant aquarium for everyone to enjoy.

LEGO house has created an experience for the whole family, young and old. Everything has been thought of and no detail escapes from LEGO house. Marvel at the giant exhibits of dinosaurs, put the giant tree or become one of Santa's little helpers at Christmas.

We ate at the restaurant, where everything is fully automated. We created your own meal using bricks and had it delivered by a robot. We waited 40 mins to be seated, but went the shop until the buzzer told us it was time.

We left with freshly-made lego samples that had just been name by a machine that shows how they are made and packaged.

We had 2 kids with us - ages 11 and 13 - and were thoroughly entertained from 10-16:00 (opening hours for the day). It was very interactive, with a wristband the whole time that captured what you created and did. Then, as we left, we were given our Lego ""DNA"" that could help us when we got home to see all of our creations. The prices were a little high, but you definitely got your money's worth.

The history was fascinating in itself but the areas to create things were really special, unfortunately my final creations were not suitable for publication butcas lot of fun.

Denmark,Travelfarandforever,LEGO House,5.0,"We have 2 huge lego fans in our house so had to make the trip here! Honestly, I thought the entrance fee was a little excessive before we visited...however I now wish we had bought the annual pass and visited 2 or 3 days. Every single member of staff we met was super helpful, my little one had a couple of interactions with a man named Kim, who was so lovely. It really makes all the difference.
We visited over Halloween and absolutely loved all the theming and extra activities.
We arrived for opening time and stayed until closing at 4pm. Spent most of our day building lego and the kids think it was the best day ever! We still missed half a zone and had to rush some parts though as we took so long playing. I do feel they could open a little later and wish we'd booked tickets for the Saturday when they shut at 7pm.
The main square at the bottom of the building is open to the public, so you could eat at the mini chef restaurant another day, if you want to extend the lego magic. We also spent a couple of extra hours sitting in the coffee shop whilst the children played with the halloween bricks in the main square the day after as the weather was bad. The children also explored the playgrounds on the roofs, something else you can do on a day without tickets.
We really had the best day, we had previously watched the documentary of them building the lego house, and my little one couldn't believe his eyes when he saw Stuart wandering around too. We loved all the little details, so much to see and do. I genuinely do not understand how you could visit with young children and not easily spend the whole day here.
Don't miss the basement, we wish we had longer to really take it all in, was fascinating for a lego fan! Totally worth the trip!

You learn so much about Lego, as well as get to play with it in a multitude of ways.
As someone who grew up with Lego, I found this experience to bring on an element of nostalgia but also realise that this is a toy for all ages, and that the creativity of Lego allows some amazing designs.
Each section was based on an ability to create your own creation. You can also download an app on your phone; you get given a wrist band to scan your way through the journey in the house, and photograph yourself and your creations you‚Äôve made which makes the whole experience funny and memorable.

Lots of Duplo areas as well as Lego. Great for our toddler, probably even better for older children. So much to do, loads of interactive things. Ideal for my husband and my toddler!

Nice cosy atmosphere and the welcome and kindness you get from each and every employee clearly enjoying their job. Many activities all revolving around ""the brick"" where adults as well as children can get lost in hours of playful concentration moving from one area to the next and feeling at the end of the day that you'd want more. Modern technology has been beautifully integrated with all the various activities stations enriching the experience without taking the focus away but in fact complementing the joy of playing with the bricks. The clean and well designed building help moving around in a safe and rational architecture where there is no worry for you to let your children roaming around unattended. I wish I'd live closer and could go more often to get a holiday for the mind. Legoland should really learn a thing or two from this place.

The experiences allows you to relive your visit long after you‚Äôve left which just extends the enjoyment (not telling you how).

There‚Äôs something there for all ages and that‚Äôs one of the great things about LEGO is that it transcends all ages and tastes providing enjoyment and entertainment at all levels.

To visit, it‚Äôs best to stay nearby overnight, it‚Äôs about 4 hours from Copenhagen on train/bus/car. If you‚Äôre flying in/out of Billund a day visit might be possible, if not exhausting.

Denmark,Sem,LEGO House,5.0,"The best place for any Lego fan! There is so much to see and do it is difficult to decide where to begin. Be prepared to spend some very interactive, creative and playful hours here. Very child friendly, although I don't recommend going with only a baby if you want to enjoy it as much as possible. The reason I mention this is because we went with our (almost) 1 year old. We had a lot of fun, but as you need to take turns taking care of the baby (which is normal) that takes away some of the experience and you really have to choose what you want to do. There are good facilities however, like a diaper-changing room that has chairs for breastfeeding and microwave ovens. Even if you are less of a builder and more of a collector, you will enjoy the vault in the basement with Lego sets from nearly every decade since the beginning and the top floor with custom models on display. The restaurant was nice, the food was ok but portions a bit small. In any case, most people don't go for the food but for the experience: ordering the food with Lego pieces is really cool and having them delivered by a robot chef only makes it cooler. I recommend taking a kids menu if you want the exclusive Lego House cook figurine. And I love the way they set up the app, makes it easier to discover the house. Also, by scanning your wristband on specific stands, you can take pictures of you and your builds, collect some Lego memories and then download them afterwards.

We loved the fish that you made then scanned in and it would 'swim' off in the tank. The robotic Antarctic ice game was fun, making a movie was good and my particular favourite was the city building activity where your skyscraper would light up a square when put down on a board and become part of a city with Lego people hurrying around. It was magical. Nice touch to take photos on the way round using your wristband, we enjoyed downloading our personal videos when we got home. Downstairs in the basement is a cinema showing interviews with Lego designers and a history of lego museum which was great for reminiscing.

Denmark,WelshyK,LEGO House,5.0,"Where to start?? A magical visit, so good that we went twice!
Lego House is still owned and run by Lego, as opposed to the Merlin-owned themepark Legoland just up the road, and it‚Äôs all indoors apart from the playgrounds.
It‚Äôs easily walkable from Legoland and Legoland Hotel, and maybe Lalandia.

If you want to get hands on with Lego, see incredible Lego creations, play with Lego, design Lego, code Lego, race Lego, film Lego, play in Lego, discover old Lego again, and much more then this is the place for you.

The fantastic architectural building is full of different areas to explore, play and build in.

If you want to (for free), you can even climb up the outside of the building to play in the 4 or 5 playgrounds and go and stand on the roof before you go inside!

We were lucky to go off season so I‚Äôm not sure how busy it can get but I believe they do timed visits to keep the numbers down.

Each area has a different theme and on your way round you can use your wristband to snap selfies and scan your creations...don‚Äôt forget to keep your wristband and receipt and you can download all your photos and a personalised video when you get home!

The whole theme is fun, and if you‚Äôre not a massive Lego fan, you probably will be by the time you come out!

Parking is just round the corner, as is a lovely bakery, but if you can, have a meal in the MiniChef family restaurant. I guarantee you‚Äôll never forget it!

We ate in the main restaurant after, be sure to get a table early, as there is a Q system operating so we had an hours wait, while the food was fine, could have been warmer, the actual experience was brilliant, I won't give it away, but it involves more Lego.
To summarise, you can't call yourself a Lego fan if you don't want to go here.

Denmark,Phillip L,LEGO House,5.0,"We travelled from Edinburgh to Billund to visit the Lego House. We'd seen the Netflix documentary and our expectations were high. We are also VERY hard to please. The Lego House didn't disappoint. Architecturally brilliant, creatively crafted experiences, plenty of space to explore for ourselves, great Lego creations and plenty of play. Our youngest daughter said the day was as good as Christmas. It was great for all of us: 46, 43, 13 and 11. The only thing that didn't surpass our expectations was the food in the restaurant - great concept and theatre but the food wasn't good value - we ate a lot of expensive but high quality food and this wasn't it sadly. BUT, aside from this IT IS BRILLIANT. GO.

Denmark,L0veT0Tr4vel,LEGO House,5.0,"Hubby is a Lego fan from way back and we decided to co-ordinate a visit to Lego House as part of our 5 weeks around Holland, Germany and Denmark. So glad we did ! It was a great place for kids - so much interactive stuff that a family with children could stay for hours - but still so much to see/do for us older kids at heart ! We are in our 50's and took Mum (75) and still had a great time. There is a wonderful vault downstairs with the history of Lego and cabinets full of the old original Lego that we remember and loved. There were sets that our children had too in the 1980's/1990's as well as Duplo and other special sets (Fabuland etc) right up to the recent releases. Lego is definitely timeless and ageless.
The displays were incredible - the sort of thing you see on Lego Masters and not the kind of build your average Lego fan would be able to build, millions of blocks were used.
I can highly recommend a visit regardless of age. If you are taking children plan for more than 3 hours but if it is just adults then 2 - 3 hours should be enough. Our rental car nav system found the way OK (it was a bit out of the way) and there is paid parking nearby so it was easy to get in and out.
Just watch when you are buying tickets online as we almost ended up at Legoland which is a whole different place/thing ! You need to book online to get the day/time you want and they do sell out - so plan ahead.

Being a Lego fan I have always wanted to go to Legoland and my boys surprised me with tickets to go to Billund. Legoland was nice but I am now sorry I did not start with Lego House. Soooo much better!!! Don't miss it and go with plenty of time. You won't regret it,Sep 2019
Denmark,Ricce55,LEGO House,5.0,"This house encourage your innovation, creative mind.

Don‚Äôt forget lunch, where you order food by playing with Lego!",Sep 2019
Denmark,Altug,LEGO House,5.0,"If you visit Legoland, you must visit also Lego House as well. It is the cherry on the cake. First thing is you should not take care of weather because it is indoor. They are very well organized and they thought every single detail for your kids and your comfortable. I really impressed that. We spent there one day but I can say it was not enough. So, if you have a chance, plan for two days. It was really great. A lot of Lego figures builded by may be millions of Lego part there. Beside that, very interesting activities available there for your kids and even for you. It is not just some Lego parts there and you make some Lego. It is more than that and really nice activities available. They use hi-tech in the building and you will bring your memories with you in your mobile app. I like that. People really helpful and everything and all our day was perfect. When I compare Legoland and Lego House, it is actually totally different. First thing, Legoland is mainly outdoor and attractions there similar like Disneyland, Gardaland, Fantasialand and similar. Roller coasters, trains and etc.. Actually you can find similar activities in different countries. But Lego House is totally different and unique. If you or your kids more enjoy with Lego parts, this is the place you can go. So, I personally like Lego House a little more than Legoland but when I ask my kids, they said both. Was that political answer, who knows üòÄ summary, if you ask me to go there again, I would say definitely again and again.

Every step provides you with more and more surprises, whether it‚Äôs fantastic activities to complete or amazing models to behold.
Each zone has an exciting theme and we thoroughly enjoyed the way that Lego has blended its traditional building concepts with technology - you can build a fish and send it to a virtual aquarium using a scanner, you can create micro buildings for a miniature simulated city and use simple coding to control robotic vehicles.
Staff were so helpful and friendly, the House was immaculate. Loved the little touch of the 6 red brick gifts and unique code, typical Lego!
We had booked a day in the Lego house but decided we wanted more time to play - We took advantage of a great next-day-return deal. We had a second fun filled day and have vowed to return in the future.

The museum in the basement is amazing. So many things to learn for the history of LEGO and the creator Oli Kristiansen.

Denmark,Christine X,LEGO House,5.0,"Everyone who runs a child focussed activity centre or museum should come here and see how it‚Äôs done. This is probably the best place we‚Äôve ever visited. It has activities for children and grownups (and the museum is awesome for looking up the sets you used to play with as a child). There are loads of fantastic activities that show the versatility of Lego, from creating a stop motion animation to directing Lego robots, and lots and lots of building opportunities where the only limitation is your imagination.

The family restaurant (I forgot the name) is a spectacular theatre and I‚Äôll forgive the long wait and pretty flavourless food for the fun in building your order and seeing it arrive. Definitely worth the hefty price tag.

As with all things Lego, the day ended in the shop, which has some special edition sets as well as big sets that make me want to start building Lego again.

Legoland and Lalandia are good, but the Lego House is what makes a visit to Billund really worth while.

Denmark,Chris M,LEGO House,5.0,"This building is a kids Mecca. The whole place is LEGO, however it is cleverly themed into different zones. These zones are good in that they give you a challenge but highly broad so that you aren't stifled.
Eg. Make a fish, that can then be animated into a computerised fish.
Or.
Make a stop/start Lego movie.

If all else fails there is are bins of Lego everywhere to let your mind run riot. At the bottom of the house is a museum of the history of Lego which is fascinating and for parents definitely a trip down memory lane!

In short well thought-out experience that results in effortless family fun.

Top tip. The roof of the whole house is a FREE play area so if you are in the area worth visiting just to explore the roof. Don't waste your house visit time though as there is more than enough in the house.

You can build structures w/Legos on top of digital tables that react to the building blocks. There is also the amazing tree of life at the center of the bouse, and in the basement a bit of history about Lego. If you find yourself in Billund, this is can't pass on the opportunity to visit the Lego House. The main restaurant has two robots, a very nice attraction to see how they interact with customers.

You get wristbands with a chip in them which you can use for the lockers and use for taking pictures and capturing Lego builds throughout the house, which you can then download easily from the app.
We were very impressed with the building and explored every part of it inside and out. We particularly loved the tree in the centre of the house, the huge dinosaur models and the Lego 'waterfall' was very impressive. We spent all day there and ate at the little caf√© which served good paninis (also sandwiches, salads and good choice of drinks). We had planned to eat in the main restaurant as that looked fun but didn't really like the menu choices (very little vegetarian choice). There are a few activities that appealed to younger children more but there was still plenty for us to do.

The place is devided into different zones with thousands and thousands of bricks for you to build your small masterpieces.
20 euros entry fee per person when ordering online. Absolutely worth it. If you go in summer, book in advance. It might get sold out. Visited this July, and the place got sold out. But there was still plenty of room. Not really crowded. Enjoyed a day from 9 to 19, building lego with the kids.
Make sure you visit the resturant. Food ordered by putting together different lego bricks, which represented different food. Food delivered by two robots. Really fun for the kids (and yeah.... also for the adults).
A big lego store available also without paying the entry fee. Like in legoland, this is probably the most expencive place to buy the lego sets, but they have som hard to get items making it worth while.

If you're staying in the Billund area, you might want to come back to the house a second day to fully appreciate the outside of the house. If you have young kids and it's a nice day, you could spend a few hours quite happily letting them play on the multitude of play equipment while you enjoy the sun! You don't have to pay to access the outside areas. I would also recommend eating at the Mini Chef restaurant, it's a really fun experience and the food is nice. Throughout the house, the staff working there are extremely helpful, friendly and multilingual which is certainly useful! All in all this was a wonderful day out.

Lots of great Lego builds to see aswell, including the Lego dinosaurs and the huge Lego City dioramas. Take your time to look at these as there are lots of great little stories within each one.

Denmark,Pink,LEGO House,5.0,"The Lego House is an absolute must for visitors to Billund- it is a triumph and celebration of the core values of Lego- play, creativity and imagination. It balances state of the art technology with the simplicity of the basic brick and creates a multitude of play stations for children and adults to get thoroughly absorbed in making and creating.

The house itself is uncompromising in its quality and design, with wonderful outside play areas on every level and a huge Lego brick on the roof. Lots of photo opportunities and interactive elements throughout. From the moment you walk in and a big screen scans your hand and asks which Lego character you are, the fun begins!

An absolute MUST is lunch in the restaurant which is ordered by creating a menu sequence of Lego pieces then delivered to your hands in a big Lego brick by robot. The whole experience is delightful- sadly the robots had a minor malfunction when it came to our turn but the meal was delicious and it didn‚Äôt spoil the excitement...

Super staff, friendly and knowledgeable and clearly committed to the Lego ethos and values. We liked the fact that once you pay to get in, apart from the allure of the shop, the attraction does not try to exploit opportunities to pay extra money for gimmicks throughout each stage. Everything from the brilliant stop motion film studio to the Robo lab is included in the entrance price- very reasonable for what you get to explore and enjoy (and for us an entire 8 hours of play!) and can be upgraded for only 200 DKK for a year pass which seemed brilliant value if you could visit a number of times- there would certainly be plenty to keep you entertained on return visits...

The History of Lego display in the basement is informative and full of examples of Lego kits through the years which show the evolution of the famous toy.

Don‚Äôt miss the chance to create a unique card with your Lego ‚ÄòDNA‚Äô made with a combination of 6 red bricks. Try not to lose it like we did, and you‚Äôll have a really great day.

Denmark,yycccllll,LEGO House,5.0,"I went to Lego house with a friend and although it was already his second visit, we still stayed a full day there and were quite reluctant to leave in the end. The place is well-designed and is suitable for both children and grownups. There were many interactive activities and I was definitely amazed. Make sure you arrive early so you won‚Äôt regret not spending enough time there!",Jul 2019
Denmark,EspenG,LEGO House,5.0,LEGO House was an amazing experience! We spent some hours there after visiting Legoland and regretted not going into LEGO House from the morning instead. There are loads of activities for both grownups and kids and if you have a slight interest in LEGO I would definitely recommend the place!,Jul 2019

There are hours of fun to be had building things with the Lego bricks and there are lots of creations to look at. Must see attraction,Jul 2019
Denmark,acr7,LEGO House,5.0,"Hard to think of things that have not already been said about our day at Lego House.
Its informative, interactive, really well run with enthusiastic staff that add to the experience.
As you would expect its full of extraordinary creations - some of which have been built by visitors to the house (rather put our efforts to shame!).
Booking in advance was easy and i would recommend the 10:00 entry time as the house was very quiet for the first hour or so (although at no point did it get really busy). We spent about 6 1/2 hours there (including lunch) but could easily have stayed another couple of hours.
Can't finish without mentioning the restaurant as well - not just really good food but a fun / inter-active set-up as well (i won't spoil it for those that haven't visited but do give it a try).
All-in-all hard to fault and a really good family day out (although you would equally at home here as adult visitors without children).

Denmark,RachelMG1,LEGO House,5.0,"Fantastic, awesome, amazing experience!! We spent 9 hours and loved every second and didn‚Äôt manage to do everything! There are so many different areas and ways to play with LEGO ... for example: build a fish out of bricks, scan it into a machine then watch it pop out of a pipe into a digital aquarium; 20 min time slots to create a stop motion video (you can return later to add to it or start a new one); build a giraffe and a pulley thing to hold it, place it in a string track and watch it glide around; build a car and race it on a track; build a big and watch it dance on a vibrating drum; add your own creation to a Waterfall of LEGO ... so many innovative ways to play!! There are photo stations to take pics of everything you create and store on your entry wristband - before you leave you get a code to download everything to an app on an IPad.
There‚Äôs also a Masterpiece Gallery with amazing creations that you can stare at for ages, marveling at the details ... and a History area to learn more about the company and the 3 generations of owners.
One of the most special experiences is in the restaurant .... it‚Äôs fairly expensive but for the experience most worth it as you chose items with LEGO pieces, load into a machine, watch a movie with LEGO characters getting your food ready and loading it into a conveyor contraption that loops down the wall to be delivered by robots. It gets busy at lunch-time - we waited an hour for a table and were given a pager so we could go back to LEGO creating while waiting (wasn‚Äôt a big deal for us, but worth remembering to plan ahead and avoid hungry tummies!). There are a couple of coffee-type stands with lighter bites.
Of course there‚Äôs a store with an extensive collection! And to show everything is thought of ... there are lockers to safely leave anything you don‚Äôt want to lug around with you. If the entry price is beyond your budget, they‚Äôve made it possible to still have fun at the LEGO house with multiple outdoor play areas on top of the giant LEGO blocks that make up the building!!
Really wish we lived closer so we could return again ... and again!!

Denmark,Gili G,LEGO House,5.0,"It was the best time in Billund.
The Lego house is not just for kids.
You cant stand and not participate in the magic that is happening next to u.
It was a 8 hours day for us that felt like a 2 hours visit.
So many things to do and build, interactive stations and most of all u have to work your brain and immagination.
Lunch is a problem inside the lego house but outside there r few good options for kids within 100 meters walk.

Denmark,Peter R,LEGO House,5.0,"This is just a brilliant place that anybody can enjoy. The models that are on display are amazing, including a tree that goes up three floors and contains 6.3 million bricks. There is a Lego fountain with loads of bricks that you can use to create your own models. The wrist bands you get when you enter mean that you can record the various creations you make at the different points round the building on the lego app for downloading when you get home This includes making your own movie. One section that our kids were totally absorbed by was the problem solving section. The restaurant at the end is fun because you use lego bricks to order your food and it comes in lego blocks. This was however, an introduction for us as to how pricey Denmark is for food.

Denmark,Dan C,LEGO House,5.0,"I was staying nearby and just couldn‚Äôt be that close and not see the Lego House. I had seen a documentary about its design, and am a long-time LEGO fan, so this was an exciting possibility. Seeing the LEGO tree was a true ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù experience.

Denmark,marianoadavies,LEGO House,5.0,"Excellent experience for children of all ages with a good combination of ideas and challenges. Visitors see very inspiring LEGO constructions and also get the opportunity to build their own. In general a good combination of ""see"" and ""do"".

Denmark,Blorrn,LEGO House,5.0,"As explained in the corporate history area in the black-tiled basement floor (really, but better than it sounds - the dark is a nice break from all! the! primary! colours! on the other floors):

(1) Lego has - for the most part - put a lot of thought into the educational/developmental potential of their toys. Sure, lots of lego sets are not much more than middle class-acceptable versions of Avengers- or whoever-themed product, but there's some interesting effort put into a lot of the others.

(2) Lego -doesn't- have much connection at all to the Legoland up the road - it's a pretty average themepark run by some pretty average UK resort/park operator, with all the charm, quality and value for money you'd expect (that is, if the irony isn't apparent, little to none of the above). The history explains that the Legoland parks were a serious misstep for the Lego group and were spun off years ago.

(3) This, by contrast, is not only somewhat educationally-driven but more widely thoughtful in spirit - the Bjarke Ingels design is refreshing, whimsical and workable; many of the staff seem to be genuinely interested; areas inside and outside are well-laid out; and many of the exhibits are beautiful, surprising and highly interactive. There are also outside play areas directly accessible from most parts of the building. Plus there's a fairly unobtrusive user interface system that allows (but doesn't for the most part require) users to track and document what they get up to. And visitor numbers are clearly carefully controlled.

Just a few downsides - older children (say, 12+) are likely to be bored - perhaps more technical/etc exhibits are just too difficult or not the target market; a few of the activity areas (one involving putting motorised dinosaurs on a stringline; another with some new, brush-wheeled lego vehicles) are just not that good; the staff do come and remove/dismantle children's constructions - as they have to, understandably - but a little quickly if said children are standing right there; and there could be more actual interaction involving those staff.

Denmark,Emma S,LEGO House,5.0,"We visited Lego House with our 9 year old twin boys. Not sure who had more fun, us or them! We stayed there for 6 hours and would have happily stayed longer.
The house is divided into themed sections and each section has multiple activities to do. There's no queues, it designed to allow everyone to interact simultaneously.
You scan your wrist band at each zone to take photos of your Lego builds and they are accessible at home via the app.
I saw kids of all ages playing happily but it was pleasing to see the parents and even grandparents joining in.
Fantastic family day.
Kids said it was much better than Legoland!!!

Denmark,elRolfo,LEGO House,5.0,"Lego House is located in the center of the village of Billund, and thus not quite next to Legoland as we thought it would be, and since we didn't see any road signs pointing there until we were quite close, we had to rely on Google maps to find it. Not a big deal though, since the village is not very big.

When we bought tickets online we had to choose a time for our visit (not duration), which I suppose is to limit number of visitors at the same time. This is absolutely essential for a place like this, as each area is not too large and it would totally ruin the experience if it became too crowded. Two thumbs up to Lego for this!

Having been to Legoland many times, we were excited to see what Lego House had to offer. We were not disappointed! Our children aged 8 and 11 loved the different building activities, and all of us were blown away by the amazing miniature worlds which in my opinion far surpasses most of Legoland's.

Still, my personal highlight was the history collection downstairs, with numerous old sets on display which instantly sparked a major trip down nostalgia lane for me.

The restaurant had an hour and a quarter waiting to get seated, so we didn't get to try the food there. If we had known this, we could have requested a table earlier and come back. But the cafe is all right for a healthy snack and kept us going happily for the rest of the stay.

A great day!

Tip 1: don't expect any discount or offer in the shop but there are some exclusive set only available at the Lego House which are well worth it.

Without detailing too much or spoil your first day there, you really see bricks everywhere. You can play, build or just enjoy watching build up models.
The restaurant at the ground floor has the interactive building menu, which is quite fun and the food is quite reasonable too!

Denmark,Bowerstravels,LEGO House,5.0,"We came to Denmark specifically to visit the Lego House and it did not disappoint. I wish this place were closer to home because it is so much fun. My husband, son and I had a wonderful time building and playing. We took a 1.5 hour tour of the museum and our guide, Singhe (not sure of spelling) was wonderful and gave us lots of information about how the Lego House came to be. You could tell that she just loves Lego and all it represents.
We packed sandwiches for lunch but bought drinks at the coffee bar.
You get a wristband that gives you access to the different areas in Lego House. Make sure you build something and scan it or get your picture taken with it at every room. At the end, you scan your band one more time, pick up a pack of 6 red bricks and a plastic card. This will give you access to all your creations via the Lego House app. Super cool to have it saved like that!
We ate dinner at the Mini Chef (15% off after 5p) and bought Legos at the LEGO store that you can only buy there.
If it's every possible, we will return!

This brand new building is not just architecturally fascinating, but a great experience for the whole family. About eight separate, wonderfully designed experiences are fun and engaging for the whole family. Loved the stop motion movie creation and freeing mammoths from ice with remote control LEGO vehicles, for just staring in wonder at the creativity and detail of some of the builds. We all loved the restaurant, where you order by selecting certain LEGO pieces and scanning them, and then get a LEGO brick-shaped bento box with your food shortly thereafter.

There are indoor picnic tables, which are very useful alongside free lockers where you can store lunch until you want it.

Denmark,thepetridish,LEGO House,5.0,"A one of a kind attraction for all ages. I enjoyed learning the whole history of Lego (take the tour, it is worth it) and building a Race car that smashed into bit trying to jump trough a hoop. My son loved that and everything else as well. He was in full Lego overload. He got to make a short stop motion animated movie, build whatever he wanted with an endless pile of bricks, and study intently every little interesting detail (like a streaker on the football pitch) built into the lego built scenes. He even enjoyed leafing through the database of every lego set ever released to find the ones he both had and wanted. We spent all day there but felt like we still could have used a couple more hours. If you are choosing between this and LegoLand, choose Lego House. It is the only one in the world. And according to the tour guide, Lego will never build another. I can not recommend it highly enough. And if you are interested in a bit of history, Lego House is built right across the street from the site of the workshop where Lego was first born.

It‚Äôs a 45 minute walk from the airport and even walking both ways we had enough time to play in all the zones and see the exhibitions without feeling rushed. Mucking about on the roof for half an hour before going into the building was great in itself.

The cafe is fun and, considering you‚Äôre a captive audience, not too expensive. All the different things to build and ways to capture your memories are so well thought through.

Building a city is fascinating and having a go at movie making via stop motion animation is really fun. Best for me were the creative areas in the red zone where you can do what you want with endless bricks.
The museum is also interesting and make sure you leave time to browse the archives.

Denmark,ch0tipagli,LEGO House,5.0,"Just got back from a long day here. I booked flights from Stansted for ¬£35 each and can be done cheaper! Flight was at 7.20 so early start. We landed about 10 then took bus outside airport to town centre (our bus didn't take card so had to go atm and get cash but next bus did). Quite a few buses go there and i checked online for which bus was going to be coming next. I was charged 24dkk for me and my dd. From town centre it's only about 7 mins to house and used Google maps to get there. Dont get confused by signs to car park like I did! We had pre booked our tickets online as you save a small amount. Once in, our tickets were scanned to obtain named wristbands which you need throughout the day. Firstly to open and close the free lockers available where we left our bags. You can also leave your coats in cloakroom too. They call this wardrobe there.

Once in we headed to the Green zone first. I don't think it matters which order you do them. We made mini characters. You use your wristband to scan your creations to download later. We also saw marvellous Lego cities and did the story lab activity (stop motion). This was my daughter's favourite activity. The blue zone had city creation (another favourite activity where you create shops, houses, parks and industries and place them where you think the interactive city needs it. You can programme robots to save the ship from mammoths too. This runs every 10 mins and can take 15 users at one time . We didn't wait that long. Also you can create cars and race them on tracks.

Yellow zone had a fun fish creation activity. Once you scan it in you can see it in the digital aquarium. You can create flowers and mini critters here too. Red zone had further creations and even a small library should you feel like reading.

There are terraces in each zone with play functions. Toilets are nice and clean. There are restaurants on ground floor. We had our own lunch and ate in mini chef. This is where you use legos to order your meal with the interactive screen. Once ready you see it come down the conveyor to the robots and they hand it you. Yes a novelty and only did it for that but expensive for the quality of food. 169dkk adults (4 items) and 98dkk for kids (3 items plus free minifigure). I guess you're paying for experience.

We went to the roof terrace at the end with lots of play areas but got kicked out before 7:30pm.

We then walked back to town centre, waited for next bus at 8 and was at the airport within 10 mins. Our flight was at 10:30 so we just waited in duty free till our flight was ready. It was just after 11 when we landed and home by 1:30 am!

A long day but doable!

Apparently the day we were there was comparatively quiet, although it seemed quite busy to me, but throughout the space there was an air of concentration and calm despite thousands of kids of all ages being there.

There are literally millions of Lego and Duplo bricks in huge bins as well as minifigures for building whatever takes your fancy. The smaller children can climb right into the bigger bins, while adults and older children can craft their fancies in single coloured 8-stud blocks or a vast range of parts, including specials such as the flower/daffodil building area that was there for easter.

For kids needing to burn off energy there are many outside play areas on different levels, access to most of which is free. Swings, climbing and jumping all in the order of the day.

For a quiet moment, the LEGO history museum in the basement is a fascinating insight into how this global behemoth has grown yet retained its Danish hygge roots.

Denmark,Michael L,LEGO House,5.0,"The LEGO House was really well done. Plenty to do which can be spread over the day. Numerous areas setup to allow building, that sound of LEGO being swished together as pieces were hunted for was pretty common. The large world displays could take up hours just looking at all the various elements. You are free to come and go over the day which was handy. And the cafes were decent - fresh juices / coffee (including ridiculously overpriced coffee !!) and the restaurant served a decent dinner. Not a lot of junk food, which is great if you‚Äôre with kids.

In my view one day was adequate. I was there from opening until close and got through everything. Not to say a second day wouldn‚Äôt be great, but if you‚Äôre doing a quick trip here (like I was) one day will certainly see it all.

The cafe and LEGO shop are open to the public. Great day, well worth it if you can get to Billund. #LEGOHouse

This was a highlight of my day trip to Billund on Sun Air from London City

Though I hadn't read the website, and its displays are closed mid week for school kids.
Though the foyer and roof terraces are open and free to visit along with the caf√© selling coffee.
Simply stunning naturally lit large building.
Great views from the roof terraces.
Giant lego blocks outside.
Nice riverside terrace.
All in all a nice way to spent an afternoon - though next time I will read their website.

Denmark,Sarah1275,LEGO House,5.0,"Having read the reviews online before we visited, I knew it was going to be good but didn't realise just how good it was going to be! Absolutely blew all our family away. I could try and explain the activities in words but think it just needs to be experienced to be believed!

Visited with our 2 kids aged 8 and 10 who were enthralled for the moment we entered at 10am to when we left at 4pm when it closed. There was just so much to do and see and all the small details were phenomenal.

The staff were also amazing, interacting with both the kids and adults.

Whilst we were there we were told about the documentary on Netflix about the building of the house which we then watched when we got home, but would recommend you watch it before you go as there's lots of things from the documentary you can look out for in the house.

We ate lunch in the Mini Chef Restaurant. Ok, so the food wasn't brilliant but that didn't matter as the concept is just like nothing you'll ever have experienced and both the kids and us loved it. You get shown to your table where you have a menu and a pack of bricks. You use the bricks to build your meal and then scan them in a machine. you then get notified when your meal is ready, which arrives down a big conveyer and then robots serve it to you. Fantastic!

We had such a great day we came back the following day. Although we didn't have a paid ticket to go into the Experience Zones, you can still climb outside on the terraces to access the playgrounds and then inside the house they put out large Lego bricks for kids to play with, you can view Lego models, visit the restaurant and cafe and also the shop. There's a play agent on hand to interact with visitors - my kids had so much fun with them.

If you download the Lego House app before you go, when you complete the app you can take the screen showing your completion to the Lego Store for a free gift. We got given a Lego keyring that you can only purchase at the Lego House which was fantastic.

When we went it was fairly quiet (Wednesday) as Danish kids had been on their holidays the week before so we didn't have to queue or wait to do anything, but can imagine it would be a lot busier weekends/ school holidays.

Thank you Lego for a truly unforgettable experience! As you can probably tell, we are huge fans of this place!

You have a chance to download the app and then have 30 days to download photos and films you make on the day - just remember to keep your wristband and card from the 6 brick challenge (on your exit route). You can arrange for your picture to be printed on Lego at the Lego shop - at peak times you need to book. We made it as a day trip from Copenhagen (train to Vejle and then bus to Bellund) which is possible and worth it. Restaurant serves excellent food and drinks - staff are willing to help you at every turn. There are lockers to store your items, including a large locker for your purchases!

Denmark,Dyuli,LEGO House,1.0,"My family and I visited Lego House Restaurant, and it was awful. We had to build our orders, which is a fun idea, but they got my order wrong, even though when we put the picture through, it was correct. I ordered noodles but got thin fries instead. The fish I ordered was so wet and and tasted like air that I didn‚Äôt even want to finish it. For the younger kids, their toy was covered in grease and we wouldn‚Äôt dare touch it. Even on the box that the food was in, there was grease on it, so it was quite disgusting to carry to our table. The whole consept of the theme of the restaurant was fun, but everything was so poorly done. I would definitely not recommend going to the restaurant to anyone, and will never return to this filthy place again. Do a better job at cleaning this place and make actual good food for once. This is just miserable to look at. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money in this restaurant.

Also unique to this building is the fact that you can even play on the outside! You can climb up to the top and visit the various playgrounds on the roof of the building.

The only possible negative was the quality of the food served in the cafeteria. The robots delivering the food were also frequently stuck.

Be sure you scan your entrance bracelet as and take photos at the various kiosks. You can access all these images at the end of your trip.

You can program a vehicle to rescue explorers and mammoths on the South Pole.
You can also make your own Lego movie and much more.

You can take selfies in the machines that are placed in different areas in the building and download them when you get home.

It is very clear that the facilities are new. Toilets are plenty and clean. Wardrobes also. You can store your bags and jackets in the lockers which are free.

You can buy drinks and snacks at the activities. At ground level you find a coffee shop and a restaurant. The procedure of ordering your food at the restaurant is another Lego activity. Also the way you get your food is a whole other story.
The food quality is okay -nothing out of the ordinary but the prices are quite high.

Remember to keep two out of three items: your ‚Äòbracelet‚Äô you get at the entrance, your e-mail ticket, or the card you get at the exit to be able to download all your pictures from your visit when you get home.

Buy tickets online as it was very straightforward and we did not need to print the tickets off. For a family of 5, this saved 150 kroner (nearly ¬£20).

The restaurant was good fun with the very novel idea of the bricks to select food. There was not much choice and it was pricey (nearly ¬£100 for the five of us and no pudding), but it was healthy and as a one off novelty worth it.

This is definitely a place to add to your bucket list! Young, old, boys, girls...there is something for any one of us!!
We also had some food there as the boys were really excited in having their food delivered by the robots! Although it didn‚Äôt really go as expected (the machine got stuck exactly during no our ‚Äòdelivery‚Äô), they still had fun checking out the food being delivered to the other people. Like many systems, this is still NOT a flawless one! Please keep this in mind if your food gets stuck up there or if it is cold or if it is not actually what you had asked for. Giving out to the people that work there it isn‚Äôt really the solution!!

Denmark,Karen H,LEGO House,5.0,"Ever since we first heard about the Lego house, we had been dying to go. Our whole family trip to Denmark with a 12 year old and two ten year olds was planned around a visit here, so we were feeling very excited, but at the same time rather nervous. What if it didn't live up to our high expectations? We all love Lego,and we wanted it to be totally awesome. We needn't have worried. It was totally ace, and we were all genuinely blown away by the whole experience.

The website says it is 'unique' and that is actually the best way to describe it. We spent 9 whole hours there and it still wasn't long enough. Highlights include making a stop motion animation film with lego characters, building and test driving lego vehicles, and creating a tall tower for the Lego city. It's all wonderfully interactive, and you get to upload your creations as you go along so you can 'virtually' take them all home.

Top tips:
- You can take the 43 bus from the airport to the terminus and from there it's a short walk. You pay for tickets on the bus. (24 DKK adults/12DKK children 12+.)
- Book early so you can get a 10am entrance ticket. Go straight to activities where you queue, like the Stop Motion Animation or Robot activity. Stay late and you can do all these things again without the crowds.
- If you eat at mini chef, be aware that you are paying for what is an excellent and fun concept, but the food is very average. Do it though, because you might not go to Billund again.
- Look for all the tiny details in the 1.9 million piece Lego display, like Darth Vadar sunbathing, or Gollum hiding in a cave.
-Get there before your entry time so you can climb to the top of the Lego house from the outside. It's very cool.

Above all, enjoy.

Denmark,OliviaGS8,LEGO House,5.0,"Visited Lego House and we as a family enjoyed our time here better than Legoland. Also a great option for when the weather gets too wet or freezing. I highly recommend the Mini Chef restaurant experience for its concept. Price of food is comparable to eating in most of the restos around Billund plus you get to take home some tiny Lego pieces to add to your kids‚Äô collection. The food tastes good too! Access to the resto, gift shop, some areas in the ground floor and rooftop deck with playground are free to non-ticket holders. Thumbs up to that!!

It is located in the center of town so we decided to stay across Lego House. Downside though is that if you flew to Billund and banking on taxis to take you to Legoland you might be in for some ranting. It was a choice between 25 min walk with little feet and 5 min taxi ride. The hotel recommended for us to take a cab. The taxi driver told us that ‚Äúit was an insult to his job that we even called for a taxi!‚Äù The temperature drop that day was not a good reason either because we were also told that we should have not decided to go to Legoland if it was too cold for us. The fare was nearly the same as centrum to the airport btw so money is not the issue. Wish there was a regular shuttle between Lego House and Legoland.

Denmark,DadColoradoGermany,LEGO House,5.0,"This place is amazing. I won't try to summarize the details of the place, because you can get that from the official website. The experience rooms wowed me. So much creativity and play to experience. Millions upon millions of bricks to play with. Each room has different themes and ways to facilitate the play. You can scan a fish and watch it swim around a digital aquarium. You can make your own stop-action Lego movie. And for a parent, just wandering and seeing the huge displays of impressive Lego creations was cool in itself. I never knew I would see a near life-size Tyrannosaurus! We spent ""only"" 3 hours here with 3 kids under 8, but could have easily spent many more. They were running from room to room making sure they at least saw everything, but it would be best to devote the whole day here.

There is also a set of free playgrounds on top of the building. Just wander up the yellow staircase on the outside and you can discover playgrounds on the top of each level (9 in total?). There are even glass ceilings you can walk onto to look down into the building. Very cool in itself.

We came back another day to go to the lunch restaurant. Definitely expensive, but the kids really enjoyed it. You place your order by assembling the Lego bricks they give you according to the code explained on your menu sheet, and then you scan it at your table. Then a system of robots brings the trays of food to a delivery station where you go pick it up. Very clever. Expensive, but you pay for the uniqueness.

Our kids couldn't decide whether this or Legoland was better - but I clearly loved this one for the uniqueness. My understanding is that they have no intention of building another one of these. So even though there are a number of Legolands around, this is the ""real"" place to experience the Lego brick!

But if I am to compere it, say to the PEZ Visitor Centre in Connecticut or them LEGOLAND Discovery Centers around. LEGO House beats them all. We will visit again and again. And one last thing, it is not expencive at all compared to the experience you get. Now thats a good feeling, I did not get that feeling at the LEGOLAND Discovery Centers for sure.. so go go go folksüòÄ

Denmark,TEAMW12,LEGO House,5.0,"We are a family of 4, teenagers aged 17 and 14. We visited the Lego house on our sons 14th birthday . We all had a fabulous day. From the moment you arrive there is so much to see and do. The Lego House is for all ages. We arrived in Billund 2 days before our LH visit. It was nice to be able to check out the outside of the building and wander through all the different play areas. Shame our children are older but we still enjoyed having a good look round as its free of charge. On the day of our visit we parked in their underground car park. Our session time started at 10am. All the staff are very friendly and helpful . The large tree in reception is amazing with so much detail and lots of different sets on different levels. The whole place is brilliant with so much interaction for all ages. We visited the family restaurant at lunchtime and enjoyed the novelty of choosing our food by building lego pieces which represented different types of food and then picking up our meals from the robots. great fun. All in all a fab day and definitely worth a visit.

Denmark,HW62,LEGO House,5.0,"The Lego House is a new addition of the Lego adventure in Billund. It is an absolutely wonderful experience and a world class interactive attraction for kids, in parallel or even exceeding more famous interactive attractions like Exploratorium in the US or Nemo in Amsterdam. I was so impressed by Lego House, and only sorrow to find that the kids didn't have time to stay longer. We surely returned for a second day.

All is built around different brick activities. What makes it so good is that there are no dead spaces in which just to look and learn. This is hands on all time. Of course you can sit down at a table and build your own lego thing. But you can also make a film, or build things that must pass a test, or play with robots, or build a rail road and much more. The worst thing is that you get hooked, kids and grown ups alike. I had to wander off, trying to find my wife who suddenly had became totally absorbed in one of the acitivities.

So this is really a place I could recommend. Planning your visit to Legoland, don't forget to include a big chunk for the Lego House. Personally, I would prefer the Lego House rather than the Legoland. Your kids certainly will not complain. And you neither.

Denmark,seeg82,LEGO House,5.0,"My only regret is that we didn‚Äôt dedicate an entire day to this place. The LEGO House was so awesome! My 4 kids ages 10, 9, 3, and 2 were having so much fun. They said they enjoyed it more than the theme park!!! There were stations in every room for the kids and adults to play. It was interactive and high tech. All the staff was super polite and the facilities were clean.
I was handicap and it was easy to navigate through the rooms. There were many places to sit and still enjoy what was going on.
The building has additional things like lockers, a small cafe, a LEGO restaurant and of course a LEGO store.
There are also multiple playgrounds on top of the building that you do not need to pay to use.

Denmark,SILB2607,LEGO House,5.0,"The park is full of fun for all ages: the lego decorations are spectacular and the rides are varied for different ages
Tips:
There is a wide picnic area where you can have a picnic
There are toilets everywhere bright and clean
The young students of Denmark go back to school on 18.8.. so the park is less crowded afterwards
Use the park application to trace how busy the cues are and plan your visit accordingly
There is a great lego shop in the park which sells an unbelievable variety of models and a possibility to buy lego parts by weight. Go during the morning because it would be impossible to buy close to the closing hours.
If you‚Äôre tourists then there is an extra cue for getting the papers for tax refund
Pay your parking ticket on your going in,avoid the line when you exit
Check the park opening days and hours before because it might be closed/ early closed

Denmark,Tracy K,LEGO House,5.0,"I had been following Lego House on Instagram when they first started building. I had no idea what it was about. So in August of 2018, we decided to visit as an alternative to Lego Land, which we have been to in Billund several times. Lego House did not disappoint! It exceeded our expectations! The museum is fantastic, all the rooms with the different creative ideas is so much fun. I can't even explain how much fun building a fish for the fish tank was and then watching it ""swim"" around the large tank. It wasn't very busy due to the time ticketing, so that also made the experience really great. We ate lunch at the mini chef and despite some issues with the order arriving, it was a fun experience! Lego House thinks of every detail! Your wristband lets you put your stuff in a secure and free locker so you aren't lugging your backpacks and jackets around, so I really appreciated that. Its a great experience for adults and I would suggest for older kids as its not about rides, its about building and creativity. We would definitely go again!

Denmark,Dru D,LEGO House,5.0,"The place is amazing! My five year old son and I visited from Australia in July and it really was a dream come true. We spent two full days at LEGO house and enjoyed every minute.
The experience zones were fun! I loved the fish tank and my son loved the racing car ramps but really, everything was amazing. It was a treat switch off from everyday life, engage with your child and just play.
We ate at mini chef several times, the food was very good but serving sizes waaaay too big. It really was all about the experience though - my son loved ordering using the LEGO bricks and watching the meals appear on the conveyor belt.
The staff were really friendly and added to the experience. We were able to store luggage in large lockers at no cost.
I suggest watching the Netflix documentary on the making of LEGO house before you go and you‚Äôll be so moved when you see it in real life. Don‚Äôt hesitate, just go!

Denmark,Megjane_11,LEGO House,5.0,"Myself, my husband and our 3 year old son had a fantastic day visiting the Lego House in Billund!

We went down into the basement first as we thought we‚Äôd never be able to pull our son away if we went to the Exploration Zones first! The history of Lego can be found in the basement including an electronic catalogue of all of the boxsets over the decades. This brought back some fun memories for us two adults!

We then went up the stairs to the Exploration Zones. We loved each area, especially the Duplo areas in each! Our 3 year old loved being independent & using his own wristband to take photos of his models using the Lego House App machines so we could download these later to print & keep.

We visited on Monday 17th September, there were no queues including for lunch at the Mini Chef restaurant.

All the staff were friendly & so informative! We had a lovely chat with Yasmin in the Red Zone who was great with our toddler!

We ate at the Mini Chef restaurant. Unfortunately a technical fault meant that they could only offer a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù service but we still enjoyed the whole experience & the Nordic-style food tasted great & was very filling! Our waitress Louise was wonderful, she really made the experience special for our son!

September is a special month at the Lego House as they are celebrating their 1st birthday so they have a celebratory treasure hunt where you look for Lego Birthday Cakes in different zones to spell out a sentence in English or Danish and each completed sheet wins a prize.

It was great to spent the whole day enjoying each other‚Äôs company, making memories & working together to build lots with Lego/Duplo!

We plan to re-visit the Lego House again in the future when our son is older.

Denmark,Andrew J,LEGO House,5.0,"Like almost all others, we loved LEGO House. With kids 14, 11 and 7, we spent a fun-filled 8.5 hours in and on the House yesterday. I expect it gets busy in Jun-Aug, but we didn‚Äôt have to wait to do things much at all in the four experience zones. The numerous staff were attentive and knowledgeable;and the use of touch screens, and wrist bands to track and record your visit is great. For us older fans, the LEGO museum in the basement is fantastic (I spent over an hour there - including 20min using a touch screen system to scroll through all LEGO sets ever made, to try and remember what I was given in the 1970‚Äôs). Rather than eat in for lunch, we walked 2min outside to the Bakery, which had great savoury and sweet food.

Denmark,Padraig C,LEGO House,5.0,"If your a lego fan (or AFOL) LEGO House is must see. From the moment you arrive until you leave you will be amazed. The different levels throughout the building provide a variety of experiences. There is lots to see and play with for all ages, from young children to adults. The displays through out the building are phenominal. Not to be missed is the History section in the basement. It provides a detailed story of how Lego has evolved, including successes and failures. Such an example of someone having a vision and sticking with it. Well worth the trip to this part of a great country, Denmark. Getting to LEGO House is quite easy; by train via Vejle or by plane via Billund international airport.

Denmark,Lunarcamper,LEGO House,5.0,"Ok so its Lego. You are expecting as much really, however its not just a day for the kids. The whole thing is one big interactive experience. The house is divided into zones, with a different activity in each, as well as the usual massive lego models. These are very impressive. Even if you don't like lego......(why are you going again?) you can't fail to be impressed by these behemoth creations.

If you get stuck in then you will have a great day. My son and I tried to out do each other by building the tallest buildings in the interactive cities, there is a stop motion recording area where you can try your hand at making a movie and much more besides.

I thoroughly recommend it as a day out if you happen to be in Billund.....

Im glad she did, because This place is just great. From the atchitecture to the installations, activities and beyond. Its just a true testament to Legos legacy.

I‚Äôd much rather we‚Äôd spend the Day here instead of legoland",Oct 2017
Denmark,Harriet F,LEGO House,5.0,"The Lego House is a mind blowing experience. The house itself is beautiful, stunning architecture both inside and house. Inside there are four experience zones including free build (red), mini figures (green), cities (blue), and nature (yellow). There is also a museum about the history of Lego (I found this really interesting), and a gallery of some amazing Lego models made by adult Lego fans.

We spent 2 days there as a family and truly connected over all the different activities and things to do and see. My oldest son loved the city builder, and he also loved the car racing. My youngest spent the entire time in various pools of duplo or building epic train tracks, completely absorbed and happy for hours. The outdoor space is fun too - different roof terraces provide play areas and equipment to explore.

If you are in Billund with a young family, I‚Äôd definitely recommend visiting Lego house; you can easily make a full day of it (we spent 2 days there), and have a day at Legoland too.

I didn't know what to expect when we visited, especially after having visited Legoland and Lalandia but this place is a must to spend a full day at if you're visiting Billund. We were disappointed with the restaurant - not the quality of the food, as it was fantastic - however from when we first went to get a table (had to wait 45 minutes to be seated) till we actually were eating (our order took around another 45 minutes to be completed) unfortunately this wasted 2 hours of precious time...had I known this beforehand I would have taken a pre-packed lunch and just bought drinks or something from there. Another pity is that closing time is at 1600hrs - this could easily be extended to 1700, there really is a lot to do in this place so do go at 1000hrs (opening time).

Actually visited on two consecutive days due to an urgent model that required finishing!! Besides it was worth visiting at least twice to explore!
The interaction and friendliness of the staff was amazing. They were keen to help, enthusiastic in their work and happy to guide you if necessary.
All of the separate areas were great and really interactive, hence 2 days of enjoyable and great fun.
Duplo zones were available for smaller people and looked like great fun. If mine had been younger they would have been sat in and amongst the blocks too!!
The app is also great for keeping photos of your builds, designs and videos, which are stored for as long as you want. The kids loved scanning their wristbands and keeping a store of their projects, including our stop animation video!!

Denmark,Mel K,LEGO House,5.0,"We chose to visit Billund for a 12th birthday to see Legoland. We never got there! Lego House is perfect for our children who are mostly disinterested in theme park rides and spend most of their time at Legoland simply building. This attraction appeals to old and young. Fascinating history of Lego and the family behind the firm. Lunch was unbelievable with a space age method of ordering lunch using Lego bricks inserted into a tabletop computer. Food was served at the counter by robots and was excellent. Stop go animation studio was a hoot and our two really enjoyed the red zone. Loads of outdoor play areas too. This truly is the future of Lego entertainment. We hope to see more Lego Houses globally. We left with free Lego from lunch with exclusives pieces and everyone gets a bespoke six brick combination on leaving plus six freshly minted red bricks. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Only gripe is the opening hours shorten at the end of August as Danish children are back in school. Plus side was it was quiet so no queuing. We will be back.

I honestly thought we were going to spend just 2-3 hours there but I was wrong! We spent 5 hrs there and really enjoyed our visit. Eating lunch at the Lego House was very interesting, fun and really something new.

Denmark,sptor,LEGO House,3.0,"I know I'm risking with my rating for that attraction and going against the overall trend in reviews posted, but I believe that I can justify such a low score. The place itself is really nice and well planned with it's free outside playgrounds, with much to do and see in experiences zones (paid section), but since it is very Lego-centric (unsurprisingly) it's activities in paid section mostly for those who is really into Lego and building things from Lego blocks. Some activities not involving building from blocks directly, but most of them definitely do. Exhibitions are nice and impressive, staff helpful and welcoming, and you can spend there couple of hours or so just walking and staring around. It all seems nice and even, you may say awesome, and deserves the highest rating at the first glance, but there are some ""buts"" which dragging my rating down. The first is the entrance price. I'm perfectly aware of that the entrance tickets to most of attractions in Denmark are quite high and usually not complaining about it since in most cases this is justified, but in this case I've felt a bit ripped off for that price - firstly the price is the same for children and adults DKK 229 on site, and DKK 199 if buying online, no family tickets, no discounts for children's tickets only toddlers to 2 years old are entering for free, but there not too much to to for them anyway. Some possibilities to get children for a half price are present, but they are limited in time and require Legoland season pass - we had them - but we were there at the wrong timeof the year , when the offer wasn't valid (weeks 27-31). Secondly this price is not justified for my opinion by any means, I can't believe that this place has higher maintenance costs then such attractions like Randers Regnskov, Givskud Zoo or Kattegatcentret oceanarium involving quite costly exotic animal husbandry and maintaining micro-climate, where even on site entrance prices are lower, and where kids up to 11 years old have a discount of around 40-50% from adult's ticket price. Even the day ticket to Legoland is not much more expensive and you almost always can find possibility to get free child's ticket with adult's ticket. Sorry to say so, but it seems Lego House trying to use it's novelty status in fullest. In fact if to sum up what you get for that price that will be following:
- playing with Lego bricks, fun but not for all and in fact that can be done in nearby Legoland as well, or even in many other places around since Lego is main theme in Billund and nearby
- your own set of six red Lego bricks (6 by 2 rectangular ones) of Lego Duplo bricks from molding machine at the entrance
- looking to the something like Legoland's Miniland and various models and statues made from Lego bricks, they are impressive sort of, but Miniland is not less impressive - just bit older, statues from Lego blocks available in Legoland and even on streets
- possibility to download app to your smartphone and then download there photos of things you've built from Lego bricks if you registered them at terminals
- play some interactive games with Lego involved directly or not
- create your short Lego movie
- look to some Lego history exhibition
You can judge yourself is this your cup of tea or not, for the price asked. Also revisiting value for the place is somewhat questionable (I know it is quite subjective thing but anyway), especially if the static exhibition will not change substantially from year to year, and you are not into building things from the great piles of loose Lego blocks - looking to the nearby Legoland this maybe the case, but there revisit value, at least for kids is bigger, since they grow out from some and up to other rides, and in that way get new experiences despite of their liking Lego avidly or not too much.
So to sum up that rather lengthy review - Lego House is great place, especially for the rainy day, but for the current price only for hardcore Lego fans whose main goal to play with Lego no matter what, for those who are just interested, but not too much into Lego and playing with blocks, use your own discretion (and check not only five stars reviews from time to time), and if possible try to get tickets for discount price, at least for children's ones it maybe possible, or just let the fans from your family or friends to roam into experience zone while spending your time in free ones or maybe some other place which interested you.

We were adults and children age 4 to 14.

So... what is Lego House...?
Even after being there, it's still hard to explain.
It's a non-trivial interactive experiences (in plural) for all ages (2 to 99 but for real).

Some examples:
1. Making your own stop motion Lego movie
2. Building a Lego car and race it with others.
3. Building a fish and.... (I won't leave a spoiler :) - just do it!)
4. Building many staff on top of others

Incredibly engaging and interactive - you would typically spend 15-plus minutes on each of the activities (and could easily be more - you only stop because there is so much more to see), it‚Äôs not just a touch screen or other gimmicky interaction that they have at most museums. Both adults and kids in our group had SO MUH FUN. Which brings me to my only complaint - the hours are way too short. They close at 4 most days. We were there 11:30-4 and did not have time to experience all of it or even see the museum in the basement. We will definitely return next time we are in Denmark.",Aug 2018

I am an AFOL so having visited Legoland and Lego House, I have to say Lego House was even better than I expected (with high initial expextation) and win hands-down compared to Legoland which looks tired and waiting time for some of the rides were long. I think Lego House has its sights on what Lego could potentially look like in the future - and hence many of the exhibits were also highly interactive.

There are two Lego models that are exclusive only to the Lego store at Lego House (not available at Legoland) - it was an absolute reward for myself for making this far a journey to my childhood dream!

Denmark,Wakanda279,LEGO House,2.0,"My son is a true Lego nut and I planned a special trip for him involving the best of Billund, including the new Lego House that opened in 2017 and lunch at their innovative restaurant to be served lunch by robots, as my son wants to be a robotics engineer. After a long badly signposted walk from Legoland we got to Lego house in time for lunch but were told that we couldn't be seated for one hour 15 minutes. We were given a reservation timer and went off hungry to look at the exhibits and returned some time after 3pm. Our drinks order was taken and a few minutes later we were told the special 'micro chip' machines were out of order so that part of the excitement was gone. Later on when I asked, we were told the special robots to serve food were not working. My son was really very glum by this time. To make matters worse he was served pork instead of chicken - lucky we are not Muslim. The food was terrible - burnt veg, burnt chicken and gloopy mash. The menu sounds gourmet but is far from that. To attempt to put a smile back on my son's face I bought him a decent sized lego set. So that's ¬£35 for an atrocious meal and another ¬£35 to the Lego Group for a make-up Lego set. Overall Lego house is souless and tries to be too clever. Maybe one day they will learn to match the service with a smile that Legoland has mastered, and give families the easy experience they need. We won't be going back but will happily visit Lalandia resort and legoland Billund again.

We all had the best time ever- the place is full of different experiences to build with lego bricks as you pass through the different zones of activity- creating a lego movie, a flower, cars, fish and much more
The day went by so fast.
Had lunch at the mini chef where you build your own meal- although we waited almost 2 hours to be seated due to a malfunction in their computer (horrible experience, though we had a buzzer so we didn‚Äôt have to wait at the restaurant and could travel around the zones) was a special experience especially for the kids . Though a tad overpriced the food was OK some of the dishes were very tasty. All in all- i‚Äôd Recommend the restaurant- mainly for the experience.
The store is lovely and has a huge selection of LEGO‚Äôs

Denmark,LauzFaye,LEGO House,5.0,"We visited yesterday with our three young children and loved every minute. We were there for about 5.5 hours and can‚Äôt fault it at all. Everything was really well thought out, fun and spotlessly clean. All staff were friendly, enthusiastic and helpful but not in a Disney over-the-top way, and it seemed all ages were having a great time.

TIP: There‚Äôs a great lunch room and lockers to leave a picnic in so taking your own food is a great way to save some cash.",Aug 2018

Denmark,AdamJBerry1988,LEGO House,5.0,"We visited Denmark for my 30th birthday. Me my wife and two daughters 6 and 23 months at the time. We spent day one in lego land with a night stay on site. Legoland seemed abit dated, very small, and expensive. but saying that it was very clean. We‚Äôve been to Windsor many times, so we know it‚Äôs expensive, but there is so much more to see. Day two we took the short walk to the Lego house and We all loved it. Everything was clean, the staff so friendly and helpful. I still talk about it to this very day. Cheap entry tickets. But food onsite was quite pricey, but we was happy to pay. I would recommend going, and we look to visit again soon!!

Denmark,Eldigga,LEGO House,5.0,"While visiting the Legoland we were told that there are unique Lego sets that can be bought at the Lego house.
Our mistake was that we thought you have to pay the entrance fee. As it is cheaper to buy the tickets online we made it before. At the Lego house we saw that the shop can be reached without paying the entrance fee.
This mistake led us to a very unique experience. You enter the Lego house by a huge stairway leading alongside a monumental tree made by Lego bricks (this is one of the unique Lego sets that can only be bought there). At the end of the stairway there is an open space with lots of community generated Lego houses and things. The variety was stunning and we'd love to get some of these for ourselves.
There are different areas connected to the center were you can play, build and just hang around. If you are only walking through the rooms it will be a quite short stay so it's all about participating.
At the end of your stay you can also visit the museum in the basement where you can learn everything about the history of Lego. Before leaving you should also take your free 6 bricks with a unique building instruction that is handed to every visitor.

Denmark,Gav_jo,LEGO House,5.0,"Wow. What an amazing place! As lovers of Lego we came to Denmark and Billund to see LEGOLAND but decided to visit the Lego House too with a combination ticket. The reviews really do live up to expectations. We visited with 3 children: 13, 10 and 6. We came beforehand to get our bearings on a previous day, and spent about an hour in the Lego Square. With the shop, cafe and activities: all free. This really excited us for our visit.

If you love Lego you will really enjoy your day. On our actual visit we arrived at 9:30 enjoying all the playgrounds on the roofs of the building - yes really!

We got our wristbands with our online tickets. These were important throughout our day. We set off and (apart from a lunch break)we easily filled the 7.5 hours until 5.30pm! We built models, created mosaics,controlled robots, constructed buildings, ‚Äògrew‚Äô flowers, made critters,set fish into the ocean and so much more!!

High praise indeed from our 13 year old- best day out EVER!!

We did do the Mini-chef restaurant which was expensive but a great experience and of course spent in the shop.

We had a totally amazing day which far-exceeded all expectations. We would love to return!

Plan for this at least 4-5 h and visit the restaurant as well, it is pretty impressive for kids! Loved the restaurant concept and that food was handed to kids by robots! Though there is room for improvement regarding food! But food is deffinatelly much better than in the Legoland Park!",Aug 2018
Denmark,MDE_Bass,LEGO House,5.0,"If you love Lego, please spend your money here and skip Legoland (or do both). We visited both and this was totally worth the money. We spend a whole day here (from 11am-7pm) and we could have stayed even longer. Why? The building is great, not only the architecture, but also the atmosphere, everything is clean, good climate control etc. There are very nice activities to do, you can just build in the red zone, but also make stop motion movies, design your own lego figures, take part in a rescue adventure on the North Pole using robots and design your lego car and take part in a race, etc. They have build very very nice Lego cities, landscapes, dinosaurs etc. If found these more beautiful then the ones I saw in Legoland. And, all the Lego House people were so nice and helpful. For example, my daughter loved the Lego bracelet of one of the Lego House people and she immediately was offered to wear it for the rest of the day to give her extra building power (thank you Stine!). Also the technology worked really well, the bracelet you get makes it possible to save all pictures and videos and download it via an app on your phone. My 6-year old did not need any explanation to use this.
What is also very clever is that in every zone, there is also a Duplo area. So if you are going to Lego house with an older child and you also have a toddler, this is perfectly doable. You can be in the same area with the whole family and while one is building a city the other one can play with the Duplo train. And there is also a very nice and clean nursing room, including a microwave and comfortable chairs to nurse your baby (see picture). We really doubted whether we would go as a family or one of us would stay home with our newborn, but the facilities were so good that it was really not a problem and we were happy that we decided to go with the whole family. I would say that it is interesting to go if your oldest child is at least 5 years old (and you love Lego too as a parent).

Some tips for your visit:
We visited Lego House during summer holidays and we did not have to wait to take part in activities at all. I asked and it was not a super busy day (we visited on a Tuesday) as that day were 1100 guests and on a busy day there could be around 1400-1500 guests.
We planned our visit time at 11am, but we phoned and it is no problem if you come a bit later. You can enter the building for free, you only pay for the experience zones / museum etc. You can go in and out as often as you want. If you do not want to eat in the restaurant there is a lunchroom in which you can eat your self packed lunch (or sit outside), or you can go to the bakery around the corner. The building is not really big, so if you bring a toddler who can walk already, there is no need to bring a stroller. There are also many lockers to store your belongings, you are also allowed to store your stroller at the information desk. The parking garage is close by and costs 10 DKK per hour, the parking Lego House Vest is on Granvej and this one is for free and only a 10-minutes walk. Enjoy your visit!

Denmark,RomseyChechy,LEGO House,5.0,"Children aged 12-8 and grandparents all enjoyed a fabulous visit.
The entrance square is open to all and open, clean, spacious and welcoming. The staff are really helpful pleasant and friendly. Through the day we lost three cards that were rapidly replaced with a smile
Each area had its own special attractions and it was hard to move on. All the exhibits were amazing and there were thousands of Lego bricks for us all to play with.
I think the highlight for all the children was the robot supplied meal in the mini chef. Ordering was done with Lego bricks and the food was served in large ‚Äòbricks‚Äô. The menu was good with baked fish or meat balls as well as beef burgers. Each child had to choose a ‚Äògreen‚Äô option of coleslaw, raw veg or salad and everyone got small pressy. K98 a child for reasonable meal so good value for Denmark.
This is all indoors so no problem if weather poor. Only slight negative is that we had a combined ticket with Legoland. It‚Äôs 1300metres and shuttle not easy to find. You can spend most of the day in Lego House, so better to go to Legoland another day

Denmark,bumps94,LEGO House,5.0,Visited with 5 grandchildren who thought it was a fab visit. Lunch served by robots was a unique experience and the grub ok as well. Young staff were adorable with unfailing smiles and good humour. A must do if going to Legoland.,Aug 2018
Denmark,Stephen P,LEGO House,5.0,"So we came to Legoland last year and heard rumours of this new place... this year we already had tickets booked before we set off. Loads of great reviews but you never know until you see it. Well we had 10:00am tickets. Got there for 9:30 and didn‚Äôt leave until after 4pm!! All the ideas are in many ways pretty simple (not animations robots!!) but so beautifully executed it makes them all together spellbinding. We were so impressed that my 6yr old (well on her birthday) asked to go back the next day... so hang it all we did. Great decision. We went later on, after a stint in Legoland and ended up there for another four hours. If you‚Äôre not interested in Lego... don‚Äôt go. But if you do I think it is a must visit attraction.
An important mention about the staff there. They were wonderful. So kind, most importantly, knowledgable, enthusiastic. Whilst they may have left me alone to build away in the creative zone they would always stop and chat to my daughter (6) and see if she was ok, or wanted company/help with her builds. Nothing was too much trouble.
The photos and movie stored through your visit on your wristband also worked brilliantly and extended the fun when got back to base and downloaded it all. Certainly went to town going to the photo stations on our second trip.
We ate at the mini chef restaurant and while the food is fine, the fun we had ordering it and getting it justified the visit and the cost.
Basically we all had 2 fabulous days here and I can‚Äôt praise the concept, execution and staff enough. Although I loved all the building my secret favourite bit was the history section and watching the story of Lego film and then going through the entire back catalogue and selecting all my childhood sets. Loved it!!

Denmark,LittleNorway,LEGO House,5.0,"We visited Lego House with two children (2 and 5 yo) and had a very very good time. LEGO has really made an extraordernary place.... one whole day was almost too litle time. Not at all like inside ¬´Legoland¬ª - this was skolering totally different! Ps remember to hold firmly to the food container you get from the robots at the Mini Chef restaurant, or else it will explode on the floor...",Aug 2018
Denmark,sculptor-for-fun,LEGO House,5.0,"We went to Lego House for the day. My expectations had been low, but I was totally surprised by what an interesting place the House is. The building was designed to look like it was built from, of course, LEGOS, and it does. There are large public areas accessible without paying any entry fees. But the most fun was inside in the various theme rooms.
I think most of us played with Legos as a child. And I think Lego brings out the child in each of us when we play or visit a place like Lego House. They had many very creative areas...make a stop action movie with 3 cameras...build a fish out of Legos, then scan it, add facial features and watch it swimming in the virtual aquarium, build race cars and race them against other car builders, or run it down a ramp to jump through a hoop. The possibilities are endless and there must be millions of lego pieces to play with and build to your heart's content.
There's a giant tree, 3 stories high made of Legos. There are huge dinosaurs, cities, mountain scapes. It's incredible to me all that has been done and can be done with Legos. I had no idea...! They even have a sense of humor with a Lego dog peeing on a lamppost in the main lobby area, complete with a Lego puddle on the floor!
In the basement of the building, there is an exhibit on the history of the Lego Company and all the toys they've built, starting in the 30's with wooden toys. The history of the company, their growth, operating cycles, potential failure, resurrection and multi-generational family control was fascinating. There were also 3 short movies which chronicled the history as well.
So if you want to have a fun day, take your inner child, your children or grandchildren to Lego House. It's a whole day experience of fun and games.

Denmark,stephanbrummelhuis,LEGO House,4.0,"We visited 4 August 2018. Family, 2 kids in the age of 7. We had a marvelous time. We spend the whole day (almost 10 hours) there. There is a lot of interaction, play-areas, stuff to do, robo-gaming, build your own fish, even make your own movie. So don't think you should combine it in one day with Lego-land.
Now the hard part, we didn't want to leave the house (witch we could have... and come back in again) for lunch. The experience of building uour food with Leg o and having it delivered by two robots in a large Legocontainer is great. So much for the show... the food was almost in-eatable. Surtainly not appropiate for kids. They ran out of meatballs!!! My daughter when for the chicken, but was very disappointed. It was fried so dark you could hurth someone with it, so I ate that. The vegies where to large and hard so my wife ate them :-( For this heavy prized meal this shouldn't happen.
All the same, we surtainly would come back to the house, but eat out ;-)

Denmark,apactraveller,LEGO House,3.0,"This is the most recently built Lego attraction and is a pretty decent day out - however it does not whatsoever justify traveling to Billund for this - you have basically several levels of different ways for kids to interact with Lego pieces and frankly not much more... the Mini Chef was probably the highlight (and for this you don't even need to pay to enter the main attraction) with surprisingly god food considering the appalling quality served at Hotel Legoland and in the park.

Overall, a must-visit if you find yourself in this area but not worth a specific trip for this.

Denmark,twickers11,LEGO House,5.0,"We were a family of 9 people, 4 children 11 downwards and 5 adults including a Granny and Grandad (me)! We all, without exception, loved the experience. It is within 10 minutes walk of Hotel Lego where were staying so very convenient. We had bought tickets and meals in advance online so hassle free entrance. The kids and adults went straight to work on the amazing range of brick pits that are placed around the fabulous new building that is the Lego House. It is a very immersive experience and we got there at about 13.00 having flown in on an early flight from Heathrow. We left happy and full of good food (served by robots) at 18.00. There are so many fantastic displays, many of them interactive, that I could not begin to do them justice nor describe them but suffice to say you couldn‚Äôt dream up any more-everything is there. The kids loved it and the little touches of personalised ‚Äúcredit cards‚Äù accompanied by little Lego brick gifts made it very personal. The people who designed this place deserve huge congratulations because it kept a very diverse (in terms of age) group of people very happy for many hours and, on the hottest day of the year in Billund we were glad it was air conditioned.

Denmark,traveling_smiles,LEGO House,5.0,"I have to admit that I took more pictures of my Lego creations here than my children did. I loved the option to take a shot of your work at a kiosk and download it later. Biggest hits were the stop motion video making and rescuing the wooly mammoths from the ice. The sculptures throughout are mind blowing (technic dinosaur!) and each themed area allows for slightly different play. It's also nice to have some outdoor play areas when you need a bit of fresh air.
We did pay the ridiculous amount to eat in the mini chef restaurant which was not at all worth it to me nor did I like the food. The kids loved the experience there & hated the food. Since they still talk about it I still give it a high rating.
Our son entered one of their tower building competitions in the lobby and was kicked off the leaderboard by a father. It would be nice if they had separate competitions for adults & kids.
We made the mistake of picking up our unique build code & bag of red bricks before going upstairs - do this on your way out instead so you aren't carrying the bricks around all day.
The staff was amazing too - so friendly even singing Happy Birthday to our son during his visit!
It was a fantastic day and I'm sure we would have had an equally fantastic day had we gone back a second time.

We spent 6+ hours here and the entire experience was one of the most memorable during our recent trip to Germany and Denmark. you really get to experience and play with Legos under various environments. In between, you can see the exhibits and the lego museum. I would make sure you visit this place, even more so than the lego land park.

Denmark,LAC1030,LEGO House,5.0,"I live in Denmark and followed the building of LEGO House. It was hard to find someone to tell me what LEGO house actually was.....a museum? an amusement park? a learning center? I visited LEGO house for the first time shortly after the opening with two of my grandchildren ages 3 and 5. This was a fantastic experience and I discovered, finally, what LEGO house actually is! In my opinion, it is a combination of it all....museum, amusement park and learning center. Maybe amusement park is no correct as there are ‚Äúno rides‚Äù. The are many activities however that entertain all ages. We were there 5 hours and the time flew by. I have been there several times and look forward to my next visit. The building itself is worth the visit. The playgrounds on the different outdoor levels are all fun for kids. There is a fantastic view from the top of the building. I can only hope that everyone who visits Billund, Legoland or lalandia takes the time to visit and experience the new concept called LEGO house. You WILL NOT be disappointed, no matter your age.

The mini-chef restaurant inside was very different and so cute for the kids. Food was good too;),Jul 2018
Denmark,scrapheapchallenge,LEGO House,5.0,"If you want to see both lego land and lego house, plan two separate days as each one requires a whole day to experience. If you can only do ONE, and like outdoors and lots of rides, then legoland is for you, however if you like more hands-on lego play experience for all ages, and all indoors for inclement weather, then choose Lego House. Also be sure not to miss the Mini Chef restauraunt for an unforgettable dining experience.

The lego house is far more than just a museum, it is jam packed with hands-on lego play areas for kids and adults alike. I visited using my powerchair and found it very accessible - even the exhibits were easy to join in on because they are already at kid height, so also handy if you are in a wheelchair. There are lifts to each floor, and decent accessible bathrooms.

The bathrooms have sliding doors which I found easier to open and close than swinging a regular door. It is not a ""changing places"" bathroom (ie it doesn't have a platform for changing adults or large childen) but it is roomy and has helpful fold-up bars to assist in transferring from wheelchair to toilet, however the bathroom I used only had space for this on one side of the toilet, I didn't check the others.

As well as a fascinating history section in the basement, and the many areas to play with lego, there are also dioramas in both lego and duplo with a day and night cycle and moving parts. The shop is large and well stocked, as well as having interesting lego sculptures up around the ceiling area. There are play areas out on the roof although I didn't attempt to access these, so didn't see what the access was like to them from inside the building.

You are given some lego to keep, such as at the lego making machine, and at the restaurant, where you build lego to order your food, but for the most part the lego is to play with and leave behind, not to take home. There is however an innovative system whereby you can take your build to a station in the area where you can have it photographed, and use your wristband to add it to your account, linked by an app so you can view your builds later at home. When you leave your build for others to see, you can inspire the next person, they may improve your design, rebuild it, or staff may even decide to display it for others to see in future!

I definitely think that lego house is more fun than lego land, and especially if the weather isn't great, it's perfect. Be sure to pre-book like we did, so that you don't have to wait for entry. We booked for first thing in the morning as it opened, so it wasn't too busy.

Denmark,Moorpool,LEGO House,5.0,"This isn‚Äôt cheap but given you‚Äôve travelled all that way, you must go. The children with you will be entranced and will have a wonderful time. Adults will find that age is no barrier to getting fully involved either.

Another must is the lunch served by robots, again not cheap, but a unique experience much appreciated by the children. You order the food with Lego bricks and while it‚Äôs being prepared models can be built using the trays of bricks either side of the table.

Endless variations of bricks, colours, shapes, functionality and sizes that are organised around interesting and inspiring themes and tasks. Children and parents/ grandparents can engage for hours within a LEGO universe that brings families together in creative play.
We spent nearly six hours (including lunch) and could have carried on.
It‚Äôs a fluid organisation of the different zones making it easy to move around or just stay put for as long as you wish, or return to previous zones.
There are ways of interacting with music, photography, stop motion and animation which brings the bricks/ compositions to life. The children loved it.
It was also great to visit the historic collection downstairs to bring back memories from our own childhoods in the 70‚Äôs.
We had an excellent visiting experience and highly recommend a visit while in Billund. It brings a high quality LEGO playground for the whole family.
The lunch restaurant is a chapter of its own. Absolutely fabulous fun building bricks to order food and using the playful technology that you find elsewhere in the house. If there is a queue (which is very likely between 11:30-13:00) you‚Äôre given a monitor that allows you to carry on playing while you wait. Totally genius for families with hungry children!!! They forget that they are waiting.
We‚Äôll be back next time anywhere in Jutland. It‚Äôs even worth a long detour!!!

Denmark,Georges888,LEGO House,5.0,"LEGO House is not only for children. You‚Äôll be hard pressed not to use your imagination. In fact adults were creating more than the children and both shared their inventions. It‚Äôs quality time well spent developing one‚Äôs creativity and fostering it in others both children and adults alike. The exhibits live up to their expectation as they truly invite guests to use them and develop items from imagination. It‚Äôs not cheesy as one would expect from American theme parks but is more attuned with the intelligence of all ages. Nothing cheesy about it. No costumed people running amok. The staff is extremely helpful, courteous, polite, and professional. They embody LEGO‚Äôs mission. They are not there to collect a paycheque but are passionate about the mark and everything it stands for. It is worth visiting even more than Disneyland. A memorable trip for all whether your in Denmark or neighbouring environs. Do make a stop or a trip. You will not be disappointed. Again exponentially better than Disneyland.

There is so much to do that the hours fly by so make sure you go at the earliest time. We have 3 kids (15,12,10) and they LOVED the whole day. My husband and I also participated in all the building/creative tasks and that made our kids very happy. We also went to Legoland while we were in Billund but if your kids are into LEGO then you have to visit the LEGO House as there was no interaction with LEGO in Legoland, it still is great but LEGO House is much better. Our family would go back again in a heartbeat but we live in Ireland so it probably won't be happening again for a long time :((

Come for opening and stay until closing. Book two days because one is simply not enough!

Eat in the Mini Chef restaurant and drink over-priced coffee in Brickaccino, a reference to The Lego Movie. Yes, it‚Äôs on the menu board at $37....

The experience zones are incredible. There‚Äôs so much to see and do, play for hours. Read a book in the library. Make a stop motion video and take a tour of the history collection.

Spent 8 hours there and all the activities available were 10/10. The kids loved it!

State of the art facilities, from interactive wristband tickets which linked to the LEGO house app, the opportunity to make your own stop motion LEGO film, to a fantastic dining experience.

Denmark,Lelah23,LEGO House,5.0,"I was conquered by my son telling me about it, checking it on the internet, and seeing a review and the Netflix documentary !!
I do believe you don' t have a complete LEGO experience without it. Also, I think it should be much strongly and heavely advertised cause..it's a blast! And something different. And expressing the Danish soul i guess...
It is obviously I strongly enjoied it: the Mini Chef restaurant and the Trex-es in the Masterchief Gallery were my favourites, but the outside terraces and their small surprises waiting were a plus, too! Just lavishig and procrastinating there..whule my son was completely into LEGO making movie or LEGO something ‚ô°
You have to see it for yourself and i strongly recommend you do it! At least once in a lifetime.
Oooh..let's not forget their LEGO dtore and the personided mosaic portret!! We got it! I know..expensive, bit life is a thrill and i think it' s a unique idea and uniquely placed..in Billund, in Denmark. Do..do it once there :)
As a summ-up, i loved all the ideas in there: the playfulness, the easy acces to anything LEGO, the personalised 6 bricks, tge free luggafe storage, the wristbands and their uploading and..the foood! It is genial, something else!
Thought of every little detail. Indeed, only the best is enough.

Everything is done to perfection.

The member of staff were the most friendly nice people ever! they actually knew a lot about lego and had a lot of interest in it!

The restaurant mini chef, was spectacular- not going to spoil what it does but it was really fun and good value for money! MUST DO!

Very easy to access from the airport- only 2 bus stops away!

As for the paid admission, adults are well advised to put down the proud demeanour and fully immerse in all the ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù. I thought I will just breeze through the experience zones as I wasn‚Äôt interested in building any blocks. Luckily Lego House staff were perceptive and took care of all guests by explaining how things work. From then, it was wow, Wow, WOW and I‚Äôd stay much longer had I not have a train to catch.",May 2018
Denmark,Nurse7042,LEGO House,4.0,"We booked our tickets 6 months in advance as I wanted to ensure no hiccups on the day of our visit.

I did do my research on the location of the parking but really why do you have your parking so far away from Lego House? It was extremely badly signposted and there was no shuttle to transport visitors to Lego House. I felt extremely disappointed at this stage... So we walked the nearly 1km back to Lego House... Again had we not driven by Lego House first we would not have found it. You need to up your game as we traveled nearly 10 000km to come and see Lego House and yes my expectations were high.

Once inside things improved immensely. The staff are genuinely friendly and helpful and very knowledgeable when it comes to Lego. The kids loved the whole experience and we stayed right to the end.

I didn't find the same enthusiasm in the Lego Store unfortunately. They didn't accept the Euro currency yet as the cafe they didüò¢

Denmark,CJF37,LEGO House,5.0,"A totally amazing lego experience with impeccable design and thought put into the entire building. After a full day at legoland the previous day and a desire to get back to the Lalandia aquadome for some water slide action we decided to go for a 10am entry ticket, their first of the day, and stay until early afternoon. In fact we stayed until we had to leave at closing time as there was so much to do and play with. Each of the four coloured experience zones were really immersive lego experiences, with a clever digital twist, and we all enjoyed it equally, whether it our forties, 9 or 7!. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone although think you‚Äôd have to go with the mindset of wanting to play with lego. As the UK May half-term is later than the local school break we were blessed with a quiet visit which no doubt enhanced the experience. Make sure you also spend time visiting the gorgeous outdoor play areas on the many terraces which were also fun. Really appreciated the fact that your wristband memories could be downloaded to your device at no extra charge. We couldn‚Äôt find any local offers other than 10% advance booking.

Decided to drop in for a quick visit to this new attraction of Lego House and it was easily the highlight of our entire Denmark trip. Initially, I thought the visit would be for a 1-2 hours, but in the end spent most of the day there till closing time. It was simply much better than I expected. My 8 year-old daughter enjoyed herself tremendously with all the different imaginative activities and my wife was wow-ed by all the creations and sheer skill and expertise on display. And none of us are really big Lego fans at all.

Denmark,differentdubai,LEGO House,5.0,"I love LEGO, so this is the House you have to visit!

Great:
- special LEGO sets at the LEGO shop that can be bought tax free. They have the mosaic machine!
- it is new and you can see this in the LEGO and attractions, fresh, not broken
- they just launched the Bugatti Technic, great to see the real Bugatti
- please pay a visit to the restaurant Mini Chef. Expensive again (it is Denmark), but the experience is a must! Ask for the minifigure chef that only kids meals get!
- visit also (from outside) the original house where LEGO is born 60 years ago, just next to the LEGO House
- a lot of digital interactions

Not so great:
- it open only at 10 am and close already at 4 pm? What is this? You can not see the entire house in this time frame if you really want to play and see each item
- staff in the LEGO shop is 50/50, some of them are great and some of them are dreadful in customer service
- the LEGO pick a brick in the shop is ok, but not great in finding exclusive or hard to find bricks

We weren't too such what we would find and it was so much more than we thought. I was expecting a museum with lots of Lego behind ""do not touch"" signs . What we found was lots of hands in things to do and see. From helping to build a giant castle to designing cars and making our own fish! There are lots of outside play areas which were super welcome in the middle of a heatwave! The staff were amazing and we all had the best day. Our son got in for half price thanks to his legoland season pass, this had to be booked in advance online. The food was a little limited but the fact it was served in giant Lego blocks by a robot made up for that. We thought this would be a 2 hour visit tops but we were there all day and would have loved to go have a second time. Go and visit the Lego house, you won't be disappointed!

The catering wasn't that good, there was a choice of 4 items on each of 4 sections of the meal, the system couldn't cope with wanting just two items (fish & chips) so I had to order two items I didn't want. the meals were ordered from the table using Lego brick symbols, and delivered on a track system via a couple of robots in a pack consisting of 4 compartments held together by lego brick top & bottom. Unfortunately the package collapsed when being handed out at the table, and spilled all over the table knocking one of the drinks over.

The museum is an architectural masterpiece. It‚Äôs impeccably clean. The staff is polished, professional and hospitable. We travelled well out of our way to visit The LEGO House and we could not be happier we made the effort. There are experience zones that celebrate the value of playing with LEGO including creativity skills, social skills, emotional skills, logic, story telling and role play. There is a masterpiece gallery celebrating the ‚Äúfree-builds‚Äù of some talented fans from around the world. The museum, library, bricks factory and cinema are all excellent. There are multiple cafes that are equally interpretive of LEGO. You can have a gourmet fine dining experience or you can build your own meal via legos ... scam to a computer ... and have your food delivered by robot. This place is an inspiration as it celebrates learning and hope through play.

Denmark,HarrisonAster,LEGO House,5.0,"This is just so good! We love, love, loved the Lego house. The building is beautiful and airy (like a cross between ikea, an Apple store and Tate modern) and you feel inspired from the moment you arrive, looking up at the multi-storey Lego tree growing up through the hall. Every staff member we passed engaged with us and took time to show us things and help the children see or do something. To be honest, the kids would have happily spent the entire day free building in the rainbow pools of unlimited Lego - and we did spend so much time doing this we couldn‚Äôt do everything else that we wanted, so do come early - but each activity was a delight. We made Lego fish that swam magically into a big screen, and our own stop motion Lego mini movie (of which we are very proud.) The field of Lego flowers was so beautiful! And don‚Äôt forget the mini chef lunch - it obviously sounds a bit gimmicky to order your lunch with Lego but a) the food was fantastic, really really lovely and imaginative and b) it‚Äôs so cool! We had so much fun - and Lego - with it that it felt like great value, too - and for Brits in Denmark that‚Äôs saying something. We are not Lego connoisseurs but are already dreaming of a return trip. Superb creative, imaginative experience.

Denmark,Bethan M,LEGO House,5.0,"Legohouse is one of the most beautiful places we have ever visited on the planet ! It‚Äôs certainly the most creative and inspirational space we have been to !
I took my son, age 11 to the ‚Äòhome of Lego‚Äô. He literally ‚Äòlives‚Äô Lego, so we were hoping that it would be a very special day and all our hopes were exceeded. It really must be visited to be believed. A fantastic experience for Lego and architecture fans alike.
We reached the building after walking through the beautiful Sculpturepark. As you leave the park you can see the side of Legohouse and nothing prepares you for the impact !
It‚Äôs just amazing ! As we entered the building we had an overwhelming feeling of wellbeing, my son could not believe it !
I don‚Äôt want to spoil it for any readers, by telling you ‚Äòall‚Äô as I would only wish that your future experience is as wonderful as ours was & want you to to enjoy the ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor too!

A few things though worth a sneak preview though !
There is so much to do inside and outside of the building. we arrived at 10am and left at 7pm ! We were happily exhausted, but there are so many opportunities to sit and just build Lego together which is really what it is all about.
- Mini -Chef restaurant is the best fun ever, a unique dining experience that only ‚ÄòLego‚Äô could have created !
- The red zone building experience was amazing. We were so lucky to have met Christian there, he was so kind and an inspiration to my son, Thankyou.
- We booked to do ‚ÄòThe Architecture tour‚Äô with the lovely Anders who was informative, warm and very funny, Thankyou !
- We were also extremely lucky to have met Gitte who was a new member of staff. She was so lovely and enthusiastic and will be a fab member of the Legohouse team, we are sure !
So, big thanks go to Christian, Anders and Gitte, along with all the other wonderful members of staff for making our day a magical and memorable one. They all go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. We will live off our experience there until we can visit again.

Denmark,Zsuzsanna W,LEGO House,5.0,"I am so glad we came to see Lego House. I superbly enjoyed every minute of it. It's so well thought out and presented in every detail. We only spent an afternnon there after coming from Legoland, but I wish we had more time here. I loved the tree of creativity, such a great idea and very well presented. Really represents what Lego is about.I had an opportunity talking to one of the staff members about it, and she told me so many interesting facts about it. Also, loved the exhibition, lots of facts, but not overwhelming. For some reason I couldn't find the exhibited Lego sets and digital well, maybe I just walked passed it for some reason, I don't know. But it was still brilliant to see where the whole story began. I watched the 3 mini films, which were interesting too, loved the bean bag idea. It made the room unusual not so formal, if someone fancies to lie on beanbags rather than sit down on chairs.
Loved the 3 dinosaurs at the top level.And the corner brick on the top. It was like a crown on the building.
Also, it was fascinating to see the brick making machine, how the bricks are made and pick up a small bag, freshly made bunch, with my unique card. The shop had lots of sets and other items. The Building a Dream book is so nicely put together I couldn't put it down. I thought they could do with some more souvenir items, like postcards, fridge magnets, and all the little bits and bobs, not just mugs and keyrings. Maybe a point to improve on?
I would have probably enjoyed the different rooms, just time was very short for us this time, but they are all so well designed too, with every detail telling another story.
Of course I had to climb to the top of the building too from outside, and stand on the cornerstone and just see Billund from above. We couldn't see it from the airplane when we flew back at night, but apparently it can be seen lit up, if you know where to look to,and the plane goes that way of course.
The only other improvement I felt would be to signpost/advertise it better from Legoland. I know Billund is not a big place, but maybe not everyone is aware of Lego House as it's not next to Legoland.
The entry ticket is good price and worth all the money. We only tried Brickaccino , so can't comment on the other restaurants on site, but we were pleased with it.
Overall, well done to everyone dreamt of this place,all the best for many years to come and if you're a visitor, don't miss out on this gem. You won't regret it!

It's such a unique experience because it's so fully interactive with your wristband. I also loved being able to download the app and get all our pictures and videos from the day on my phone. Every little detail is amazing and do go all the way to the bottom floor to see the history exhibit of Lego and watch the film about the family business. I cried a little at the history exhibit. It's a very special story of family, innovation and the indomitable human spirit! Bravo, Lego!

Denmark,Chris C,LEGO House,5.0,"An excellent venue. Very interactive, typical of Lego. Good for 4 hours of entertainment. Would suit older children rather than toddlers. Very much sums up the quality brand that is Lego.",May 2018
Denmark,Kath_IMO,LEGO House,5.0,"I wish I could have stayed longer, and most of the adults looked like they felt the same. The kids were having fun but so were the grown ups. Stuff to see, stuff to do, stuff to build, stuff to read, to learn, to watch, to interact with...even a bit of computer programing; literally something for everyone. The only thing I was disappointed with was that in the store they have a photo booth which snaps a pic of you, then produces the design, blocks and instructions to build your pixelated portrait in relief. Great fun, fabulous idea, but at 999 kr (roughly 100 euros) I thought it was silly that they could only do one face at a time. I would definitely have paid for one if I could have had a joint picture with my husband.

Nevermind, I had a BRILLIANT day at Lego House anyway. Absolutely 100% recommend.

Denmark,Darren,LEGO House,5.0,"I visited the lego house with my 4 year son, my fiancee and her family so there was an age range from 4 - 50 and everyone enjoyed the Lego house more than the actual park!
It was great to say we've visited the home of the brick in its first year of opening!

Staff were very friendly and the dedication that has went into the sculptures in such a short space of time is incredible!

There were loads of 'play areas' that you'll find people of all ages building away keeping no track of time and having fun.

The gift shop has some really cool lego exclusives that you won't find anywhere else.

This is a real must for any lego fan and fun for all ages.

The robot restaurant: 3/5
Expensive but an experience.
I would recommend booking a time when you arrive so you don't have to wait. We received a buzzer and were told it would be a 25 minute wait. We ended up going back to the counter 45 minutes later and asking what was going on. They apologised and seemed to have messed up the booking. It was a little frustrating waiting so long and when we were eventually seated there were plenty of tables available.
The food was very basic although the system was cool in which you order and collect it.
The restaurant is definitely one of those things you will only do once.

We spent a good five hours at the house and probably could have spent longer (had only landed that morning and all were extremely tired from the early start).

There is things to do in the Lego House for all members of the family with areas which allow you to build, areas to observe some amazing constructions along with a museum which was very interesting.

If we had the opportunity again we would with out a doubt return.

Denmark,James A,LEGO House,5.0,"Billund, Denmark; the home of Lego. Nearly 90 years ago the founding family of Lego started their business, first as carpenters, then wooden toy makers, and then moving with the times into plastic. They weren't the first to do a plastic brick, and doubtless they won't be the last, but they are the best, and it would take something very special to change that. The Lego House is a stunning piece of architecture in this funny little town, where to be quite honest- there isn't much else. For fans of lego though there's a full days activity here, exploring the different interactive zones and trying the many and varied tasks and challenges. There's also a great museum which walks you through the story of the brand, and some incredible displays. Occasionally they run tours of the factory and if you get an opportunity to do this it's a real privilege (pre-booking essential). A wonderful place for people of all ages!

I'd recommend this for any Lego fan, whilst it had a lot of activities for children, my friend and myself managed to spend nearly 3 hours in the house. The museum in the basement was very good, the dinosaurs were amazing, the huge city and mountain scenes were so good we spent ages looking at them. There is a Lego store on site and the restaurant is a must just for how you order and receive your food, although the food itself wasn't great for how much it cost.

It is simple, thoughtful and excellent. We startede at the LEGO tree 11.000 kg og bricks and almost 16 m tall and startede building for the first 20-30 min. LEGO is mesmerising. Everywhere you scan your id and take pictures that you get when you home. This is a modern 20th century playhouse for all ages.",Feb 2018
Denmark,physalis,LEGO House,3.0,"An interesting experience and I would say it's worth at least one visit for all Lego fans. However, it's very much catered for younger kids: I'd say under the age of 12. Unless you are a die-hard, super passionate Lego fan for whom Lego just can't do any wrong, it gets boring after the first 10 minutes or so. There are multiple play areas where kids get to play with various Lego pieces. They call it ""experience areas"" but I would describe it nothing more than themed play areas with different brick pieces that kids get to put together in free play. There are no particular challenges or organisation there.

I think it would have been nice to see how Lego is actually made but there is nothing like that. It's just literally an opportunity to see a little tiny bit of Lego history, which is mostly few photos of the family and few old boxes of Lego, play with Lego pieces and, of course, buy some things in the Lego shop.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend this trip to anyone, who is coming in winter or any time when the theme park is closed because it's simply not worth the money. Especially if you intend to travel from Copenhagen. Combined with the theme park, it may well be worth a visit but on its own, it's quite dull.

A trip from Copenhagen will take you nearly 3 hours one way. A train ticket for a family of three cost us nearly 250GBP plus entry to the Lego house that was nearly ¬£75 for the 3 of us, so over 300 GBP in total just to play with few lego bricks.

It is worth it but only in so far as to see the place of origin of the wonderful Lego idea. If you are planning a visit, try to come when the theme park is open. Otherwise it's a massive waste of money.

We were a party of 10 people of all ages from 6 yrs to 79 yrs old, and we all had a great experience and we stayed for 5 hours only leaving then because we had booked a table in the Greek Taverna, in Vejle.
We had tried to book the restaurant in the Lego House to have a gourmet meal, first they accepted our booking then sent an email they could not help us as we were 10 people? however when we there in the house there was no light or sign of life in that section, so maybe they have a problem with the idea?

The food was good and hot and was a large meal.

After 6 hours we were all exhausted and all of our expectations were exceeded! We particpated in many of the activities. The stopmotion videos and the city planning stations were our favourite.

The showcase builds are fascinating and we looked at the displays for hours. To say they are amazing is an understatement. Look for the monkeys in the tree!

We had lunch at the Mini Chef restaurant. It is an expensive meal, but a highlight of our visit. I highly recommend you include the Mini Chef Restaurant in your experience.

Denmark,TravelMonkey814,LEGO House,5.0,"We visited LegoHouse in late October for my son's 8th birthday. While I feel that LegoLand is geared more toward younger children, Lego House was a magical enchanting experience that the entire family enjoyed. There are plenty of duple areas for younger children and the activities are designed to appeal to even the most advance builders but can be accessible to children at the same time. We arrived at 10am and stayed nearly nine hours with about an hour break for lunch. At the time we visited, it never felt crowded. The staff is friendly and clearly all love building Lego with offers to help & play alongside. I appreciated the strategically placed hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the building and my kids loved the camera check in points in which you could photograph your creations & it stored your experiences in the app which you could later access with your ticket number. My son's favorite activity was the Story Creator in which you make a Lego movie, while my favorite had to be the Fish creator in which you build a fish, then scan it and it appears on a video screen ""tank"" and swims around with other created fish. It's clear that the entire experience has been thoroughly planned for guests' ease and enjoyment - starting with the personalized wristbands that provide locker access and access to the camera check-points, to the final gift of a personal lego brick combination and a bag of legos fresh off the in-house production machine. We only booked tickets for 1 day and purchased tickets for Legoland for the next day, but the entire family would have loved to return for a 2nd day at Lego House.

As a family of four, we spent over six hours and could have stayed for at least another two.
Get there at least an hour early to get your wristband, check the outside and play in the roof top play areas. Getting there early will allow you to explore the areas open to all, visit the shop (And buy the exclusive items of course), and put your coat and knick nacks away in the free locker (Once you have your wristbands).
Once you are in, just explore and enjoy.
All the interactive stuff is superb. A great mix of manual builds, group interaction, and technology. And that is even before you examine the fantastic model displays and the truly stunning Tree of Creativity.
It was not busy at all when we went, everywhere was clean, the staff were super friendly and helpful and we even saw the CEO of the Lego House itself.
We had to try the Build Youur Own Meal, and while it is quite expensive for what you get, the food was hot, and it was quick.Bear in mind that drinks are extra and there is no pudding menu !!
Brickaccino offers something different, again, expensive, and limited choice, but worth a quick visit for a top up of energy to see you through the day.

The absolute strength of this house is its celebration of the human imagination, and creative mind. Well done LEGO!!",Oct 2017
Denmark,AyCeeUK,LEGO House,5.0,"We visited the Lego house on the second day it was open during a trip from the UK to Legoland. There were 6 of us aged from 4 to 70 and there was so much to do for everyone. We were inside for over 6 hours and never ran out of things to do.

There‚Äôs the history collection and cinema (showing 3 different 15 minute films - Lego adverts through the years, Lego designers and Lego history) which is fascinating and a great way to remember the Lego sets from our childhoods.

After that is the main experience zones which allow you to build everything from minifigs to fish to flowers to cars. The masterpiece gallery has the most amazing detailed Lego build which I could have spent hours looking at!

As it‚Äôs a new attraction I was expecting it to be so busy but it wasn‚Äôt. The controlled entry times mean that there was always plenty of space at all the build stations and barely any waiting for the photo stations. There were plenty of toilets and they were kept extremely clean. I was impressed with the number and quality of baby changing facilities too.

The best feature is the wristbands you get. These are used for entry and then once you‚Äôre in there are cameras in every zone to take pictures of your creations which link to your wristband and you can download when you get home. The wristbands also work the lockers to store coats etc during your visit.

At the end of your visit you get a bag of 6 bricks (which you can watch being made in a machine in the main square) and a unique design to build (there are over 913 million combinations using just 6 2x4 bricks!).

Every single member of staff we met was fantastic. They were brilliant with the kids and very friendly and helpful.

After our visit we went to the Mini Chef restaurant. This was 169DKK for adults and 99DKK for kids (I think). Here you are given a bag of bricks each and a menu. Each menu choice is linked to a brick so you build your meal and scan it at a machine in the table and it sends the order to the kitchen. It was a little confusing at first as we couldn‚Äôt get it to work but once we‚Äôd figured it out it was good fun. The meals then are delivered in Lego boxes along a conveyor belt near the ceiling and down to a couple of robots where you collect your meals. You need to be watching your screens at the table to see when your meal is ready to be collected as there‚Äôs no audible notification and it‚Äôs not obvious which boxes are for your table until you get up close and read the receipt taped to each box.

There wasn‚Äôt much choice for the meals, especially for a fairly fussy child like mine! You choose from 4 main meals, 4 sides, 4 vegetables/salads and adults can choose 1 of 4 warm sides too and kids get a gift (Lego house minifigure). The Lego boxes that the food comes in opens up to become small plates/ bowls holding the food - a minor downside to this is they take up a lot of room on the tables.

Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with the quality of the food. The fish I had was cold in the middle and the chips were over cooked and very hard. Other people in my group enjoyed their meals though, except for my fussy son who ended up just eating a few chips and a tiny bit of chicken and I had to buy him another meal from somewhere else later on!

The novelty factor of this restaurant is worth a visit but the price, quality of my food and lack of menu options means I wouldn‚Äôt eat here again.

Overall the Lego House is a brilliant day out got any age and fantastic value for money and if I ever visit Billund again I will definitely come back here.

Denmark,BeanoBoys,LEGO House,5.0,"We were very fortunate indeed to go into Lego House on the first full public day, straight after the official opening. I have been so excited to visit so soon as I realised that our planned trip to Billund corresponded with the opening of the house. The most important thing that you need to know is that it way way exceeded my expectations. I knew it would be great but the reality is, it‚Äôs totally amazing. Even if you don't want to visit the bits you need to buy a ticket for, you will love this fascinating building. The best way to understand it is by walking over the top to visit the children's playgrounds on the terraces and also the crowning 2 by 4 Lego brick. You can also visit the Square inside, the restaurants and the well stocked Lego Shop without buying a ticket. If you are a big Lego buyer, you will have a VIP card - and this shop accepts it so you can collect points on what you buy and spend your points too.

The ticket price of 199 Kroner (about ¬£25) is exceptional value for money. You can play with a great selection of Lego all day if you want to. I saw loads of adults, some appeared to be grandparents, totally lost in the brick. Carefully studying the task and creating masterpieces. The place is really ‚Äòhands-on‚Äô and as they restrict the number of tickets, it shouldn't ever get too crowded. I challenge anybody NOT to have fun even if you have never considered Lego as a pastime.

If you want to see everything the Lego House has to offer, be prepared to stay all day.

Three tips - there are 2 prices for coffee / hot drinks. You might reasonably expect this to be small and large. In fact the cheaper price is to use the self service machine, the dearer price is for if the cafe staff make it for you. Also, the lockers are really clever - perhaps too clever. Took ages to work out how they work even after reading the instructions a few times. Thirdly, get the app on your phone. That way you can see the photos that you take in the house using the essential wrist band that you are given when you enter.

Denmark,Mark D,Romo Island,5.0,"Romo, is a large island (with only about 700 inhabitants) located in Jutland's South East. It can easily be reached [even by public bus] as there is a large, long, free 10 kilometre causeway linking it to the mainland! There are many wide [which may get 400+ meters even wider when the tide is out], long, white, fine sandy beaches which can be enjoyed by wind surfers, wind drawn ""carts"". One is permitted to drive a vehicle onto ""designated beaches"" [see the Tourist Information bureau for additional information]. Kite enthusiasts also find it a pleasure [in early September there is a ""Kite Festival""! In the summer many ""Naturalists""/nudists enjoy the complete freedom due to the size of the beaches! When the summer season is over it is also a favourite by those seeking solitude- in a very natural area! One can ""camp"" [tent, trailer or Motor Home] at the various ""campgrounds. There are also restaurants, bars and a supermarket... It is definitely worthy of a visit!!

It's one big stretch of a beach. There's no rocks, and the shell range is limited. The beach is truly enormous.

Denmark,Lauren T,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"Rosenborg Castle is a great place to spend a couple of hours (especially if the weather is nice). Located right down the road from N√∏rreport Station, it's easy to get to and makes for a great day trip when combined with the Botanical Gardens across the street and Torvehallerne (for lunch, dinner, or something in-between) which is right down the road. At Rosenborg, the only thing you have to pay admission for is going inside the actual castle; student tickets are about 85 DKK, and a locker is included (no bags are allowed inside). There are some spectacular artworks and collections of ornate items, as well as the Crown Jewels and weapons. Definitely a great place for pictures, both inside and outside. The grounds are great to walk around, and it's a very peaceful area. I spent about an hour inside the castle, plus another hour or so wandering around outside. You could definitely spend 2-3 hours here. Highly recommend if you're visiting Copenhagen.

Denmark,Poisonwells,Rosenborg Castle,3.0,"Rosenberg is a must see in Copenhagen and there is some interesting history and some wonderful items of jewellery on display. I would have preferred more information to have been available in written form, either in the rooms themselves or in the display cabinets, especially in the treasury. I don't have a smart telephone and I noticed that there were many people of all ages wandering through the rooms who seemed to have neither information on what they were looking at nor any knowledge of how to get it. Perhaps one is meant to buy a catalogue in the bookshop? If so, then of course I should have done so. Thus my advice to the visitor is to determine your source of information before you enter the collection because you won't find any information, not even the identification of a portrait, once you are in.
There seemed to be neither lift, nor easily accessible lavatory and you had to exit the exhibition via a spiral staircase. Were I even slightly waling impaired, I would check out that situation before just turning up. The staircase was a bit of a gruel.

Denmark,Livelove laughplay,Rosenborg Castle,4.0,"In July 1995, when my son was 2, we visited this castle and, when admiring the Crown Jewels, noticed an empty display case was open. After I commented on this, an alarm rang and guards ushered us out at gunpoint, ordering us to stand against the wall with guns pointed at our heads! Suddenly my 2-year-old escaped my grasp and ran down the grassy slope.
Terrified, I yelled ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt shoot!‚Äù and begged for permission to bring him back. The guard nodded so I ran after my son, and carried him back.
After some time we were allowed to go, never knowing if the jewels were recovered.
This is probably why they now make you take your phone in a plastic bag, or use lockers.

Among the main attractions is the Knights‚Äô Hall with the coronation thrones and three life-size silver lions standing guard. Tapestries on the walls commemorate battles between Denmark and Sweden and they are out-of-this-world and one-of-a-kind masterpieces. A hint...don't think the Danish guards are a photo op and don't get too close.

Denmark,Karen186424,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"Great castle to visit in Copenhagen. Just a short walk from N√∏rreport station. Tour passes through castle in chronological order so you learn quite a lot of Danish Royal History. A floor plan guide is provided but these were quite difficult to read in some rooms because the lighting is low to protect the exhibits. We found it a lot better to use the iPhone tour. Really easy with no download required. Just point your camera at the QR code in each room and the relevant info came up on the internet browser. (Free Wi-fi in castle) There was also more info than on the floor plan guide. If you find the initial rooms a bit drab, don‚Äôt give up - they get more stunning. The great hall at the top is amazing with some brilliant tapestries, glass, bronze and porcelain cupboards. But the best bit is the treasury. Loads of Ivory, jewels, gold etc but this isn‚Äôt like visiting the English Crown Jewels where you are on a conveyor belt and only get a timed glimpse, the Danish even, very considerately, provide steps so that you can admire the crowns, up close, for as long as you like!

However, nothing could dampen our moods. The park outside the castle was already so beautiful. We had a marvelous morning with good sunshine in the cold weather! The well-kept and clean environment was a great motivation for all of us. We enjoyed taking pictures and strolling around the park.

The many items included with the crown jewels are well curated and include English translations which provide interesting insights into how the royals lived.

This could be a difficult visit for those with physical challenges as access to the elegant upper level throne room, as well as to the lower level spectaclar crown jewels requires navigating steps.

Denmark,Anita,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"Visited the Rosenborg castle on a rare fine day in early August - was told rain and grey sky was the norm in Copenhagen.

My 6-year old daughter is obsessed with royal families and queens and princesses, and insisted that we should go and see the Crown Jewels of the Danish Royal Family. She made a fine choice for mummy who couldn‚Äôt be bother to plan ahead.

We were wow‚Äôd by the beautiful castle set on very beautiful grounds. Having visited Buckingham Palace and Amalienborg on the same trip, I know we had to join the guided tour on Rosenborg in order for it to be engaging and interesting for my daughter (and for myself).

Having arrived early, we had a walk around the grounds and had an ice-cream each before we headed into the reception in the museum shop. The thing to remember is that you can‚Äôt carry any bags with you, you can only carry a bottle of water each in a clear bottle. There are lockers inside the museum shop and we managed to get a coin from the reception with our tickets to use the lockers for free. I did see that others used Danish coins to utilise the lockers.

Our guide was a volunteering university student who spoke great English. Before we started our 2-hour tour, he was excellent in laying out the visitors‚Äô rules clearly to the group of 20 on the tour, warned us of keeping away from the royal guards (they were on duty, not part of the display!). He was actually quite effective in keeping us together in a group moving through the castle on a very crowded day. He delivered excellent trivia, stories and other details about the castle and the monarchs who lived there while guiding us through the well maintained castle. We were thoroughly impressed by the history that has been preserved in every object in this place. In fact, I feel I could now understand the humourous side of the Danish culture which was reflected in some of the design features of the castle.

The Crown Jewels room didn‚Äôt disappoint. It was a highly secure area and all visitors were supposed to keep voices low in order not to set off the sound-sensitive alarms. Our guide was quite serious about this and even told off those not on the tour but in the room at the same time as us about their noise level. It was such a treat being able to see so many pieces of fine art up so close. I found the variety of the jewels displayed in this room a lot more interesting than the British Crown Jewels collection displayed in the Tower of London.

While we didn‚Äôt visit every single room on the tour, we didn‚Äôt feel like going back in again even though our tickets would have allowed us back in. Instead, we took a while shopping for souvenirs in the museum shop before spending some time strolling around the beautiful grounds of Rosenborg. We were so lucky to have great weather and a great guide on the day of our visit there.

One of which was The Trouser Watering Chair that was from the time of Frederik III. It was an ingenious device that would grab hold of a guest using hidden bindings in the armrests. A bound person would then be subjected to running water, which came from the backrest through a pipe in the seat. When the victim was released and could stand up again, a toot sounded from a trumpet hidden in the seat: Yep, you guessed it, it was the first whoopie cushion!

Then of course there are the crown jewels, a must see

I read there was a combined ticket to see Amalienborg Castle and Rosenberg castle.

Denmark,Linda L,Rosenborg Castle,3.0,"I enjoyed visiting this museum but I did not like that I had to download a link which gave information of the plots and rooms. My husband was never handed a brochure when he paid for a visit so we o lu had the link to use. It was awkward finding the rooms matching the link. Overall, I think a guided tour would make this stop much more interesting and enjoyable.

Do not go if you have walking issues. Lots of Spiral staircases. The Crown Jewels are in a separate building and again stairs can be a concern.

I‚Äôm happy that I had the opportunity to go but there is a lot of walking.

One last note, we took the hop on hop off bus to get there and we were dropped off at an area where no crosswalks were present. crosswalks located closest to the entrance would be nice. .

Inside the castle, you'll find an amazing array of items to view from paintings to tapestry, ceramics, swords and the Crown Jewels. Helpful tip: The process when we were there was that we got a ticket from the ticket office (included with the Copenhagen Card if you have that) which will have a time for entrance. You must leave backpacks and purses in a locker which they will give you a token for when you get your ticket. We went right when we arrived to get our ticket and had about a 30 minute wait before we could start touring the castle. There was plenty to walk around and see while we waited but we were glad that we went and got in the queue when we did. Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did!!

Denmark,vatravelingbug,Rosenborg Castle,4.0,"Every inch of this castle's walls and floor spaces, it seems, is covered with art. It's a hoarder's dream of high-class, rich art and furniture all neatly arranged and kept up. That said, it's one of the most poorly labeled ""museums"" (for that's what it really is. Sure, there's an app, but it's definitely not user-friendly. First you have to figure out the floor you're on, then the room, then the piece of art you're looking at for it to be helpful. So if you really want to know what you're looking at and learn, I would encourage signing up for a guided tour. I don't know how good they are since we didn't do that--but after touring the castle wish we did.
Also, this is one of the most rule-bound, user-unfriendly place I have ever visited. The officials are very rigid (you can only carry a small purse;anything bigger than say an 3x5 index card MUST be locked up. And you're given a time ticket and woe be to you if you try to enter 30 seconds earlier than the time stated.

Denmark,Rodney B,Rosenborg Castle,4.0,"We toured the castle while in Copenhagen. The grounds are nice. The castle has many rooms with all kinds of artifacts from the past 500 years or so including weapons, jewelry, carvings, artwork, and a bunch of eclectic items like a mirrored room, a handmade music box, and a prank chair that would lock the person sitting down and squirt them with water. You have to exit the building and then enter the basement rooms through a separate entrance in order to see the weappns and the crown jewels. They don't allow bags or bqckpacks in the museum, but they have lockers at the tickets counter and gift shop. Worth a visit.

There were only 2 others and they were busy taking pictures so we had the guide pretty much to ourselves. She was a font of information (history major) and gave us a great overview of the history of both the country and the monarchy. Plus she answered some other questions we had about Danish life in general. The crown jewels were amazing to see and are included n the tour. Extra bonus: The royal drum and fife corps were performing with a children's drum and fife group on the grounds of the royal living guard just below the castle. The garden is also lovely. All in all, a lot of bang for your buck.

Denmark,BigHugh51,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"While enjoying our second stay in Copenhagen, we again visited the Rosenborg Castle. The castle is located in the central part of the city but it is surrounded by the botanical gardens and other parks. Because of its location, the castle is easily accessed by public transport followed by a walk through the surrounding parks and gardens.
However, as we did for our first visit, we simply walked from our hotel located in another part of the city to the castle and took in a host of sights along the way.
Unlike during our first stay in Copenhagen, this time we had Copenhagen Cards which provided us with free access to the interior of the castle.
Visitors to the Rosenborg Castle need to be aware that it is actually a Danish Royal Palace. Consequently, security is very tight. If you intend visiting the interior of the castle, you will be required to leave all bags in lockers adjacent to the ticket desk in the gift shop. Basically you can only take cameras\phones in with you and not much else.
If there are a lot of visitors at the castle, you may be required to queue outside the main door. It was our experience during this visit that the attendants at the entrance would wait until about 20 people exited the castle and then they would admit 20 people waiting in the queue. Fortunately, we didn‚Äôt have to wait very long at all before being admitted.
Whilst this was not the largest palace which we had ever visited, it was certainly full of splendour. The somewhat ordinary external castle appearance belies the fabulous art, furniture and elaborate decorations within. The area of the castle which can be accessed by the public is spread over several levels requiring visitors to make their way between the various levels using staircases. Because the number of visitors allowed access to the castle is controlled, it was easy for us to move about within the castle without rooms becoming too crowded.
We probably spent the best part of an hour within the castle and certainly enjoyed our time there. Highly recommended as a place to visit in central Copenhagen!

Denmark,cisco289,Rosenborg Castle,4.0,"My wife and I visited Rosenborg Castle, partly because admission was covered by our Copenhagen Card and partly because it is so close to a couple of other museums we were interested in. It was also a stop for our Hop Off/Hop On bus. We waited for the time on our ticked, then self-guided for about an hour. There are many rooms with walls and ceilings that are so covered with paintings, etc, that no bare spots are visible. The portraits of the nobility are countless, and the furniture is terrific. Overall, it was a nice castle to visit (especially on a rainy day) and probably very impressive if you have not visited very many other castles during your trips. The gardens are also very nice and worth your time.",Aug 2019

They sell timed entries on the internet if you know what time you will arrive. Otherwise you can just show up and take your chances. We were able to enter within 15 minutes of our arrival. They provide a nice brochure that shows you the route through the castle and since they limit the number of people by using the time entry sysem, the place isn't overrun with tourist groups.

Denmark,Jessica L,Rosenborg Castle,3.0,"When checking the entry times, look at the castle website and not at a guide book. The DK guide book to Copenhagen says the castle is open until 6 in the summer months (including August), however this is incorrect, the castle was only open until 5 when I went (on 14 August). Also I'd recomend arriving there earlier in the day as entrance to the castle is via timed slots so you don't know when you'll actually get in.

After realising the castle was only open until 5 we rushed to get there, reaching it at 3:15pm we were expecting to be able to go in right away. However we were given a timed ticket for 3:40pm, assured that still left us enough time to see the castle and then we were left to awkwardly hang around trying to seek shelter from the rain until it was our time to go in.

With your tickets you get a bit of paper telling you to connect to the free wifi so you can check out the castle website. Once inside it becomes very clear why - there are absolutely no information boards in any of the rooms in the castle. Thankfully whats on the website is very informative and myself and my Mum were enjoying reading it. Unfortunatley if like us you enjoy reading about the place your visiting 1 hour 20 mins isn't enough time to go round and we got hurried up twice and had to rush through the last few rooms. If only they'd actually let us in when we arrived. They try and clear the place at 5 on the dot with military prosicion - when I went to the toilet after our visit a rather rude member of staff tried to get my Mum to leave without me.

We got a timed admission for 4.30 which gave us just 25 mins to look round and 5 mins to pick up our possessions from the locker as the staff said they promptly close at 5. Personally I think they should have a timed admission to go into the basement (a separate entrance) because the ground and upper floors were not that busy. It would also have been helpful to advise visitors what to see in such a short time rather than have to speak to a staff member. Clearly the Crown Jewels and the collection in the Armouries is the reason for coming but the tapestries on the top floor were excellent. I‚Äôm sure if we had had more time we would have given this palace an excellent rating.

Denmark,laureldg,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"This small fairytale-like castle in Copenhagen is well worth a visit as it is more intimate than many larger and grander castles in Europe. This castle, built in the early 1600's, was the favorite of Christian IV who died here. There is even a showcase with his clothing from a battle in which he lost an eye and the earrings he made from the shrapnel as a gift. The throne room was spectacular with one throne made from narwhal ivory surrounded by 300 pound bronze lions. The Treasury room contained the crown jewels of Denmark, including Christian IV's coronation crown, which are spectacular. The castle itself is surrounded by beautiful gardens. This was my favorite of all the castles we visited in Denmark.

Denmark,Marty Bielicki,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"The Copenhagen Card will get you in for ‚Äúfree.‚Äù Even if you have to pay, visiting this Castle is well worth the price.

We walked from Nyhaven and came through the gates to see the beauty of Rosenborg Gardens. There is good reason why over 2 million people visit here. The grass is emerald green and the trees are beautiful. The actual ‚Äúflower garden‚Äù is by the castle. Don‚Äôt miss the statue of Hans Christian Andersen as it was approved by the author during his life time.

We have been in bigger castles, but there is a distinctive ambiance about the Rosenborg Castle. Completed during the reign of Christian IV in the early 1600‚Äôs, it reflects the Dutch Renaissance style. As you go in you may see the Royal Life Guards still on duty protecting the Castle.

What we remember most is the Baroque style throughout many rooms. The Long Hall particularly comes to mind as it is ‚Äúregarded to being one of the best-preserved Baroque rooms in Europe.‚Äù

The history of Rosenborg is intertwined with Christian IV. He was quite a robust person who spoke several languages, would actually fight in the wars he directed and fathered 25 kids with several women. He died in this castle at the age of 70.

Christian IV did lose an eye in one of the battles. He took shrapnel in the head and made earrings from the projectiles as a gift. The earrings are easy to miss and so we asked around and actually found those earrings in a glass case.

The Treasury Room, indeed, should not be missed. It is there were the crown jewels and crowns are on display. The actual king and queen crowns are rather mesmerizing to say the least. What I found most interesting was a gift by President Lincoln to Frederik VII back in the early 1860's. It was engraved Colt Revolvers that were completely knew to Europe at that time.

The visit is in two parts.
First, you visit some of the rooms in the castle. Some are rather nice, while some are dark and not offering so much interest. But overall, it is a very nice path that takes you through the huge dining room, the ballroom and the coronation room.
Second, you go to a distinct entrance and you get to see the crown jewels. There are not so many to look at, but they are beautiful.

If you are on a schedule, beware of the queues as there is a maximum number of people that can get in at a given time. We arrived at 12:15 and were appointed the 13:30 timeslot (not so bad)... so you have to plan accordingly.

So, hot tip, if you want to maximize your time, buy a ticket online and pick a time. It turns out, this a big tourist bust site, with loads of people coming from the cruise ships taking up the morning slots. (When we left, most of them had left and there was no line at the ticket window.) The upside is that it was not very crowded inside and I was able to get pictures with no people cluttering up the scene. We spent the time relaxing in the small caf√© eating a delicious pastry and people watching. Note also, the building is not air conditioned and even on a moderate temperature day (low 70's) there wre places where it was a bit warm.
All of that said, it's a very interesting place to visit; lots of Danish history contained in this single building. There are a couple ways to be guided along; one is via smartphone; there is free wireless and a website one can access that gives room-by-room information (audio or text). Or one can use the free printed guide available at the ticket counter. Note that it's dark in many places making it difficult to read; I just used the flashlight on my phone for those places. The highlight of the tour are the crown jewels; they are spectacular. But also within that area are some very impressive solid gold works and, in another area, beautifully crafted works of ivory as well as amber.
This is a must-see site in Copenhagen.

Denmark,Aamnas-Travels,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"I stumbled across Rosenberg Castle and Gardens after an afternoon spent wandering in the botanics (they‚Äôre pretty much down the road from one another so good sites to combine into a day trip if you get there early!).

The grounds are very picturesque to great for taking some holiday pics. In the grounds there was a lot of variety of unusual flowers along with a very pretty rose garden. The castle itself looks great from the outside and is surrounded by a small moat!

I unfortunately didn‚Äôt have time to go and visit the castle from the inside but even if you don‚Äôt have time for that, I think the gardens and grounds are great to just wander in for an hour or two and definitely a great place for a picnic stop!

Denmark,Mel S,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"What a great place to visit. You can begin by walking through the King's Garden and snapping some wonderful photos of flowers you've probably never seen before. While wandering about, we came across a rehearsal of an unusually presented piece of theatre but were not there to see an actual performance. The statuary dotted the park area and was interesting. By far, the best part of the day was a visit inside the castle itself. There are so many fascinating objets d' art to see such as the lathe, the musical cabinet, (don't miss out on hearing it play), the porcelain and, of course, the crown jewels. It is easy to get to by public transportation.

Used by the Royal Family until about 1710 it is now the place where all of the royal jewels are stored and showcased in the ""basement."" The upper floors are filled with portraits, furniture, tapestries, and memorabilia directly related to generations of the royal family. The reception room on the second floor is particularly stunning with its thrones and wall murals that depict the country's ongoing wars with Sweden. Don't leave without visiting the basement to see the amazing collection of jewels, crowns, swords, solid god chess sets, and the like. The era of Danish greatness may have been a long long time ago, but it lives on at Rosenborg Castle. Get there early before the crowds overwhelm the narrow rooms and corridors.

Denmark,Jetlagged55,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"As royal palaces go, Rosenborg Castle is quite small. But the exhibits on display are beautiful, intriguing and very interesting. So a visit is very much recommended. To avoid being overwhelmed by crowds the tickets are sold with a designated entry time. If you miss your slot you won't get a refund. Bags are not allowed inside and free lockers are provided for visitors to leave their bags and valuables. Cameras are welcome and I saw no restriction on photographing anything, including the crown jewels.

A free guidebook is available which gives you a minimal description of each room on the three floors and in the basement. Placards are provided in Danish and English describing exhibits in more detail. QR codes give you a link to webpages giving further information if you have a tablet or smartphone with you.

After touring the three floors that are open above ground you can enter the basement and see more exhibits including the Danish Crown Jewels. Other items on display include collections of such things as antique firearms and ivory carvings.

The Castle is surrounded by beautiful gardens, separated from the rest of the park by a moat and walls. These grounds can be visited without charge.

Denmark,Blorrn,Rosenborg Castle,2.0,"Rosenborg is described as a castle but is really a small four story (not very) stately home turned into a dull and mediocre museum.

Expect a long queue and, despite timed entry controls, far too many people, plus cramped and dusty exhibits, indifferent portraits of the remarkably ordinary-looking Danish monarchy, and ornate but nonetheless underwhelming staterooms. All of this guarded by Danish soldiers who, plainly, would and should be somewhere else. Add minimal visit information and one ends up with about ten minutes' worth of museum plus the clear impression that:

- there really is a sucker born, or at least looking for something interesting in central Copenhagen, every minute; and
- whoever is responsible for all this knows that. This could be, well, good but why bother?

Instead, head to a real castle - Kronborg is good - and you'll have a much better time.

The Rosenborg Castle and its grounds is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in the heart of Copenhagen.

We took the S-train from our hotel near the Dybbolsbro Station three stops and arrived at the Norreport Station within ten minutes. From there, it was a brief walk to the main entrance. There's a lovely park frequented by stroller-pushing parents and joggers alike, and we sauntered across the narrow bridge that brings visitors across the moat.

Go to the ticket office to purchase an admission pass (somewhat expensive) and pay attention to your scheduled time- groups are admitted to the castle every ten minutes so if your entry time is later you can walk around the gardens.

Important tip: the Danish soldiers that guard this site are very professional, and they also carry loaded weapons for their primary mission of defense. Please respect their duties. Don't be the woman I saw dash into one of the red guard stations for a photo op who was promptly and tersely yelled at by an attentive soldier. And avoid crossing the soldiers' designated patrol path (basically the flagstone perimeter around the base of the castle). If you do, you may wind up on the receiving end of a push delivered with sufficient force to remind you that you have chosen poorly (as another visitor discovered to her surprise).

Once you have successfully entered the castle without getting shot, there are three levels to explore. As with many castles-turned-museums, the lighting is sparse to help preserve the various displays and exhibitions. Pictures are permitted as long as you don't use a flash. Each floor follows a single path that leads you back to the central, spiral stairwell with which you can access the upper floors. There are other rooms off the main hallways that contain art, paintings, musical instruments and other artifacts- these areas have installed glass enclosures for viewing which may frustrate amateur photographers like myself. C'est la vie.

The second floor is more of the same- classic portraits and various displays of accoutrements accumulated by the Royal Family. The third floor contains the expansive Knight's Hall, complete with black and white marble tile and the coronation chairs used by the King and Queen when they received important visitors. Tapestries, side rooms filled with elaborate dinnerware and three, large silver lions all attest to the opulence of Rosenborg Castle.

When you're finished viewing the castle's main floors, you can step outside and enter the Treasury (located in the castle basement and accessible with the same ticket). There are many luxurious trappings on display here, including an impressive selection of flintlock muskets, armor, swords and very large wine barrels. Of course, the main attractions in the Treasury are the Crown Jewels and associated regalia, all with shining gold and laden with jeweled insets. The curators have made an effort for the public to get good views of the items on display- there's a short ladder that allows one a top-down perspective of the sparkling crowns.

An enjoyable visit and one I consider a must-see for visitors to Copenhagen.

Some amazing items on display, a clock that when it strikes the hour plays a beautiful melody, maps and thrones etc. On exit there the treasure room where the jewels are kept, low roof but again worth the effort, try to avoid the huge groups as they mob up and block those narrow passageways.

Denmark,Anfrist,Rosenborg Castle,1.0,"Very bad experience. As a Copenhagen cardholder, you have to sit in long line. The line is very slow as there are a lot of discussions on baggage at the desk, this should happen before. They ask even that medium purse goes to locker, lockers are not optimal and you need a coin in a city which is largely cashless. All instructions are discovered on the way. The toilets are dirty. There was waiting time of 40 minutes to get to the castle, which we learnt after 20 minutes in line. They do not allow access to treasury even if it is different, so you have to wait for that as well. Badly managed, we did not have time to wait and exercise our ticket.

I decided to try again the following morning. I arrived at 9am, ready for opening and was allowed straight in. Bags are not allowed inside, so you are given a token for the locker, which will hold a backpack.
There are tours available but I was happy to guide myself around, following the map and using the information online, accessed by QR codes situated in the rooms (these are small and aren't always obviously seen so keep an eye out for them!) The palace is beautiful, with so much decoration and lovely views from the upstairs windows. The palace is guarded by soldiers, who change positions routinely, which is interesting to watch. The basement contains the Danish Royal Jewels amongst other precious intricacies.
If you are lucky you may hear the music box, which sounds every half an hour.
The palace is a lovely place to wander and take in the Royal culture, and you can easily spend an hour or more inside.
Entry is included in the Copenhagen Card, which I found a great resource during my weekend backpacking around the city.
The garden alongside is also beautiful, with a fountain and cafe.

Denmark,Prado 150,Rosenborg Castle,4.0,"Rosenberg Castle is well worth a visit while you are in Copenhagen. Located in very attractive grounds (now public parkland), the Castle is relatively small compared to others in Europe. The ticket office is easily located and there is a cloak room for bags, etc. Danish Army guards patrol the entrance and are insistent that you maintain orderly conduct and not treat the site with disrespect. Inside are several galleries over a number of floors which shown various eras of Danish Royal Family rule and the associated artefacts. The real highlight of the visit to the Castle is The Treasury in the basement of the Castle where various Crown Jewels are on display. This is also the last thing you get to see which tops off the tour nicely. Recommended.

We decided to check out Rosenborg Castle to put a lid on our castle visits for the week. The line to purchase entry tickets was quite long but seemed to be moving fairly well. During our wait, we discovered that once you purchased your ticket, there would be a wait of up to an hour before admittance was allowed due to the smallness of the castle. There were six in our group, and the two couples ahead of us in line had their tickets stamped for an 11:50 entry (it was around 10 at the time). As the last couple, we were told our entry time was 11 -- a mere 10-minute wait. The two other couples tried to follow us in at 11, but were denied entry. Once inside, my top desire was to see the crowned jewels. They were located in the lowest level of the castle. It was a nice way to end the tour. As we were leaving, the other two couples were just entering.

He castle itself is quite small but had four levels including the basement. Plenty of items of interest to enjoy including paintings, thrones, houseware items and other castle paraphernalia. I learns a lot about Christian IV who really made his mark on Danish history. I liked some of the old clocks, the thrones, and the dishware the most. I‚Äôd say the treasury with all the jewels, crowns and other valuables was also pretty spectacular. It didn‚Äôt take too long to see the whole castle and you could complete at your own pace.

The entire castle sits on beautiful grounds and gardens with some nice water features too. It‚Äôs nice just to walk around when the weather is fair. Even though you are in the city it feels like you are in the country.

Denmark,danoinec,Rosenborg Castle,5.0,"I purchased a Copenhagen City Card which includes free entry into the Rosenborg Castle. This castle is smaller than those you typically see, but well worth the visit as well as the park surrounding it. I rented a electric-assist bicycle that had a GPS map system on it and pedaled my way to the castle from the Central Train Station in Copenhagen.

When you obtain a ticket at the small cottage at the entrance to the grounds, you'll receive a specific timeslot for entering the castle so they can control how many people are clamboring about inside. While waiting, stroll the grounds a bit. Also, you must put your bags/knapsacks in a locker they provide along with a token to activate the lock.

I love the very ornate ceilings, grand fireplaces (darn near in every room), the 'hole' used to communicate to the other side of the castle, the tapestries that line the walls to help keep the rooms warm, the (kinky) mirrored room, and the Grand Hall. Don't overlook going into the basement which requires you going outside then down via another entrance to the vault where the crowns and other jewels are kept. Apparently, this castle suffered a couple of fires that stemmed from the kitchen. So, it was decided to move the kitchen outside to an exterior building. Didn't' help...it burned down, too!!!

Denmark,Stanley S,Rosenborg Castle,4.0,"such a thing. Relatively young for a castle it was ornate but nothing like the French, British, etc castles. It definitely had a more homey feel and I guess that fits with the Danish persona/lifestyle. The gardens were well manicured and lovely despite the time of year we visited. Even the ""moat"" was not imposing but fa friendly crossing. The military guards on site sort of knew their presence was ornamental and certainly not deterrent despite their rifles. We walked in through the gardens which lulled you into feeling pleasant before having to wait on line for your group time. Well organized, we did not feel rushed or crowded despite so many people there. You can also purchase a combination ticket for the disappointing Amailienborg Castle for a reduced rate. Inside the castle it was well preserved and the crown jewels did not scream aristocracy but more revealed a wealthy family line. Check out the collection of amber pieces. Overall. a pleasant few hours.

The shop was disappointing to say the least, very small and just glossy pictures of the Danish royal family. The castle is missing a trick here.

The use of QR codes throughout the castle for more information also works really well and made it very easy to get additional information on anything in the castle.

One thing I would recommend is to get there early, when it opens! When we got there, there was already a queue, but as we left an hour and a half later the queue was enormous.

Wonderful castle that is beautifully maintained. The museum is great, and there is a lot to see. If you go on the website of the castle and click ""your tour starts here"", you can follow along with the rooms as you walk through them and get information about what the room is, and detailed information about any of the specific items that you're interested in, I found this really helpful and interesting and would highly recommend it.",May 2019

The rooms are accurately furnished with period things. Like the title, the king lived well and collected valuable things. It‚Äôs small enough not to overwhelm you.

The treasury is also very good located in the basemen . Lots of swords etc., but the Crown Jewels are pretty awesome. Definitely worth a visit. Use the Copenhagen card if you‚Äôre here for a few days!

Denmark,Cairo27,Rosenborg Castle,1.0,"I reviewed this castle 2 years ago, when there were 2 ladies toilets for hundreds of people. The response was stating an upgrade was due and difficult to build more as building restrictions. This is a wonderful place to visit, it is one of the top 5 must sees in CPH. However, the lack of toilets for females is a disgrace. You are happy to open this palace to the public and take their money but provide inadequte facilities. I wonder whether you made the toilets into the unisex toilets like in most of CPH there would be further complaints? My husband did not queue and used the male loos. There were 10 ladies in the queue for the female toilets and then a group from MSC cruise entered and they too joined the queue. This is 2019 there must be a solution you are making enough money, so invest and provide. You represent the Danish innovation, a fabulous country!

Can get busy - so top tip - buy your tickets from the website on your phone when you get there. This saves having to join the huge queue for tickets. Also note no bags allowed in the house. Space is tight in there so no backpacks and shoulder bags - these have to be put in lockers in the gift shop (20 DKK coin required for the locker)

There can be long, slow queues to get in so I would recommend going first thing in the morning. Don't miss the weapons and the treasury in the basement. Many of the pieces have a fabulous story behind them - like the ""trouser watering chair"" (proof that 17th century rulers loved a bit of slap-stick), and the impressive musical cabinet from 1737 which still works beautifully. The castle is also very photogenic from the exterior gardens.",Apr 2019

Inside was stunning, stuffed with art and furniture. The corridors are narrow so be warned that you can 6e a to get pushed along by crowds and miss some of the little alcoves.

I loved the throne room. It was amazing. It's very interesting and very clean. You can get pretty close to the exhibits and things.

You also need to leave your bags in the locker room as you are not allowed to take them in. They are located in the ticket office and the gift shop.

Be warned, the castle can be hard to access if you are disabled. There are no lifts and the steps are uneven.

The crown jewels were lovely too!

I suggest booking online for tickets as it can get busy. It also shuts at 15:00 and they are very prompt at closing the attraction.

You don't need a lot of time to go though this castle, but it is one of the top destinations, so expect to wait... But don't let that deter you.

The castle has a beautiful garden outside with royal roses. The inside is decorated with gorgeous art pieces, vases, chandeliers, ceiling murals, and statues. While not the whole castle is eye popping... they are some amazing pieces in there.

You can tour on your own, just follow the directions inside. It has some of the earlier artifacts and history of the Monarchy and you will be in awe of the crown jewels. The grounds are well landscaped and very comfortable for relaxing or having a picnic. One of the further building houses the military and you might even see some military training going on.

1) it is 3 stories of a spiral staircase so if walking is difficult, this may not be a good venue.

The Automotive Museum was very nice, with many interesting cars. It would in my opinion have been nicer had the cars been arranged in chronological order. A separate aircraft display would have also been nice but they do take space.

Denmark,Ealianora,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"We came here specially to see Titanias palace again. And what a wonderful place it has here, very fitting!
But all of Egeskov is beautiful. The tulip garden is a hidden gem, the sculptures are nice, and the whole atmosphere is great.
Enough to see and do for the whole family. A great playground, a treetoptrack, mooncars, and of course exhibitions of cars and motors and planes.
But we spend most of the time in the castle, that‚Äôs still inhabited as well.
People working here are also very friendly.
Tip: if you spend 2 days or more here it‚Äôs more value for money to buy an annual pass.
We hope to come back here some day!

I had a great time walking this property and seeing all it has to offer. There‚Äôs certainly nothing they will not try at Egeskov Castle and super willing to make visitors feel welcome and happy.

The grounds were neat and very well taken care of and the castle in fantastic condition. Unlike so many castles around Europe, this one is kept up very well and lived in by the Count and his Family.

I loved the cars and motorcycles and could spend days wandering through them listening to each of their stories told.

I was privileged enough to meet the Count too and was extremely impressed with him and how humble and sincere he is. We had a lovely chat about our mutual interests in Harley Davidsons and motorcycles in general.

I look forward to my next visit and i wish I have more time then to explore.

Denmark,Frank D,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"My wife and I stumbled on this when on a road-trip. We were a bit dubious about going because it seemed to be a bit of a tourist trap theme park. But I am so glad we did go. There is something for everyone.

Yes there is a bit of a Disneyesque theme park feel to the area round the maze, and I am sure that in the summer months and during holidays it must get VERY busy. But in early September it was nice and quiet. The maze itself is good fun for 15 minutes, and even though we are both in our late 50s enjoyed getting out by going down the slide into the play area! :-)

The gardens are well set out and lovely to explore and the scenery all round, with the castle as a back-drop is just stunning!

There are several very interesting and well presented museums. The castle itself is magnificent - and go right up into the roof space to see the collection of toys. Easy to miss but you would really be missing out.

We hadn‚Äôt really intended spending the whole day there - but we basically did, getting kicked out as they were closing the gates.

My kids dug their heels in not wanting to go see a castle even as I told them it had a moat, looked like a castle, and had so many activities around it. In the end we were all glad I made us go. My older son was thrilled to climb the largest rope structure in Denmark and to ride the pedal cars, we all managed to get out of the maze (but not in an impressive time), we walked the treetop bridges, tried the stilts, made music in the garden, watched a peacock with her baby, sniffed the scent garden, and this was in addition to viewing the castle inside and out as well as the grounds around it and the antique car, plane, & camper exhibit. I'm really glad we took the time to go into the music garden & to see the campers. Only disappointment was as it neared dinnertime we found the sit down restaurant near the castle was closed.

The surrounding park is wonderfully kept though and it definitely provides a good platform for enchanting pictures.

Denmark,Eva Campos,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"When we went, we were expecting just the castle and the gardens, but the place was more than that!

There were different exhibitions in different buildings of the place (old tradicional houses). In our case, was a veteran cars exhibition of all kind.

It has a very big park area for kids with swings, a tree top walk and a big slide. There were also picnic areas and restaurants. So you can spend calmly the day with the family.

We could see that they had a program with concerts and activities too.

So at the end, a cultural visit of a castle has been transformed in a theme park in very nice way. The price of the entrance is totally worth it.

Ah! And outside of the castle there is a car parking (it's not easy to get there without a car) and a little free camping area.

I loved the gardens (Rosehaven was especially lovely), the castle in stately splendour that includes the charming and breathtakingly detailed miniature Titiana‚Äôs Palace, and my husband enjoyed the interesting motorcycle and fire truck (Falck) exhibits.

Only wish there was more detailed commentary for all the art and artifacts, history etc. We were given a pamphlet with a little information and there are some signs but would have loved to learn more. We had lunch at the pretty caf√© next to the White Garden - Italian cuisine - while the food was tasty, it was quite pricey even though it's self-service. Bottled mineral water - 500 ml for 28 DKK ouch and no tap water option. Many visitors brought their own picnics and there are many picnic tables dotted around the property.

Years ago there was a miniature castle filled with tiny treasures that lived in a stately home in Ireland , when the late owners gifted it to the Irish government in the 1960s the Irish decided to sell it!!

My son had fun playing peek a boo in the huge hedges and jumping and splashing in the puddles from the rain, the vegetable garden was fantastic seeing some huge vegetables growing and all the beautiful and different delilah varieties was amazing.
So many peacocks around the grounds as well.
We went on a Friday morning and was expecting it to be very busy, but there is so many different gardens around that we only ever ran in to a few people.
Even with the rain the castle is beautiful to photograph.

Denmark,blbttl74,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"We travelled out by train and bus which proved to be very easy as they both run regularly and to time!!
The approach from the road is impressive and the initial impression can be that the activities have overtaken the castle as the attraction. However the castle is well appointed and English descriptions are available. There are a lot of stairs to climb so not for anyone with walking difficulties. I am not aware of a lift but there maybe one?
The gardens re extensive and provide a great place for a walk or a picnic.
The attractions located in the former farm buildings, stables and carriage house are a lot better than we expected. There are over 500 motorcycles to be seen.......great if you are into motor cycles. Above this display is their storage area for future restoration - it is an area far more interesting than the m/bikes downstairs! A significant number of British vehicles of various eras in varying states of decay!
The maze I'd well maintained and actually not that easy to navigate......it takes longer than you think.
Food and Drink is available on site is a bit basic and was not as expensive as you would expect at a location like this.
Well worth the effort for a visit.

My wife continued to the castle tour. I can't review the interior since I didn't go inside. The grounds and outside of the castle are what Disney used for inspiration. Just beautiful.
I went to see the motorized halls. There are many cars, motorcycles, scooters, bikes, and a few planes and a helicopter to see. There are also campers and an old time general store. It was a great collection from the 1920's to the 1980's. There was also a separate collection of rescue vehicles.

Walk in the huge gardens enjoy the hedges, vegetable and flower gardens. The path takes you in a trip around the slot and gives a nice different view every time.
Inside the slot the rooms are very well setup and equiped with amazing furniture and things.
Huge collections of carriages, horse gear and motorized equipment is displayed in the old stables.
When you think you have seen everything you find huge barns with old cars, motor cycles, carriages and other vehicles.
Don't forget to take a peek in the attic, large unrestored collections are hidden there.
A walk in the tree tops as finishing touch and a bite at one of the many restaurants ends a fabulous day.

Denmark,Lars S,Egeskov Castle,2.0,"Hi,

Thank you for a wonderful day in the park and castle unfortunately it was raining heavily that day so we was not that much outside to appropriate the garden but we did get to admire it some. The entrance fee is high but manageable.

I would love to come again, but what strikes me was the service we received at the entrance, mind you at was pouring down we got all wet standing in the rain, we noticed a nice little sign saying you can buy pounchoes and umbrellas in the gift shop, so I was trying to get in, but was received by a rude guy in the shop telling me not to go inside. I would need a ticket. Mind you that there was a long queue with people standing so close that the little amount of shelter from the rain was occupied. So here I‚Äôm standing with 2 senior citizens a 5 year old kid trying to get some cover from the rain and gets denied entrance to the shop so we could buy some items that could help us stay somewhat dry and warm. Yes you might say we needed better clothing but we checked the weather forecast and it said only a few mm of rain. We was not expecting that much.

Denmark,ryanchong123,Egeskov Castle,4.0,"Decided for a daytrip to Egeskov Slot and it did not disappoint despite that I found the entrance fee a bit up there (DKK 220 including the castle museum - DKK 190 excl.).

The weather was great on the day so it was a nice stroll around in the area and the time easily goes by so spent around 3-4 hours there. In the end I will say that it is a great place with kids as there are some cool playground facilities (bridges between trees, mazes, climbing facility etc.). It is possible to buy fastfood there that are reasonable priced, but it is also allowed to bring food yourself to enjoy in the park.

They were having issues with the credit card machines so lines were long. When we finally entered, we ventured into the gardens onto the castle. The grounds are beautiful and you feel you have the place to yourself. The museum is interesting and a good informative lesson for the kids. The grounds thereafter are a bit odd. A car museum, food museum, hot dog stand and playground for the kids. We felt like we had embarked on an amusement park-ish area after the castle.

The castle is very small and the garden was not what we expected. For the price we paid, it was truly a disapointment. Go there if you really love vintage cars or just want to burn your money. Otherwise there are other amusement parks and castles that are much more interesting and not at all as pricey.",Jun 2017
Denmark,Kristian_Stern,Egeskov Castle,2.0,"First - this thing is more than 20 miles away from Odense (town), so it is a bit misleading ''thing to do"" in Odense and requires a bit of a detour to get there.. Check the map first before you decide to head there.
Second - although it is presented like a castle in fact it is more like ""Egeskov Amusement park"". Indeed the castle is there, but there are also gardens, various expositions/museums, playgrounds, fast foods, maze and other stuff. Which for majority of visitors (mainly with kids) I would assume may be great thing, as they can easily spend whole day there and keep their kids busy, but if you more up to historic piece you may be little bit disappointed (like in the end we were). As for the castle itself, although rather nice from outside and surrounded by picturesque garden, quite honestly inside is nothing special... Things like doll house and hand made carpet indeed are remarkable, but for the rest you sort of feel like in an antique shop...
Third - all-in-all I simply cannot stop having feeling this place is (even for Denmark) rather overpriced... Two options available only: Attractions+Gardens+Castle or Attractions+Gardens.
To sum-up: If you think about this place as the Amusement park and wanna spend whole day there and don't mind high admission fee, go for it. But if you think this place more as a historic site, don't expect anything special. Comparing to other sites in DK it is just an average (if not less).

Dog friendly to walk in the grounds and visit collections of vintage motorcycles, cars and fire engins. Waited for the day to cool off so we could leave the dogs in the car, backdoor open, to visit the inside of the Egeskov castle. By then many visitors had already left - so we could explore the castle's handful of rooms virtually alone!

Please note that the place closes at 5pm or at least you cannot enter then any longer. We tried that yesterday.. today, we spend 7hours here? We could have spend even more..

We couldn't help noticing that on top of all German visitors, there is much more other Finns than we are used to meet in Jylland region or in the other places of Fyn that we have seen.

Denmark,David N,Egeskov Castle,1.0,"If you visit Egeskov as a tourist, I recommend it, and I have taken visitors there many times. However, it was a miserable venue to give a lecture. The room,a remodeled stable, was too long, poorly shaped and a bit small to hold an audience of 140. It had bathroom style acoustics. The powerpoint screen was hung on one side rather than in the center, making it hard to see for many in the audience. The loudspeaker and microphone functioned poorly. There was no technical assistance available (as far as we could see), and we had to make the best of the equipment. A meal was served to the group before the lecture, but the staff disappeared, and nothing was cleared away. I ended up clearing off some of the plants, bottles and glasses, so we could put up the projector on the table - there being none permanently mounted anywhere. The images of the screen were not square but wider at the top than the bottom, an unacceptable distortion. Given the location of the screen and the tables, where was no good place to stand. Not one person in the audience was seated comfortably with the chair properly oriented toward the front. I have given lectures from Santiago Chile to Athens and hundreds of places in between, but this was the worst ever. I managed, but will never speak in that terrible room again. I do not understand how the management can risk there otherwise good reputation by renting out such an unsatisfactory space as a lecture site. Most of the problems were not peculiar to our visit, but require a financial investment. The food, at least, was fine, but with there were not enough waiters to serve it, and we also lost half an hour there, so the guests had very little time to see the castle or the grounds. In short, a nice place for tourism, but a dubious choice if you want to hold a meeting.

Firstly lovely gardens, especially the tulips at this time, they were magnificent.
The fairy tale castle slowly appears from behind high hedges to be revealed in its glory with an amazing reflection in the moat/lake, echoing to the cries of the roaming peacocks.
Inside the house was a fascinating look at the life of the family who lived their and their adventures big game hunting in Africa and elsewhere.
Then there was the utterly amazing Titania's palace. A fantastically detailed and large doll's house. you could spend hour just looking into the beautifully decorated intricate rooms.
Outside there are collections of all sorts of transport, from sleighs and carriages, to motorbikes and amazing cars. you can travel in style in a horse drawn carriage around the grounds too. there are cafes and restaurants and loads to do for children.

Various museums, veteran cars, motorcycles and bicycles, an old-fashioned grocery etc etc. Huge playground for kids. This time we went into the castle since the entrance fee now also includes the castle. The building is beautiful, originally built sometime around 1550 and well preserved. Note that there are quite a lot of stairs in the castle. You can easily spend the best part of a day here, but go on a day with nice weather. The grounds are vast and requires a lot of walking and on a rainy day it would not be pleasant. We had lunch in the italian restaurant, ok but nothing memorable. There are a couple of other places to eat as well. There is a museum shop where you can buy plants too. Free parking outside. Several restrooms.

They also acquired the last gown owned by Marie Antoinette, sadly never finished. The exhibits of carriages, cars, motorcycles and aircraft seem endless, filling several
huge hangar-like buildings. Everything is beautifully displayed, with good explanations in English as well as Danish. There is an absolutely incredible ""fairy palace,"" complete with its own mythology, which was recently acquired. A British artist created it over a period of 15 years for his daughter.

Denmark,Waitknowe,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"Egeskov Castle is just a beautiful place to visit. We were probably fortunate in that when we visited (October) it was quiet so there was no need to push through large crowds. I imagine it can get very busy in Summer. Having said that, the grounds are so large and well laid out with so much to see that even on the busiest days I am sure it would still be a delightful place. The castle itself is a beautiful place, which has made the best use of every inch of its stunning interior to show off the building and its contents to the best advantage. Titania's Palace dolls house was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen. The museums in the grounds were fascinating and had obviously been laid out by expert curators. Even to someone like me with no real interest in motorcars or motorcycles found it fascinating. The old grocers shop was an amazing look back at a lost way of life and the costume displays including the last remaining dress belonging to Marie Antoinette were amazing. Not sure about the model of the severed head in the basket though! At first when we saw the entry price of approx. ¬£20 each we were a bit shocked, but it was worth every penny and we could easily have spent the whole day there without tiring. If there was one negative, as a keen shopper I found the Castle shop hadn't been signposted well enough and we ended up missing it altogether! We would undoubtedly have purchased some goods there. The only shop we found was the plant shop at the exit which had a very limited range of goods. All in all though this is must see for anyone travelling to the Odense area

Denmark,889_san,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"The beautiful Egeskov Castle should not be missed if you are even the least bit interested in history ‚Äì and also if you are more into cars and motorcycles. The grounds are vast, the park lovely, with many different gardens within, and you can get a ride in a horse-drawn carriage for a pittance. Also, you get to pat the horses if you ask nicely.
The Count that owns Egeskov has done a tremendous job, and there are several interesting exhibitions, of old vehicles (cars, MCs, carriages etc) owned by precious Counts, and other displays. The medieval castle itself is lovely, and you can pay an extra fee to see the interior. No elevators, though, and four stories, so be prepared for some excercise. I would not take young children on a tour inside the castle, too many valuable and fragile items on display, but the grounds are more than enough for a long visit. Good food in at least three different spots, and a big outdoor play area for kids. The maze is fun, but quite easy to get lost in. Keep an eye on kids or you will be searching for them for some time..

It is not in Odense, you should probably take a train to Kv√¶rndrup from Odense (20 minutes, departure once in an hour) and then either walk 2.5 km or take a bus (I prefer walking, not that far away, really). The territory is really big, the views are enormous. And the castle is beautiful both inside and outside. The gardens are wonderful. Besides, there is a hammocks place in the park, where you may relax and enjoy everything you are surrounded by. Highly recommend for visiting. Thumbs up.

Denmark,Robert H,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"Egeskov is a splendid attraction with many things to see and do in addition to a tour of the castle. I enjoyed the tree-top walk - great for 'ariel' photos of the castle - the maze and the various museums. The gardens are most attractive and inviting and you are likely to see a peacock or two when visiting them. You can enjoy a meal in the restaurant, or a Danish hot-dog at a caf√©, spend hours in the museums - the automobile museum is a favourite, as is the recreation of a Danish general store. The castle is magnificent, and a tour of the interior - do see the amazing Titania's Palace - makes a fine conclusion to a very enjoyable day. The all-inclusive ticket price is good value. No surprise that Egeskov is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Denmark!

Denmark,J. Miller,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"This castle is the epitome of what we all believe a castle should be. In many ways, one can visualise the original fortification as a mode of defence. Yet, it is also clear that this castle was a home and, while this does seem completely natural too, it also seems a little incongruous. Victorian clutter in an ancient structure built for defence. While we were visiting, we were lucky enough to see the exhibition of the amazing dollhouse ""Titania's Palace"" built by James Hicks for his daughter. There is lots to see within the castle, but there's also plenty to do outside. The collection of vintage cars is fascinating and there are lots of physical activities for children to enjoy too. The gardens are lovely. I was first here in 1989 and much has changed since then. It remains a great place to visit and to learn firsthand a little more about Danish history.

The castle it's self is beautiful, even though you can't visit all of it. I found some rooms to be more attractive than others (I'm not a big hunting-for-sport fan), the views from the windows were amazing as well, and there's some local superstitions as well.
There are some beautiful gardens around the castle, playgrounds, old cars expos, shops, a greenhouse etc.
Definitely worth visiting with friends or family, works just as well for a school-trip.

We enjoyed this stately Castle with drawbridge and moat surround. We were amazed to find a large transportation museum housed in several buildings on the grounds. This included early time horse and buggies to automobiles and motorcycles. Their is another museum building for emergency transportation trucks and equipment.

You can walk to the garden, visit several museums on the estate; old cars are the best attraction for me. You are not tired because attractions are different and happy faces are around you. When you have enough, just can sit and wait for your children still running around, find a lunch or just a drink or ice cream. Again, you really need a whole day here.

Denmark,petergoode2,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"My wife and I are spending ten days in Denmark...and with a focus on castles and palaces, having completed four days in Copenhagen, we rented a car and drove down to spend three days in Svendborg.

Took about two hours, but on the way we stopped at Egeskov. And in this case, as spectacular as the photographs on the web site may be, an ""in person"" visit exceeds the photos by miles.

Just about ten to fifteen minutes north of Svendborg, a short jog off road 9 (highway), a couple of left and right hand turns had us at Egeskov. They provide a very nice map of their extensive grounds upon entry, and there is a short level walk to their exhibits, phenomenal gardens, and the castle.

As we had arrived early afternoon, we grabbed a quick bite at their cafe, we each had a very nicely prepared, tasty tuna/lettuce/mozzarella/tomato salad (the cafe is, interestingly enough, Italian themed, other offerings included pastas, pizza, etc). While dining in their outdoor area on an unseasonably warm and 100% sunny day, we had the unexpected pleasure of a visit from a peacock and peahen, who lingered within a foot of us, enjoying sprigs of parsley and lettuce we basically were able to feed them by hand...amazing.

We then meandered over to the castle, with its extraordinarily beautiful views from all angles...over a moat and in we went.

The rooms themselves are not outstandingly furnished, but there are some quite remarkable hunting trophies (seems at least of one every single animal to have ever lived in Africa is hanging on the wall as a stuffed head or skull). And the absolute highlight for us was Titiana's Palace, a dollhouse that took 15 years to create, and the likes of which one has never seen anything close to before, so much detailed work that one could spend hours just closely examining the miniature everything furnishing the enormous multiroom dwelling.

The formal gardens are spectacular, only exceeded in beauty by the sizable rose garden, some of the healthiest specimen one could ever hope to see, wish their gardeners would stop by our house and help us do half as well.

There is plenty else to do on site, but since we were tired, don't care much about motorcycles, we called it a day...but a perfect day as far as we were concerned.

It is a shame that this is off the beaten path for most tourists who spend time in Copenhagen and feel they have seen all that Denmark has to offer...our visit to Egeskov was a highlight of our Danish travels, and will never be forgotten.

Denmark,dgjohansson,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"This cluster of things to see is quite fascinating. Primary, you might go there for the nice castle and its park, but you'll also get 3 other interesting museums located within the castles grounds. The car and air plane museum, the motor bikes museum and the Falck emergency vehicle museum. On top on that there are many things to do for kids too, Segway jousting (extra cost), tree top walkways, garden mazes, playgrounds and more. All-in-all its an excellent place to visit. The car and bike museum might not be a museum which holds any special unique units but it is still interesting to walk through. The problem with the place is that it runs in all directions with even more micro museums on top of the main vehicles museums. There is also a historic shop museum, you can visit the storage with cars kept in waiting for something, there are temporary exhibitions and more. A full day needed if you go there and want to see all. Picnic areas available and several restaurants and fast food shops in the area. Free wi-fi too.

Denmark,Aaron,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"Worth the trip for the castle and the gardens themselves. Then there are all the cars!

We went on a day with great weather, and it was beautiful. The castle is nice and cosy, especially compared to Elsinore which we saw just a few days ago. It felt like a real home, not a space surrounded by masonry.

Then, there are the cars. Did I mentioned the cars? There is a brief explanation at the entrance of why the cars (and motorbikes, etc.) are there. It is not easy being aristocracy.

How we got there:
Took the train to Ringe from Odense (15-20 minutes). The train only has two cars, and at the Odense Station there were lots of people waiting on the **same**platform for another train, obscuring our train. Make sure you check the whole platform and not just go with the crowd.
Walked out of the Ringe Station and waited at the very small parking lot (saw a small crowd, figured they were doing the same thing). The bus stop sign is in the parking lot, not on the street, and has the timetable on it. The 920 bus will stop by the ""Taxi"" sign on the street. That is okay, it is very close and you won't miss it. Bus journey to Egeskov Castle is about 10-15 minutes.

How we got back:
Waited for same bus on the same road outside the Castle, but on the opposite side of course. Went right to the station. Get ticket from ticket machine.
Could not buy ticket because credit card did not have PIN (we have had the same problem in all Scandinavian countries and Russia), but lucky enough a nice guy was there. So we paid him and he bought the ticket for us (he was so nice that he actually did not want to take our money, but we insisted). Same train ride back to Odense.

What people say about the restaurant and picnic is true, but I didn't bother to bring food, so ended up eating at the restaurant anyway. It wasn't bad in any way, but nothing to write home about.

We enjoyed the museum (cars and motorbikes) but we were not as fussed about inside the castle. There was plenty to do, both inside and out.

We would go back again but we would take a picnic rather than eat at the restaurant, which was very average. The grounds had loads of opportunities to sit and take in the surroundings, and benches, chairs and hammocks were available.

The gardens were a pleasure to walk around.

It was nice to stroll around in the garden, and admittedly, there is a great number of other amusements, e.g. the top-tree walk, various playing grounds etc., but if you really just want to visit the castle, this is way too expensive and definitely not worth the trip. Denmark has so many other castles to offer, which are more interesting and less expensive.

The tree bridges were pretty high and there were several playgrounds. The kids really enjoyed. It was GREAT to have the opportunity to drive a Segway. We cannot drive them at age 10 in America, so my kids were thrilled. They enjoyed the maze and there were little physical challenges for kids everywhere, like wooden balance beams, stumps to jump along, etc. Note - you cannot cross the bridge on the moat. It is closed off. Would have liked a photo on there.

But after now having visited over two days have to say this is a absolutely outstanding visit with or without kids. There is everything for the museum curiosity, activities, entertainement and the amazing restaurent Cafe Jomfru Rigborg. A absolute must to visit.

Denmark,Laurel M,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"This was by far the most fun castle experience I've had. The castle itself is beautiful and well furnished with excellent descriptions. The big surprise is the collections kept on the grounds here. Cars, bikes, motorcycles, rescue equipment, planes, etc. There is even a Segway track!

For the kids, there is plenty to do, excellent playgrounds, with zip lines and towering nets to climb, suspension bridges through the treetops, a maze, stilt walking and all sorts of other fun things. We spent about 3 hours here, had I realized it had so much to offer we would have come earlier in the day.

Coffee, candy, ice cream and slushies were all available.

Denmark,Tornbo,Egeskov Castle,4.0,"Egeskov offers a lot; beautiful sorroundings, huge playground in the wood where our children could play many hours. It offers you a culture and historical trip back in time through the beautiful castle and museum with vehicles. We brought our lunch with us and enjoyed it in the park. There are good number of toilets. However the queue to the ice cream shop was not good at first you had to order and pay and then you proceeded to the next line and again we had to repeat the order.
Overall a good day and we will visit this attraction again because we didn't achieve to see it all :-)

Denmark,Scott_M_SubGuy,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"Number one of all the castles we've had the chance to tour. The interior is full of lovely period pieces, and the building is in great shape. The tour of the castle allows you to visit all the levels, including the lofts. Interesting collections of different things are found on the grounds, from antique toys to cars, many animal heads from hunts, and fuchsia plants. Take a few hours to really enjoy everything at a comfortable pace.

Easy driving distance from Odense (and probably Copenhagen), but check ahead of time to see what support will be available as most times of the year the cafes will be closed.

Excellent visit and highly recommended.

Denmark,bobjanh,Egeskov Castle,4.0,"Had a pleasant day out visiting Egeskov. The castle itself is lovely, both inside and out, and the setting superb.

Wonderful grounds for a stroll and the tulips were still in bloom at the time of our visit.

Plenty of activities available to keep children entertained. Great car and motorbike collections that would interest enthusiasts.

Part of the fun was getting there. We did not have a car so travelled by train out to the castle taking the local train in the direction of Svendborg, getting off at Kvaerndrup after about 20 minutes. The trains stopping here run every hour in both directions. From the station it is a 2.5km walk over flat terrain to Egeskov. Unfortunately it is along a road with reasonable traffic levels without a footpath so care needs to be taken.

A great spot worth the effort to visit.

Denmark,auroraPOZ,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"One of the most lovely places, and so much to do, or not, as you wish. The grounds are exceedingly well kept and truly beautiful themed gardens and we were there at absolutely the right time for the masses of tulips and the blossom. The castle itself is delightful and seriously built to withstand attack; one just wonders how many more artifacts are waiting to be brought up from the moat, funds and time permitting. An excellent play and activities area for the children and the historic cars, planes and motor cycles are well looked after and gleam! Best of all it still feels like a proper family estate.

I would recommend bug spray in the summer - our bug-averse child was extremely put-off by the swarms of bugs in the garden, which you must cross to get to the castle. That made for a rough start, but once he was calmed, the castle tour was nice and the fun kid climbing stuff to explore in the other section cheered him up immensely. Excellent stop in our Danish road trip.",Aug 2015
Denmark,Ann C,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"We last visited Egeskov about 6 years ago just about this time of year and it was great to see that they still have the wonderful display of tulips in every colour you can imagine. The parkland is beautifully maintained but not out of bounds to visitors with picnics of which there were many yesterday as it was a public holiday in Denmark. There is an excellent cafe where you can get soup, salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes as well as the usual range of hot and cold drinks, including beer and wine.
The weather was beautiful yesterday, but if you should go on a rainy day, there is still lots to see undercover, not least the castle itself. Everything is well presented and it feels that you are almost visiting someone's home with additional extras. One of the highlights for me was Tatania's Palace, an incredible doll's house created by an Englishman in the 19th century for his daughter. The detail is phenomenal and the collection of miniature household and decorative objects is breathtaking.
For petrolheads, there is the classic car collection and the motor bike collection, both housed in the old stable area and for children there is plenty of imaginative play equipment to help them work off their excess energy.
Plenty of parking and reasonable entrance fees make this a grea place to visit.

Denmark,jennifer h,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"I have lived in Denmark for 11 years now and this is by far the BEST castle (in my opinion) in Denmark. Privately-owned and well kept. If you are into the ""more classical"" castles, you may not agree. In the attic of the castle there is an old doll that has a myth attached to it. You may not move the doll or bad things will happen...but the funny thing is...there is really nothing around the doll (alarms/glass/etc.) to make sure that you don't touch/move the doll. The myth is enough to scare people from moving/touching her.
This castle is well known for its collections of old antique cars/motorcycles/airplanes. There are two or three LARGE buildings full of them! They also have a huge collection of dolls. It also has a maze on the grounds made of high bamboo. There is also tree walking and playgrounds for the kids. This is not your typical boring trip to a castle...even the kids love this place!

The castle is a museum to quite a few collections, vintage automobiles, vintage motorcycles, history of agriculture and many more displays throughout. We found it to be very fascinating. The interiors are stunning with each room offering something of interest.
It was lovely to see many activities for children, such a lovely place for kids on their school holidays.

Denmark,aquate,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"When we first glimpsed Egeshov Castle it was a dream-like experience. On a day when skies are cloudless it appeared like part of some sort of fantasy defying description. ""Wow!"" covered the moment. To visit the castle is expensive - well over a 1000 kroner for four people - more when the inevitable food, ice cream, beer and a gift or two is included. Even so it is that immediate impression that keeps you going to towards the entrance, money in hand to pay the fee. It is an amazing place - somewhere not to be missed if you traveling in Denmark and on Fyn island specifically. The castle and its setting in a beautifully manicured landscape provides great visuals for those who like photography. A visit inside of the castle is interesting but wait until you see Titania's palace! It is a powerful monument to one man's patience and creativity and the imagination of children. Beyond the castle are many other fascinating places of interest. An hour or so can easily be spent looking at the extensive collection of two and four-wheeled machines and other carefully maintained artifacts from the past. There are facilities for children, places to buy snacks, horse rides, quiet retreats under the trees, a garden center and places to mingle with people from far away. Although many visitors arrived at Egeshov by the coachload, they seemed to melt away while the castle stood in stately silence.

I loved the exhibition of Marie Antoinette's dress (they recovered a bit of the actual fabric and some sketches of a dress that Marie Antoinette commissioned) , Tatiana's palace (the most amazing dolls house I could ever imagine), the wooden doll in the attic (and the legend that if it is ever moved the castle would fall down), the breathtaking gardens and seeing my husband walk on stilts. :) Oh!

On a beautiful late August day and set against blue skies, the castle looked outstanding from any angle. Inside, you will find numbers of firearms, 'trophies', various artefacts, tools and utensils that date back hundreds of years. There's also a wonderful collection of toys from the early 1900's that are on display in the attic.

Or the small Museum of dresses and uniformes of the personnel. I think in the way all things are presented and explained here one of the best historic presentations I have seen.

Coming here with children is part of the concept I guess. A playground, a walk in the trees, the museum of old toys, the castle of the fairy Titania in a fascinating detailed wooden model and of course the giant Egeskov Softice all this points in this direction.

I agree with other travellers that the entry fee is high, for us around ¬£70 for a family of 4. However coming from the uk this is inline wuth similar atractions back home sch as Longleat, Leeds or Warwick castle. In my opinion Egeskov is better than those so represents good value.

Although the entry fee is expensive (we bought the gardens/collections ticket - without castle), it was probably our favorite place in Denmark:
1) the gardens are large, varied and beautiful
2) the hedge maze is fun although it started conjuring up images of the Harry Potter maze from the Goblet of Fire, and it took us over 15 minutes to solve. There is also an older hedge maze which is closed to the public (perhaps too many people couldn't get out)
3) there are somewhat eclectic and odd collections (motorcycles, cars, some planes)
4) hanging tree bridges (kids loved this)
5) horse cart rides (relatively inexpensive by Danish standards).
6) pleasant restaurant where you can have a relaxing lunch

The castle is very pretty from the outside (nice backdrop for photos) but we didn't go inside.

There are some viewing towers and a playground for kids near the castle. You could easily spend a day at that place if you want. At the exit, there is also a small florist area for you to visit.

This was a mistake: Interesting castle (one of many in Denmark, but still different from any other), A lovely display of old toys on the top floor of the palace, and in another building, a vast collection of classic cars, motorcycles and even a few aircraft.

If you are interested in the exhibitions and in walking in the beautiful gardens you can spend several hours enjoying this special attraction.

Denmark,vincentlau,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"This place should easily be the #1 ranked attraction in Odense, far ahead of any Hans Christian attractions esp for families w kids.

The expansive forest playground was a real treat for kids. Slides, swings and all kindsof un-imaginable gadgets were onsite yo excite and chaklenge all kids of all ages. The tree top walk over 5 suspended bridges was also a real experience.

The castle with its landscaped gardens and the moat was a real visual feast. The castle which is a working castle also offered a real peak of the grand rich history of the past owners.

Food both fast food and sitdown cafes were plentiful and avail. Ice cream stalls were everywhere. Bathrms were clean and well maintained.

Kids could also ride Sedways, try walking on stilts etc.

Our family of 4 chose to rent a car at a local car dealership and drive ourselves. Trip is about 1 hour via interstate. Easy drive. Allow 1 hour to tour the castle and extra time to visit the grounds. There is a great playground for young kids, as well as, an antique car museum and ""Dracula's Crypt"" that's a good laugh. Be sure to try the Tree Top Walking - a series of swinging bridges high up in the trees.",May 2015
Denmark,Andre' S,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"We visited Egeskov during our vacation in Denmark. There was a lot to do, so suddenly we had been here for five hours. Would recommend to come here early in the day when it opens. It quickly queue later in the day, especially on weekends. We were on a Sunday, first went for a walk around the castle, was no queue when we arrived, but when we came out there was a queue outside.There is no capacity for wheelchair inside the castle, as there is no elevator there.
There is much to do for the whole family here. there is a big playground outside for children.

Fine parkland outdoors where one can eat food to relax. There is also a large museum with many vehicles and aircraft , including a department with emergency vehicles from the firm Falck. There is a cafe with the possibility of simple meals , and there is a restaurant with dinner serving. It is also a maze and gardens areas to wander and look in.

We also tried three top walking , where we went on a footpath hanging high among the trees , this was fun for the whole family.
We will probably come back here at a later date. Highly recommended.

There is a outdoor stage, where I could picture some shows or other recreational events occur on schedule. There are some outdoor activities for children, mainly wood playground.
From outside, It's beautiful and worth a visit.
Inside, It's ok. If you are a hunting guy, you will probably like it. There is a lot of horns, weapons, rifles and stuffed animals. Oh, there are carriages rides too!

The Doll house is not to miss. Detail detail detail including a garden

Beech hedges from the late 1700s are magnificent.
Some interesting vehicles in museum area.

Unfortunately the gardens(absent the aforementioned hedges and some of the topiary) seem to be a work in progress. May well be that they are doing a complete switch over but the gardens were less than impressive.

The castle was truly amazing and in great order. The park opened at 10 and castle at 11. You can tour several floors of the castle and into the attic to see the structural pieces of the castle, amazing. There is an antique train set in the attic as well as china and kitchen goods. There are many family items in the castle including a very detailed doll house.

The grounds were just amazing and very well kept. We actually ran into several deer through the gardens. There is a restaurant on the property and wifi though the park. This was actually one of the better tours on our cruise ship excursion. I highly recommend this trip!

Denmark,FieldfamilyMom,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"So, yes, we (74 & 50 year-old women) walked the 2.5 km from the Kv√¶rndrup station - which means we got to walk the 2.5 km back at the end of the visit. It appeared that there was a bus that ran to the road near the castle (Egeskovvej), but we could find nothing about it at the train station. As we were walking back later, a bus passed us (going the wrong way)! It's the bus that goes through Ringe, but I don't know the bus # or schedule. It would be worth finding out though, unless you really like to walk. Anyway, as I said, Egeskov is definitely worth the walk if that's your option for getting there. There are beautiful vistas and the grounds are as amazing as the castle. I was able to get postcard worthy photos of the castle from various locations around the property. There are many activities in the park - and all accessible with the entry fee. There are garden mazes, including a bamboo maze that I wasn't sure we were going to get out of, a horse/wagon ride, and super fun tree-top bridges. You can rent Segways and go on the Segway course. There are fun medieval-era games for kids. There are also exhibits/museums and locations to purchase food. There are a couple gift shops, ice cream stands, and even a nursery to purchase plants. Inside the castle is Titania's Palace (a huge doll house) - which is amazing! So, while Egeskov is fairly far from Odense, and there is an entrance fee, it is definitely worth whatever it takes to visit. This was certainly a highlight of our trip to Denmark!

I could have gotten a couple of beers and maybe enjoyed it, instead we got a latte and a regular coffee for 61 dkr (8,20 Euros). On our way home a somewhat regretted having paid 550 dkr (73 Euros, 2 adults, one child) for this Danish type of rip off.

The antique car and motorcycle museums are well done. Same for the Falck Museum of emergency vehicles. The attic over the motorcycle exhibit has lots of old cars and bikes that are awaiting restoration. Its all covered with dust and is sort of eerie.

The castle was great. The rooms were well preserved with period furnishings. There was a hunting room with some shotguns/rifles on display with horns of the hunted animals mounted on a wall. There was an absolutely amazing dollhouse.

The gardens were great, but were a bit drab because we were there off-season.

The displays in the stables were unexpected. We wandered into one of the old stables buildings and found a few antique carriages, cars and motorcycles. That led to another building with about three dozen more cars from the earlier 20th century though the 1980's. There was yet another stables building that contained well over 100 motorcycles. And, another contained all emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks. Overall, there had to be hundreds of cars and hundreds of motorcycles. A very impressive collection!

There are lots of different museums as well on site with other gems from previous times. A highlight would definitely be the Gardens, they are extensive and the staff work tirelessly to keep them looking good. Because my visit was the last week of the season, the gardens weren't looking as good as they would during their peak. My personal highlights were the aviaries in the gardens, in Summer it would be lovely to sit in the gardens and eat with the birds nearby. Also the extensive hunting collection inside the castle was something I hadn't seen anywhere else. Although it rained the whole day I was there, it was still a great trip. If the weather is nice it would be wonderful to bring a picnic, and there are plenty of activities for kids too.

If going by public transport there is a 30min wait for the bus connection with the train, but like another reviewer I walked along the road there, an easy 30 min walk. On the return there is a closer connection with the train.

Note: I believe that it is now closed now until 26th April next year, with the exception of a weekend during December so just check before planning a visit before then!

It's more convenient if you have a car, but we came to Egeskov from Odense by train, and then it took half an hour walking along the highway (there was little traffic so it wasn't very uncomfortable though) to get to the castle from the station (and it's been raining along the whole way - happily we had an umbrella). We could took a bus from station but it went once an hour or so, so we decided not to wait. But when we got to the castle we immediately forgot about the rain and the long way, because the castle was just amazing. It's in a very good state, it's very interesting itself, and it has many attractions and things to see both inside and outside of it. It has museums that are really interesting (we liked especially the vintage automobiles and motorcycles collections!). It has several beautiful gardens, playground for kids, a nice rope walk in the trees. The exhibition inside the castle is really interesting because it describes the very actual environment in which the castle owners has been living for ages (by the way, this castle is still living, and some parts of castle are closed for visitors). So, in short, this is a great attraction, and definitely worth visiting.

What surprised and impressed us was how much there actually was here. A family would easily spend a day here covering the various attractions.

The staff were as ever in Denmark really friendly, helpful and spoke brilliant English.

A well worth visit !

Denmark,Lou W,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"The whole place is beautiful, well tended and clean. As the other reviews said there was something for everyone and it was definitely a full day out. I was sceptical about the museums, but they were extensive, well put together and interesting. The mazes were a real treat and the gardens amazing, (and our family really don't do gardens and the like). The high ropes walk in the trees was suitable for all ages and there was Segway to try and this was a very reasonable extra charge. The house was lovely, inside was ok, the only disappointment was the size of the character in the attic reputed to be stopping the place falling into the moat! There was an enormous play area outside suitable for up to 12 years ish. Well worth the reasonable entrance fee.

Denmark,sarcasticlamp,Egeskov Castle,4.0,"We caught the train from Odense and then walked to the castle. It is not a bad walk, there is a bus but on the way back we decided to walk rather than wait. If you have better organisational skills you will not have the long wait at the station like we did! We were within 2 minutes of the station when the train passed!
The castle and grounds were well worth the trip. The castle is really interesting and the grounds are beautiful. There is plenty to see. The playgrounds are amazing, so children can have a great time playing.
The collections are amazing and clearly a work of love and devotion - the motorcycle collection is huge as is the emergency services one.
We also did the maze, which didn't take too long but was good fun.
Everyone we met was really helpful.
Would recommend to everyone.

This is the type of eccentricity that makes for great holiday memories!

Two complaints: the price, as noted by most others. And the smoking, everywhere! I'm sure that one of the leaflets said the whole site was non-smoking (except for designated areas, whatever that means). This was simply ignored by any smoker present, and obviously not enforced by any staff. Shame.

We have departed from Odense to Kv√¶rndrup by train. We have looked for a bus to get to the Castle, that is far from the raily station about 2.5 km, but we didn't find it, so we have walked along the street to get there. It hasn't been a relaxing walking because there were many trucks on the road, but at the end we have finally arrived at the destination. The Castle and the area all around are very relaxing! You can spend your time walking through the beautiful gardens or trying to going out from the great labyrinth or, again, making a carriage tour. You can have lunch in some restaurant or a sandwich in the pic nic area. Enjoy it!

Denmark,halfviking,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"Ok, in danish the word 'slot' can mean anything from a ruined castle, sumptious palace, manor house or chateau and in this instance, I reckon it's fits several of these descriptions. Firstly, it's definitely not a ruin and is almost a fairytale castle. Honestly, it is so beautiful! Situated in south Fyn, sort of midway between Odense and Svenborg, it is a 'must see' destination. We were a family group of 5 and it cost about ¬£100 to go in but it is definitely worth every penny. There is a childrens play area including a tree top walk (not easy), a maze that will drive you crazy, an emergency services museum (did not have time to see this), a 'man and machines' museum featuring amazing cars, cycles, carriages, workshops etc. relating to the castles history, a fantastic motorcycle museum with many classic British and American bikes, a 'k√∏rbmand' shop which is like stepping back in time with all the products from bygone times, another classic car museum that included several aircraft, a herb garden, a deer park, formal gardens to die for and, of course, the castle itself. A beautiful building set in a lake. Inside there is great emphasis on the hunting, shooting traditions of the owners in times past. OK, it may not be politically correct today, but in their heyday it was the 'norm'. Many trophies adorn the walls along with the weapons that got them there. There is a dolls house 'par excellence' - Titiana's Palace - an absolute work of art. Way up in the huge lofts there are collections of toys, porcelain and kitchenalia.
So much to see and, if you get a little weary (as we did), there is a nice restaurant to refresh yourself (can definitely recommend the lasagne). The whole place is a photographers dream and we can thoroughly recommend a visit.

There are ample parking, picnic and toilet facilities, as well as playgrounds for children. You will need around 4 hrs to explore the castle, 10 museums and extensive (15 hectares) English gardens, designed in 1700, with well-manicured green hedges and peacocks.

The museums are most interesting: antique cars, antique toys, motorcycles and others. Lots of activities for children. The castle is located in a very rural area. If you have an automobile at your disposal, then traveling there is easy. I rode the train from Odense to Kvaerndrup (my choice to do so!). The walk from the small station is about 35 minutes to the castle entrance. The walk is flat, but there are no sidewalks on the highway, which has a fair amount of traffic, and only a gravel/weed/grassy shoulder. During my visit, it rained for quite a few minutes, and was raining when I wanted to leave. I wasn't looking forward to the walk back to the train station with wet shoes! One of the nice women at the ticket booths called a taxi for me from Kvaerndrup. He charged only 80 DKK, but I gave him a substantial tip!

Denmark,WJP89,Egeskov Castle,4.0,"What do you do if you own a sprawling manor house, hundreds of acres of park land, and a very large amount of money? Presumably, you collect motorcycles and vintage cars, establish a fire engine museum, build the most elaborate doll house ever assembled, travel the world hunting mighty beasts and collecting obscure bric-a-brac, create garden mazes and menageries, float a boat in your moat, and then invite the public (for a fee, of course). The owners of Egeskov Castle have created something of a throw-back to more genteel times, eschewing rollercoasters and wandering mascots and offering, instead, tree-top walks, a play area where children can try stilts and push-powered go-carts, and an ecclectic assembalge of vehicles ranging from a bicycle with a motor on it to a Starfighter from the Danish Air Force. The fire engine museum is an homage to the Falck company, which provides Denmark with everything from ambulances to horse rescue teams. There is also a ""Dracula's Crypt"", sort of the side-show to the main attractions. Give yourself plenty of time - there is a lot to see and do at Egeskov. The manor house (separate admission fee) houses a vast collection of hunting trophies - so perhaps not a place for the animal lovers in your group - but it also offers the most extraordinary doll house in the world, which took master craftsmen 15 years to build. You can access the attic of the manor, where you can see the timber construction of the roof while perusing a collection of industrial-grade kitchen utensils that presumably kept the lord and lady of the manor, along with their guests, amply fed. Although this is not an inexpensive destination, it is worth it if you are willing to devote the time needed to see it properly. You can buy food onsite or bring your own picnic lunch. And one last thing - Egeskov is NOT in Odense! it is in Kvaerndrup, about half an hour south of Odense.

Denmark,Pete-Watson,Egeskov Castle,5.0,"Let me tell you about our visit. I went along with my wife and two twenty-something girls...

On arrival we paid for entry for all of us to the castle - this is where we could have made a saving.

We went along to the period fashion display in the gatehouse and then went around the castle. All three females really enjoyed this, however apart from the display of toys in the loft space, it didn't interest me. OK, the dolls house is splendid, but I was totally happy after five minutes rather than the full half hour viewing (you get the picture). Basically going round the castle is treat for the female contingent.

Afterwards we went across to the vintage car museum; now this is where I started to get interested. The cars had been beautifully restored, but the real treat for me was the motorcycle displays. You go in and think that there are loads of lovely bikes, then you go on, and find a second, even larger hall. I was in my element. You go up to the loft space and there is all the newly recovered cars and bikes awaiting restoration. However, buy this time the female contingent was becoming bored waiting for me. This seemed common with other visitors with husbands entranced and wives bored; exactly the opposite of the castle side of things.

So here is my tip. At the entrance, but castle entry only for the females so that they can go and enjoy the dolls house and the fashion displays. As a man, you don't need to pay the extra as the car, bike and vintage emergency vehicles (I wasn't even allowed to go and see these). The women can then branch off to the right to see their interests and the men can branch off to the left to see the ""bloke"" things. Meet up again after a couple of hours when you will all have enjoyed yourselves.

I wish someone had given me this advice in advance of our visit as it would have made much better use of the time.

Having said that, allow yourselves a good four hours or so for the visit be you male or female.

Highly recommended.

There we bought tickets for the garden only, which came to US$30 per person. The gardens were a major disappointment and consequently terribly overpriced.

For the children you have mazes, playgrounds and tree top walks.
Then you have the castle itself, looking great set on a lake and very interesting inside. They had Titania's Palace on display, which is a huge dolls house with rare items collected from all over the world including a minature diamond encrusted seat and many other valuable pieces.
Sometimes you can visit these sort of places and have seen everything within a couple of hours, but if you want to see everything here you will need a whole day.

Denmark,JRAsFishBabe,The Black Diamond - Royal Danish Library,5.0,"Copenhagen was our next stop on this visit to Denmark. We had chosen to stay in Roskilde, partly because of its close proximity to Copenhagen and also because of it being a better place to find accommodation. And let's not forget, it is the home of another UNESCO World Heritage Site, Roskilde Domkirke. We are staying at a very nice Airbnb which was run a very pleasant lady called Nellie, which by the way was close to the Cathedral as well as to the main square. Roskilde is about 30 minutes from the Amager Street metrostation, where, for 24 DKK, we caught the metro to the Kongens Nytorv Station. This gave us good access to shopping at the Magasin and to the Stroget, as well as ""everything else""!
Arriving at what is really the centre of the city, you are well positioned to explore. As we are in the habit of doing here, we went to find some pastry and coffee, so off to Holms Bager on Kobmagergade. Well fortified, we set off to ""explore"". There is obviously much to take in as you wander down to the waterfront where ""Den Sorte Diamant"" is located. This iconic, modern building gets its (nick)name from the polished black granite cladding and its irregular angled construction. It was constructed in 1995 and is an addition to the Royal Danish Library on Slotsholmen. It not only functions as a library, it also has a multi event serving auditorium, a bookstore, restaurant, cafe and a rooftop terrace. There are two museums here as well, one displaying photography and another one cartoon art. This is really an impressive looking building, inside and outside, well worth visiting. A nice feature of its location is that it is situated right on the waterfront. So after your visit, grad a coffee (or not) and sit out on one of the chairs that are available and enjoy the goings on in the canal. And a bonus to you if the sun is shining! This really is a special place in Copenhagen.
Well, after we ""enjoyed"" watching the life on the canal, in the bright sunshine I must add, we headed back to Hojbro Plads for something to eat at the Wok On. Another good recommendation. A good end to a good day and then back to Roskilde.

It is located right on the waterfront of great Copenhagen's sea canal and is one extension to the Royal Library, situated behind.
This ultra modern edifice is shiny, of black colour, with black facets that mirror the sea and the sky at the harbour front.
The architect have had one stunning and courageous conception to make one large incision, that literally cleaves the building into two formations and gives light to the atrium inside. This atrium is then connected by walkways with the Old Library.
The glass facade is supported by iron girder beams .
Outstanding building !

Denmark,Ian C,The Black Diamond - Royal Danish Library,5.0,"The Royal Library in Copenhagen is the national library of Denmark and also, following merger in 1989, the university library of the University of Copenhagen. The library holds nearly all known Danish printed works including the first printed Danish book from 1482.

Founded in 1648 by King Frederik, the Library is now split across several sites, the most prominent being the ‚ÄúBlack Diamond‚Äù completed in 1999 as the first in a series of major cultural buildings along the waterfront.

The new building, designed by Danish architects Schmidt Hammer Lassen, extended across the road into the old Library on the Slotsholmen site which was built in 1906 by Hans J√∏rgen Holm with a central hall designed as a copy of Charlemagne's Palace chapel in Aachen Cathedral.

The ‚ÄúDiamond‚Äù houses a number of other cultural activities ‚Äì a 600-seat auditorium/concert hall. exhibition and museum spaces, a bookshop, a restaurant and a caf√©, which spills out onto the waterfront in summer and a pleasant place to stop for a coffee as you explore this part of Copenhagen.

Obviously, the reader areas are closed to the public, without agreement, but the building is nevertheless worth a visit to see the quality of cultural renaissance being achieved in Copenhagen.

Denmark,923Dan,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"Highlight of my trip to Aalborg and well worth the trek across half of Jutland to get there.
The Lindholm Hoeje Museum is on the site of Viking Burial tombs and houses discovered under sand dunes on a shooting range in the 1950's.
The museum itself has a small cafe and shop with two exhibitions. One on the vikings in the area and the other on geology and wildlife.
The staff in the museum were knowledgeable friendly, helpful (looking after my bag) and even booked a taxi at the end of the day.
The highlight were the ruins outside. A peaceful windswept hill, with burial chamber remains of granite boulders and houses.
A truly special site!

Denmark,JRAsFishBabe,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"Lindholm Hoje is a major Viking burial site located just north of Aalborg across the Limfjord in Norresundby. The Lindholm Hoje site includes the museum as well as the ancient burial site. The museum showcases two exhibits, one featuring the Viking age from the Lindholm Hoje period and the other one showing life dating back to the Nordic Iron Age, ca. 5th century AD. The museum is quite small but contains many interesting artifacts and displays. The burial site, on the other hand, is quite extensive as there are approximately 700 graves. Some of the burials were done under mounds, pre-Viking period, and others are indicated by rocks placed in circles. The majority being place in the shape of ships, with the larger shapes being an indication of the importance of the person buried.
Apparently the site was abandoned in the 1200's A.D., probably due to the drifting sand caused by deforestation and intensified by the strong westerly winds. This sand, as it turns out, helped to largely protect it over the centuries. Some excavations of the site began in the late 1880's, but nothing major until 1952. The visit to Lindholm Hoje, we found to be quite mesmerizing and is something you should visit at least once.
The museum has a reasonable entrance fee and there is a cafe and a gift shop on site. Check out their website for more details. The burial site is free.
P.S. We were visiting with family and were looking for a place to have a picnic. There did not seem to be any facilities available here, but we managed to find a nice spot close by at the Herb Garden in Lindholm. This is the location of the Brohuset from 1880, a booking and shipping office used up until 1933 when the Puntonbroen ""bridge"" closed, and moved to its present location in the early 1990's. The gardens here, are lovely and there doesn't seem to be a shortage of picnic tables either, making for a great spot to have a picnic.
P.P.S. There is much in the area to keep you around for ""a bit"", Aalborg has a history dating back over 1000 years. Please make sure that you visit Budolfi Cathedral. This beautiful, white church dates from the late 14th century and the original, around which the present one stands, was built in the early 12th century!

My first visit was a complete disaster, as I was new to the city, I decided to investigate the surroundings and arrived at Lindholm Hoje. The museum consist of 2 places, the burrial site (outside) and the galery (inside). The experience was a disaster because there were no sign and nothing marked for me to go inside to see the galery. So, I just saw some rocks.
The second one, was much better, visiting the galery inside and the cafe/restaurant that they have, checked out the souvenir shop and so on. This was absolutely magnificent, as I am passionate about history.
Combining my two experiences, I'd say that if you are a first time visitor, do you homework and document yourself about the place before going there.

Denmark,Perchrj,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"It is safe to recommend this museum to all people interested in history and prehistory. The museum is located on a hill north of the Limfjorden sound, and the slope outside the museum was used as a burial ground from about 400 CE to a bit before 1000 CE. There were also settlements on the slope at different times, both in the Iron Age and the Viking Era. The graves are marked with stone formations, the younger graves are often shaped like a boat. The area was eventually covered by drifting sands, until the area was excavated in modern times. It was quite interesting to stand on the hill and think of all the centuries when this area was in use, and how cultures changed with the times. The museum itself had both an exhibit on the area itself and a more general exhibit that started before the time of these stone formations, all the way back to the Stone Age when Denmark was rich in flint, and flint tools were traded to neighbouring countries. The collection of items found in graves and buried in other ways was also rich and fascinating. So if any or all of this sounds interesting, I would recommend visiting Lindholm H√∏je and its museum.

The burial site for somebody is maybe nothing more than stones and rocks on the ground but the fact that they've been there for centuries is quite impressive! Hidden by the sand that keeps shifting and now they came back to the surface. similar interesting story is the Tilsandede Kirke in Skagen and few others buried for centuries in sand and now they're back for us to admire!
Lovely little caffe too.
A bit of a let down were the goats droppings everywhere. Not Ideal especially as I was wearing sandals and I had to slalom and pay attention to every step I made. I know they keep the vegetation put and they won't need gardening however it's jst not really my liking and maybe somebody else.

Most of these graves are surrounded by stones laid in various shapes. Quite an impressive sight.
Second, this area had been covered by years of layers of shifting sand and not until 1952 was it excavated. Luckily, it was not lost forever, An amazing discovery.

I am really glad I got there early. Me and another couple practically had the place to ourselves...which of course makes for better photos. It was a pretty cool experience to walk where Vikings once walked...to touch the stones they laid to honor their dead. There are several small informational displays.

Access to the archaeological site from the car park is over the crest of a small hill, which is not handy for wheelchair users, but could be do-able for determined wheelchair users when the ground is not softened by rain. The grass appears to be kept in check by the sheep, so again not great for wheels.
For the lovers of Viking Age history though, this is a great place to visit. For English-language monogolots, the translations on the interpretive boards are a blessing (the written information in the museum is also given in English).
The museum has one section downstairs on the pre-history of the area, well-explained and presented and another section on the ground floor on the Vikings. The exhibits are thoughtfully presented and interpreted, but my husband found the low level of lighting and the enclosed feel quite headache-inducing by the time we got to the last part of the Viking section.
We thought a lot of the things in the gift shop might be available in lots of places in Jutland, but found this was not the case. The gifts on offer here are Viking inspired and we didn't find any more gifts like them on our visit to the area, except a couple of items in the museum in Gothenburg.

Denmark,Balticlight,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"I realize my title is pretty grandiose. There are many great places in Denmark. But Lindholm Hoje is special, top of the list. Sometimes standing at the top of the hill, I almost think I can hear and see the Vikings who once lived here and buried their loved ones here. To my knowledge, it is the single largest Viking graveyard in all Scandinavia. The story of its life and it's recovery 1000 years later is fascinating I itself. There are early round and oval graves for women, triangles for men. Then there are the boat graves, my favorites, graves shaped like the mighty ships these people made and sailed all over the world. There are also the remains of buildings. A lively museum shows some of the findings and tells the story of the place. The shop has great stuff - Viking replica sweaters and cups and plates and jewelry often made by folks who do the work for the joy of it. There is a cafe, which isn't great but OK. The staff are helpful. And the authentic sheep grazing in the graveyard are mostly pretty friendly. If you are remotely close to Aalborg, do not miss Lindholm Hoje. You'll never forget it.

Denmark,Boo777,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,4.0,"My husband and I just returned from a Baltic cruise and loved our afternoon at Lindholm Hoje! It's basically a Viking burial ground beside a museum. It's not too far from the Aalborg city center and you can reach it by taxi. We love the History Channel's tv show ""The Vikings"" so this attraction was very interesting to us.

Denmark,DMarco1982,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,4.0,"LindHolm Hoje is a nice calm park, a few train stops away from Aalborg. There you would travel back to the vikings age, visiting a sacred burial area in the middle of the nature, with free cows and animals in the surrondings. You¬¥ll feel the spirit of the vikings everywhere. There¬¥s also a museum to know a bit more about the story of the place but you can just visit the park, sit down under a tree an enjoy yourself imagining how those vikings lived and died. Each tomb, rock, and placement has a different meaning according to if there lays a woman, a warrior... so each tomb is different depending on how that person lived and meant to the community. From my point of view it¬¥s a ""must"" to visit. You can visit both, the museum and the park, in just a morning. The access to the park is free. If you don¬¥t like vikings history don¬¥t go to Lindholm hoje cause you¬¥ll probably get out of there with the feeling of having just seen stones... but those same stones will describe you a story if you love vikings.

Located at one of the highest points in N√∏rresundby, Lindholm H√∏je is surrounded by a viking burial site with stone formations, and darling sheep to keep the grass clipped - so watch your step. The museum is located further back in the forest, and is relatively inexpensive and small. Small, but rich and full of artifacts that tell a rich story of how vikings lived during that time period.

Denmark,Jolyon67,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,4.0,"Lindholm Hoje is one of the finest examples of a Viking cemetery you will ever hope to find. It is a 15 min drive just north of Aalborg. There is an onsite museum costing 60 dkk which closes 5pm, but the main attraction is the surrounding hill covered in almost 700 graves dating back between 400-1000AD. It is a very atmospheric and windy place, populated by friendly sheep. In the museum are reconstructions of Viking houses and the main artefacts which were found in the surrounding cemetery. There is sword from a warriors grave and household items such as combs and a chess like game made from sea urchins & antlers.
Outside the hill is covered in countless stone graves, the ones nearest the top of the hill are the oldest. Men's are boat shaped or triangular, while women's tombs are round or oval. Stones mark out the location of a 20m long Viking Long House and the location of the extensive village of which very little remains. If you are into archaeology this is a unique and well preserved site with lots of information panels in English for you to follow.

It was photogenic and on top of that they had English language info boards so we were still able to get a little education in. There were also some sheep wondering about which which gave us a bit of a fright when we heard the crunching leaves of following footsteps only to turn around to be relieved by the sight of a bleating sheep.

In the museum is a good exposition of Iron Age and Viking era Lindholm area. Slightly let down by English translation on lower floor only, which has been updated more recently. It did give a good view of Viking culture and how it had emerged from the Iron Age populations. Attached is a cafe that aims to serve Viking inspired food. Normally this would be burgers with a Viking name attached, but no, this is more thorough going. This was fresh food that might have been eaten by well to do Vikings. So there was fried fish with brown bread, barley and carrot salad with thyme and cabbage salad. No potatoes here and no Coca-Cola. Fruit juice, water, beer and wine were on offer.

What a totally extraordinary and amazing sight!

Plenty of signs in English to explain what you are seeing around the site and the I spotted a small path on the far side which led me straight to the museum. 50K entry fee but absolutely masses to see and read about (English printed guidebook loaned so you can follow the section of the museum without english translations).

An amble back to the bus-stop (and a cold wait as I'd just missed a bus! - currently twice an hour 27 and 57...) and I arrived safely back into Aarlborg with time to spare for a trip to Penny Lane for a well deserved and delicious lunch.

A worthwhile excursion for both families and single travellers.
Two minuses (at the time of my visit in June 2012):
1 ) the museum has two wings; the new wing has exhibits with descriptions in both Danish and English, the old wing, only in Danish.
2) local public transportation (bus #2C) doesn't go all of the way to the museum; it's a pleasant 5-10 minute walk from the bus stop (depending on whether you take the shortcut through the viking settlement).

Denmark,Peter_VG,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"Lindholm Hoje (Lindholm H√∏je which means Lindholm Hills) is a vast viking burial site from the late Iron Age and the Viking Era, situated on a sloping hill on the North bank of the Limfiord just opposite Aalborg. The fiord is at its narrowest just here and thus the obvious choice for the connection between Vendsyssel to the North and mainland Jutland.
The hill climbs to 42 meters above the fiord.
On the hill, several hundred stone dwellings are to be found and more than 700 graves have been uncovered, primarily with burnmarks as if the departed had been burned on funeral pyres.
The oldest graves date back to the year 500 AD while the youngest were made as late as the year 1100. Furthermore, the remains of a settlement or village have been found in the area. Even the remains of a new-ploughed field were found which must have been ploughed shortly before the sand covered it.
Towards the end of the 11th Century, the whole area was covered by sand. This has played a significant role in preserving the remains and the artifacts till present days.
The ancient burial site at Lindholm Hoje is undisputedly one of the most spectacular and beautiful reminders of ancient times in the whole of Denmark. From the top of the hill, on clear days, there is a marvellous view of Aalborg and the fiord which stretches through the landscape for miles and miles. A true ‚Äúmust‚Äù for any visit to Aalborg.
The site was discovered in the 1930ies, and completely escavated 1952-58
Next to the hill, an interesting museum is found, displaying in an untraditional way the artifacts from the excavations, as well as reconstructions, panoramas, maps and illustrations of the life and death of the wikings and their ancestors.
There is an OK, mid-priced caf√© in the museum were you can have a cup of coffee or a meal while digesting the impressions from the visit. It is an excellent place to bring children as well with ample space for them to play.

On the grounds one will alwayd have the chance to say hi to the resident sheep and goats - mind your step as regards droppings! The burial and residendence sites are clearly marked with informational stands - I particualrly dig the bottom of the field where plow furrows of old are still visible.

Denmark,WJP89,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"The Lindholm Hoje Museum and the adjacent Viking burial ground are must-see sites for anyone visiting Aalborg. The burial site itself is a sprawling hillside covered with mounds and stone markers, with interpretive plaques placed strategically. It can be visited free of charge and is interesting enough in itself. But by paying the relatively nominal entry fee for the museum, you will be able to get a much better appreciation of the burial site, and of Viking life in the Aalborg region. The older part of the museum is devoted to interpretation and presentation of the burial site. It shows artifacts and reconstructions, and tells the history of how the site was discuvered and excavated. The new exhibits in the basement expand greatly on the storyline, with excellent displays on neolithic tool-making, burial customs, the development of tools through the iron and Bronze Ages, Viking social structure, trading, warfare, and so on. The artifacts on display are of very high quality and are presented thoughtfully. English interpretation sheets are available. What is more, this is one of a series of museums that are in association across Denmark such that paying to visit one gives you free or discounted access to all the rest! If you cannot visit the National Museum in Copenhagen (or even if you CAN), you really must visit Lindholm Hoje.

Denmark,grateful_travels,Lindholm Hoeje Museum,5.0,"Lindholm Hoje was one of the highlights of our trip through Denmark. We spent close to 3 hours, casually wandering through the museum and lingering for a bit in the beautiful cemetery.

The museum was well laid out and full of fascinating information on Vikings, the discovery and excavation of the cemetery, and history of the area. There were many relics on display that were recovered in the area, and great descriptions and depictions of life in Viking times. All exhibits were presented in both Danish and English, so it was easy to make sense of everything without a guide.

The cemetery was amazing. Some of the oldest burial sites here are from the year 400 AD! It is so beautiful and tranquil; I can imagine being at peace resting there for all eternity. It was so interesting to see the different shapes of the stone structures and read about what each shape meant. The cemetery has signs scattered throughout giving different information about where homes were erected, where people were buried, what the stones mean, etc.

If you're in Aalborg, don't leave without stopping here.

It's not too overwhelmingly large - we took our time, and were in the building about 1.5 hrs. There is a separate area inside explaining the cemetery which does not have English explanations, so we only spent about 20 minutes in there. Then out to the cemetery itself - which is amazing.
