St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"Simply awesome and absolutely beautiful. Stand at the entrance and try and take it all in. Huge paintings, sculptures, mosaics there’s so much to see. Pope John Paul II mausoleum simple but powerful. Confessionals for those inclined to take confession. Hard to believe this is a church still in use and not just a tourist attraction. Certainly the highlight of my trip to Rome. Even if you’re not religiously inclined I challenge you not to be awestruck by this building. Free to visit (fee charged for climbing the dome).",5.0,Sep 2021
St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"One of the most iconic (if not the most iconic) churches in the world. It is just HUGE, it is beautiful, it is incredibly decorated.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"we queued on the day for about an hour and did the dome tour.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"We booked a private St. Peter's Basilica Dome Climb through ""Get Your Guide"". Mr Samuele was an amazing guide. his English was impeccable, his knowledge encyclopedic, and his passion for the art of St. Peter's was obvious. Thoroughly enjoyable climb to the Dome which provides you with incredible panoramic views of Rome and the Vatican. Mr. Samuele identified the many sites you could see and explained what they were and when asked gave information on how to 'get' to them. His tour through the Basilica and crypts was filled with information on the art and artists represented. He did not limit his tour to 'the big ones' but highlighted many lesser know works and their creators. We recommend him without reservation.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"Women should NOT wear shorts, skirts above the knee, tops with lots of cleavage or bare shoulders.

Monitors stand at the entrance AFTER the metal detectors & reject people who are not dressed appropriately for entering a house of God.

Why edit in line fir an hour to be turned away?
Be respectful and dress fir church, not a nightclub or the beach.

Once inside, it is a working church, so low whispers are encouraged. Selfie sticks will get swatted down... it’s just too crowded.

Make sure your shoulders are covered and your dresses your shorts are down to your knees otherwise he will not be allowed in. Walking up to the entrance of the church make sure to pay attention to the detail outside of the church. The day we went we actually got to witness mass which was quite amazing.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"This was my 3rd visit to St. Peter's and it is still awe-inspiring. Everywhere you look there are magnificent works of art, starting with Michelangelo's Pieta on the right side once you enter. Thinking about the workmanship that went into every square inch of this Basilica is mind boggling. A MUST SEE!

Be sure to spend the extra 7 euro and WALK up to the dome. It's 551 steps but you get to stop and walk around the interior of the dome (looking down into the Basilica) before you continue up to the roof.",5.0,Sep 2021

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"In preparation for my third trip to Rome, I scheduled a tour through Headout for St. Peter's Basilica Dome Climb & Papal Tombs. I had been to St. Peter's Basilica, but had missed out on those two important experiences. My tour guide was Chiara, part of When in Rome Tours. Prior to arriving, which my wife and I were a bit late for, she called to check up on us. Already a great start. From introduction to farewell, Chiara was amazing! Very knowledgeable about the tour she led, while sprinkling in humor throughout the more than two hours she spent with us. The experience was entertaining due to her interaction with the group, which comprised of people from four different countries. I would jump on any tour that Chiara led.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"Let be honest - the Church / Basilica is magnificent (grand), also popes tomb is very special to see / experience, but...
Be aware of a dress code wanting to enter (unfortunately does not apply to all visitors).
They will check you (as on airport - sceners) and doing that before entering they will also check if you are dressed properly (shorts slightly above the knee and T-shirt is O.K.). Especially women's short skirts and pants, or uncovered shoulders are a no-go, but unfortunately not for all. As some people are rejected (it is a possibility to go outside, buy a scarf, cover yourself and go again through all the procedures), some are by a miracle left to enter, even though having very shot (even indecent) dresses/attire.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"It should be on your ""must see"" list!

It is monumental and beautifull beyond words.

If you are a catholic, please note that Pope John Paul II is also laid to rest here (second chapel on the right from the entrance) and you can say your prayers in front of his grave.

Pieta by Michelangelo is also such a touching work of art that you simply must see for yourself.

We were there in the begining of August 2021 and there were no crowds, we have waited only 5 minutes to pass the security check.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"I know this is contrarian, but St. Peter's is the least interesting church I saw in Rome, and I saw a lot.

A must see.",5.0,Jul 2021
St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"Absolutely stunning!
I recommend you come on Sunday to see the Pope give a small speech from his window at 12pm (my and a fellow traveler tried to see him on Wednesday at 10 but according to one of the guards you only see him Sundays). Do come earlier to choose a spot, as people start arriving an hour before at least.

With Covid restrictions, the crowd isn't as big (about a quarter of the square fills up). Also the entrance to the Basillica is free if you don't want to climb the dome (you must cover your arms and knees. I recommend in the Summer to bring a loose skirt or baggy trousers to wear on top of shorts so you don't have to boil for the rest of the day.)

Inside is definitely the most beautiful church I've ever seen, there are frescos and statues and ceiling paintings. There is also a ""secret door"" behind St Peter's statue holding the big X cross where you can visit St Peter's tomb and the other popes' tombs too. I went after seeing the Pope, so there was a bit of a crowd.

The shops in the Vatican are cheaper than the center of Rome, I did a fair bit of gift shopping around the area afterward (e.g. stands with beautiful jewelry for 1 euro, and the Vatican post in St Peter's square sells postage stamps for 1.15 a piece rather than 1.60 as I've seen in Rome. I was there also on a Monday morning around 10am and there was no one else, so I dropped my postcards in the box immediately after buying the stamps.)

Make sure you cover your shoulders (men and women) and knees (only women from our experience) however out of courtesy men should also cover their knees.

St. Peter's Basilica,Italy,"St. Peter's, the beating heart of Catholicism.
St. Peter's Church attracts pilgrims from all over the world.
Almost everyone is amazed upon entering the richly decorated Basilica, under Michelangelo's vast dome.
In the 2nd century, a sanctuary was erected over the tomb of St. Peter.
The first great basilica, ordered by Emperor Constantine, was completed around 349 AD.
In the 15th century it was in ruins and in 1506 Pope Julius II laid the first stone of the new church.
However, it took more than a century to build and all the great architects of the Roman Renaissance and Baroque worked on it.
Coming to Rome and not visiting St. Peter's Basilica is something that even those who are not Catholics should not do.
It is of the richest places in art and history in the world.
Entering the basilica is already awe-inspiring. Seeing the tall dome from the inside and all the works of art that decorate it is a memorable experience
If you want to try something unique and have a 360 degree view of Rome, go up the Dome, it is tiring (an infinite number of steps) but it is worth it and you will have a unique view.

This was our 2nd visit and restoration is still ongoing and probably will be for a decade more. This trip we went to the roof which would have had a great view, but it was raining so the view was limited. I would not recommend going to the roof in the rain; it is all marble and much of the roof is slanted so it can be slippery and many of the steps are outside so one has to really watch one's step!

Duomo di Milano,Italy,"Took the lift up to the roof as my husband had a damaged knee. Views were beautful. You really get to appreciate the whole scale of the amount of genius that was needed to construct such an amazing building.

Be aware that although you take the lift up you have to walk the steps down. It was manageable for my husband, but had it been high season with large amounts of people it would have been harder. We didn't buy tickets for inside but you exit through the inside. You get to see the Duomo from the side but not the alter. Still worth the visit and would highly recommend.

Great time to go before the crowds return, if the travel restrictions aren't too onerous.

Hostess Cathia, booked through the Duomo di Milano official site, provided an excellent tour of the Duomo, the Duomo Archeological Site, and the rooftop. Her native language is Italiano but her English was excellent and nothing was missed because of language difficulties. She used an iPad to add highlights through pictures and depictions that are more easily understood visually but the technology only highlighted and expanded on the tour rather than becoming the focus and a distraction. Her pace was just right to hear and comprehend what she was saying. She always allowed a little quiet after speaking for contemplation and then took the time at each stop to ask questions and expand on items brought up through any questions. The timing never felt rushed and we actually exceeded our allotted tour time by a bit since business is just getting going again and the next guests weren't waiting. She wasn't in a rush to end the tour and instead stayed for every question and discussion as we stretched beyond the posted time of the tour.

I highly recommend Cathia as a host and a guided tour the Duomo whenever you can make it to Milano.

Gallerie Degli Uffizi,Italy,"We enjoyed the museum as it took 3 hours. The cafe has zero place to eat and enjoy a beverage, sandwich, etc without paying the.m a severe premium price plus an included tip. In fact the benches have a sign that says ""No Picnic""
Now there is a menu outside the cafe showing prices sitting at a table and as a take out every item each is one Euro or as much as 3 higher per item.
Hence a small pizza margarita was 6€ each. It was microwaved!! Probably the worst in all of Italy. It may have had one small tomatoes amount of sauce, the closest it came to pizza.

The museum has several very Biblical paintings that were not to be considered the stretch of the imagination including the painters. Abraham and Isaac being sacrificed. Too much wood, remember the little boy carried the wood and a body of water in the background. Other than that, pretty exact on ages etc. Out of the hundreds and I mean hundreds, paintings of Mary; only one showed her a very young maiden of 14 or so with Joseph in his 40 to 50's.
Another funny one was to show John the Baptist as an old man baptizing Jesus. They were cousins, 3 to four months difference in age.
Another very accurate and little ever spoken of by ministers was an older man taking Mary to Egypt to avoid Herod's wrath. Then the very finest of all paintings. With absolute Biblical accuracy and an unbelievably beautiful was the showing of Esther risking

Gallerie Degli Uffizi,Italy,"We booked a guided tour of this incredible gallery to a) avoid huge queues and b) to understand and get an unhurried look at the important pieces of art. We were not disappointed. Our guide Rosa (trip booked via Trip Advisor) was warm and friendly and took us through the history of art in the Italian Renaissance. The early paintings were incredibly vivid and colourful and it was a privilege to see Botticelli's Primavera and Birth of Venus close up.
So much to see including Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio's Medusa, Reubens, Leonardo da Vinci but another highlight was the exquisite statue the Venus of the Medici, a Roman statue dating back to the first century BC.

Gallerie Degli Uffizi,Italy,"The Medicis must have been proud. Of course, their hands were never clean; you don't get to be an affluent political dynasty without breaking some eggs. But Lorenzo de'Medici must have seen his family as the parents of modernity. In the Uffizi, one finds many magnificent art pieces commissioned or collected by this family. As is expected from parents, I imagine the Medicis to have attributed great value to world they left behind for us. Why else would they collect so many adorations of the sages? How would they explain the tension between the stories of Christ and the Greek Myths? And the beautiful wedding gifts painted by Botticelli surely had a hopeful message for the newly weds. If Lorenzo would look upon this forest of art, he undoublty would be touched to tears. So many stories, such profound wisdom and spirituality, so much pain and forgiveness. I imagine he would tell me all about it.

But Lorenzo is dead, and the Uffizi makes little attempt to hide that. To get to the art, you first must pass a series of dark halls and reconstructions, as if the museum itself is digging in its memory to remember. And when you finally enter the forest with marble statues for trees, you enter the parentless world where most visitors are lost for meaning. The plaques give you the cold facts, but most human context is lost. The audio guide does not tell us why this art is here, which makes me wonder why I am here. For all it cares, everything is self-evident; This is art, and this art, and this is art.. Even when buying tickets the guest is left parentless and confused, as swindlers offer the same tickets for different prices.

If only Lorenzo would be there, next to ""Judith and Holofernes"". Telling me to look at the self-portrait of a girl who was raped at her teens. How she grabbed a knife and wished her aggressor to share Holofernes fate. But she did not. Maybe because he was not sleeping. Maybe because of the book in which Judith plays a role. But her wrath, sanctified by the scene, is painted for eternity. But Lorenzo is silent.

My mother, an avid florist and Christian, sometimes would show her many pictures of the forest. Moss have been the highlights of her visits. She would make me laugh when she would show 8 pictures straight; ""This is moss, and this is moss, and this is moss...""
But my mother is still alive and well. She will tell you all about the botanic wonders. How God has made everything so for us. And how there is a story even to moss, shows us good can grow from the shadows of great things. How the small works matter for everyone.

One day, I will be parentless and lost like I was in the Uffizi. I fear the inevitable day that my mother comes to pass and moss becomes like Artemisia's ""Judith""- a wonder in the dark, without someone to show its grat value. I give the Uffizi two stars.

As I am not a particularly avid art enthusiast, I was more interested in the paintings than the sculptures. Having said that I'm glad I visited this gallery, and would recommend stepping back from the paintings and viewing them from top to bottom to understand the vision.

Well worth the admission charge. We were in there for about an hour and a half, but were not hurried by the staff. There are various benches situated throughout so plenty of opportunity to sit, rest and observe.

The waiting times were very reasonable in our case (in total less than 30 mins, but it might easily be longer again post-covid). A security check at the entrance was also quick. 0.5l and larger bottles are normally not allowed to be brought inside, but kindly asking the security staff might grant you an exemption. I would recommend to get audio guides for 6 EUR/person. We relied on an app based guide, which was not nearly as complete as the official ones offered. The entrance area can be a bit confusing, but just keep going with the flow. We spend abour 3h of time when we reached a feeling of saturation. I guess that a time of 5h would be required to really look at everything. A small cafeteria awaits at the end.

We turned up in the morning on the day of our reservation to collect them but only after we queued up we saw a little sign saying we can only come collect tickets ten minutes before our reserved time. We wanted to collect them to go and see one of the other sights included in the ticket but were told that's not possible and can only be collected before going to Uffizi at the pre-booked time 🤦🏼‍♀️ so just be aware of that in case you were planning to use the ticket to go to other places first and leave Uffizi last. ☺️

The museum does not have the extensive collections such as the Louvre or the British museum that cover pre-history to current day pieces, but as represnetative for the quattrocento and ciquecento period of italian renaissance, I believe this mluseum to be unsurpassed. To be able to look at the 'primavera' and the 'birth of Venus' from a distance of less than an inch (2.54 cm) is quite unique and allow the visitor to appreciate the magnificence of the pencil strokes applied by the masters of that period.

Six weeks later the museum is still open and the Trip Advisor listing still tells us it is closed. I'm disappointed that once this notation was implemented on the website, there was apparently no mechanism put into place to accommodate the inevitable re-opening.

Hearing not just about the technicalities of the artistry in the works we viewed, but the historical context surrounding their origination, was particularly remarkable; I greatly enjoyed learning the drama behind the works we were observing, and any future visits I make to the Uffizi Gallery will be that much richer for having had this spectacular introduction to it.

Doge's Palace,Italy,"Watch out! Long queues even with prebooked tickets (October 2021), so highly recommend booking a guided visit.
I took the 10.15am « Secret Itinerary » tour with a wonderful guide and did not have to wait. Quite inexpensive and well worth it, as it takes you behind the scenes to the chambers where the Venice Republic machinery worked on government and justice (secret passages, torture room, places of detention, Casanova's cell, archives room, etc, etc).
I learned not only about the fascinating political institutions of ancient Venice, but also about the hidden architecture of this beautiful and gigantic palace (a visit to the attic reveals how Venetian architects dealt with the challenge of weight-bearing for the immense and heavily decorated ceilings below).
Daniela was our fabulous, very informative guide : Why were actors present during torture? Did Casanova really escape? Why was the number 3 so important in Venetian politics? Were archiving clerks nearly illiterate? Who instituted the 1st quarantine ever to protect a city from the plague?
Daniela kept everyone hanging on her every word. ( btw, she also does private tours danyni89@yahoo.it). 
After this amazing tour, I visited on my own the rest of this somptuous palace (included in the Secret Itinerary ticket), with the help of an audioguide, which, I must admit was not very informative.
I believe the best way to visit this gorgeous and fascinating place is by taking first the « Secret Itineraries » guided visit, then have lunch at the very good museum café in the courtyard, and finally get a guided visit for the Official Rooms.
You won't regret it !
The sophistication of the Venetian government is mindblowing and explains how this tiny city-state became a colonial empire and a supreme maritime power for several centuries

Doge's Palace,Italy,"If you visit ONE thing in Venice, make sure it's this one. The Doge's Palace is absolutely stunning inside and out. We booked a time slot (12-4 pm) with the Venice Unica card, and frankly, it was a waste of money because the queue for the pre-paid, pre-booked tickets still went all the way around the block at 12. We returned at 3:30 pm and managed to get in after a relatively short waiting time.
They were very thorough to check the COVID Green Pass and ID, so it felt fairly safe inside there even with many other tourists visiting at the same time.

My recommendation would be to book a guided tour or even a private guide as no doubt you'll get a lot more out of the visit than going on a self-guided tour. Overhearing some of the guides' commentaries, there were some very insightful and entertaining anecdotes, so next time I'd definitely pay more and have that experience (and possibly avoid the long lines with a booked tour) experience instead.

However, as we were leaving, swarms upon swarms of tour groups from cruise ships were ascending and I was so relieved that we had avoided the nightmare; the site has many steps and is uneven, so to have to manoeuvre the site with so many people would have been uncomfortable and would have spoilt the visit.

If you go to the front of the line, you can download a QR code tht allows you to buy tickets on your phone and skip the line. Recommended! The site is huge. Never realized how big it is. When I think of the Acropolis, I think of the main structure ... not all the other structures on the premises.

Acropolis,Italy,"TL;DR version: As one other reviewer posted here, visiting the Acropolis is more stressful than it is enjoyable, romantic, or fun.

While the Acropolis is beautiful and certainly worth the effort to climb and enjoy, the staff there make it incredibly difficult for visitors to do so. The flow of traffic is somewhat difficult to navigate, and many visitors have audio tours in their ears. When they happen to wander in the wrong direction, the staff attempt to steer them back on course and have to do so quite loudly or harshly — atop of patch of very slippery marble. Disappointingly, the staff try their hardest to control the way people take photos, and this is where we ran into trouble. A rather overzealous woman stationed at the southeast corner of the Parthenon shouted at us from across the marble field to delete our photos “out of respect for the site.” Unfortunately, the fact that she had screamed so loudly to us meant that every single person in the area had heard the commotion and turned to watch the (non-)drama unfold.

After we approached the woman (it took a minute or so to actually walk over to where she was), we asked her “Which photo was the problem so that we know not to do it again.” In the end, after reviewing our photos, she apologized (we had not crossed a barrier, we did not pick anything up, and were not climbing anything; it should also be noted that pictures may be taken of all the structures without flash). It made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience, and we departed from the top of the hill not shortly after (due in part to simply being tired).

Unfortunately, it is now painfully clear the awful reputation of the guards at the Parthenon is one they deserve to have — they are, for all intents and purposes, mall cops. Not even one minute after our collision with this woman, we heard her whistle again at another group of people. Athens has been an absolute joy so far, home to some incredibly nice people, and all of our interactions at other attractions, supermarkets, and retail shops have been lovely. I’ve been able to practice my Greek as much as I can, and I’ve loved every second of it. It is a shame that the staff at the Acropolis are so hyper-focused on fighting the wrong battles. I saw many children climbing the ruins, people slipping on marble, and elderly persons in need of assistance with no guards around to offer any. Also, the rather large guided tours clog the entryways (particularly at the Propylaea), making the Acropolis a rather precarious site. In my eyes, efforts could certainly be made to improve safety over policing those who had not been doing anything wrong. If you are expecting the same level of kindness or professionalism one would see at any museum across the EU, at the Colosseo, Palatino, Les Invalides, or the Catacombs of Paris, forget about it.

Acropolis,Italy,"The view and buildings are impressive. What I personally missed was the storytelling in the information that was provided. Many of the signs were (too) literally translated from Greek, which didn't make them really pleasurable to read. There were some guided tours, but they weren't advertised at the ticket office.

When I visited there was no waiting line, so at least around this time of year it's not necessary to buy a skip the line ticket or anything like that.

Secondly get a licensed guide. We had a gentlemen named Angelos Kokkaliaris, who I recommend very strongly. A guide will really make this place pop. If you're not a total history buff, a lot of what your looking at is just piles of rocks.
In summary, this was absolutely a bucket list visit. The site is overwhelming. You really feel like your walking through history. And craftsmenship that went into this temple, 1500 to 2000 years ago is nothing short of mind blowing. This is a must do.

Acropolis,Italy,"Obviously a must see. We followed the advice abs series at 08:30 (its open form 8-8) until October. It’s similar to the Forum in Rome with temples for the gods. It used to be a walled city and considering that’s it’s built on a hill makes the architecture even more impressive. The views are stunning and stretch to the port. There is nowhere to buy food or drink but there are watering taps and toilets at the top. Check before you drink as the heat turns the water into bath water temperatures.
We entered from the main gate and exited through the theatre (not the amphitheatre which is still in use) and we’re greater by a string of restaurants with cold water and cold beer.

Unfortunately the experience was tarnished by a NATO delegation doing a media tour. There was no prior notification ( I understand that for security reasons but simply stating that it’s open later would suffice.) We arrived at half past 8 and had to wait in the searing sunshine until 11:00 without any access to toilets as they were also locked, before the last VIP’s sauntered down the path to the exit to much boos and hand clapping.

Acropolis,Italy,"We left our hotel early and arrived at the ticket office shortly after it opened and purchased the Acropolis Combo Ticket. As we approached the entrance a gentleman asked if we would like a tour. After negotiating a price and length of tour we journeyed to the top. Be careful and don’t be in a hurry as we saw several people fall. Fortunately all seemed to be unhurt. If you have trouble walking there is a lift that can be used. So please look into that. Once we got to the top we were amazed at the structures and the views of Athens. This is something you do not want to miss and you don’t want to be hurried. After our tour was completed we spent an extra thirty or forty minutes wandering around on our it. It is certainly a site to behold.

Acropolis,Italy,"It was a challenge for me. I had knee surgery three months ago. Our taxi driver drove us up to the main gate because i had crutches.
There was a side access for people with disability. There was a cart to drive us to the special elevator. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
Got to enjoy exploring the top of the hill before returning to the main level via the elevator.
Beware the ground on top. There were about 15 steep stairs fir the next level. Ground is very uneven and big rocks are “polished “ from centuries of people walking on them.
While challenging, it was worth it

From her extensive knowledge of archeology and history, she fast- tracked all the important information that I needed to know without reading every placard in the Acropolis Museum. It can be overwhelming to be in Athens in the summer heat, but enthusiastically and energetically, Faye lead me to the great sites and her guidance was invaluable!! I would beyond recommend this classy lady to guide me wherever I wanted to explore in Greece! Do yourself a favor and just trust her guidance. She knows what she is doing! From finding a shady spot at the Acropolis so she could go into more detail about a marble sculpture- to how to get to the airport: Faye is who you want by your side in Greece.

We went right when it opened to try and avoid the heat of the midday. Be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen! It is an uphill climb, but it doesn't feel like one as our guide kept us enthralled with historical facts and history lessons – most of which is not on the reading plaques around the artifacts.

Be sure to wear a hat, sunscreen, and take a bottle of water. Thanks to COVID, and going early in the morning, there was no line at the ticket booth. We walked right up and right in! The ruins are breathtaking, and so beautiful. Be sure to take your camera! Sadly, there were those with no respect, who were climbing over the ruins, standing on top of the ruins, and generally not being their best selves, but luckily the crowds were not bad before noon.

Also, they advised us that a few days prior they had closed the site from 1-5pm because there was a heat advisory. There were guides outside the Acropolis offering tours and we joined up with another couple to pay 20 euros per person. We found it well worth it.The ticket for the Acropolis is 20 euros, but for 30 euros you can get access to a few other sites around the city. We did the 30 euros and regretted it as we didn't end up using it (we only had a day in Athens). Also, it doesn't include access to the Acropolis museum (which we wrongly assumed) and that's an additional 10 euros. The museum is really great - nicely designed space to learn more about the history and see the original artifacts.

Underground Naples,Italy,"This is the 'official' Sotteranea in Centro, just past the north end of ""Christmas Street"", not the other one with the same name.

Their advance booking system is poor, no indication of the tour language. When I contacted them by e-mail, they replied three days later that they weren't sure when the English tours would be so I should write to them again a day in advance. This made sense, so I wrote to them again a day in advance. Three days later I got exactly the same reply, they weren't sure when the English tours would be so I should write to them a day in advance!

Anyway, things were clearer in person and advance booking was not needed. We booked and took an English tour. Our guide was perfectly good, we did not have the bored and detached guide described in earlier posts. However, her accent was sometimes hard to follow given her high speed.

The tour itself is only of moderate interest. It did illuminate some of the water supply issues of the city and how Romans tried to address them before they had pumps. The fake German(?) tank was not interesting. Our guide was frank about the fact that the water in the pools had been added for our benefit. The supposedly claustrophobic passages were fun to walk/run through, and not very claustrophobic.

I turned up at the address I guessed the tour would start and the tour operators told me it was the wrong one and I had the wrong company. The address I needed was 30 min across town.

When I booked a tour in Pompei the tour people rang me to make sure I knew where to meet. I heard absolutely nothing from these people, neither email or call.

Underground Naples,Italy,"our guide wasnt very engaged, it sounded like a very mechanized talk, we were told the tour would take 1,5 hour, in the end we finished in less than an hour. I am not saying this in order for guide to get minus points, but in order for the sotterranea or the agency to train them better. There was no option for us to ask questions, no one told us we would need to use our phone during the tour and that if you're ""claustrophobic"" half of the tour is not for you. 
Also, in covid times, I think the groups should be limited to less than 10 people.  The structure and organization of tours wasn't that good either, we had to constantly wait for other groups to finish their talk at certain location so we could enter. All in all, too many tours and with too many people. which, at least in my personal opinion would mean: very money  driven, which partly ofcourse makes sense, but it should also be value for money. However, the concept of the tour is pretty unique, but its presentation could be improved. 

iI want to add that it could be that we simply had bad luck or that the guide had a bad day, so I wouldnt like to generalize my experience. See it for yourself :)

Underground Naples,Italy,"This tour could have been great, but unfortunately turned out to be the worst guided tour experience I’ve ever had. The underground sites are really cool to see, but our guide, Micheal, was the worst tourguide I’ve ever encountered. He gave very limited information about the different sites we visited, made us wait for 10/15/20 minutes at a time before moving on to the next site because there was a group before us, but didn’t bother to interact with the group during the long waits. Instead he was on his phone ALL THE TIME. When someone in our group commented on this fact he got angry. Furthermore; the group was supposed to be a maximum of 30 people, our group consisted of at least 60. Long story short; this was a waste of time and money. We saw some cool sites, but most of the tour consisted of waiting and I didn’t really learn anything. Felt like a tourist trap to me and I’m not surprised people left the tour at different points in time. Tour: August 28 2021, 6PM.

Underground Naples,Italy,"I visited the underground today, Saturday August 28 at 4:00 p.m. with the guide for the group in English. It was the worst experience I have ever had with a guide. He didn't bother to introduce himself, he didn't explain ANYTHING to us, he was going so fast that we passed all the other two groups that arrived BEFORE us (Deutsch, French). He rushed us from site to site, he made his little explanations even shorter, had no interaction with the group, didn’t show us all the places he was supposed to show. He was on his phone all the time. Someone in the group dared to ask him a question, he didn't even bother to look up from his phone to answer her. We were all shocked and disgusted by his behavior. Some people even left in the middle of the tour. The tour ended when the guide left us alone in a hallway. Unfortunately, we were unable to get his first name because he didn’t tell us his name. Some of the people in the group told me his name was MICHAEL. I strongly do NOT recommend anyone who wishes to visit the undergrounds to visit it with this English speaking guide who might be MICHAEL. I assure you that you will have a really bad time. He disrespected us all and wanted to rush the tour as quickly as possible. It’s a shame for a tourist site like this. You have other undergrounds to visit in Naples, go there and don’t waste your money on this site if you need an English guide. The English guide has long hair with a small ponytail and is in his thirties, always on his phone. You can't miss him, no one can't be more unpleasant than him.

Underground Naples,Italy,"Yesterday’s walking tour of Napoli Solterranea was great exercise and an awesome history experience. The Romans were amazing engineers! Their aqueducts built in the 4th Century B.C. brought water for Napoli to these underground storage caves from mountain sources that were 400 km distant. Those aqueducts still working today. The tour is offered in Italian and English. I didn’t have time to wait for the 6.00 PM English tour so I went at 5:15 on the Italian tour. I was fortunate to have a family from Switzerland on my tour. The husband translated for me. The tour guide speaks at great length with many stops through the caves. Some are very narrow and require sideways movement. It lasted about 90 minutes and was a lot of steps as well as walking. Very worthwhile if you like a vigorous walking experience and don’t mind a few tight tunnels. Cost is 10 Euros. Yesterday they could only process cash.

Underground Naples,Italy,"This is a really great tour - but be aware that there is a rip-off version around the corner. Only go the the one with the big “suterraneo” arch over the door. The tour goes for 1.15h and includes squeezing through narrow tunnels, along aqueducts and seeing an old Roman theatre. Definitely worth going. Maybe prebook your ticket. We waited in line for quite a while",5.0,Aug 2021
Underground Naples,Italy,"We had seen pictures with underground gardens and were expecting to see things like that. We didn't, but were told that was at the tour at the other end of the aqueduct system, however, those aren't old. They are current projects of the university for experiments they are conducting.

However, what we did see was interesting, and helped us understand how this system worked, first as an aqueduct system for the city, but later as a series of bomb shelters during WW2, and how the army retrofitted it for that purpose. Lots of information and stories. I highly recommend!",4.0,Aug 2021

Underground Naples,Italy,"My boyfriend and I did not initially plan to visit the underground of Naples, however we happened to be in the area and thought we might give it a look, and I am glad we did.

When we arrived there were just two spaces left for a tour in English 20 minutes later, we paid 10€ per person for entrance to the underground and a guided tour.

I feel like it was very high value for money compared to a lot of other things in Naples. Our guide was really great and explained a lot of interesting things.

I am very claustrophobic and although being underground was a little uncomfortable, there was plenty of room and no tight spaces. The only time where I felt uncomfortable was when there was a tour inside the old acueducts, that part of the tour is completely optional, and I didn't go, which I was really glad I didn't after I heard how my boyfriend described it.

All in all we had a really great experience, and I would recommend this tour to anyone!

Underground Naples,Italy,"Nice and cool to walk underground when it's over 30 degrees (C) outside. The narrow hallways offered some extra excitement. Arriving at the large halls with clear water pools was nice. The tour was on Sunday at 16:00. Tour groups were much too tightly spaced. At some points in the tour three groups were packed into the same hall and we had to wait for our turn. The guides should have left more space between groups. Our guide Michael seemed to be in a bit of a rush and at times it was hard to hear him. At one point he gestured toward a board with pictures from important historical events, but these were never explained nor did we have time to read the texts. Our tour ended abruptly at the end of a sentence.

Museo Egizio,Italy,"Turin is considered to be the city where Egyptology began; its Museum of Egyptian Antiquities holds artifacts obtained in the excavation sites studied by the Italian Archaeological Mission in the 1900s, consequently to the (failed) Napoleonic Campaigns in Egypt. Thousands of artifacts, sarcophagi, mummies, papyri, jewels and statues are now exhibited in this impressive museum up to par with the Vatican, Louvre, MMA collections.
Among the most significant vestiges found are the intact tombs of Kha and Merit, along with the rupestrian temple of Ellesija.
One could spend days in this amazing museum: Exhibits are comprehensive and well curated with concise explanatory notes in Italian, English and Arabic..

Museo Egizio,Italy,"Terrible experience top to bottom.

No wonder, since it pretends to be government owned, in reality it is owned by Intesa, the most corrupt bank in Italy with a crook on top.

You can't take a bottle of water into the museum, the tickets are too pricey, and the staff are primates. Sorry primates are more considerate and friendly than these creepy creatures called staff.

Not worth it.

Arena di Verona,Italy,"When you come to veron talke the time to check out this nice Arena, It is one of the few left arenas in Italia that it acutally remians active, they have all kinds ofo concerts and special events year Round. Take the time to explore it and do yourself a favor pay for the admission ticket when you are there is worth it! The best time to go is when they very open around 10 am there is not so much people and you can enjoy it better or just walk it they otside at night and take the views as much as you can. It is very close to the Veron (Busy) Shopping district and it is at a very close proximity to the Verona Center (and casa de Julieta).

Arena di Verona,Italy,"Forecast for the day when Aida had to be performed said: ""Disruption due to thunderstorms"" with 90% rain probability. 
Myself and husband had been very much looking forward to watch that Opera, so we tried to stay positive.
During the day rain has been on again and off again; when we arrived at 8.40 pm, scattered drops were falling while vendors were selling cheap rain ponchos outside the amphitheater (and ffp2 face masks, mandatory to attend the performance). 
By 9:00 pm there was still a light sprinkling, enough to block the start of the performance (musical instruments get easily ruined by rain drops), then the rain stopped … then restarted … and again … Aida started and stopped three times; from our seats we could see orchestra musicians going up and down the backstage with their instruments. Fun moments: enthusiastic rounds of applause did welcome,from time to time,the cleaning company trying to dry the stage between sprinkles.
Most audience at that point were wearing ponchos and even opening some umbrellas (yes, you can bring an umbrella inside Arena,providing it has no sharped tip)
Eventually Aida really started (9.45pm ?) and went on.
There was just one break: remind that restrooms are very few, decently clean but quite “old fashioned”.
There is a bar for coffee and spritz;you are allowed to bring bottled water (plastic only) and sandwiches inside the Arena, but metal objects and cameras are forbidden. These items have to be left outside the entrance, no receipt given at all, so you need to be lucky and find your stuff at the end of the performance ! Conclusion: don't carry with you anything that you don’t wish to loose!
Even if we had rain and delays , we fully enjoyed Aida and would recommend to tempt fate and book your seats at least one month in advance, as Arena offers an exceptional, wonderful experience.
Cast, orchestra, lights, sound and scenography were excellent!! In my opinion it's worth to spend some more money in order to get a side stall (poltrona) not too far from the stage.
