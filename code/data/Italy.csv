Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Fantastic experience in a place full of history and spirituality, even for an poor old pagan as myself. Impressive and beautiful. Free of charge. Sometimes long queues to enter.",Nov 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We walked in at the start of 5 o'clock mass and it took my breath away. We heard the organ, the choir and the service while we took in the incredible art and history in the basilica. Not to be missed, regardless of religious background!",Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Simply awesome and absolutely beautiful. Stand at the entrance and try and take it all in. Huge paintings, sculptures, mosaics there’s so much to see. Pope John Paul II mausoleum simple but powerful. Confessionals for those inclined to take confession. Hard to believe this is a church still in use and not just a tourist attraction. Certainly the highlight of my trip to Rome. Even if you’re not religiously inclined I challenge you not to be awestruck by this building. Free to visit (fee charged for climbing the dome).",Sep 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"One of the most iconic (if not the most iconic) churches in the world. It is just HUGE, it is beautiful, it is incredibly decorated. Underneath is the necropolis with the graves of the popes and of course at the higher level of the dome the view can take your breath away.",Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"we queued on the day for about an hour and did the dome tour. Lots of steps, very steep and gets hard on the legs but so worth it if you can do it!! the views from inside the church and from the top of the Dome of Vatican and Rome were AMAZING. So reasonable at 8 Euro each as well! Church is free. We loved it.",Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,3.0,we had considered buying 'skip the line tickets for both st peters and the vatican and are glad we saved our money. the wait times were not too long and we saw many guided tours having to wait a while anyway. tip get the elevator ticket for the dome just 10 euro but there are a lot of steps so you'll need to rest now and again.,Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,This is an amazing art and architecture place to visit. Don’t miss it. Moreover it’s free. You really are in the heart of the catholic church. The mosaics are incredible. Photos are allowed.,Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We booked a private St. Peter's Basilica Dome Climb through ""Get Your Guide"". Mr Samuele was an amazing guide. his English was impeccable, his knowledge encyclopedic, and his passion for the art of St. Peter's was obvious. Thoroughly enjoyable climb to the Dome which provides you with incredible panoramic views of Rome and the Vatican. Mr. Samuele identified the many sites you could see and explained what they were and when asked gave information on how to 'get' to them. His tour through the Basilica and crypts was filled with information on the art and artists represented. He did not limit his tour to 'the big ones' but highlighted many lesser know works and their creators. We recommend him without reservation.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,We did not go inside the Basilica due to time constraints. The exterior is amazing by itself. Add in the size of the plaza and the other buildings and it’s worth your time.,Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Women should NOT wear shorts, skirts above the knee, tops with lots of cleavage or bare shoulders.

Monitors stand at the entrance AFTER the metal detectors & reject people who are not dressed appropriately for entering a house of God.

Why edit in line fir an hour to be turned away?
Be respectful and dress fir church, not a nightclub or the beach.

Once inside, it is a working church, so low whispers are encouraged. Selfie sticks will get swatted down... it’s just too crowded.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Booked a private guided tour of St Peters church and couldn’t be more happy. We got picked up at our hotel and in 10 minutes we arrived at our meeting point. There is to much to say about the whole experience, so it’s better to just lay it down to , this is a must place to visit no matter what. So so impressive and humbling, the whole scale and beauty of everything is overwhelming. Outstanding!",Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"The Main catholic cathedral is really majestic. One of the biggest cathedrals of catholic world painted with frescoes by famous Italian painters. Must be visited definitely. It is free of charge just be respectful for believers and people who visit the cathedral to pray. Dress code is simple- no naked shoulders or knees, so no short skirts or shorts. At least have extra cloth to cover what guards ask you to cover otherwise they reject to let you in.",Oct 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"The Cathedral itself is awe-inspiring and so worth visiting! Booking a guided tour was the best decision! Silvia had such a great way of telling stories and engaging the group, she made everything so much more interesting and gave life to all the beautiful ststues inside the church. I strongly recommend booking a tour, we booked ours through Tiqet. Really gives an insight into how the basilica came to be and allows you to learn so many interesting things!",Sep 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,1.0,"I just could not get into san peter’s dear church because I was wearing a short pants. The person from security at the entrance actually hurt me shouting at me and being so violent when I did not contest. Men can go inside with the same short trouser I had. I am quite shocked about such violence and inhumanity.
Bless san peters church, everybody is not welcomed though",Sep 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,I don’t know where to begin with this phenomenal church! First make sure you are dressed appropriately! Make sure your shoulders are covered and your dresses your shorts are down to your knees otherwise he will not be allowed in. Walking up to the entrance of the church make sure to pay attention to the detail outside of the church. The day we went we actually got to witness mass which was quite amazing. Once you are inside the church it is absolutely breathtaking the artwork the marble just the presents of God inside. There’s so many things I could talk about with this church but I will leave that for you to see.,Sep 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"This was my 3rd visit to St. Peter's and it is still awe-inspiring. Everywhere you look there are magnificent works of art, starting with Michelangelo's Pieta on the right side once you enter. Thinking about the workmanship that went into every square inch of this Basilica is mind boggling. A MUST SEE!

Be sure to spend the extra 7 euro and WALK up to the dome. It's 551 steps but you get to stop and walk around the interior of the dome (looking down into the Basilica) before you continue up to the roof.",Sep 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Beautiful basilica and our tour guide, Chiara, (with Headout) was fabulous! She was prompt and informative and very enjoyable to be with.",Sep 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"In preparation for my third trip to Rome, I scheduled a tour through Headout for St. Peter's Basilica Dome Climb & Papal Tombs. I had been to St. Peter's Basilica, but had missed out on those two important experiences. My tour guide was Chiara, part of When in Rome Tours. Prior to arriving, which my wife and I were a bit late for, she called to check up on us. Already a great start. From introduction to farewell, Chiara was amazing! Very knowledgeable about the tour she led, while sprinkling in humor throughout the more than two hours she spent with us. The experience was entertaining due to her interaction with the group, which comprised of people from four different countries. I would jump on any tour that Chiara led.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,3.0,"Let be honest - the Church / Basilica is magnificent (grand), also popes tomb is very special to see / experience, but...
Be aware of a dress code wanting to enter (unfortunately does not apply to all visitors).
They will check you (as on airport - sceners) and doing that before entering they will also check if you are dressed properly (shorts slightly above the knee and T-shirt is O.K.). Especially women's short skirts and pants, or uncovered shoulders are a no-go, but unfortunately not for all. As some people are rejected (it is a possibility to go outside, buy a scarf, cover yourself and go again through all the procedures), some are by a miracle left to enter, even though having very shot (even indecent) dresses/attire.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"It should be on your ""must see"" list!

It is monumental and beautifull beyond words.

If you are a catholic, please note that Pope John Paul II is also laid to rest here (second chapel on the right from the entrance) and you can say your prayers in front of his grave.

Pieta by Michelangelo is also such a touching work of art that you simply must see for yourself.

We were there in the begining of August 2021 and there were no crowds, we have waited only 5 minutes to pass the security check.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,Like it or not and if you're a believer or not this place is magnificent and will leave you speechless if you are seeing it for the first time. It is a place that must be visited at least once in a lifetime.,Aug 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,Crowds are insane but this is something you have to go and see. Really amazing architecture and history. And I need 10 characters to make the TripAdvisor minimums.,Sep 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,1.0,"Wore shorts above the knee as a female. I wasn't allowed to go in. Saw men passing me by with even shorter pants who could enter. When my husband mentionned this I was simply told ""he has spoken""... Ok, i can deal with dress codes. But not if they only apply to women and men and not only woman. Sexist institution...",Aug 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,3.0,"I know this is contrarian, but St. Peter's is the least interesting church I saw in Rome, and I saw a lot. Michelangelo's Pieta is great but it's behind glass at a distance so you can hardly see it. St. Peter's is big, but quantity doesn't mean quality. If there were a really long line to enter, I would seriously consider skipping it.",Aug 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"If you are in Rome, you MUST go and see St. Peter’s Basilica. Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure. A must see.",Jul 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Absolutely stunning!
I recommend you come on Sunday to see the Pope give a small speech from his window at 12pm (my and a fellow traveler tried to see him on Wednesday at 10 but according to one of the guards you only see him Sundays). Do come earlier to choose a spot, as people start arriving an hour before at least.

With Covid restrictions, the crowd isn't as big (about a quarter of the square fills up). Also the entrance to the Basillica is free if you don't want to climb the dome (you must cover your arms and knees. I recommend in the Summer to bring a loose skirt or baggy trousers to wear on top of shorts so you don't have to boil for the rest of the day.)

Inside is definitely the most beautiful church I've ever seen, there are frescos and statues and ceiling paintings. There is also a ""secret door"" behind St Peter's statue holding the big X cross where you can visit St Peter's tomb and the other popes' tombs too. I went after seeing the Pope, so there was a bit of a crowd.

The shops in the Vatican are cheaper than the center of Rome, I did a fair bit of gift shopping around the area afterward (e.g. stands with beautiful jewelry for 1 euro, and the Vatican post in St Peter's square sells postage stamps for 1.15 a piece rather than 1.60 as I've seen in Rome. I was there also on a Monday morning around 10am and there was no one else, so I dropped my postcards in the box immediately after buying the stamps.)

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Regardless if you’re religious or not I’d recommend you to visit St. Peter’s basilica.

Make sure you cover your shoulders (men and women) and knees (only women from our experience) however out of courtesy men should also cover their knees.

The basilica is flawlessly built, decorated and painted by masters of their craft and wherever you look there will be an absolutely fantastic sight.",Jun 2021
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"This is the biggest church in the world, very huge and decorated , it worth every minute that you spend there , many details to see.",Jun 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,Utterly jaw dropping views. A must visit regardless of your interest in the church. NOTE: CLIMB THE STEPS YOURSELF. There are circa 500-600 steps to the top (which you can climb yourself for a reduced entry price) and I would highly recommend doing so. It made the already amazing view even more worth while. Never mind the colosseum or the Sistine chapel - this is the place in Rome to visit.,Sep 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Visiting St. Peter's Basilica for the first time is an uplifting feeling. You can easily miss some things that in in the Basilica.

As you enter, look to the right, against the far wall you will see Michelanglo's ""Pieta"" sculpture. I was stunned to see that someone could start with a block of marble and come to this result. The sculpture is behind bullet proof glass !

The photo from the roof is the gift to those who climbed the ""many"" stairs to the roof.

The large black canopy over the main altar is the ""Baldachin"" by Benini. The Baldachin is to respect the tomb of St. Peter which is under the main altar.

A beautiful place !!!!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"St. Peter's, the beating heart of Catholicism.
St. Peter's Church attracts pilgrims from all over the world.
Almost everyone is amazed upon entering the richly decorated Basilica, under Michelangelo's vast dome.
In the 2nd century, a sanctuary was erected over the tomb of St. Peter.
The first great basilica, ordered by Emperor Constantine, was completed around 349 AD.
In the 15th century it was in ruins and in 1506 Pope Julius II laid the first stone of the new church.
However, it took more than a century to build and all the great architects of the Roman Renaissance and Baroque worked on it.
Coming to Rome and not visiting St. Peter's Basilica is something that even those who are not Catholics should not do.
It is of the richest places in art and history in the world.
Entering the basilica is already awe-inspiring. Seeing the tall dome from the inside and all the works of art that decorate it is a memorable experience
If you want to try something unique and have a 360 degree view of Rome, go up the Dome, it is tiring (an infinite number of steps) but it is worth it and you will have a unique view.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Regardless of your religious affiliation, Catholic or not, St. Peter's Basilica is one of the places you will never ever forget! With reverence and awe, this massive and magnificent Church goes back to the time of the Renaissance, where the Italian art masters such as Michelangelo, Bernini, Raphael, to name a few, once walk on it's marbles floors to create magnificent frescoes, sculptures (The Pieta) , and architectural wonders dedicated to God. When you go, no wearing of sleeveless outfit, shorts, mini skirts, plunging neckline , especially if you are a woman.",Jan 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"For me personally, going to Vatican is one of my goals. I went there to see the big historical Church - because im a catholic, when all big events happens.

Due to the coronavirus stuff there is currently nearly no tourists in Roma area ! So normally you should queue for several hours to visit the Basilica, but this time we went in the afternoon and we did not wait for even a single minute.

Visiting this huge monument completely empty of people provides huge emotions. Several annex chapels are restricted for prayer-only, but the rest of the church can be discovered quietly. 

With the audio guide, the visit is worth at least an hour. So amazing huge Church.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Because of Covid restrictions we could not walk from the Vatican Museum to St Peter’s. Instead we had to exit the museum, walk round the walls of the Vatican and enter from St Peter’s Square where there was the usual temperature tests and security searches.
Once through that ( easy because of the lack of tourists) you enter the huge church on the right hand side of the nave. A one way system is in place so the first thing you see to your right is La Pieta, the famous Michelangelo sculpture of Mary and the crucified Jesus. Three years ago you could not get anywhere near it but, in the time of Covid, you could walk right up to the bullet proof glass protecting it. You then walk in an anti clockwise direction all round the huge basilica, marvelling at the huge scale of the building, the many side chapels, paintings and sculptures

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,What a magnificent place to visit. Especially during this current climate. No crowds or queues. We climbed the basilica which you had to pay for in CASH. No cards accepted. Worth noting. It was well worth it though. 551 steps but you can miss a couple of hundred of them if you pay extra and get the lift. Personally the steps were ok. You have plenty of time and opportunities to slow down or rest. Superb view at the top.,Oct 2020

Amazing art, sculpture and devotional artefacts. There are chairs set aside in the side chapels for private prayer. There are works by Raphael, Michelangelo and other rennaisance artists, so it's a true cultural experience. This is an experience not to be missed, and at the moment not too busy.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,"A must see , the dome ,worth the the climb , very high not to be recommended if you are uneasy with heights . On the ground floor do not go into the caticoums until you have completed you're viewing as this is the way out with no return.",Sep 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We went here on 29sep 2020, we had booked a time for 10am using the omnia card we had bought online (worth buying) we got there at 9.30, hardly any tourists, we we escorted to main entrance straightaway, no waiting. We had bag scanned and temp taken, and then we were in, nothing can prepare you for the sight you get when you walk into the basilica, it is absolutely stunning, it is massive with so many things to look at (we were offered a free guide, but we just wandered around ourselves, with the omnia card you can get a guide you can download onto your phone, you tap the numbers on the little map and it gives you a spoken guide for where you are, handy.
You can go up the dome, which is 551 steps, it is €8 to go up, or €10 to get the lift( we paid €10 we thought it takes you most of the way,it skips 230 steps, you still have to walk up 321 steps) most of them are quite narrow, and some parts you are leaning to the side because of the dome, I have to say I found it quite hard, so if you have any medical issues give this a miss. You get a good view of Rome from top, but you can get a good view from castel sant’ Angelo or from pincio hill,having known now about how bad the steps were I wouldn’t have bothered

It’s free to get in, you pay to go up to the dome but couldn’t find anywhere to book this online. We didn’t try as we had done more than enough walking by that point but there is a lift if you need it. The website explains men must wear long trousers but there’s loads of men with shorts on and they’re not questioned at all. Ladies must cover their shoulders and wear an appropriate length skirt/trousers.

According to tradition, the basilica stands at the burial place of St. Peter, recognized by Catholics as the first pope - his grave lies under the main altar. It is a leading work of Renaissance and Baroque architecture, with a very rich interior design, where there are also monuments from the former Constantine basilica built in this place ,including the bronze figure of St. Peter Arnolf di Cambio. In the modern period, Michelangelo - Vatican Pieta, Gianlorenzo Bernini ,including Saint Peter's altar with canopy, Cathedra Petri, tombstones of Pope Alexander VII and Urban VIII, figure of Saint Longinus, made their works of art here.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"St. Peter's Basilica is absolutely stunning, both inside and out. We had to wait 30 minutes in line to get in (can't imagine how long the wait would be in summer) and another 15-20 minutes to climb the dome. Note that you will pass a security check (but bringing bottled water is fine).

If you want to climb the dome, I recommend to go there first as the visit to the dome will end right inside the church. Entrance fee to climb the dome is €8 per person if you are going to climb the stairs the whole way up - note you can only pay in cash to avoid dissapointment once you're at the cashier's desk. You can skip part of the stairs by taking an elevator, but that's more expensive. If you're reasonably fit, not afraid of heights and not afraid of small spaces, I totally recommend to climb up. The climb is fun. You will get a close-up look at the inside of the dome (which is beautifully decorated) and once you're on top, outside, the view over the square and the rest of the city is amazing. You will go down a different set of stairs than the ones you take when going up, so the lines of people are neatly separated. The inside of the church is amazing too - I couldn't stop looking up as the ceilings are so beautiful. A must-see when you're in Rome/the Vatican!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Be early if you want to avoid long queues. We arrived 8:05 AM and we need to wait 30 minutes in a queue before we passes security. Two hours later queue to security check was several hundred meters. You need to have proper clothes to have access to basilica. Shirt without sleeves and mini shorts isn't permitted.
Access to basilica is free, but we visited in Dome and it was 8eur/adult. Size of the basilica is amazing and it's the world largest church. Saint Peter's Basilica is the great masterpiece of architecture and art. Michelangelo's Pietà and Saint Peter's bronze statue are maybe the the best ones.
We visited in Dome without elevator. There is 551 steps to climb, but it was worth to visit. View over the Rome is nice. If it's clear sky you can Colosseo. Vatican's garden is also worth to see from Dome.
When you leaving the basilica there is post office and I sent postcard's from Vatican. Postal service was pretty fast only three days when postcards were delivered.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"One of the most beautiful views in the Vatican, but the climb is not for the faint hearted. Entry to the church is free of charge but to climb the dome is €8, or €10 per person if you want to take the lift half way. You can only pay by cash on entry, but also be aware that there were signs to say that they do not accept the Roma tour passes or passes purchased through travel agents.
The climb is over 500steps, or just over 300steps if you take the lift option. The stairway becomes very narrow the higher you climb, and some of the stair case is winding and on a slant which can feel a bit weird. If you are claustrophobic then just be aware that approx the last 50steps are snug to say the least - not too much more than shoulder width room.
The views are absolutely stunning when you reach the top. It was well worth the climb as you won’t get views like this anywhere else in the Vatican.

BTW, many people incorrectly use a possessive form in the name of who is being honored by the church. In this case, Saint Peter. It is not his basilica. It his named for him or in honor of him. I'm not sure why some people do that for churches, but not other public buildings or areas. We don't say Rockefeller's Center or Dealey's Plaza. Strange.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"A renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest and greatest church in the world. Catholics believe the basilica is the burial site of St Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first bishop of Rome(Pope). The basilica is approached via St Peter's square. The facade , with a giant order of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two 5.55m statues of the first apostles to Rome, Saints Peter and Paul. The basilica is cruciform in shape, with an elongated nave in the Latin cross form. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. When you stepped inside the basilica, you would be shocked by the interior dimensions. The entire interior is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs,architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people. It is free to visit the basilica but you have to q up and go through security. It took us 45 minutes to get in.

Biggest church in the world. Inside was pretty overwhelming. Huge huge huge. Many small areas that you can enter to kneel and pray. Security will stop visitors from entering if they think you are not catholic. I was going in to pray and they let me in. Its only for prayers and no picture taking. So please if you are not going in to pray, kindly respect the rules. Don't attempt to lie in a place of worship.

Some areas are off limits to public. There's a marble board with the list of previous popes dating back to St Peter. Thought that was cool. There's a gift shop with rosaries, cruxifixes, holy water, etc. All about the same price as Santa Maria Maggiore, but more variety and some do go for higher prices.

Catholic or not, i recommend this place to everyone. Am sure it will be appreciated by all.

Watch out for pickpockets. Saw so many visitors carrying their small backpacks with the zips wide open. Both in the queue and inside the basilica.

My advice is to take a minute, sit down and just look around at the beauty that you're witnessing. You can walk up the 551 steps to the dome, which is an incredible view. Then walk downstairs underneath St. Peter's Basilica to the Vatican Grottoes which contain the tombs and sarcophagi of numerous popes, as well as several huge columns from the original 4th-century basilica.

Seeing the Pity by Michaelangelo and discovering that he created it aged 24 is moving and awe inspiring. Quite an experience.",Feb 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,3.0,"Coming from a non-conformist background this beautiful, opulent building reeks of political power with superstition (rubbing a statue's foot) and idolatry rather than a Christian message of piety and humility.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,as per my other posts it was so busy when we went. Very interesting to take a look around and see how big this place is.,Oct 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Wow. So much wow. Inside and out is breath taking.

We prebooked a tour of the museums, Sistine chapel and St Peters. This is absolutely the way to go. Entrance is on the opposite side of the city from St Peters and with ticket in hand you walk right up. I was here in February and literally walked right in to the metal detector to meet the tour group. Lines at St Peters and lines outside the tour entrance are not your problem with a ticket. Go past the line on the tour side and show a guard and he lets you pass right in.

You can buy the tour on the Vaticans official website and do not need any of the after market options. You also do not need any of the “skip the line” options people charge so much more for. Now, I will remind you I was here in February. Maybe it’s longer or different during the summer months but I am not sure how with the timed tour. The guards won’t let you pass until 30-45 minutes before your tour. I assume that would be consistent year round.

Finally, at the end of the tour, you can remain inside St Peter’s Basilica and explore that as long as you like.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"St Peter’s Basilica, one of the most famous, richest and largest basilicas in Rome, welcomes over 40,000 to 50,000 visitors per day, which amounts to over 10 million visitors per year. Many people visit from all around the country and the world to see the marvel and spectacular that is St Peter’s Basilica to dedicate their time, effort and money for a purpose that’s larger ourselves. As St Peter’s Basilica is considered one of the holiest churches for Christians, it’s become a place of pilgrimage as well as for Christians to celebrate and embrace their faith. St Peter’s Basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, hence the name, who was the chief among Jesus’ apostles, as well as being the First Bishop of Rome. Even though I’m not religious in the slightest, St Peter’s Basilica holds a rich history as well as some of the most majestic and magnificent masterpieces, such as Michelangelo's work of Pietà and designing St Peter’s Basilica as Pope Paul III appointed him to be Chief Architect. Overall, St Peter’s Basilica stands at an impressive 132 meters, in comparison to The Colosseum which stands at 27 meters, with a diameter of 42 meters. The Statue of Liberty only stands at 93 metres, allowing The Statue of Liberty to comfortably sit inside St Peter’s Basilica with space still left.

Upon entering The Vatican City, St Peter’s Basilica dominates the skyline of Rome and for anyone, becomes a breathtaking moment when they first set eyes on St Peter’s Basilica. At this moment people are taken aback by the scale and sheer size of the basilica, with their eyes scrambling from one area to the next, in one moment it’s simply too much to take in. St Peter’s Basilica was originally commissioned by Emperor Constantine during an era between 319 and 333 AD, with the land being where Saint Peter had been buried over 250 years earlier. Just like The Colosseum it became victim of abandonment and neglect led it to then being redesigned in the 15th century. Pope Nicholas V commissioned this work to be done by Alberti and Rossellino yet this didn’t go far and completion was far from done. Although, Pope Julius II then turned these plans into a reality by laying the first stone for St Peter’s Basilica. Even though construction began in 1506, Bramante's death then led to construction being halted once again, with the next few architects making little to no progress. However, it was Michelangelo who then made the largest and most impressive impact on St Peter’s Basilica, as Michelangelo declared that this to be his greatest achievement as he drew up the plans. Unfortunately, Michelangelo died in 1564 but work on St Peter’s Basilica continued to progress rapidly and in 1626 it was completed.

As mentioned before, St Peter’s Basilica has become a place of interest for both locals and tourists from all over the world, leading to long queues regardless of the date. As I visited St Peter’s Basilica at 1:30pm on Sunday, there was an overwhelming queue which seemed that it would never end. However, I only waited 30 minutes to get through the security checks and then walk up the stairs to the entrance of St Peter’s Basilica. It should be noted that there is a strict dress code along with strict security restrictions, as St Peter’s Basilica has unfortunately been a target in the past for vandalism. The other reason being that St Peter’s Basilica is an important place of worship that has been open for hundreds of years, with the preservation being kept for utmost importance. Either way, it was quick and easy to get through these security checks by simply putting my bag through an x-ray machine and then walking through a metal detector.

Even though The Treasury Museum is located inside of St Peter’s Basilica, it requires an admission ticket which is available to purchase for a small fee of €5 and reduced admission for those 12 and under for €3. The entrance to The Treasury Museum can be found behind the gift shop, located on the left aisle of St Peter’s Basilica, which was a building attached under Pope Pius VI during the 18th century who commissioned Marchionni to complete this addition. It should be noted that photography was strictly prohibited in nearly all of the areas in The Treasury Museum with members of staff and guards in every room keeping a watchful eye on those who walked around. Luckily, those who enter The Treasury Museum will receive a free audio guide which allows the visitor to walk around and become absorbed with the incredible history of these valuables while admiring them in front of the glass case they’re kept in.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,You don't pay to get in but you do queue to go through security checks. You can pay to go to top of dome which is well worth it for the amazing views.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We didn't have a fast pass to get in here but only stood in the queue for 20 minutes. It did look grand from the outside but it truly is something else inside. There is so much detail, culture and history in there is unreal. There is the opportunity to go down into the grotoes where a lot of the past popes are entombed. There are no photo signs in there but unfortunately there were still people taking selfies with the sarcophagus' which we found a bit saddening and disrespectful. There was certainly a shift in atmosphere as you walked through. There is also the opportunity to pay to enter the treasury but we didn't as there was so much to see in the Basilica itself. You could also pay to climb to the top of the dome. Again we didn't as we had done so much walking I don't think my legs would of took me up them. We very almost didn't go in as I was put of by the line but it did move very quickly and to be honest I would of been gutted to miss it knowing now the scale of what is inside.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"This place is huge! So many halls art (sculptures, paintings and architecture) to marvel at. Be sure to pay the entrance fee of 8 or 10 euros to go up to the cupola and see Rome from up high!

10€ gets you into the elevator line that gets you about 150 steps closer to the top. Unfortunately some 350 steps wait for your demise after that. Can't pay your way to the top here!

8€ on the other hand buys you express line straight to the first steps!

Be aware that this trip to the top takes physique and takes you to pretty confined spaces you can't turn around from. Not for the faint of heart (both figuratively and literally). The way to the cupola goes through the upper level of church interior first. This is the level the elevators stop. Don't worry about this! There's still plenty of stairs to climb from there in the outside!

This is my second favourite sight in Rome right after Coliseum!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We were in Rome for Christmas Day and of course had to go to the Pope’s Urbi et Orbi Blessing in St Peters Square. At noon exactly, the Pope comes out from the balcony and addresses the crowd. There were tens of thousands of people in St. Peters Square, and from all over the world. The event is free. There was security to get into St Peter’s Square but it moved at a good pace; we arrived 45 minutes early and more than enough time to find a space in the Square though we ended up pretty far back. The crowd was friendly and in very good spirits despite the very large crowd. Unless you get there early it will be hard to actually see the Pope; though there are many large projector screens throughout the Square with a close up view of the Pope. We are Jewish and totally enjoyed the experience. For us, it was not a bucket list item but if you are Christian, I would say definitely bucket list!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We decided on a small group guided tour, skip the line, and it was well worth it.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We got the full experience tour with a guide of the Vatican museums, Sistine chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica. Our guide was called Serena, she was fantastic 10/10. Very knowledgable, friendly, informative, funny and engaging. She was fantastic. The first part of the tour was through the museum, it is huge with so many rooms full of art, tapestries, paintings, statues etc. Without the guide and her wealth of information we wouldn’t have enjoyed this half as much. There is no talking allowed inside the Sistine chapel so all tour guide info is given before you go in, using a very helpful digital screen with pictures etc so the guide can talk you through what to look for. It was very interesting, incredibly busy even for February but please listen to your guide and/or respect the numerous signs on the way in - no talking or photos inside the Sistine chapel! Our guide then met us at the back of the chapel and took us to St. Peter’s. She was brilliant at pointing out Swiss Guards etc going past us and again had so much knowledge about the exterior and interior of St. Peter’s Basilica. Once inside she showed us around, informing us of numerous items/areas inside. She directed us to the holy water font if anyone wanted to bless themselves, which we liked as we could bless our wedding rings, as we where on honeymoon in Rome. After the tour had finished Serena had advised us we could enter the underground area to see the crypt of the Pope’s, aswell as the dome of St. Peter’s (additional fee of €8 with no escalator or €10 with the escalator). We decided to do both the crypts and the dome and found both worthwhile. Even if you pay €10 for the escalator, this will take you up to the internal dome, however still includes 200 steps up to the outside dome (amazing 360 views and definitely worth it in my opinion). However please note the steps are up through quite a small, restricted area so it may not be for you if you are claustrophobic or have mobility problems. Overall the Vatican was so interesting and we definitely thought the guide ticket was worth it. Our guide Serena, as above, was fantastic. Thank you Serena. Just a little additional information, our hotel was near trevi fountain. We found it easier to get a taxi over to ensure we arrived in time for our tour (12 euro), however we just walked back as found this the best way to navigate Rome. There are so many sights at every corner, it seems a shame to miss it in transport. We stopped off for lunch along the way but approx 30 mins walk.

The basilica itself is beautiful - floors, ceilings, altars and chapels. The height is impressive and the building is so large that it did not feel crowded. Further, there are areas where visitors can choose to pray or sit quietly, where photographs are not allowed.
Definitely to be recommended. The view out over the square on leaving is also iconic, even without the crowds!

Absolutely stunning!!

We didn’t buy a ticket. We just joined the queue outside the Bascilla in St Peters Square which looked massive when we arrived but went down really quick to be honest and was free!!!

The Bascilla itself was gorgeous and huge, stunning paintings, sculptures inside. We paid €8pp (cash) to walk to the top of the dome, the view is incredible and a must BUT the walk up there is very, very hard work. You can pay €10pp to get the Elevator though!!

Inside St Peters Bascilla you can also visit the Tomb of the Popes (free) which again I would recommend. Out of all my time here in Rome, the Bascilla was 100% my favourite bit. Definately do it!! :)

We are me and my wife, a 2 years old and a 5 years old. We took the elevator up to the first level (no use actually) and then I carried the years old all the way up. Easy!
The view from the top is fabulous and magical when the city wakes up.
The walk was easy for us but we are reasonable fit (after the fab Roman food).
We walked down without using the lift.
It ends up into the basilica.
The dome, elevator-walk-photo-walk was done in maybe 40min.
So entering the Basilica just after 8 in the morning and it was virtually empty and that was great.
The crypt only opened at 9 and we had a real spiritual feeling there, go there and remember to respect!
We lingered around the Basilica until after ten, wanted to join a service but the security guard stopped us, strange, we are both Christian and baptised kids, luckily the 5 years old run in so he allowed us to join and it was a beautiful service indeed, great experience in the end, please educate your security staffs though.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,"Once you are in Rome you will visit this Basilica as it is one of the most famous. It is free but there is a very long queue. It might happen that you need to wait several hours on the sun - it is because of a security check.
If you go there from Vatican Museum, you can skip the line. Other idea: if you go there early in the morning - 7 am, the line is much shorted, you can enter in 10 minutes. But you can visit only a part of the Basilica in the morning - treasure opens only at 8.30 am, tower opens also later. There are some side chapels where it is allowed for any pastors to make a celebration between 7 - 9 am.

So my idea: book a ticket in advance to the Vatican Museum and visit the Basilica together with other museums.

Didn't have time to do the Vatican museums and can't do the Sistine Chapel without the museums. This was a great option and free we were there over an hour taking photos and looking around slowly you could be in and out in less than an hour if only quick walk around!,Jan 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"This place can be visited for free I you do not wish to enter to the museums (which, of course, are worth it... but this place stands on its own anyway).

It is big, full of great painting, statues and decorations (some very famous ones, by the way). It’s very big too.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Save a day to visit the Vatican city, it's allot to take in and you will need a whole day to visit the church and the museum's, the capula of the st Pieter has the best view in the city, and is somewhat claustrophobic (my partner). But definitely worth the walk up stairs, don't take the elevator cause that takes away your sense of accomplishment.

I've visited rome 3 times now, and it still amazes me.",Jan 2020

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We went to see this I was quite excited, its 10 euro for lift and 8 for the stairs, unfortunately the lift doesnt go to the top it only goes a small bit. But the rest of the way you have to do yourself and its treacherous, so many stairs to climb by the time most got to the top the sweat was pouring off them, if you are off a bigger body set like me it'll be difficult enough on the knees but most of the hall ways are very small, but once you get to the top the views are unreal, its definitely a wow factor and makes all those stairs worth it.",Jan 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Amazing place to visit in life. Specially if you are spiritual person and if you admire beautiful constructions and history.
Go up to the Dome is something you must!! You can take the elevator but the stairs are really cool. The view paid off!
If you arrive before 9:00 lines are not so big to enter sometimes no lines at this time.",Jan 2020
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"After a short queue to get through security (~4pm) we quickly made our way inside.
What a fantastic place with absolutely outstanding architecture, paintings and murals.
The size is mind blowing and impossible to fully appreciate. Believe it can hold 60000 people for a service.
The riches are phenomenal and makes you wonder how there can be poverty here and elsewhere in the world. If all the riches of churches and cathedrals, places like the Vatican and museums was estimated and 1% of this valuation given to the poor then poverty would not exist worldwide.
I suppose such a world would be Utopia and could never exist.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Excellent visit, beautiful basilica with mesmerizing artworks. The entrance was free. I expected extremely long queue to go in but when I visited at about 3pm on a Tuesday the wait was only about 20-30 minutes.

Do not miss visiting the underground papal tombs by taking the spiral staircase in the middle of the basilica. But do finish your visit first as you can't go back up once you descend.",Sep 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"I cannot even count how many times I have been to the San Pietro’s Basilica but every time is like the first one.

During my most recent visit to Rome, I have witnessed a very memorable event at the Basilica: it was the evening when Pope Francis led a traditional Filipino mass at the Vatican, so I have seen the Pope on the big screen outside the Basilica.

As always, I took plenty of pictures of the gorgeous Bernini’s statues, the dome and the Swiss guards, and the festive Christmas tree.

Five days later, I have come to the Basilica di San Pietro around 4pm and, despite scary looking long lines, passed the rigorous security check in 15 minutes.

Surprisingly, Basilica was not crowded at all inside and I even had Michelangelo’s “Pieta” all to myself. My favorite statue in the whole world... I am always so moved by Mary’s chiseled beautiful face full of dignity and boundless sorrow. It such a powerful image of a grieving mother who lost her son... a monument to all mothers who had the worst happened to them.

The altar is really magnificent... those little golden leaves on the columns add so much beauty... And all the chapels, the statues, the Michelangelo’s dome, and Bernini’s statues... all of them are stunning beyond the imagination.

I had been to the Treasury before, so I did not go this time, but I highly recommend doing that for the price of only 5€ you will see amazing craftsmanship of the most elaborate religious objects.

Also, I think climbing up to the dome is a must: we had done it in May, in great weather, and the views of Rome and the Vatican were absolutely mesmerizing. And you can come up really close to the Bernini statues of the apostles.

Do allocate ample time to enjoy the most gorgeous cathedral in the world. Visiting early in the morning and in late afternoon helps to avoid crowds to a certain extent.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"What an outstanding place to be! I’m not sure I’ve been inside a religious building of such magnitude and charm in my life, and that’s saying something. Obviously the number of disrespectful tourists lessens the impact of the basilica, but if you find a nice quiet spot to either pray or reflect you won’t regret it. That art is absolutely amazing and it’s fantastic that such a unique and stunning location is free to enter. Expect a long wait if your not going either very early or late.

Waiting in line, however, might take some time. (It's free, but there's a security check) and it took us 2 hours to get inside; and by the time we got inside, the done closed.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Get your guide has excellent products in general and teams with good local companies.
Alessia took us up the Bascilica dome today. She was super knowledgeable, lovely commentary with interesting stories. I would highly recommend her.
Only downside was because the crowds were thin earlier we spent longer at the top (which was brilliant) but then our tour ran an hour overtime. Sadly we had to leave early as we had a fast track entry into the Vatican museum & Sistine Chapel (that we should have had a 40min gap between to get to the checkin for the second tour).
We've done most of the Rome highlights (& I've visited Rome before many years ago). The bascilica climb is by far one of my personal favourite highlights. Closely followed by the Get your guide Colusseum & Arena fast track guided tour.

The Basilica itself is so beautiful and so big, the music rebounded off the walls adding to the experience. At the end of the Mass I left feeling I had just truly experienced the meaning of Christmas.
Tickets for this Mass as with all ceremonies at the Vatican are free however to secure a ticket you need to apply for a ticket months before hand. I applied in August 2019.

The Vatican Guards, the chiming bell, the cupola and the sheer beauty, proportion and scale of the Basilica defy description. Give yourself a full day to explore the cavernous Basicila - it is massive and absolutely overflowing with art and stunning architecture and visual spectacles to quietly savour. And also try to climb the cupola if you can. It is an experience you will never forget. I also recommend you sit in the square in the late afternoon in front of the Basilica for 2 hours and watch the light change as the daylight fades and the night falls and the lights come on on the Basilica. Rome has so many unique and iconic sights, but St Peters Basilica tops them all.

This inched forward ever so slowly, no least because the security staff had only opened three scan station. Having waited two long hours, we finally made it to the front, only to realise that there was another much shorter queue by the side. Why??

Inside, the basilica is magnificent, although there is an enormous focus on the various popes. I had expected that more attention would be paid to Jesus, but at times it seemed more a monument to powerful men than to the One who came to serve. I was also disappointed that given all the wealth on display, they still thought it appropriate to charge admission to view the church's various treasures.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"The best way to get there is by Metro. Get off at the Ottaviano station, and follow the signs. The iconic Colonnade of Bernini will come into view shortly. Walk through the portal into St. Peter's Square. Marvel at the sheer size. We visited on 3 December 2019. There was a line at the security checkpoint, but we waited no longer than 15 minutes. When you walk through the doors, head to the right, where you'll see Michelangelo's famous Pieta sculptue. I saw it as a child, in 1964, at the NY's World Fair. I never dreamed that I'd see it again, but there it was. At this point, you're still about 100 metres from the main altar. You may have heard about the vastness of the Basilica---nothing can adequately prepare you for seeing it in real life.

If you are at all physically capable, pay to go up to the dome. The view at the top is awesome. There's an intermediate point where you can exit the stairs into a rotunda and view the Basilica from above. The staits are narrow, and winding. The lift only eliminated about 200 of the 500+ stairs. Pay the extra 2 Euros. Every little bit helps.

Monitors stand at the entrance AFTER the metal detectors & reject people who are not dressed appropriately for entering a house of God. You may stand in line for hours, only to be rejected at the door if you are dressed inappropriately. Why wait in line for hours, only to be turned away?

Once inside, it is a working church, so low whispers are encouraged. Selfie sticks will get swatted down... it’s just too crowded. Uncontrolled children, running loose or screaming will be asked to leave.

Worth paying something to jump the queue I imagine if you don't enough mornings and arrive too late in the day (the Basilica is FREE otherwise). We arrived at around 9am on a Friday morning and had no trouble with queues and were in in no time.
We had some confusion sorting out all the different options especially with so many people hawking their options without giving clear information. So with that in mind The Dome is a viewing platform, both on the inside of St Peter's Basilica Dome and on top on the outside. It was also an excellent experience, not for those worried about heights, steps or enclosed spaces though! It cost 8 Euros or 10 to use the lift (still over 300 steps in addition to the lift).
The Vatican Museum is where the Sistine Chapel is and this is a massive museum also. I think it was 16 Euros for an adult ticket.

Don't miss.",Dec 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,This is one of the most beautiful Basilica's in the world. There is a long security line to get in so be prepared. We did not get a skip the line ticket and ended up in line for only 40 minutes. We have heard that the line can be 2-3 hours. Once inside it is very beautiful. We used the free Rick Steves audio guide and were glad we did. A lot of good information and easy to follow. Do not miss seeing the Pieta or the crypts were past popes are buried. This is a must see sight when in Rome.,Oct 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"I heard stories from friends about the size and content of this historical building... boy was I surprised POSITIVELY! I always thought the descriptions or stories were exaggerated but they were true. The priceless artwork anywhere you look, the history of every showcased piece, the sheer size of everything... planning to go back with the kids next year!!",Dec 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"The Basilica itself is overwhelming, but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the beauty of The Pieta located in the church. It is impossible for me to imagine how Michelangelo could create such a masterpiece out of a piece of stone.",Dec 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"St. Peter's Basalica is the start of the Vatican city. It is a little down the road from the Vatican and the walk up to the Vatican is about 10-15 minutes.

The open grounds is huge and full of monuments. A fountain at either side of the yard (there is a seating section in the middle of the yard for tours). The grounds are very quiet and spacious and there was harly people around.

The place had us in awe and you could see it all from where you were stood there was no need to go look around although you could walk round and look. You are not allowed inside unless you do the tour but it is a short tour and was around €25 euros each and we had missed the tours by the time we had arrived.

It is on the other side of the river so far away from all the other tourist sites and in a regular town.

It is well respected and looked after.

An amazing breath taking place. Another definate must see if you are in Rome.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"I read many times that you should get up early and get ahead of the crowds. YES, that's 100% true. I got there about 8:30 am and was through the check point and in the Basilica in all of 10 minutes. I had a step counter on me: 12,000+ steps for the day.",Oct 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,The size of the building is unbelievable. You can hurt your neck trying to see the ceiling. Admittance is free but in order to climb the dome (551 steps) for the amazing view you pay 8€ or you can pay 10€ and take the elevator to the first level and avoid climbing the first 231 steps. The stairs towards the top are quite claustrophobic. The view from the first level is also very impressive and you also get to see down inside the dome.,Dec 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Visited The Vatican on our trip to Rome & you can't not visit St Peters Basilica when here. Que to get in is quite long but it moves swiftly.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,Its everything you expect it to be. Amazingly historic. Walking distance to other major sights. We had a private tour guide and it was well worth it.,Aug 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,Popular and free attraction. Lines can take up to an hour as everyone has to pass thru a metal detector and their bags checked. Visited in late afternoon on a weekday and the line was only 15 minutes. Did not have much time as I was on a cruise excursion and needed to catch the coach back to port. So visited only the basilica and managed to take a number of photos and videos. Ornately decorated with paintings and statues. Need several hours to really see all.,Dec 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,"Don’t do it if you’re claustrophobic!!! Poor research on our part meant that we didn’t even know you could climb the dome. So when someone said it’s a quick elevator ride to the top, we said great! So that was to the first level, which was fine and beautiful. We then saw a sign directing to the top and thought it was just maybe a few steps. Now, we’re young(ish) and relatively fit people. Well, by the time we got climbing and were out of breath, the realisation that the only way out is by continuing to climb hit us. This coincided with the extremely narrow steps and the climbing space getting smaller. It didn’t seem to end and the burning in my legs and lungs were nothing compared to the feeling of being trapped. I guess in that regard it’s good exercise because quitting is not an option - you literally can’t go back. Psychologically, it was so much harder for someone like me who doesn’t like feeling fenced in. Coming down was easier but still feels like a game of dominos - if one person trips, everyone is falling down. This was first thing in the morning in December with very few people so I’d dread to think what it’s like in high season and in the heat. For the extremely fit and anxiety free people, you’ll love it. For me, never again - although I’m proud I overcame the panic attack as it got going because for a while it literally took my breath away!

The rest of St. Peter’s was amazing! Just wish we’d have skipped the very top!! Our fault for not researching more though.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We went as part of a self guided City Break in Rome. We went early in the morning (strongly advised!) around 10.00 am and were in a relatively short queue to go through security (about 20 minutes total). At busy times, the queue is immense, it can take ages to get in, and you are surrounded. It is definitely worth making the effort to wake up and get there!
This is an absolute 'must see' in Rome. The building is of huge historical and religious significance and on a massive scale. Wall to wall culture, art and features. St Peter's Crypt is also in the centre and is surrounded by an amazing tower like structure.
One place to go is the Sacristy (I think that is what it is called), on the left, about half way down. This is a very sacred place, so treat it with respect - no hats, no talking, no photos, just peace, quiet and prayer.
It is impossible to list all of the things which are inside this building as there are so many pieces of sculpture, art and history. You must visit.
Although there is a 17 Euro ticket for the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel and Basilica combined, the Basilica is actually free on it's own.

The museum alone is worth visiting and the climb to the top of St. Peter's though not for the faint hearted is worth every step (there is also a lift). Inside St. Peters is truly spectular although maybe not for a truely spiritual vist, I was pushed outta the way more than once for being in the way of someones selfie which is uncomfortable in a place of worship. There are places that this is not allowed but the unmannerly behaviour of some people shocked me.

The first basilica, which is now called ""Old St. Peter's Basilica"" was begun by the Emperor Constantine between 326 and 333 AD.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Wonderful place. Loads of history and a lot to see.

Advice I can say is get here early morning before tourist hours around 7am and queues will be down to none nearly.

Wednesday is audience with Pope himself being out you have to check the Vatican calendar but also you need to apply for tickets well in advance by fax or post. Sunday’s can be very crowd with the seeing the Pope at residence window.

Mesmerising place of worship brings enlightenment to the heart and getting a glimpse of seeing the Pope is something I would recommend everybody who visit this place.

However, before you make it inside you have to go through security screening and depending on your arrival it can be a matter of minutes or hours. After that you are free to go and explore the basilica or use a toilet on your way there.

The majesty of the interior is indescribable and has to be experienced. The feeling of walking towards the altar and seeing the huge dome opening above you is truly amazing and it makes you feel small. It is really remarkable what beauty a human hand is capable of creating.

I was lucky to visit the cathedral on a festive mass, which even multiplied the impression of the building.

There’s also another souvenir shop outside of security, pass the other commercial gift shops, if you’re facing the the basilica right in front of the steps, on the left there’s a bathroom.

The best way to beat the crowds while visiting St. Peter’s Basilica is to arrive as early as possible. They have a strict dress code: men must wear long trousers (no shorts) and cover their shoulders, women must not have either bare shoulders or skirts shorter than knee length. Papal Audiences are held every Wednesday as long as the Pope is in Rome. There, visitors can see the Pope and receive the Papal Blessing. Another chance to see the Pope is on Sundays at noon when he is in Rome. Then, he comes to the window of his apartment overlooking St. Peter’s Square to give a short speech and a blessing to the crowds below. The event usually lasts around 20 minutes.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"I had a short trip to Rome, I didn't organize much. Reading about all these skip-the-line tours I lost hope of getting in to St Peter's Basilica. But I wanted to see the dome and the view from there. It was a sunny Sunday morning in November, I decided to see how far I would get. I was there at 10 am. The service was going on. The people must have come earlier, because there was no queue to the friendly guards, who examined my bag. I passed all the gates and went directly to the entrance of the dome. There was no queue to the dome, nor to the church hall. I decided to take the stairs, not elevator to the dome, and make it a kind of pilgrimage. This way I skipped the queue to the elevator. Many steps later we reached the interior of the dome and looked down at the service in the church hall. You can imagine, it was quite an experience! Then the stairs continued through two layers of the dome. We had to tilt to walk there. Thrilling and a bit claustrophobic. Amazing job of architects and builders! Once we were outside, the view of Rome was awarding, worth every step! Going back, we came directly to the church hall, where the service had just ended. After admiring it all, I went out and found myself in the inner circle of crowd, for whom the Pope started to speak from a window. I didn't deserve this, ignorant people are sometimes lucky. This morning in Vatican was the highlight of my trip.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Unless you arrive very early, there will be a queue. A long queue. Don't let this put you off. It is very well organised and moves surprisingly quickly. Security is swift and it took no more than twenty minutes in total to get in.

It is stunning! A huge and ornately decorated interior that is breathtaking. The scale of the building meant it never felt crowded. There was no rush to move on and plenty of time could be taken to appreciate the interior. We were in the church for the best part of an hour.

The fact that entry is free is also incredible.

If you're in Rome it is a must!

You can either climb the whole way or you can take a lift part of the way. The difference in price is only 2 euro so I took the lift. You can only pay in cash either way, so make sure you have some cash on you.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We visited on a Monday before our departure day. We had not been the to vatican city and did not have tickets for the Vatican Musuems. We thought this was the next best thing but it turned out to be a highlight of our trip. We saw the swiss guard which are beautiful uniform that were designed by Michelangelo. They are eye catching and look like circus costumes to an unknowing American. The View of the Basically from the courtyard is beautiful in itself, but once you walk inside there is nothing like it. Having visited many churches, this is the most impressive in Rome. We spent time trying to take in each vessel. The vibe in this place is spiritual and powerful and emotional for worshipers of Christ. Seeing Pieta (the most famous work of Michelangelo) will bring tears to your eyes.

Also, a bonus was the steps to the Dome. For 8 euros you can test your stamina and walk up over 500 steps to the Dome, twisting and turning through very narrow hallways. Some of the steps/doorways were incredibly narrow where anyone over an average size would not fit. They warn about the number of steps but not the narrow steep stairwells. Once you get to the top, it's worth every step. The views are phenomenal. Plus you can see the vatican housing where the current pope lives and the castle where the retired pope lives. (backstory to that is interesting too)

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Please read the other review if interested in the Basilica..it is awesome. But if you aren't aware of some other options, you might either regret missing them, or need to go back 3 times like we did! Definitely tour the Basilica! Inside, 2/3 of the way down on the left, is a new entrance to the Crypts where St Peter and many of the other Popes are entombed. It's an amazing moment to pause in front of St Peter's Tomb. At the end of that part of the tour, you can exit and go back into the Basilica or you can take an elevator to the Cupola Tour. It's 8 or 10 euros (pay the 10 and take the elevator half way!!) to walk up the 350 to 700 stairs to the middle and ultimately the top of the Basilica inner dome. The views are spectacular of rome, St Peters Square, inside the Basilica, and close ups to touch/see some of the mosaics. Halfway down, there is a small Coffee shop that you can get a well needed rest, drink, light food or a beer. Of course you still have the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums to do as well so if this is your first time, either plan on 2 days or look for some of the avoid the line tours that will rush you through. Last thing you want to do is wait inline for hours. Note also, that you can attend a Papal Audience in the Square on most Wednesday's then do all of the above after 12 to really make your day an incredible visit...but for the latter, I highly recommend a City Wonders tour to the Audience as they will get you a ticket, get you in and give you a 1-2 hour radio historical overview and tour tips for the rest of your afternoon!

We took the 500 steps option and took our time, beware it's not for the faint hearted. If you dont like small space dont do it.my husband is over six feet tall and he found the smaller spaces challenging. If you have thought is it worth the climb then the answer is simply YES it is the views are spectacular. It was busy at the top and you came walk either way round the dome.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,1.0,"I have been to Rome more time then I can count. I have continued to return to The Vatican and St Peters, but never again. This is the only place in Italy that I have been disappointed 100% of the time.

First- no crowd control! The experience is dreadful, unsafe, and certainly not driven by preservation of the art, sites, or visitor experience. It gives the feeling that the Almighty Euro is the major objective.

Vatican Museums- this is not a Museum. It’s a tons of Art stuffed into the rooms of a fancy attic. Add the back to back viewing, and this leaves no opportunity enjoy the Art.

Sistine Chapel - Here you get cattle herding on spades! You are stuffed in Back to back with people to view this tiny chapel. The Vatican adds a special touch of having Guards yell at you if you make a sound! Is that to ensure respect by visitors of this holy site? If so, I recommend the respect start with the Vatican!

St. Peter’s- this is a shame! St. Peter’s is a place everyone should see. But, it will be a cold day in hell that I pay the Vatican to go into a church! What are they thinking! Oh yes, the Almighty Euro! If you don’t want to pay to go into a church, be prepared to wait a very long time. When we went in October, it was a 3 hour line! Now, if you don’t mind paying to go to church, then you can prepay the Vatican 20 euro to still wait on a line that was 1 1/2 hours in our case. This is the saddest thing, and in the future, should I go to St. Peter’s, I will only do so if I go to mass. Hopeful they don’t have and entrance fee for it!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"It is one of the most recognizable and celebrated religious building in the world, St. Peter’s Basilica is held as one of the holiest shrines for its followers. Do I need to write it’s in Vatican City which is the world's smallest country with its own post office for 1000 citizens consisting of 90% males. The Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world, with an area of less than half a square kilometer, most of it enclosed by the Vatican walls. Inside are the Vatican palace and gardens,

It is at the far end of St. Peter’s Square, the Basilica has a beautifully designed front facade and is crowned with statues of the Apostles and Jesus. Inside the Basilica, the architecture and decoration are simply divine and it is regarded as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. Both Michelangelo and Bernini contributed to the design and you can see their handiwork in the immense dome and stunning Gloria sculpture. Shall I mention Michelangelo's masterpiece, Pieta, along with statuary and altars by Bernini and others. There is a story for Pieta and it can stretch my review so I will leave for now. But guys google Pieta history. It’s really fantastic. it’s the only art where Michelangelo's had signed.

Inside the Vatican, Palace is the Raphael Rooms, the Borgia Apartments, the Vatican Library, and several museums that include the Picture Gallery, Museum of Secular Art, Etruscan Museum, and others.

A fact: The Basilica of St. Peter is huge, with an interior height of 120 meters, the space shuttle, together with its booster rockets, could fit inside, as could the Statue of Liberty.

Folks, mind it, Dress code is there as most of the churches. Stringent dress code is enforced: No short skirts, hats or bare shoulders. And because St. Peter's Basilica is one of the area's major attractions, there is almost always a long queue – though it tends to go fast. We reached here 630 in the morning and we did not even spend 5 minutes in line. The basilica was looking really beautiful in golden sun lights.

Note: It's free unlike most of the buildings in rime or Italy and with a fee of 6 Euros you can enjoy trekking to the top of the dome. You can climb the 551 steps to the summit and for a fee of 8 euros, you can take an elevator to a terrace where you'll climb just 320. Regardless, you'll take in a panorama of Rome's spectacular landscape.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"My wife and I entered this monumental cathedral, after a 10 minute wait, to see what beauty, stories, architecture, emotions and presence were inside. Once inside, I was so taken back by the details, gold laced ceilings, the feeling of history of Catholicism and Christianity, the details and placement of ancient history. This was and always will be the most beautiful and intriguing cathedral I have ever entered. Second to none. As we walked through the Cathedral, we were so taken back by knowing the Pope does Mass here and that several Popes lay in rest. So large of a Cathedral. Lots to take in throughout the Cathedral and it can be somewhat crowded, but we took our time to really get a good feel and understanding of history. Some areas were blocked off but lots of areas to just imagine. This a must see! We didn't do any tours in here because we didn't want to be pressed for time to enjoy history, but many available. We arrived here around 3 pm, which I guess a little less busier but still crowded. Enjoy and take your time here. Look all over, so many nooks of history.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Over the years the crowds in St Peter's Piazza and the Basilica itself only seem to have become larger. The day we went on this trip the queue to enter the Basilica was apparently four hours long. It is free to enter, but let's face it if you can afford it you really should consider a tour. We chose one which entered at the Vatican Museums on the other side of the Vatican city and arrived at the Sistine Chapel just after it opened. Required a stroll in the dark to get there and there well still hundreds of people around (including in the Chapel) but still avoided the mammoth queues. As for the Basilica what can you say? Every time you go you'll end up focusing on something else. The size is often the first thing; it's faintly amusing to see the lines on the floor of the length of other churches in Christendom reflecting the pride here in the Basilica being the largest Christian church (although apparently it's now been overtaken by one in West Africa somewhere!). For us the two things that stood out again were Bernini's spiral-columned canopy on the altar - I think the technical term is a baldachin - and Michelangelo's Pieta. The dark and brooding columns emit mixed feelings in we classicists as at least some of the bronze to make them was stripped from the Pantheon. There's a well know quote about this: 'Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini' or ‘What the barbarians did not do, the Barberini did'. (The family name of the Pope in question - Latin is such a great language for puns.) As for the Pieta, it's Michelangelo's best, and it's hard to believe he was only in his early 20s when he made it. Love the fact that he managed to get away with putting his signature on the statue after there were claims that it was the work of another sculptor (you'll need a telephoto lens but look at the sash across Mary's chest where it says, in Latin of course, ""Michelangelo Buonarroti, Florentine, made this""). Even for the non-religious amongst us it really is a quite astonishingly beautiful piece and worth entering the Basilica just to see it. But everyone will find something different to love in this massive edifice. Obviously if you visit Rome this is should be near the top of your to-do list.

We ended up queuing for 2 hours but it was the only attraction we did queue for so didn’t mind. It was worth the wait as it was spectacular inside. It was our last attraction before our flight so we used the baggage storage which was efficient and safe. I’d recommend this and the Vatican museums if you have luggage as both had the best storage of all Rome attractions. I wish we had more time to stay inside as it was out of this world.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,"I've just given St Peter's Basilica a rating of 4 and I'm wondering how can that be? It is a truly wonderful and inspiring building. But, I am sad to say that the whole experience of my time in, and around the area of, St Peter's - was not the highlight of Rome for me. In a previous review from a Canadian visitor - the word peaceful was used ... perhaps that reviewer was at a different St Peter's ?! From the moment you begin to walk down the route towards the building you are assailed by commercialism. It is so uncomfortable. Having to stop and engage or say, very forcefully, NO. Pretending not to speak English etc etc. My experience was tainted by those who just want to make money. Welcome to life perhaps you are saying? Get resilient. Yeah, I get it. But this was supposed to be a beautiful and joyous event for me. A visit to a church (albeit a rather large one!) We decided to join the official queue. Entrance is free despite people wanting you to think otherwise. There are fees to go into specific areas like up into the dome or to get an audio guide or join a group. But those swarming every path up to the building want you to part with 10 euros each to 'skip the line'. According to a fellow tourist, that simple involves parting with your cash and being marched up to the front of the queue and left there (presumably to the annoyance of all those who have waited 1.5/2 hours). And so, we did queue. It was sunny and we were going into an iconic and major wonder of our world. So we felt it was going to be special. After nearly two hours we arrived at the security gates where our bags went through an x-ray machine like at an airport. So, imagine our dismay as a group of 8 - 10 people appeared at the side and tried to squeeze in. They were challenged but eventually they did get in. Once inside the building, it was massively crowded with a hum of noise and little chance to sit and ponder and be amazed by the marble, sheer scale and artwork. Walking around there were some areas which were roped off and manned by official staff. They did nothing to make you feel welcome - given how long we had waited. Seemingly, they were doing us a favour by allowing us into 'their' building. I do appreciate that its going to be challenging to manage the colossal swarms of visitors but I feel they could show more sensitivity. I saw one of the officials stopping some visitors from entering a specific quiet chapel. I think it was because the area was overcrowded and he was monitoring numbers but he did not make it clear. His manner was officious and he proceeded to point to the information board and talk loudly to a group who obviously did not understand him. After the lecture - he reluctantly allowed a couple of people through but an unfortunate non-European lady was confused, attempted to follow and got shouted at. Pregare, pregare he yelled. And presumably she prayed that she didn't meet him again, anytime soon. :) For a lot of the travellers who have come from other continents - this will have been a once in a lifetime trip. And so, to finish the review - yes, its a fantastic monument. If you have not seen St Peter's Basilica - of course, it is worth the effort. But mass tourism has ruined its wonder and glory ... for me. Good Luck.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,I originally bought skip the line tickets from ‘Rome Sightseeing’ but they turned out to be just for the Vatican museums. You must buy the tickets from the green pagoda within the Vatican square and present them to the Voxcity officials in blue vests. The tickets cost €20 but worth it or you’ll be in the queue for at least 2 hours. The basilica is the crowned gem of the Vatican though!,Oct 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,This was not like any other basilica I've been to. It was beyond grand with it’s tall ceilings lined with gold and beautiful walls. It really is a must see in Rome but get there early as queues like most places are ridiculous at 45 mins and especially in the burning sun due to no shade! You may even see the Swiss guards walking around which was really cool. The only annoying things was we clearly picked the wrong security gate to go through as the queue jumpers went through there slowing it down massively. This place is amazing and not one to miss,Oct 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"Excellent!Easy to get by train from the main station of Rome city named Rome Termini.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"I can’t recommend this highly enough!! From walking in, the basilica is breathtaking from start to finish! It’s free to enter so get there early as the queues can go all the way around Saint Peter’s Square by mid morning (unless it’s a Wednesday and the audience with the Pope, if this is the case the basilica doesn’t open until 12 noon) The walls, floor and ceilings are incredible and the crypt is amazing (although hard to find and not signposted) The crypt is accessed to the side of the impressive altar by a staircase that is not plainly visible. This place is a must see even for the non religious. You cannot light a candle in any of the main churches",Oct 2019
Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,We entered the Basilica as part of a tour. It is beautiful! There’s so much detail. If you go downstairs you can see the tombs where the old Popes are.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,"The Papal Basilica of St. Peter in the Vatican is a marvelous church for its impressive architecture, the spectacular art contained therein, and the fact that it is regarded as one of the holiest Roman Catholic shrines. A visit to Rome would not be complete without visiting St. Peter's Basilica.

During our recent stay in Rome, we visited St. Peter's Basilica and Square on two occasions - once on Friday for an informative tour lasting more than three hours and on Sunday around noon for the Pope's blessing.

Persons planning to tour the Vatican would do well to engage a travel guide who knows how to avoid the lines and gain access to areas the average tourist cannot see.

Got inside and looked round the fascinating sculptures, roof, floor, everything was so ornate. There were money boxes at certain statues and also places you had to pay for penance etc. Fascinating building and architecture but it makes you think how much money is so tied up with the religion. Makes you think no wonder they needed a reformation! Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Sola Christus, Sola Scriptura, Soli Deo Gloria. (Look it up, it could change your life).",Oct 2019

1. best is to book a private tour early morning before the museum opens to the public. Costly but worth it!!!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"We visited at the end of August. We joined the queue at around 08:30 and the queue was already about 45 mins long - but it was absolutely worth it.

There is a Treasury Museum that you pay to enter (around 5Euro for Adults) and it is defintley worth visiting - lots of spectacular artifacts and information, and you get an excellent audio guide included.

The Basilica is massive with lots of side chapels and artwork to see. You can also go down into the vaults below the Basilica which was fascinating - but it takes you to the outside, so leave that until the end of your visit.

Also, just as we were leaving we went past a side entrance to the Vatican and the Swiss Guard were Changing the Guard which was fascinating and very colourful to watch.

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,5.0,"I've been to the Vatican 3 times now. As of October 2019, they have changes things a bit. We use to be able to buy skip the line tickets off the street of at one of the shops near by but it seems they now require you to purchase in advance online. We were able to get lucky and get same day ""skip the line"" tickets on getyourguide but as I said, we got lucky. We were able to purchase the ""Reserved Entrance: Saint Peter Basilica Self-Guided Tour"" The tours are not called ""skip the line"" all the time. But this ticket allowed us to get a self guided tour for about $20 each through the official company selling tickets for the church. You meet the company on the right hand side of the square ( they are easy to find) and then they give you a sticker and you get into a separate line...you still need to wait in line but it is much much faster than the main line with thousands of people in it. With this tickets you also get an audio guide. Go to the area that says ""Audio guides"" to retrieve your device. The lines move very fast. Be prepared to go through medal detectors going in.

The waiting line to buy tickets was incredibly long, so I’m glad that we bought tickets online (getyourguide) with morning entry (10-13), so we walked right up to the security station and cut the line infront of many hundreds. The tickets cost a bit more, but its certainly worth it! Otherwise, go in the afternoon where the line is much shorter. Inside, the church was full!

Italy,St. Peter's Basilica,4.0,"Of course, seeing St. Peter's Basilica is a must-see if you are a Catholic visiting Rome. The wait in line is just for security and moves pretty fast, so don't be intimidated by that line.

Once you are in line, don't expect any spiritual experience as it is a bunch of tour groups trying to take photos of anything Michelangelo. And if you are Catholic, you may be a tad bit turned off by all of the rich collections of art by the church while at home your Catholic church begs for money for the electric bill, and they close your Catholic schools.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"Ordered and bought the tickets on line to save on queueing. We chose the stairs option (cheaper than the lift btw) and were quickly to the top. There's one way up and one way down so you won't be passing anyone going the other way in the narrow stairs.
Getting to the rooftop is amazing, the view over Milan and surroundings is fantastic and definitely worth a visit.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"It is the big cathedral in the center of Milan. It is one main sights of Milan. For touristical visit, you have to buy a ticket. Inside the ticket zone, there is the grave of Charles Borromeo. He was bishop in Milan in the 16th century. There are some combined tickets with museums. You also can go to the roof with a ticket, which includes that part.

There is also a prayer zone. There is also accessable the other side of the Presbiterio (Capella Feriale). I had the chance to follow a Holy Mass there (which was held in the Ambrosian Rite). They have several Masses every day. They also have Confessions in the prayer section.

In the prayer section, you also have access to the Altare del Crocifisso di san Carlo, whre is written ""We admire the Christ and Blessed, you have saved the world with your holy cross"". This is the part of the whole Cathedral, which impressed me most, especially for its religious meaning.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,4.0,"The Duomo is a massive Cathedral with a different feature than the other great Cathedrals in Italy. The Duomo of Milan has more statues than any other Duomo.
The inside of the Duomo is modest except for the beautiful floor. I attached a photo of the side isle of the floor and another floor of the special marble at the altar.

Th Duomo of Milan is dedicated to Saint Maria Nascente. When you see the spires of the roof, you can see her Statue because it is the highest spire on the roof and the only one with gold coating.

If you have wanted to climb to the roof, this is the place to do it. You gat an excellent of Milan and the countryside and an up close view of the spires. Besides the Spite for Saint Maria Nescente the others statues are of the famous people of the era.

The Duomo of Milan is beautiful and has a great deal of style.

There are 38,000 statues, a tour of roof top views, a sun-dial, a nail from the Cross stored in a cross in the ceiling taken down fir 3 days of viewing a year, and archeological ruins of the baptism font & church that pre-dated this massive marble beauty. It takes $30M to maintain with replacement or rehabilitation of the marble each year. There is simply no way to take it all in, but a local guide will show highlights and point out unique sculpture. The St. Bartholomew statue inside depicting the martyr skinned alive, the 1930’s additions including boxing sculptures, frogs, sun & moon and so much more are part of this unique tour.",May 2021
Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"Just reopened within the last few weeks!
Great time to go before the crowds return, if the travel restrictions aren't too onerous.

Hostess Cathia, booked through the Duomo di Milano official site, provided an excellent tour of the Duomo, the Duomo Archeological Site, and the rooftop. Her native language is Italiano but her English was excellent and nothing was missed because of language difficulties. She used an iPad to add highlights through pictures and depictions that are more easily understood visually but the technology only highlighted and expanded on the tour rather than becoming the focus and a distraction. Her pace was just right to hear and comprehend what she was saying. She always allowed a little quiet after speaking for contemplation and then took the time at each stop to ask questions and expand on items brought up through any questions. The timing never felt rushed and we actually exceeded our allotted tour time by a bit since business is just getting going again and the next guests weren't waiting. She wasn't in a rush to end the tour and instead stayed for every question and discussion as we stretched beyond the posted time of the tour.

I highly recommend Cathia as a host and a guided tour the Duomo whenever you can make it to Milano.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,1.0,"In the middle of summer, my girlfriend carried a jumper the whole day, because we were well aware of their stubborn clothing policies. She was denied entry, even though she was wearing said long sleeved jumper at the ticketing office. However, they had no issue with my short sleeved tshirt or my shorts, which did not reach my knee and thus were significantly shorter than her dress.

Furthermore, the person who denied entry used truly disgusting language, which I don't even dare to repeat publicly. He only spoke french as foreign language and propably assumed I would not understand his insults. Unfortunately, my french is not that bad.

But of course, they would happily have made additional money with another layer of clothing for my girlfriend, to assure that triple coverage I guess.

We did not visit the church, even though we patiently made our way through the waiting line.

Very few viable free-running lines were available to me, and the guards all had guns! Also, the crowds looked and talked differently from the game, which was a big disappointment.

The floors, gigantic internal 52 columns and even the ceiling are all marble. The stained glass in this cathedral is unparalled, the size of the windows and the amount of glass is exceptional. Infact the sheer size of the entire structure is somewhat overwhelming. I have been to many cathedrals around the world, however, I was not prepared for the splendor of this. While I was inside the sky cleared and the sun was like a switch on the stained glass and a kaleidoscope of colours danced on the columns - magic.

In order to visit the Duomo I would recommend the combination ticket for 17 Euros which grants you access to the inside as well as the rooftops. You can opt to take the stairs or the lift to the roof for an extra 4 Euros. I actually found the rooftop to be more interesting than the inside. The views were nice from the top and it felt like a more unique experience. You can also book the tickets in advance, especially during busy tourist seasons to avoid the otherwise very long lines.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"Really beautiful cathedral in an Italian Gothic style. During the day, the square in front of the cathedral is really crowded and if you want to enter - prepare for waiting (it's better to come in the morning as it is less people around). Also, just a note if you want to enter the cathedral on Sunday - when I was visiting they closed it for maybe 2 hours starting from 10:30 in the morning. I am not sure does this happen every day, every Sunday or just on some special occasions, but I suggest you to check. Also, regarding the terrace, it's nice, but honestly, if you decide not to go I think you will not miss out much. There are parts that are under reconstruction, and I couldn't really find some super nice view of the main square in front - where I could stay for a few minutes and enjoy. So yes, it's nice, worth visiting, but I also think the ticket is a bit overpriced.

Tickets - there was no need to pay for fast track. The queue for tickets was less than 5 minutes and it was at the fast track stand as the queues were short in August (perhaps due to COVID). We paid €3 to get in and €10 to go up to the roof top.

We had to go up to the roof first and as you could imagine for the size of the Cathedral, it took a few minutes to get up! The views were fantastic and the architecture was good too. Worth the money to go up.

Then we went down and into the cathedral itself which was very pretty inside. We didn't spent much time here as we are not religious but I can imagine it being nice for someone who is.

Quick note for anyone visiting in short shorts - you may have to pay €2.50 for a thin kimono for modesty. Although we didnt have to get one as we came in as we had knee length shorts but as we came down from the rooftops into the cathedral we were given one. I think because I had my shoulders out.

Overall, a great tourist spot and definitely number 1 of things to see in Milano!

When i was here i paid €13 to visit the rooftop and the inside of the cathedral, €10 for the rooftop and €3 for the cathedral. Online it states that the cathedral entry fee is free, it is not, but the £3 is worth it. The rooftop is very interesting it provides some great views over milan and all the different spires on the top are very interesting to see up close. The inside of the cathedral is dectractive, lots of big columns are very dectractive windows. The inside of the cathedral is just has impressive as the outside.

Ambling around the rooftop is quite something. It becomes possible to take in the glorious work of the spires, and also to observe the surrounds in Milan. We were fortunate to visit during the Covid pandemic which meant crowds were under control.

Even though portions of the building are under repair (and thus hidden under scaffolding), it's still possible to take in the wonder of this amazing building.

Part of the cathedral was under renovation but I was able to see the alter and the side chapels. the art and sculptures are breathtaking. If I had more time, I would have gone to the roof. It was not crowded and I was able to stop at each side alter to look and admire the art and religious icons. if you are pressed for time, 30 minutes is good, and then spend the rest of the time admiring the architecture. It is stunning.",Nov 2019

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"I snagged this from wikipedia but it fits, I agree with Mr. Twain.
The American writer and journalist Mark Twain visited Milan in the summer of 1867. He dedicated chapter 18 of Innocents Abroad to Milan Cathedral, including many physical and historical details, and a visit to the roof. He describes the Duomo as follows:

""What a wonder it is! So grand, so solemn, so vast! And yet so delicate, so airy, so graceful! A very world of solid weight, and yet it seems ...a delusion of frostwork that might vanish with a breath!... The central one of its five great doors is bordered with a bas-relief of birds and fruits and beasts and insects, which have been so ingeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like living creatures-- and the figures are so numerous and the design so complex, that one might study it a week without exhausting its interest...everywhere that a niche or a perch can be found about the enormous building, from summit to base, there is a marble statue, and every statue is a study in itself...Away above, on the lofty roof, rank on rank of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air, and through their rich tracery one sees the sky beyond. ... (Up on) the roof...springing from its broad marble flagstones, were the long files of spires, looking very tall close at hand, but diminishing in the distance...We could see, now, that the statue on the top of each was the size of a large man, though they all looked like dolls from the street... They say that the Cathedral of Milan is second only to St. Peter's at Rome. I cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by human hands.""

I guess some people love it or hate it, but it was the first place (35 years ago) I had an experience of the numinous/ sacred, and my recent visit (the first in 30 years) had a similar impact. It's gotten a bit (ok a lot) touristy since then but still an incredible mysterious living being with much to share if you are receptive. The views from the roof are unmatched IF on a clear sunny day, otherwise the views are so so, but the details on the roof are fascinating regardless. Take the stairs if you're able. My only objection is that there is an enormous television on the outside of one of the back walls visible from Corso Vittorio Emmanuele- I appreciate the cutting edge art and speech inside the duomo, but blatant video advertising seems, well, sacrilegious. It should be taken down.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"Like many Duomo's in Italy, you can pay extra to climb the Duomo. In Milan, you climb the stairs to exit on the roof top. The roof top is sloped but manageable and the views are great. You are up close with the building itself and see the intricate stonework and ongoing repairs that are quite wonderful. If you are there in winter, choose an afternoon timeslot to make sure the sun is up and ice has melted. If the roof has ice on it, they close the climb for safety reasons.
Inside the Duomo, explore around. Definitely queue up and pay the extra Euro to walk behind the altar. There is a jewelled surprise there for you.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"You might have seen the cathedrals in Florence or Sienna and think that one more Duomo is not worth the trouble. Think again. Each one of these three cathedrals is quite different and all are totally breathtaking. The Duomo in Milan is huge and had amazing sculptures around the roof that you can get to see close up by climbing the stairs or taking an elevator. That plus the view of the city are amazing. At the opposite pole, there is an archeological dig accessible by a small door and staircase at the back of the Duomo near the exit door that is not to be mssed. There you will see parts of the early churches that preceded this present building which itself was started over a thousand years ago. Buy yout ticks at a nearby ticket office on the left as you face the Duomo and on the way there are toilets. There are inside the Duomo. On your way to the Duomo walk through the giant covered shopping mall and enjoy the beautiful stores and their amazing clothes. At the opposite end of the shopping mall to the Duomo is the Teatro Alla Scala, Italy's leading opera house. Tickets are 20% off within one hour of the start of the performance. Have fun.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"This is not the first Dom that we have seen in Europe. All of them are amazing. Each has the own history and attractions.
Duomo di Milano is special in a way that you have an access to the roof top and can see everything from the very close distance, from above and even mountains on a clear day.
We booked an elevator and audio tour over the internet. Would not do this again, as we get just elevator (even that did not get you too high, you still have to climb the stairs) and had to pay again for he audio tour. Would advice to start from the Duomo and get your audio device, as 1/3 of the tour related to the roof top, We were not aware of this, start from the roof without audio and after listen audio inside of the Dom. Due to that we missed some interesting points on a roof, but it was great anyway.
So, yes, we had some hick ups, but they did not ruin overall impression.
I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

You literally can't stand and take a photo for 2 minutes, without someone coming up to you, trying to talk to you, or sell you something. It actually became uncomfortable at some point, and we left. If you ignore them, they throw bird seed around your feet, which causes the pigeons to surround you - not cool.

Beautiful and empowering as ever. There were many many people but it didnt matter. I would recommend one purchase a ticket inside the cathedral and do the tour. Go to the roof and Enjoy the sites overlooking Milan. Breathtaking. I was back the next day to get more shopping in as I didnt get too much in doing the cathedral etc. Good walking shoes required, a camera, little backpack with water and a snack for the long walks.

Yest here are a lot - that has to do with the height of the building so if you don't like them use the lift. There was a bit of a queue for this but it didn't look too bad.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,4.0,"We were not let down by the wonderful cathedral, vault areas and the majestic rooftops.

You really wouldn't want to miss this.

Sadly the queuing system needs overhauled - queue to get into the ticket office to be given a ticket to wait on our number being called (after 40 minutes it wasnt - use the machine)

The queues are not managed so there's about a 20 minute bottleneck to get off the roof (non peak February visit). There ARE security staff with radios so would be better if they managed this.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"This is the landmark of Milan and the seat of its Archbishop. It is also one of the biggest and tallest cathedral in the world.
The stunningly impressive architecture, ornate facade and rooftop, and richly decorated interior will make you feel admiration and respect. The stained glass (most of them dating back to the 15th century), depicting stories from the Bible, are adorable as well. So are the huge marble columns with the miniature statues close to the top. A number of masterpieces, statues and paintings, are there too.
You can visit the archaeological area beneath the cathedral and see the crypt of St Charles and foundations of the original churches on top of which the present cathedral was built - building it took almost 6 centuries.
For some extra euros you can go to the rooftop either by the stairs or by the lift where you can admire the beautiful views of Milan.
Tickets are sold in the Duomo shop (to the right of the entrance to the Duomo). If you are not willing to pay more for ""skip the line"" tickets, you'd better go earlier and buy your tickets first because the line, to get into the Cathedral, can become really long and may take an hour or more to enter.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"You cannot fail to be impressed by O Duomo. The height of the ceiling gives makes you feel small and the artwork of the statues, tall pillars and windows as you walk around is amazing. I suspect the intentions of the architects was to make the general population awestruck by the power of god. It made me, a committed atheist, awestruck by its design and contents.
After you have visited the interior, you should go to the rooftop for its views over the city and to see some of the stone carvings close up.",Nov 2019
Italy,Duomo di Milano,4.0,"This experience gives you great views over Milan - and if you're lucky with the weather you can get some amazing photos.

Me and my boyfriend went during the week (Thursday) and it was very busy once you get up there, but all in all pretty straight forward as we'd booked tickets beforehand.

I would point out the entrance for the rooftop is to the left of the cathedral's main entrance - signage isn't very clear so we asked inside.

It was a shame there was so many building works on the roof - this limited the space for people to walk. But it's definitely worth a visit if you're in Milan.

Visiting the Cathedral inside is a must do visit - it is beautiful and wonderous. There is ongoing maintenance work so somewhat restricted pedestrian movement inside.
It is essential for a better understanding of the Cathedral to do the museum tour.
The rooftop is also a must do visit - you can get an elevator to the roof. The views are spectacular! But having the opportunity to see centuries old work close up and also see the great cleaning and maintenance operations so closely is wonderful.

We're not very happy with our tour guide but we had lots of reading about all these attractions so we knew history/etc. We were very disappointed when we were told that the Duomo visit was cancelled due to a private event. We received tickets that could be used next day. However, we're boarding a cruise in Genova next day & couldn't use tickets/visit Duomo. We returned later (after 6 pm) to Duomo after the private event was over. Two young security guards let us inside. We explained them our situation (inability to visit next day) & they're kind enough to allow us enter the cathedral. We bought tickets to the rooftop & enjoyed amazing sunset view. Highly recommend skip-the-line tickets if you have limited time in Milan. Don't miss Duomo. It's beautiful.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"Spoiler alert! Stairs involved.
This is one of the two must see places in Milan (the other being the Last Supper). The building itself is just amazing. And, surprisingly, quite new. Albeit construction started in the 14th century, but finished in the 20th. Anyway, I digress.
The tour is - honestly - just a tour. The usual patter about this and that, but everyone manages to find some personal nuggets, so that is always useful.
The thing I loved about the tour was that you get to go all over the building, and I mean all over. Underneath, and best of all on top.
We were lucky to get a reasonably clear and cool day (yes, January, it can be very cold, sometimes closed due to ice on the roof). The view is amazing. We could just make out the Alps in the distance.
If you don't do anything else, or time limited, this is the place as it is central and very easy to get to.

You have to go to a security check up, to enter a church they scanned you, they security people will interview you several times what do you come to do in a church on a Sunday?
After, the space to pray is really limited, a very narrow space, again the security people on their phones inside the church talking loudly

Italy,Duomo di Milano,4.0,"A centerpiece in central Milan and with the crowds to prove it. If you have not pre-purchased your ticket, be prepared for a wait. There are a central ticket office and gift shop on the far right side of the Duomo (if you are standing out front and looking at the front doors). There is also a priority ticket office on the same side of the Duomo but closer to the front doors. Be sure to get tickets before getting in line, and even with Priority tickets, expect a wait.

Interior is very impressive, but if you have visited many churches, it may feel like a repeat of the very best.

Tip - Go inside the department store across the way, head to the 5th floor, and enjoy an up-close view of the steeples and roofline. I enjoyed this as much if not more than entering the Duomo.

Our family really enjoyed the very reasonably priced private tour and truly skip-the-line access that we got through the Priceless Cities Program. The Duomo di Milano is a very beautiful and impressive Cathedral. We enjoyed touring the cathedral and found the archeological ruins very interesting, but the highlight of any visit is the rooftop, where you can walk amongst all the gothic spires and flying buttresses and get amazing view across the city.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,4.0,"The cathedral is beautiful, inside and out. There is so much to see and do here and I would recommend the ticket that allows you access to the roof, archaeological site and the museum. The only criticism I have is the ""new"" tickets process. When I was here three years ago it was a lot simpler. Now you need to get a ticket to queue and then there's different options inside for buying. In theory it should work but there's too many tourists and not enough staff around to help out. I'd recommend buying your tickets in advance. Hopefully an easier and quicker process is introduced soon.",Dec 2019
Italy,Duomo di Milano,3.0,"We visited the cathedral during our stay in Milan. The area surrounding was very busy and even though October wasn’t a peak time the queues were very long. There was an option to queue jump but we were assured by staff that the wait wouldn’t be too long. Staff were relatively friendly and helpful. I believe for two adults and two children it was around €60 as part of a family ticket. It was different to the price online. The ticket office was very well organised. You got a ticket and waited for a booth. I imagine this is a necessity at peak times.
We joined a queue to go up to the roof and waited around twenty minutes plus. This would not gave been too long for the adults but the children were pretty fed up. We’d then wished we’d paid the extra €10-€15 extra to queue jump. From the queue our bags were checked and we walked up a few steps to a lift to take us to the roof.

The roof was beautiful and views stunning. There was a lot of preservation work going on so there was a lot of scaffolding. We were guided around by staff as it was a one way system. There were lots of steps to navigate and the lift only brought people up. I couldn’t see a way those with reduced mobility or babies could fully access the roof tour as stairs separated the two lifts one for up and one for down.

We took the stairs down which we were told were about 100 plus. We were then in the nave of the cathedral. This was very quiet and calm. There were various areas to buy candles to reflect and have those calm moments. These were priced at €2.
My older son wandered off and I got a little worried so I discreetly tried to call him. A member of staff rudely asked me to finish my call (he acted like I was just chatting to a friend). I explained and he said to meet them outside. Not very helpful. It was a huge place and very busy. I thankfully spotted him. I can’t imagine what they would have done in the event a small child was lost. They were not helpful at all.

We left to go home and unfortunately were pickpocketed at the metro station. The two well dressed people tried to push between myself and the children in a packed platform. As anyone can imagine my mind was on ensuring my children were safe and they took our purse from a zipped handbag! Please be very careful!

Overall a must see but be aware of queues and pickpockets!

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"The outside architecture of the Duomo is breathtaking. The sheer size and architectural details are amazing. Pictures do not do it justice. Be sure to look at the door with the intricate details. The inside of the Duomo is no less amazing with high vaulted ceilings, huge marble columns and amazing huge stained glass windows. One particular stained glass window showed the life of Jesus with all important events depicted in approx. 30 separate stained glass pictures within the one window. The floor and the altar are also amazing. This is a “must see” if you are visiting Milan.

Crypt: There will likely be a line to the crypt, but it moves rather quickly. You go down the stairs and take your turn to look through the gate and take a picture and then follow the line to the opposite side and take a picture and then you are done. If you don’t have time for the line or have difficulty with stairs, you can look through the windows and essentially see one of the two things that you will see in the crypt. The crypt contains a relic from Saint Carlo Borromeo.

Archeological area: The archeological area shows some broken brick walls and some broken mosaic pieces. Unless you are studying the history of the Duomo, in my opinion, this section can be skipped.

It is highly recommended to visit the rooftop. I’m amazed by the craftsmanship and material used to build this cathedral, Even the roof tiles and hand rails are made of marble. All marble blocks are crafted, it is an open art gallery throughout.

Unfortunately, the central spire is undertaking restoration so part of the rooftop is seal off for visiting.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"If you are like me, I would strongly suggest hiring a guide for a half day or whole day. Usually I go in to historic buildings look around and say wow and then leave without knowing anything.
Most people won't notice the entrance to the baptismal chapel and learn about the 600 year history of the building of the cathedral. A great guide like Alice Salvagnin (Milan Private Tours) will bring the tour alive with explanation of the families that built the Duomo, the colouful stories of the bishops, the sad stories of the statues, the tiny beam of light from the ceiling, the removal of all the stained glass during WWII, and much more.
Alice got us through the ticket line in umder 2 minutes, and into the cathedral past the waiting line with no delay at all. Then shared with us the incredible history of this impressive building.
Be sure to visit the baptismal chapel ruins under the Duomo.....fascinating.
Our tickets allowed us to come back at 5pm to go to the rooftop to see the surrounding city as night fell. We were not able to go around the whole rooftop perimeter as they had closed off the back half the building. Maybe go at 4pm and do the back half first before they close it off for the evening.

Further we went to Disney store, me, my wife, my daughter and the grandson...the store is very short way to walk from the Cathedral...And this moment was exactly right to remember You are in the city with many tourists and also criminals aiming to take your wallet content...This exactly has happened at the Disney store after I payed for goods...but the most outrageous what the store staff was doing afterwards...they refused to call the police, even more, the manager guided me to police station three Subway stations away, while the nearest Police station was 10 minutes to walk. This proofs store staff is covering criminals even not worse. So, my suggestion is keep watching all the way, observe the people around You. This event destroyed all the good impression, only out apartment owner Marco deserves highest respect for that, what he did for us. So,enjoy Your trip,but keep aware. Giuseppe.

This is completely true and possibly my favourite cathedral I have visited. The detail is amazing. We visited without a tour guide, there are security checks which luckily at 9:30am in the morning we only waited a couple of minutes, but I can imagine during the day the lines can be quite long. The stained glass windows are so beautiful and so is the rest of the cathedral. There were places you could sit and pray if you wished, and places to light candles. It was an amazing experience - and also a visit to the terraces is a must. It is a really beautiful view.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,4.0,"Being an important monument as it is considered it is quite understandable the endless queues there are to get the tickets and then to have access to the temple.

We made 4 queues. First, and at about 11 we joined one with some 80 people eager to get tickets although more than half of us were in the wrong place for the tickets we wanted. Second, and after going to another building, we queued for more than half an hour to purchase the tickets to enter the cathedral and visit the tower via the stairs. In that moment we were told that the cathedral was impossible to be visited as there was a religious mass in progress and we could try the tower in the meantime instead. So, we queued to enter the tower for another half an hour. Later, we came back to the cathedral only to spend over 45 minutes queuing.

All in all, I can honestly say that we spent more time queuing in the street than visiting the temple. Bad luck.

The Duomo cathedral is by all means splendorous and magnificent and a must-see for all visitors to Milano.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"We only had a couple of hours when we went at the end of October and really wanted to go on to the roof so we bought the combined rooftops by lift ticket which gets you into the cathedral as well. ( 17euros ) Buying a ticket is a confusing process as you go to the queue and are met by a helpful guide who points out an office where you go to buy your tickets.As you pass through the foyer remember to visit the machine which will print you a numbered ticket. Then you pass through into a largr room which seems to double as the gift shop. Then you have a confusing wait to buy your ticket when your number comes up. We decided to forgo all of that and try the automatic self ticket machines queue which are on the right. They worked really well and we got our tickets. You then have to go back outside and walk right around to the other side of the Duomo to join the queue for the lift. Fortunately this was not long. You eventually arrive on the roof and are really glad that you bothered as the views are amazing and it is wonderful to get up close to all that stunning architecture. You can wander around at leisure all over the top ( except for one small area that is being renovated ) before catching the lift back to reality. Go a space this is and again you can stay as long as you want. Be sure to visit the statue of St Bartholomew.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,1.0,"Following experience is after purchasing tickets from tiqets.com. I bought ""The Duomo di Milano, Rooftop & Museum + Audio Guide "" for 18 euros / person....

Audio guide service is pathetic. Lady sitting in the audio booth office was very rude. I went there at 4.20 and asked her audio device. She said, she's gonna leave at 5 today (08-Nov-2019) so she can't give us the device unless we surrender our ID to her possession. In our case, she was clearly asking us to surrender our passport and get it back from ticketing office after we give the device back. She started doing this for everyone. A old couple came and asked for device and she said straight to their face the she can't trust that they will give device back by 5 (so rude). I told that crazy lady, I paid for audio guide, still I'll skip as i cant trust you with my passport.

Now to duomo di milano, it's a great piece of art. Good that maintenance is ongoing to preserve its beauty. Without audio guide, I couldn't connect with the history unfortunately. I paid 36 euros and it's not worth it as I couldn't enjoy the benefit. Also this ticket includes escalator for rooftop, but they didn't allow initially. Later, a different security officer said some issue with tiqets online pass and let us in......

point to note : security officers and info guys were very kind and very patient to answer back to you.

In short, we visited a grand , rich historic valued place without understanding what it is :( I hope management take care of this In future.

Italy,Duomo di Milano,5.0,"We visited the Duomo Di Milano last October and in one word - AWESOME! With our on-line tickets, we proceeded to the rear and had no problem at all boarding the lift going up to the roof. I half expected a steep roof where one could easily slip. Not at all, there were fiat walkways on the roof and railings as well. It’s an engineering design marvel though since the marble roof is quite heavy. The view from the rooftop was magnificent and the spires and statues even more imposing up close, especially the Golden Madonna which is a mere speck if viewed from the piazza level below. Unfortunately there were some ongoing renovations and the scaffoldings blocked some of the views. We then toured the Duomo interior to view the magnificent altars, windows, statues, archeological area and the tomb of St. Charles Borromeo. Of particular interest was the red light on the dome ceiling that marks the location of the Holy Nail. On the way to the Duomo Museum across the street, we saw the long queue of ticket buyers. My advice - buy your tickets on line and pay extra for the lift to the roof. You will enjoy your visit much more!

For example, the Maria statue on top of the building is carrying a weapon. A unique portrayal, indeed. In the interior, there are zodiac tiles at the floor near the entrance areas. It is also believed to house an holy nail from Jesus crucifixion. During my time of visit, the interior was being cleaned, hence there were a no of scaffolding inside the building.

Now there is a menu outside the cafe showing prices sitting at a table and as a take out every item each is one Euro or as much as 3 higher per item.
Hence a small pizza margarita was 6€ each. It was microwaved!! Probably the worst in all of Italy. It may have had one small tomatoes amount of sauce, the closest it came to pizza.

The museum has several very Biblical paintings that were not to be considered the stretch of the imagination including the painters. Abraham and Isaac being sacrificed. Too much wood, remember the little boy carried the wood and a body of water in the background. Other than that, pretty exact on ages etc. Out of the hundreds and I mean hundreds, paintings of Mary; only one showed her a very young maiden of 14 or so with Joseph in his 40 to 50's.
Another funny one was to show John the Baptist as an old man baptizing Jesus. They were cousins, 3 to four months difference in age.
Another very accurate and little ever spoken of by ministers was an older man taking Mary to Egypt to avoid Herod's wrath. Then the very finest of all paintings. With absolute Biblical accuracy and an unbelievably beautiful was the showing of Esther risking

The early paintings were incredibly vivid and colourful and it was a privilege to see Botticelli's Primavera and Birth of Venus close up.
So much to see including Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio's Medusa, Reubens, Leonardo da Vinci but another highlight was the exquisite statue the Venus of the Medici, a Roman statue dating back to the first century BC.

The audio guide is trash and you really can’t learn and appreciate this museum. Same with the Borghese gallery in Rome. Get a very knowledgeable private guide- it is worth every penny.",Sep 2021
Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"There are so many important paintings in the Uffizi and it was a thrill to see them. Our guide, Raffaela, was very knowledgeable and informative. She made the experience interesting and enjoyable. Sometimes it was hard to understand her over the headset because of background noise but not much can be done about that. We enjoyed the museum and particularly enjoyed Raffaella.",Sep 2021
Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,2.0,"The Medicis must have been proud. Of course, their hands were never clean; you don't get to be an affluent political dynasty without breaking some eggs. But Lorenzo de'Medici must have seen his family as the parents of modernity. In the Uffizi, one finds many magnificent art pieces commissioned or collected by this family. As is expected from parents, I imagine the Medicis to have attributed great value to world they left behind for us. Why else would they collect so many adorations of the sages? How would they explain the tension between the stories of Christ and the Greek Myths? And the beautiful wedding gifts painted by Botticelli surely had a hopeful message for the newly weds. If Lorenzo would look upon this forest of art, he undoublty would be touched to tears. So many stories, such profound wisdom and spirituality, so much pain and forgiveness. I imagine he would tell me all about it.

But Lorenzo is dead, and the Uffizi makes little attempt to hide that. To get to the art, you first must pass a series of dark halls and reconstructions, as if the museum itself is digging in its memory to remember. And when you finally enter the forest with marble statues for trees, you enter the parentless world where most visitors are lost for meaning. The plaques give you the cold facts, but most human context is lost. The audio guide does not tell us why this art is here, which makes me wonder why I am here. For all it cares, everything is self-evident; This is art, and this art, and this is art.. Even when buying tickets the guest is left parentless and confused, as swindlers offer the same tickets for different prices.

If only Lorenzo would be there, next to ""Judith and Holofernes"". Telling me to look at the self-portrait of a girl who was raped at her teens. How she grabbed a knife and wished her aggressor to share Holofernes fate. But she did not. Maybe because he was not sleeping. Maybe because of the book in which Judith plays a role. But her wrath, sanctified by the scene, is painted for eternity. But Lorenzo is silent.

My mother, an avid florist and Christian, sometimes would show her many pictures of the forest. Moss have been the highlights of her visits. She would make me laugh when she would show 8 pictures straight; ""This is moss, and this is moss, and this is moss...""
But my mother is still alive and well. She will tell you all about the botanic wonders. How God has made everything so for us. And how there is a story even to moss, shows us good can grow from the shadows of great things. How the small works matter for everyone.

One day, I will be parentless and lost like I was in the Uffizi. I fear the inevitable day that my mother comes to pass and moss becomes like Artemisia's ""Judith""- a wonder in the dark, without someone to show its grat value. I give the Uffizi two stars.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,4.0,"We visited mid afternoon and the queue was minimal. Once the security and covid checks had been satisfied, we had to climb two sets of stairs to begin the tour on the upper level. We hired handsets but found it easier to read the placards next to the exhibits which caught our interest.

As I am not a particularly avid art enthusiast, I was more interested in the paintings than the sculptures. Having said that I'm glad I visited this gallery, and would recommend stepping back from the paintings and viewing them from top to bottom to understand the vision.

Well worth the admission charge. We were in there for about an hour and a half, but were not hurried by the staff. There are various benches situated throughout so plenty of opportunity to sit, rest and observe.

The Uffizi exceeded my expectations. Were only there for about 3 1/2 hours, but fortunately we hired a guide to help us prioritize and to provide historical, religious, or mythological insight. What a collection! I was surprised to see Dutch Masters along with Renaissance masterpieces. Take advantage of the skip-the-line tickets. Some of the exhibition were more crowded than others, but everyone was masked up and for the most part, patient. Wonderful experience!

The waiting times were very reasonable in our case (in total less than 30 mins, but it might easily be longer again post-covid). A security check at the entrance was also quick. 0.5l and larger bottles are normally not allowed to be brought inside, but kindly asking the security staff might grant you an exemption. I would recommend to get audio guides for 6 EUR/person. We relied on an app based guide, which was not nearly as complete as the official ones offered. The entrance area can be a bit confusing, but just keep going with the flow. We spend abour 3h of time when we reached a feeling of saturation. I guess that a time of 5h would be required to really look at everything. A small cafeteria awaits at the end.

To our surprise we didn't received an e-ticket but we're told in an email to come collect the tickets at Uffizi (maybe we just didn't see the info). We turned up in the morning on the day of our reservation to collect them but only after we queued up we saw a little sign saying we can only come collect tickets ten minutes before our reserved time. We wanted to collect them to go and see one of the other sights included in the ticket but were told that's not possible and can only be collected before going to Uffizi at the pre-booked time 🤦🏼‍♀️ so just be aware of that in case you were planning to use the ticket to go to other places first and leave Uffizi last. ☺️
Otherwise we really liked it once we got in and really enjoyed seeing the whole collection. The works that are in the gallery are amazing and definitely worth seeing. ☺️

The museum does not have the extensive collections such as the Louvre or the British museum that cover pre-history to current day pieces, but as represnetative for the quattrocento and ciquecento period of italian renaissance, I believe this mluseum to be unsurpassed. To be able to look at the 'primavera' and the 'birth of Venus' from a distance of less than an inch (2.54 cm) is quite unique and allow the visitor to appreciate the magnificence of the pencil strokes applied by the masters of that period.

Six weeks later the museum is still open and the Trip Advisor listing still tells us it is closed. I'm disappointed that once this notation was implemented on the website, there was apparently no mechanism put into place to accommodate the inevitable re-opening.

To paraphrase Mark Twain, ""Rumors of Uffizi's closure (and others) are greatly exaggerated.""

We entered the gallery on schedule at 3PM, and the tour still ended up being closer to 2 hours rather than the initially stated 1.5, which was perfectly fine for me as I wanted to learn as much as I could. Hearing not just about the technicalities of the artistry in the works we viewed, but the historical context surrounding their origination, was particularly remarkable; I greatly enjoyed learning the drama behind the works we were observing, and any future visits I make to the Uffizi Gallery will be that much richer for having had this spectacular introduction to it.

Simone Martini's ""Annunciation"", Lorenzo Monaco's and Gentile da Fabriano's ""Adorations of the Magi"", Giotto's and fra Angelico's ""Madonnas"", Filippo Lippi's Madonna"", Uccello's ""Battle of San Romano"", most of the Botticelli(s), van der Weyden's ""Deposition"", the sublime Bellini (""Lamentation"", my favourite painter), the Leonardo(s), the Raphael(s), the outstanding Bronzino(s) and particularly the extraordinary ""Portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi"", Titian's ""Venus"" and ""Flora"", and Rembrandt's portrait of an old rabbi which literally dominates the room and reduces van Dyck's and Rubens' paintings to feeble attempts--I am exaggerating of course but the sheer ""presence"" of this work of genius is striking.

Some rooms were very crowded, particularly in those occupied by tour groups. Pre/post-covid I hate to think of how even more crowded this place would be.

The restaurant is very expensive; if possible do as the locals do and take your order at the counter. Instead of paying €5.50 for a cappuccino, you'll pay €2.

The whole visit took us 3 hours. You could spend a little longer but you would be hard pressed to shorten the visit. The galleries are well laid-out so it shouldn't be difficult to view all that's on display.

The collections alone justify a 5 star review.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"A must visit place for our first time in Florence. Not huge art lovers though and 2 hours was enough for us. Many, many rooms over 2 floors....you do forget what you've seen as so many religious themed huge paintings. Vast number of Roman busts too...
We visited in mid September and it was quiet (Covid time....). We checked but didn't need to book and just arrived at the entrance, paid and went straight in with no queues. Our 2 daughters (both under 25) only paid €2 each and 2 adults at €8 each was very value. (Good views from windows inside along the river).",Sep 2020

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,2.0,"Obviously there are a lot of wondeful famous artworks that you can see in this museum for which you might want to visit. But I have to say I didn’t enjoy this museum so much, because even outside of the high tourist season and now with corona it’s absurdly crowded. In some parts of the museum, it’s impossible to stand still to read the descriptions because you are being pushed in the crowd like a herd of cattle. However beautifucal and significant these artworks are, you will hardly be able to appreciate them under such circumstances. Going to a leas famous museum, you will probably be able to enjoy the historical artworks more and learn something new. All in all I guess I wouldn’t recommend visiting.

However. Although it's a beautiful building, it's not well designed for visitors. Anyone with mobility issues will struggle. There are a lot of stairs. The signage is not clear, the entrance is very tight and crowded. Toilets are a long way from the start.

The cafe and terrace half was round is really nice.
The staff do look very uninterested I have to say!

I personally found myself flagging about 3/4 od the way round, I dont know if it was the heat, the masks or the layout- other museums on a similar scale such as the Orsay and the Louvre have a much more interesting layout with a lot of differences between the rooms and artists.

I cannot fault the art on display- it's absolutely breath taking- but for me, the experience wasnt the best.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,2.0,"It's regarded as a 'must-see' for visitors to Florence, so I must admit I didn't really do my homework before booking tickets.

So I'm afraid I found the Uffizi to be dull and massively overrated. People do rave about it, but for me the emperor's new clothes come to mind.

I liked the Roman statues, but apart from that it was mainly a load of religious art, which I find a turn off at the best of times. Even then I saw plenty of better stuff in countless fabulous churches I visited during my fortnight in Italy.

Florence is a beautiful city, but if you're not into religious art then save your money and skip the lines by skipping the Uffizi entirely.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,2.0,"After many trips to Florence over the years, I decided it was time to brave the queues and visit the Uffizi - sadly not a case of pleasure postponed, pleasure doubled.

It goes without saying that the collection is amazing by any standards but that is where the praise ends. If ever there was a gallery resting on its laurels, this is it. Many of the paintings poorly hung (does the gallery possess a spirit-level??) and inadequately/badly lit. The decoration of many of the rooms in reds and greens is reminiscent of a provincial pizzeria. Most frustrating is that nobody seems to think that it might be an idea to clean/polish the glass protecting some of the exhibits (the glass in front of the Caravaggio Medusa looked liked it had been last wiped with an old dish cloth).

Even in times of Covid-19, the Uffizi was well visited but I seriously doubt that the experience would be one to encourage anyone to make a habit of going to visit galleries. Given that we are in 2020, it might be an idea that those in charge of the Uffizi take time to visit Amsterdam or Dresden to see what their colleagues (with no less impressive collections) are doing to make a trip to their museum visitor-friendly.

Finally, not least in the middle of a pandemic, it is to be expected that toilets should meet a minimum standard of cleanliness. On balance I would say that the sanitary facilities are fairly representative of what seems to be the management's attitude to visitors generally: We have the collection, you have the money (Entrance €20).

In short, a visit that was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"Truly a wonder in terms of art - the endless number of sculptures and paintings are incredible. I visited the Uffizi 14 years ago and the museum has changed for the better since then. There are now several new extensions with lots more art and sculptures, and it's done very nicely.

You can spend several hours in here just craning your neck to look up at the ceiling art. Bring comfy shoes, water, and take your time. I think many people also miss the art on display on the floor below the main hall. The main part of the museum is at the top of a few floors and when you finish the main hall, you're in front of several staircases (and a lift) you must descend in order to reach the exit. Well, off the floor immediately below the main hall is another floor filled with art - don't miss it, as there are excellent pieces by artists from various places around Europe.

I recommend reserving tickets in advance, as the lines/queues for non-reserved ticket holders can be long, and when it's in the middle of summer and it's blazing hot, you don't want to be standing outside for hours on end... I didn't know I had to collect my reserved tickets in a small room in a building across from the Uffizi main entrance. I initially stood in the reserved ticket line museum entrance thinking I collect my tickets inside the museum, but when I asked a Staff member, she explained I had to go across the street to collect my tickets. I'm glad I asked.

Back then it gave me an appreciation of some of the more beautiful parts of human history - on this trip i got to experience it again and share the visit with my wife.

Booked online and collected our entry tickets earlier in the day, this worked well. We probably should have got an audio guide as the write-ups left you wanting to know more. Also glad we did the tour in December, although it was still quite crowded.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"The view of the Uffizi U-shaped building and its inner courtyard, located not far from the Arno River, is perfect. Being here in this place and watching these works of art by genius artists is a great privilege. The construction of Uffizi was commissioned by Cosimo de Medici and designed and began construction of Giorgio Vasari in 1560. It's a beautiful building that has no objection. From then on, the Gallery - a museum with almost the largest collection of paintings from the 12th century to the 18th century and classical sculpture, will be created. At first it was opened on request, and in the middle of the 18th century it was open to the whole public. The museum is organized as a long labyrinth of rooms with amazing works of art displayed roughly in chronological order along a Renaissance building that was never created to be a museum. Cosimo de 'Medici had entrusted his favorite architect Giorgio Vasari to create a grandiose building right next to Palazzo Vecchio, the seat of power, to host the magistrates, the seats of the Florentine Guilds, and the vast theater and judiciary offices (hence the name "" Uffizi ”which means offices in Italian). The Medici family were great lovers of art and also great collectors, and they managed in a short time to obtain works of art the greatest masters of painting and sculpture. Buontalenti created for Francesco de Medici an octagonal shaped room ""Tribuna"" ( small treasure chest), to host his favorite works of art and jewels ( sculptures, cameos, books, paintings, coins, armor, a potpurri of elements). The Tribune is considered the most ancient and precious heart of the Uffizi, still maintaining its original shape from its construction in 1584. Favorite works of art start from the Gothic painters which include Giotto and Cimabue, who left some of the largest altarpieces. The magic of the first hall is the sensation of being welcomed inside an ancient church, with low lighting reminding us of candle lights. We enjoyed the next one to walk through the Hall of Early Renaissance painters like Paolo Uccello and Masaccio and the beautiful unmistakable Portraits of the Dukes of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca. The profile of Federico da Montefeltro is one of the most impressive portraits of the Renaissance. A few steps from the diptych we find the largest hall of the museum, housing the most stunning and breathtaking paintings by Sandro Botticelli. We stop in just a few minutes to simply admire the silence of a large panel of the Allegory of Spring and the canvas of the Birth of Venus. We also enjoyed many other Botticelli works of art in these rooms. But what I was most interested in were the works of The Tondo Doni by Michelangelo (the Tondo Doni features the Christian Holy Family (the child Jesus, Mary, and Saint Joseph) along with John the Baptist in the foreground and contains five ambiguous nude males figures in the background) and Raphael's portraits. We are then delighted with the works of Leonardo da Vinci's one and only completed panel painting ""The Annunciation,"" Filippo Lippi's Madonna and Child with Two Angels, Titian's Venus of Urbino, lots of other works, including works by Caravaggio, Tintoretto, Rembrandt, Velasquez, Rubens. ...... All these works around us are the magic of the beautiful. Also a special feature of Uffizi is the 'Corridoio Vasariano', a passage that in the past has helped Florentine nobility to pass seamlessly and unnoticed from the Medici offices, via Ponte Vecchi to Palazzo Pitti. An extremely meaningful, wonderful and interesting experience.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"Our tour agency Ciao Tours had reserved tickets for us on Mar 7 to see Uffzi and the Accademia. We arrived early and had no problem getting in early and see the gallery. We bought the 3 day tickets which also included Petit Palace and Boboli gardens which we were going to do Mar 8th. The start of the tour starts on the 3rd floor so you have lots of stairs to climb prior to coming to the ""Roman/Greek"" sculpture gallery. I enjoy sculptures but there were so many with many of them being significant sculptures. After about 45 minutes of this area, got my fill. I am not saying they aren't great but overload was apparent. What was very interesting was that some of these ""ancient"" masterpieces were repaired by Renaisance masters such as Michealangelo. You could see where the repair joined but the overall effect was complete. One sculpture Michaeangelo fixed, there was argument about his repair based on position of the arms, it was found that he was such a great anatomist with his art, that experts now agree he was correct. Galleries, Michaelangelo, Giotto, Raphel, Da Vinci and so many others. I saw paintings which were in art books but see the real art. Amazing, almost too much. We didn't use audio guides, had used before other palces and unfortunately too much information so you spend lots of time listening and not seeing. The art gallery was in flux with some areas being rearranged and closed. Some would use a personal guide, Luca our guide, stated he got burned out after doing tours for 15 years at Uffzi since you can only see this artwork so much and explain it so much. We were lucky, the virus cut down the crowds to almost nothing. Note, you can spend more than 3 hours here easily, we were burned out and left after 2.5 hrs.
The 3 day Uffzi/Pettit Palace pass is a very good deal IF YOU CAN USE IT.
They closed the Pettit Palace and we asked for a refund of 42 Euro's but Uffzi REFUSED - offered a voucher to use in 1 year - like we are going back?????

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"On a practical note: Use the bathroom before entering, there aren't any toilets until near the end of the artworks, and they contained only about six cubicles... yeah the crowd of men loitering 'patiently' for their women to come out was not quite as great as the queue for the ladies itself! Because the gallery is so vast and has a number of entrances, it isn't clear where to pick up the pre-purchased timed tickets, so don't waste time and just ask one of the line attendants. (It's actually a small office door on the opposite side of the courtyard to the main entrances; then you return to the entrance with your ticket).

Ok, the gallery is enormous, FILLED with INCREDIBLE works of art (even the building itself is to be admired), but thankfully there is a natural flow around the works that helps you not to miss anything and prevents you getting lost or the crowds too claustrophobic. I have visited many galleries around the world and found some bewilderingly pompous and unfriendly. The Uffizi has works to match or surpass any of those, and yet opens its doors with unpretentious respectful passion for all to relish with exuberance!

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,3.0,"There are two great galleries in Florence, the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti. Everyone rushes to the Uffizi because it's so famous but, especially if you don't have much time, the Pitti might be better for you. Sure, the Uffizi has the famous Canalettos and so on, but the great bulk of the collection consists of religious paintings and, frankly, an endless parade of Madonnas and their child quickly becomes boring. By contrast, the Pitti has a much greater range of paintings that provides a much broader and deeper understanding of what was going on with European art. There are also artefacts and precious items and a greater sense of the involvement of Florence's rulers. Another huge bonus is that the glorious Boboli gardens are behind the palace. All in all, the Pitti provides a much richer experience than the Uffizi. Though the Uffizi has a more obvious location, the Pitti is an easy and picturesque walk.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"This is definitely one of the most impressive art galleries I have been to- the amount of paintings and sculptures it contains is unbelievable. It is fairly easily to spend a whole day here, walking through the corridors and hallways looking at paintings by well known artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. The design of the gallery is also marvellous, with the painted ceiling on the main corridor containing the busts. Also very convenient, just off the main square in Florence near tons of restaurants and shops. Prices were quite affordable (especially for kids) and audioguides are available too. Would totally go back when I return to Florence.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,4.0,"You need to buy timed tickets to get into the place, which is fine, just be aware of the 15 minute slot. Hired the audio guide, which was okay at times, but too many areas and exhibits are not covered by it.

The place is vast and labyrinthine. Many beautiful works of art to see, I think the only downside would be that there's almost too much to take in, and it is all of a very similar nature. If you have a strong interest in the contents, you will be in heaven (whilst looking at paintings of heaven). For the casual observer and tourist, you may find yourself flagging after a while.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"We arrived at 9am. Because it’s low season, we only waited two minutes to get the tickets. It seemed that the line for buying tickets was shorter than the one for reserved tickets. We bought the 3-day €18 combination tickets including the Palazzo Pitti and Boboli Garden, a very good deal.

The collection of Uffizi is really amazing, a lot of master pieces. No wonder it is the number one attraction in Florence and the most crowded one. Each painting has English description, so not necessarily to rent the audio guide, but the audio guide provides more detailed explanation which is very helpful. We spent the whole day inside and barely finished it when the museum closed.

The Uffizi never fails to impress with their ongoing dedication to improvements. Every time I visit Florence I go back to see just what they have done. It is not a boring, stuffy gallery and the gift shops are fantastic for souvenirs and serious books.",Dec 2019

Next, it was walking up two very long flights of stairs to begin my viewing on the top floor. The upper corridor is lined with seemingly endless Greco/Roman statues/busts, some of which are most impressive. I honestly had no idea which way this museum flowed which was frustrating. From the crowds meandering around me, it seemed they were as lost as I was. I spent almost three hours here, eventually highlighting my visit with specific works and spending more time examining those as there is simply too much to possibly see in one visit. I’ll say that the large crowds definitely took away some enjoyment at the museum, especially around the more popular pieces - virtually zero time to really see those pieces. I cannot even begin to imagine the crowds this museum receives during peak tourist season. Overall, I was underwhelmed with the art and the museum itself. I felt that the museum’s reputation far exceeded its collection.

This was my first solo adventure in Florence and this is definitely something to do (solo or not solo) that will most probably take up the whole day– if you’re like me And you love art, history and culture, this is definitely the place to go. The art exposed there is are from famous artist such as Da Vinci, Reuben and Boticelli amongst many more.

I was in awe with the various rooms and fantastic ceilings... Yes do spend some time looking at the ceilings, they are definitely something to see.

It was nice to see that there were some explanation in English, I did think of hiring an audio guide however the fact that I had to leave my passport or driving license behind didn’t sit well with me. However I was still able to get by reading the info that was in English.

I must say that I absolutely loved the gallery and would go there again if I am ever visiting Florence again. Do you take your camera out to take pictures of Ponte Vecchio. The views that you see from the gallery are quite spectacular.

One advice would be to buy the skip the queue ticket as it would save you hours of queueing up. And if you’re going, have a wonderful time. You will not regret it.

Inside is you may leave a bag in thr ockroom only if its a ruck sack. No other shaped bags are allowed! You are not able to leave a coat in the clock room! You must carry this during you 3 or 4 hour visit.
The audio guide requires a driving licence or photo I'd and once you get it it may not work. If it does often when you enter a number in a room it says, there is no audio for this room 🤣 it's so bad you couldn't make it up.
Thr lighting is so rubbish. Many items can't be seen at all well especially in winter light.
The clock rooms were rank, filthy.

The Gallerie is filled with Greek, Roman, Medieval, Renaissance art too numerous to mention. In fact, some say even the museum does not know its complete holdings. Of course, Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus"" and ""Four Seasons"" are not to be missed, but the works of others such as Bernini, della robbia, etc. should not be short changed either.

From Cimabue and Giotto to Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Memling, and other great masters. It took 8 hours for us to go through the gallery and we only focused on paintings. But the experience and emotions are just great.
Some recommendations:
Book your tickets in advance and add priority entrance. This will allow you to skip the lines. If you have Firenzecard, just go to the office opposite to the main entrance and take your free priority ticket. Consider the audioguide, which is helpful but does not provide too much details. Do not start your cisit too early. There are many groups that are a bit disturbing. They disappear around noon and you will have a good possibility to study art, unless you don’t plan to make a sprint along the most important paintings. The best season is Jan/Feb. Note that drinks are not allowed inside. As in the Pitti, coats need to be taken with you, cloak room accepts bags and backpacks only. There is a small cafeteria serving simple food and snacks.

I suggest you buy tickets through internet to avoid huge queue and go as early as possible. If you will not have a guide, rent the audio-guide. Wear comfortable shoes and be ready for hours of walking and standing. But it surely worths the fatigue! Michelangelo, Dante, Da Vinci, Donatello, Rafaello,Tiziano, Boticelli and so many others! Even if you are not such a great fan of art, I suggest you do not miss it!",Mar 2019

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"The history and design of this building is just as amazing as the art inside it. If you go to only one museum, it should be this one for sure! It has everything, paintings, sculptures, views of Florence, a terrace, and beautiful ceiling.",Dec 2019
Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"We snagged a last minute two hour tour with a local company and met outside the museum at 3:30. The place was a total madhouse. The tour was overpriced at 45€ apiece, but beggars can’t be choosers, and with limited time to spend, sometimes you just have to bite the bullet.

The U-shaped grey granite Uffizi Museum was built in 1555 to house the administrative offices of Florence. The owner started collecting works of art and it soon became the first art museum in Europe. It houses the finest collection of Renaissance art in the world.

It is world famous for many of its works of art, including the Jovian Collection of paintings that runs along the ceiling throughout the main hallways. The 450 portraits on the walls showcase the faces of the most famous people of the Middle Ages, making it a who’s who photo album of a forgotten time. Interestingly, the ceiling frescoes are called “grotesques”, which doesn’t mean something ugly, but rather, “from a cavern”.

But the most famous masterpiece in the museum is the familiar painting seen in advertisements, bedspreads, diner plates, and all sorts of modern day media, Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus”. It’s the one with a coy teenage Venus standing demurely in all of her naked glory, hiding her treasure box with her long red hair while emerging from a clam shell.

I have a heart condition and couldn't do the whole Gallerie in one go when we went back the next day they said we couldn't go back it's only one visit per Gallerie we said we asked and were told yes we could when we bought it, our understanding is we could go as many times in the three days as we liked, it was a huge place to visit so many wonderful works of Art to see and I can't manage it all in one go. They should tell people only one place one visit when they sell the ticket.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"Last April the week following Easter I went to Venice and Rome for the first time. A must see among all these Italian treasures is the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. I got my entry ticket in advance from a website which advertises to skip the queues. So that was a head start. In the square outside the gallery there is the large statue of David by Michaelangelo. This is a replica of the original kept in the Galeria del accademia de Firenzi... Not far away. But proceed behind the statue where there are several entrances to the Uffizi depending on what ""skip the line"" ticket you have. As I went after Easter in April the queues were not too bad. But in season these queues can be horrendous so it is advisable to buy a ticket on. Line in advance. Once in the Gallery there is much to see. I did not use the hand held guide very much but it was useful. You can get one when you deposit your luggage coats, bags etc in the foyer. Having a guide meant I could choose which rooms to look in to be sure to see your favourite artist. For me it was to see a few Caravaggio paintings and Leonardo da Vinci and lots more. There is a decent cafe and shop.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"My partner booked a trip to Florence for my birthday and we managed to find time for the Ufizzi. I visited Florence more than 15 years ago and couldn't get in the Ufizzi. Queues were over 4 hours long. This time we didn't book and only had to queue 30 mins. Success.

You are taken to the top floor to see a multitude of renaissance sculptures and then the star prizes particularly for me the separate rooms for the greatest artists such as Sandro Botticelli. To see Primavira and Birth of Venus was more than I could have asked. To see works of Donatello Di Vinci and Michelangelo. This is a museum that is a must see for all art lovers. Dont wait do it go for it. It does however take around 6 hours to see a reasonable selection of the paintings and statues and much longer if you concentrate.

Finally try the cafe on the top floor for a break. Prices are high €5 for a coffee. The views across Florence are special. See the Duomo the way the Medicis did.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"My wife and I traveled to Florence in November and went to the Uffizi with a little over an hour before closing. We were able to go right in without any wait whatsoever. However, I will say it was not anywhere near long enough to enjoy this incredible museum. Since we had a map, and the layout of the museum is very easy to follow, we were able to see all the art highlights before they herded everyone out at closing time. A word of note, if you are in there near closing time and you must use the bathroom, get it done before they start ushering people out the door. Once they start that, no one is allowed in the bathrooms.

The museum itself is a work of art. I found myself just walking the main hallways in awe. The building is shaped like a giant U and you start on the top floor at the end of the U and work your way around to the other end of the U and then go down to the next floor and repeat. The main walkways are on the inside of the U and the rooms with the art are distributed along the outside of the U, making it very easy to visit everything sequentially without missing any rooms. The map they provide lists the artists or major attraction in each room. The entire museum is laid out in a way to ensure nothing is missed. The collection of art in this museum was stunning. Botticelli, Da Vinci, Raffaello, Michelangelo, El Greco, and Titian are all here. Along with the Academia (which houses the statue of David) this is one of the must see museums in Italy. Don't miss it!

Do yourself a favour and book a guide in your own language. We booked a danish art-expert to meet us there and she had planned the tour where she described the paintings and stated the time, timeline and circumstances. She made us see what we wouldn't have seen on our own and she answered all of the questions we had.

Keep in mind that this is one of the most popular museums in the world, so if you plan to visit the gallery:
Book tickets at least a week in advance.
Prepare yourself for standing in queues because there's always a lot of people.
You will have to climb a lot of stairs to get to the gallery.
Keep your ticket with you at all times. There's lots of security and sometimes they check your ticket again when you walk out of the museum.
Use your lower voice. Many people with many opinions gets loud. The staff will ""shh"" you.

- Buy tickets online in advance. On the day of your visit, you’ll need to stand in line at will-call to collect your ticket and then get in the ‘real’ line to get into the museum (security check is here).
- Keep your ticket throughout your visit.
- Go as early as you can. The rooms will be sufficiently packed by 9am and will stay packed until close.
- Download the official Uffizi app, which has helpful audio on many works, and search by photo-capture.
- Download Rick Steves’ app “Audio Europe” and listen to the same helpful bios of the famous works
- Bring earbuds for both
- Take snacks and water along, as you’ll be inside a lot.
- Turn off your flash before taking photos.
- If you’re really into the art, allow 4 hours for the top floor, and 1-2 hours for the bottom floor. There’s just so much art.
- If you had to choose one floor, see the top one (2nd floor). It has all the very best of Italian Gothic and Renaissance paintings. It’s all here. The first floor has some fine works by the post-Renaissance masters (Caravaggio, Rembrandt), but their best works are in other museums throughout the world.
- There are three interconnected gift/book shops at the end; look through all of them if you’re looking for something in particular.

In addition to visiting the Galleria dell'Accademia to see the David, we spent part of the day visiting the Gallerie Degli Uffizi. The artwork is simply breathtaking and if you love Renaissance artwork this is simply a must see. This gallery is full of amazing paintings and sculptures. It took us about two hours to see all of them. The is another must if you love art and history.

I do recommend a private guide for touring the gallery. We used a tour guide from Viator and he was excellent! He was able to explain things AND answer questions. Let's see an audio tape do that! Well worth the cost.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,4.0,"The collection at the Uffizi is extensive and has a strong focus on the Renaissance period. There are some extremely beautiful works and sculptures. It was particularly interesting following a tour of Florence, where some of the featured artists were mentioned in the context of the city itself. I’d highly recommend going following such a tour, if you’re planning on doing one.

I regret not doing my homework prior and understanding the must see pieces, given the enormity of the collection it’s very wise to do this beforehand so you don’t miss anything.

My only other advice would be it may be a little boring for someone who isn’t an art buff. There is a dedicated and strong focus to a defined period and the subject matter is very religious for a lot of the content. My partner was a little bored.

It wasn't that busy when we visited on November 10. There's a nice collection of artwork and the museum doesn't feel too big once inside. We stayed for about 3 hours up until it closed. During the last hour, the top floor wasn't very busy and we felt like we had the museum to ourselves. Pleasant surprise. There's a 3 day pass that I suggest buying that includes the Uffizi, Pitti Palace, and Boboli Garden. The website wasn't clear when I tried to purchase this pass. I ended up with just tickets to the Uffizi and the museum would not allow me to pay the additional 2 EUR to upgrade to the pass.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"If art interests you, then Uffizi Gallery is one place that you should not miss on your Florence tour. It is one of the most interesting places to visit in Florence, Italy. Situated in the Piazza Della Signoria, it can be covered together with the L shaped beautiful square. With the world’s preeminent collection of Renaissance paintings from artists such as Botticelli, Raphael, Da Vinci and more, this is the obvious go-to museum for one day in Florence. However, it’s also enormous, with 101 rooms bursting with art. it still displays the Medici family's prominent art collection, which includes such masterpieces as Botticelli's ""Birth of Venus,"" Raphael's ""Madonna of the Goldfinch"" and Titian's ""Venus of Urbino.""

*** The 10 Most Important Artworks at The Uffizi Gallery ( just so that you don’t miss this, I did miss a few and found out when I was reading about it)
The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli
Coronation of the Virgin by Fra Angelico
Laocoön and his Sons by Baccio Bandinelli
Madonna with the Long Neck by Parmigianino
Portrait of Pope Leo X with Two Cardinals by Raphael
Head of Christ by Unknown Tuscan Master
Annunciation by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Verrocchio
Medusa by Caravaggio
Doni Tondo by Michelangelo
Venus of Urbino by Titian

It houses a collection of awesome Renaissance time paintings of Botticelli, Da Vinci, Caravaggio, Giotto, and Michelangelo to name a few. A minimum of 2-3 hours is needed to explore all the paintings and sculptures. Don’t miss the courtyard outside. It houses statues of Galileo, Dante, Da Vinci and other greatest of Renaissance times. Online Reservation of tickets is available and I suggest buy skip the line ticket.

This is a must-visit place in Florence and it will easily take 4-6 hours. Just to know Uffizi's place is among the handful of world's top art museums. So don’t regret if you come across something and think, S**t, I was there, why I did not see this.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,5.0,"I have visited The Uffizi a number of times dating back to 1970 . Visitors had much more access to the collection then than they do now , a tragic result of vandalism . The Uffizi cannot be missed ...my favorite artist , Botticelli , is well represented there along with countless other famous Renaissance painters and sculptors . The lines can be extremely long , so get your tickets on line and avoid the queue . It is not uncustomary for museums and galleries to close for one reason or another , so make sure when you purchase your tickets online that you are sure of the exact day you will be visiting . This is not a 1 hour activity : give yourself at least 2 1/2 to 3 hours to experience this treasure . I would advise going online or securing a guide book through the gallery to identify the locations of your preferred artists ( for me Botticelli ) and map out a type of strategy unless wandering around suits you better . Masterpieces abound.

But I share with you our experiences of prebooking the tickets. Which worked out so fine. We have previously encountered in some European art museums that prebooking doesn't work, you might end up queuing up in the same line with the people buying the tickets on the spot.
We chose the suitable day and time, booked the tickets online, got a confirmation. Then we went to the ticket office for reserved tickets (door 3) about 20 minutes before the given entrance time. There the attendant sorted out people who were in the wrong place/line and let only one person of every group to go to collect the tickets.
The line moved fast in to the office, I handed out the confirmation email and got tickets in about 30 seconds. With the tickets then to a separate line for prebooked entrance. The line looked long but moved very fast. I checked in the watch and the time it took from starting in the ticket office line and to get inside the museum was 21 minutes!
Italy isn't best known for efficiency but this exceeded all our expectations! The prebooking is 4 euros more to the standard ticket price of 20 euros (per ticket) but I consider it worth of paying.Recommend!

It was crowded due to a national holiday in Italy but the staff there is almost uniformly bored, unhelpful and seem like they are there to just get a paycheck. We happened to still be in the museum as they were closing and this was when the staff became the most animated. “Get the pesky tourists out of the building so we can go home”. There is no one readily available to complain to, and I doubt anyone on the staff cares anyway.

We have been home for two weeks and still feel extremely frustrated and disappointed in our visit. The Ufizzi and especially the bored staff made a rainy day visit even darker.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,3.0,"This museum is located in what used to be offices during renaissance Florence. The gallery has recently been reconfigured and as such it was difficult to navigate, even with the map provided by the museum.

In the sculpture halls, there are several, and I do mean SEVERAL, sculptures. I would treat this museum kind of like the Louvre. Look up the pieces you have to see, find those and spend the most time there. There is simply too much art to take in for a reasonable day trip visit.

I would advise you to book tickets online for both the Accademia and Uffizi, at the official website. Book Uffizi first, as out will take you the most amount of time (we almost ran out of time here!) and then go to Accademia in the afternoon. With a time booked ticket you are guaranteed your entrance to both.

Some notable works include Artemisia Gentileschi, The Birth of Venus, Venus Urbino, and several others.

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,2.0,"A million words could be said about the great art collection of the gallery, but our visit has been spoilt by the horrible management and attitude of the museum's staff.
Before the visit, we had read all the rules and bought our tickets online in advance to come to the gallery on November, 5th at 11:30. It just happened so that it was a morning with an awful rain and for some reason the museum held sort of a fire drill. Okay, I can understand that.

As a result, they stopped any admition to the museum and we had to wait for about an hour to collect our online tickets from the ticket office, because it had simply been closed for a while. With all the crowds that have gathered by the entrance it was impossible to understand which queue to take and where to go (no signs there). Once we found a museum employee, she told us that with the collected tickets we need to stand in queue to Porta 2. Alright, we spent another 30 minutes in the queue. But soon we got suspicious, since we saw mosty groups around us. It turned out that individual visitors were to enter through Porta 1, and the museum girl simply gave us the wrong information.
We approached another museum worker who just told us that we had to queue in a different line all over again. When we tried to explain that her colleague gave us wrong instructions, she just said ""it's not my fault, talk to the man in charge"". We found the man, he didn't even look at us and only said with total indifference ""you want a refund - go stand in that line to get your refund, you want to get in - go stand in line to Porta 1.""
We understood that it's impossible to get through to them because everyone was saying ""I'm not to blame"" and offered no help or even a bit of politeness.

We'll, we spent about 2 hours under pouring rain to collect our PREPAID tickets and finally get inside. People around who shared our situation kept making jokes like ""We'll, that's Italy"". Doesn't sound like an excuse to me.

After we finally got in, obviously, the rule that they promote on their website (not more than 900 visitors at a time for everyone to comfortably enjoy the collection) was totally broken as they had to let in all the people who were outside when the admission was suspended. So the place was crowded.

I emphasize, I have been to many major museums, I'm okay with fire drills, queuing for hours, security checks and stuff like that. But I have never seen such ATTITUDE of museum employess towards their visitors and, what's even more ridiculous, towards their own work. Nobody could explain what was going on, they gave contradictive instructions, and kept saying that it's not their area of responsibility. They showed no affiliation with the museum and no interest whatsoever.

The Uffizi has one of the best collections in the world. It is also has the most poorly organized ticketing system. There is little signage. There are FAR to many tour groups. I would have to agree with many of the reviews on here that there are too many people taking photos and selfies. Many of these works are the most reproduced artworks in the world. Come on people. It's SUPER uncool to snap photos in museums. In fact, the museum would do well to ban the use of cameras as they suck the soul out of the place. As a painter I hoped to be inspired. I brought my sketchbook along. I knew I would be sitting and sketching. I found that I wanted to flee the place after 2 hours with not one line drawn. The staff were generally unhelpful and disinterested. Some were in fact on their phones. The bathrooms and elevators are insufficient for the throngs of people who are herded into the building. I find it is a poorly managed museum that is certainly not on par with any other major museums I have visited in the world. I give it 3 stars because the collection is world class and a must see. It's too bad that the management is poor. What a shame.

We took the chance and went around noon. We got really lucky and made it in a rather short line which they roped right after us. 12 euro pp, I paid almost double online and still got cancelled. Even though it was off season it was a weekend day and the museum was very busy. Need at least a half a day. Many great famous works! Well worth the visit

Italy,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,4.0,"My wife and I were in Florence for three days last month and we spent one of them by visiting the Accademia in the morning and the Uffizi in the afternoon. I knew that we would be rushing it and as expected, it was sensory overload with so many great paintings and sculptures to see in one day... it was a FULL day but what a day it was! At least we didn't spend more than a few minutes standing in line because we'd followed Rick Steves advice and bought our tickets well in advance directly from each museum's own website (not the brokers who pop up first in a Google search.). We also downloaded his free podcasts for each site and followed his tour which enhanced our understanding of what we were seeing. We may someday return and spend more time in each but for those with a limited amount of time in Florence, this was time well-spent.

One of the things we did to make sure we understood the importance of the Uffizi was hire a private guide. We are not ""private guide"" kind of people but we found it was the Best Money We Have Ever Spent. The guide allowed us to move through the lines, position ourselves in prime spots even with many tour groups all around us, but most importantly, he helped us to appreciate what we were seeing. Marco Verzi, marco@verzi.it - just in case you want to take advantage of his expertise. We also made use of the cafe on the top floor.

If you go, get the audio guide or get a guided tour. Without it, you just see a ton of paintings and sculpture with no context whatsoever.

Another gripe - the amount of security is unbelievable. You have to go through no fewer than three checkpoints to get in and submit to having your baggage and belongings x-rayed. While I was taking my phone out of my pocket, my ticket fell out and the third and final ticket checker wouldn't let me proceed. I asked her, ""How do you think I got this far without a ticket?"" She looked surprised, like she had no idea there were other people checking to make sure I had a ticket. In the end, my husband gave me his ticket and he went back to our hotel. It turns out he had the better time.

We had the Firenze card and a reservation and still waited over 45 minutes to get inside. Once inside it is bedlam around the popular exhibits. It is amazing how many of the visitors (especially those from China) don't know how to queue up and spend their time taking pictures of each of the pictures. Very difficult to get through the museum. Nice cafe for lunch. Watch for line cutters. We met some people at the Academie who had 4:00pm reservations, got in a little before 5, and the museum closed at 6:15.

I knew it was full of Renaissance artworks including the Birth of Venus etc.
We booked on line to jump the queues and paid another €4 for the privilege. So €24 each.
Entrance was a bit chaotic and not very well organised. Then the stairs. Oh yes the three long flights of stairs. Apparently there is a lift...somewhere.
The museum itself is stuffy but the it's one redeeming feature is the frescoes on the ceilings. Very nice.
And that's it.
Terrible signage. Quite a few areas closed for refurbishment which we were not aware of when we booked.
After a few rooms of Madonna and Child I had had enough. Yes. I get the art is incredible, being so old but I felt that if you took some of this work out then the museum would have nothing else left to offer.
Also, make sure you go to the loo before you start, as if you are caught short in the top galleries you have a long, long walk to the basement to the facilities.
I have been to a good many museums around Europe and this is easily the worst.

The people in tour groups basically hogged the good stuff.
If you wanted to see a Michelangelo painting, it was from afar, looking over peoples heads. It was a massive building so if you go, be prepared to walk a lot and go they many sections and rooms.

I enjoyed the sculptures more than the paintings.

If you go to Florence, you really should see this. Based on talking to other fellow tourists who went with a tour group, I’d recommend not doing a tour as they “spent too much time on a few works and we did not see all the artists we wanted to.

The online system is so confusing it changed my request from 12th to 9th Oct. i would not have chosen the 9th as i would not be in Itay then. I had to buy a new set of tickets for €78 and the customer service department refused to accept any responsibity . They would not refund the money and basically said that the “computer doesn’t make mistakes!

I had to buy another set of tickets but obviously it was a fantastic experience and I would recommend it. I bought a 3 day pass that allowed entrance to the Uffizzi, the Boboli gardens and one other. No need to pay the €4 extra to secure entrance.

I would recommend buying the brochure when you enter the gallery as there isn’t another opportunity anywhere else and it would have been a useful guide.

We loved the museum and Boboli gardens and spent well over 4 hours there- we did the Uffizzi first and gardens last - pack a picnic and you can sit in the peace and quiet to enjoy it under the trees .

However, the organization of the rooms and displays left much to be desired, especially on the 1st floor. It was not clear what was the recommended flow and order for visit, and I was quite confused and anxious about whether I had finished visiting every room. Quite a shame since there were many great art pieces such as Titian’s Venus of Urbino.

I also wish the gallery limited the number of visitors at each time block. The amount of crowd was crazy in the popular rooms such as the da Vinci or Botticelli room, it was almost impossible to really enjoy the art because everyone was fighting to get a clear shot of the painting. But I suppose this is the sad reality for most big-name museums like Uffizi and Louvre.

A complaint to Headout resulted in saying the tour started on time, so there wasn't a problem. It did start on time, that was never the issue. We paid for skip the line entry with guided tour to BOTH the Accademia AND Ufizzi with an outside tour of Duomo! False advertising, no accountability.

The rooms have paintings that are beautiful but each room was so crowded and stuffy!! You wanted to get out as soon as possible! I had a hand fan which saved me. There is a window that gives a view of the bridges in Florence that is breathtaking! The cafe has a nice terrace where you can sit as well but good luck trying to get a seat! The toilettes are in the basement which takes a long time to get to from the third floor! Then on the way out you have to show your ticket again! Thank goodness I didn’t throw mine away! In retrospect I wish my husband and I had spent our 3 hours sitting at a cafe instead of sweating and being herded like cattle! Definitely not worth it! We were there the end of Sept thinking crowds would be less! So much for off season!

2. The stuff are rude. I wanted to use the toilet at 17.54 and the stuff told me to use one in the bar or the restaurant outside because the toilets are closed, even though we were talking right next to its door.
3. The audio guide was not available after 16.00 (museum closes at 18.00) , of what I found out after pucker purchase. At 16.05 they refused to give me one and there was no guide available.
4. The stuff is incomplete. When I asked about the opening timeong of the other museums included in the combo ticket, the stuff gave me the wrong timing, before I bought the ticket, because of what I could not see any other museum.
I was waiting to see the palazzo , I had one day in Venice, however my experience was completely ruined.

There are two very impressive rooms, but not worth the €25 entry fee.
This ticket also gives you entry to the nearby Museo Correr, however I mistakenly understood this could be visited on a different day. This is not the case and again is a bit miserable that you have to visit both museums on the same day. Would not recommend this museum

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Watch out! Long queues even with prebooked tickets (October 2021), so highly recommend booking a guided visit.
I took the 10.15am « Secret Itinerary » tour with a wonderful guide and did not have to wait. Quite inexpensive and well worth it, as it takes you behind the scenes to the chambers where the Venice Republic machinery worked on government and justice (secret passages, torture room, places of detention, Casanova's cell, archives room, etc, etc).
I learned not only about the fascinating political institutions of ancient Venice, but also about the hidden architecture of this beautiful and gigantic palace (a visit to the attic reveals how Venetian architects dealt with the challenge of weight-bearing for the immense and heavily decorated ceilings below).
Daniela was our fabulous, very informative guide : Why were actors present during torture? Did Casanova really escape? Why was the number 3 so important in Venetian politics? Were archiving clerks nearly illiterate? Who instituted the 1st quarantine ever to protect a city from the plague?
Daniela kept everyone hanging on her every word. ( btw, she also does private tours danyni89@yahoo.it). 
After this amazing tour, I visited on my own the rest of this somptuous palace (included in the Secret Itinerary ticket), with the help of an audioguide, which, I must admit was not very informative.
I believe the best way to visit this gorgeous and fascinating place is by taking first the « Secret Itineraries » guided visit, then have lunch at the very good museum café in the courtyard, and finally get a guided visit for the Official Rooms.
You won't regret it !
The sophistication of the Venetian government is mindblowing and explains how this tiny city-state became a colonial empire and a supreme maritime power for several centuries

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"If you visit ONE thing in Venice, make sure it's this one. The Doge's Palace is absolutely stunning inside and out. We booked a time slot (12-4 pm) with the Venice Unica card, and frankly, it was a waste of money because the queue for the pre-paid, pre-booked tickets still went all the way around the block at 12. We returned at 3:30 pm and managed to get in after a relatively short waiting time.
They were very thorough to check the COVID Green Pass and ID, so it felt fairly safe inside there even with many other tourists visiting at the same time.

My recommendation would be to book a guided tour or even a private guide as no doubt you'll get a lot more out of the visit than going on a self-guided tour. Overhearing some of the guides' commentaries, there were some very insightful and entertaining anecdotes, so next time I'd definitely pay more and have that experience (and possibly avoid the long lines with a booked tour) experience instead.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Now this review must be taken with a grain of salt.

My wife and I arrived in Venice in the very beginning of March 2020. Right before the shut down.

We decided to see if the palace was still open for visitors. It was ...and we were 2 of about 10 people that were touring at that time. For most of the rooms we were completely by ourselves!

In fact when we headed over the Bridge of Sighs to the prison, we had the place to ourselves for 30 minutes!

Given all that, I am sure my review is a bit skewed.

It was magnificent! Being able to spend as much time as we wanted in each location and painting! We were able to really study each piece without any rushed feeling as there was no one else waiting!

Even if you have a waning interest in history, art or architecture, this place is a must! Spent hours in there and seriously could have spent more in front of some of those paintings!

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"The Doge's Palace is on everyone's ""must see"" list when in Venice. The walk up entrance fee of 25 euros might seem a lot, but it does give you access to the excellent Correr museum, which can be saved for another day. If you elect for the standard visit you are self-guided, beginning in the courtyard then moving through the grand rooms of the Ducal legislature. Initially there is a sense of awe, but after more and more of these rooms, decorated with gloomy old masters and miles of gilt, you long for some soft furnishings and light. The quality of information is quite good, with information displayed in four languages and some descriptions of the huge quantity of paintings. There is very little contextual information, covering the history of either the Doges or their impact on their citizens. In fact you learn almost nothing about them and see little of the treasures they acquired. The second half of the tour crosses the Bridge of Sighs and wends its way around the prison cells. Again, there is no information about the prisoners, conditions, or why they were there. The tour also takes in some of the vast collection of arms and armour, which may test the patience of some. In Covid times it is reassuring that guests are temperature checked, limited to ensure that there is not too much overcrowding and there is plenty of sanitiser. Expect to spend 1-2 hours inside, more if you are a fan of Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Itinerari segreti with the excellent guide Alex was most interesting (bought online Eur 15 senior rate). The horrors of emprisonment in the bottom cells were palpable. The story of Casanova's escape which I knew from his Memoirs was made quite real in the piombi. The abomination of the secret trials and government of the ""republic"" in the secret archives made one loathe secrecy as a method of government. An added advantage apart from avoiding the queue was the fact we could visit the rest of the Palace at leisure on the same ticket.

The grand state rooms are most impressive, splendiferous, richly decorated, etc. and must be seen when you are in Venice but we were somewhat disappointed with the quality of the paintings which are so huge, so official, so grandiloquent, so manipulative, so heavy with ideology that even Tintoretto whom we love and admire unreservedly is not at his best (and some paintings by other artists are indifferent at best). I suppose our reaction was the same as in Versailles where one tires of so much gilding, of the acres of stately canvasses celebrating a (very bad) ""sun"" king or, in this case, vicious, decrepit doges. Give me the Carpaccio cycle in Scuola Dalmata, the Tintoretto cycle in Scuola Grande San Rocco, or the sublime Bellini Virgins in the Accademia ANY day.

Official art is to art what official statements are to reality.

Costs 25 euros. Cheaper than the 'buy cheap tickets in advance on the interweb scam', but is still overpriced. Lots of empty civic rooms and prison corridors to look at. Some very impressive wall and ceiling art, but nothing to anything you'd see in Rome or Florence. There is very little information given in each room to explain how this place is part of the thousand years of Venetian history. Overall, it's another tourist trap and a missed opportunity. Exit is via the gift shop, just to rub salt into the
wound. Ten euros per person would be excessive. And there is no where to sit down and admire the art. Just hurry down the line and out, as the next tourists (at 25 euros plus a head) are right behind you. The best thing about this is the views from the windows.

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"The Doge's Palace is stunning and other reviews do this justice. What I found infuriating about the visit was that I really wanted to learn about it, but audioguides were not available due to Covid. What is the justification for this? Even if you believe that there is a ""risk"" in this, surely it just needs a wipe down with antibacterial/viral wipe after use? To make matters worse - the info boards in the rooms were small with tiny writing, you literally had to be stood in front of it. This occasionally led to more than one person gathering round it to access the info, which is surely far more of a risk than a disinfected audioguide?! The mind boggles.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Breathtaking.

More art, gold and torture than you can shake a stick at.

I did the secret tour which led through rooms behind the court scenes. Fascinating. Then ‘joined the public’ for the rest of the visit. All one way systems in place for COVID. and so much space. Fantastic.

On a short itinerary? Worth getting a ticket which jumps the queue.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,Lots to see and a good walk about from courtyard with Basilica view to rooms full of historical artefacts. Weapons dominate as does beautiful carpentry. However front and centre is a series of large halls with amazing ornate ceilings. Incredible detail and designs. Worth stopping and sitting down to take it all in. Add massive movie screen size canvases and tapestries and you have a jaw dropping experience if you love grand art and history. Of course you get to walk inside the bridge of sighs too. Memorable museum. Wow.,Sep 2020

We joined the prepaid queue just after 11am, and went nowhere fast in 40 minutes, maybe 10% of the queue. Asked the lady at the head if we could come back tomorrow on our ticket, and she said ""or after 2pm, there's no queue then."" Came back at about 3pm, there was a short queue, maybe 15 minutes. Got us out of the heat of the sun, it was perfect. By the time we got out, the worst of the heat of the day had died back.
7 year old and 4 year old found bits boring (the state rooms), the 9 year old found it all very interesting, and they all enjoyed the Bridge of Sighs and the New Prison.

Booking tickets in advance doesn’t let you truely to skip the queue, but let’s you cut it short. I recommend getting a trip with a good guide- but it is ok song the pre-paid tickets too. They manage visitors numbers well - it’s really comfortable inside. There are full disinfectants everywhere and it’s also nice and cold due to the air-con systems working. Temperature checks on entry. It was my third visit to Venice, but a first time in the Doges Palace, and I want to underline - it is a spectacular place.

It has been so well kept and really does give anyone attending a real insight to how the rich people in Venice lived, thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",Jul 2020

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Given the non exciting ques it was great! We visited two times at two different days and we waited no more than a couple of minutes to get inside the first time.

Cost was 13 euros per adult and a little less for the kids. Took us a good hour to go through it all, and close to no waiting.

The lines were shorter in the afternoon (past 14) than in the morning. Well worth a visit",Jul 2020
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"The Doge's Palace stands out on the Piazzale San Marco and on the Venice waterfront - no way to miss it. But, beyond the shining outer walls, do fin the time to visit, for an hour or two, the magnificent inside of this elaborate and refined symbol of the Venetian Republic. Only within the walls of the palace do you realise the wealth and power of Venice in ages past, the complex power-balance, and the system of government that upheld republican principles and the equilibrated participation of all (the patricians...).

The visit is truly worth it (and good value for money). You will see the magnificence of the palace halls, rivalled only by the
similar wealth of its counterparts in other Italian principalities and republics (such as Florence). Each hall is exquisitely decorated with the finest art and masterpieces of painting. While the prospect of visiting the armory might seem tedious, its extremely elaborate and extended collection of mainly 16th century weaponry, all in perfect condition, will soon have yoiu think otherwise.

A little ""surprise"" comes when you are invited to cross the bridge of sighs - with its panorama on your photograph-taking tourist pairs - into the prison. This comes as an alteration in the 2 hour visit. The latter ends with the visit of two more halls, and exit at the north side of the palace.

All in all, extremely worthwhile, go if you can.

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,This is the only museum/palace i visited when I was in Venice. I showed up without a ticket so I had to wait about 15 mins which is not too bad. They do temperature checks and at the main stairs they spread people about (because of covid I assume). Also you are required to wear a mask. For me this was the real problem.. the museum was warm and wearing a mask for so long wasn't comfortable. The place is a one way tour.. you just follow the route. I think I would have enjoyed it more without a mask but I can understand thats not possible at this time.,Jul 2020
Italy,Doge's Palace,2.0,"I have booked my ticket a few days ago in order to skip the queue. Unfortunately, even though my visit was planned at 2p.m., at 2.40 p.m. i was still in the queue, and the restriction for coronavirus were not respected at all, except for the temperature check.
I think that such a great place like this needs a whole better management than the actual one, even if I admit that the crowd that visits Venice is so much that is very difficult to control everyone.
2 stars just because the visit was very interesting and it's a lovely place.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,I came here first thing in the morning in November 2017 ( not 2019)- It was like having a whole place to yourself. The exterior is mesmerising and stepping through the door and seeing the courtyard is absolutely not to be missed. The intricately decorated ceilings going up the stairs and seeing Venice from the DP is amazing. You also get a real sense of history and decisions being made that impacted Venice in the great hall and the shiver of other forms of decisions being made in the prison. Definitely come and view the side of Venice where History was made and marvel at the paintings.,Nov 2019

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Visited here 59 years ago and wasn't the slightest bit interested as I was very young. Now I find the place fascinating. Each room beautifully decorated with wonderful art. Then the armoury with all types of weapons to kill with as much pain as possible. The prison cells leading to the bridge of sighs. It is difficult to imagine living in that era, you either had the money and opulence or you had a short life. Even the grounds are lovely when you walk in , reaching to winding staircases. Once inside you actually forget you are in Venice on the water. I can only assume that they were short people as the prison doors are very small indeed.
We also chose to go late in the afternoon, no waiting, straight in and no people about.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"The Doge Palace and whole of the Piazza San Marco is an impressive relic of the history of Venice, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Being February there were no long queues to suffer, so we were able to walk straight in, and tour the building with relative ease. There are a lot of steps, and I'm not sure of the facilities for disabled, so check with the venue first if this is a consideration.

The rooms have some impressive artwork, guilded ceilings, furnishings and the history of how the governance of venice gradually formed is well presented and explained in a variety of languages.

The final part of the tour through the prison side of the building was a little bit too long as there's not much to see besides the cells so it takes quite a long walk to finally exit this part of the tour.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We are not surprised that the Doge's Palace is considered the nr. 1 attraction in Venice, besides the Canal Grande. It really is a very picturesque and history-filled building.

What stands out - compared to other palaces we've been to - is the diversity of its style, already starting with the courtyard where you enter.
Since the (majority of the?) building has burned down and had other damages, it was always readjusted, with parts of it being redone. This gives the palace the feeling of a strange harmony with a healthy dose of ongoing renewal.

If you are into history, especially art history and the works of e.g. Tintoretto, then this palace will especially be a treat for you, as it has njumerous beautiful pieces by him and many other famous artists and architects.
Even though we are not so much into art history, we understand the beauty of most pieces (e.g. Paradise, and Last Judgment) and can only recommend visiting the Doge's Palace!

Not sure if it can be purchased separately. Admission to this site is included in the Venice visitor pass and includes a skip the line speedy entry. Avoid taking large bags ( if you do have large items there is a locker/ cloak room area), you will be screened. There is ramped access but not sure how much of the palace interior is accessible.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We were here for about two hours and I could easily have come earlier in the day (I believe we arrived between 5 and 6) and stayed even longer. The rooms are all breathtakingly beautiful and extraordinarily ornate. My only regret is that there is so much political history that I couldn't entirely follow: when I return, I would like to give myself a little overview of the historical Venetian government so that I can more fully understand everything there is to see here! They give you do a very good of briefly explaining what would have gone on in each courtroom and judges' chambers but there are so many and they each had unique functions within the government that they eventually blend together (although every room we visited was fascinating). I would say it definitely a must-see.

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"Absolutely amazing place to see. From palatial and beautifully decorated rooms to grim prisons and the link to the Bridge of Sighs. The reason for the low score is the two offensive creatures who ""welcomed"" us. We had pre-booked tickets which included ""go to head of line"" priority, Being January,there was no line, but that didn't stop a chain smoking yob and his female assistant grunt at us and tell us to go several yards and wind up and down the lanes which wouild obviously be busy in summer. Of course we didn't. She grabbed my wife's bag to search it. A pity that after 4 great days in Venice, these two offensive and growling employees left a sour taste.

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"to be fair i was a little underwhelmed by the palace and feel that with a little more thought and effort the experience could have been so much more.
firstly at 25 euros per person its expensive then you walk round pretty much endless empty rooms granted the artwork on the ceilings and walls is amazing but the simple use of manikins dressed in period clothing would give you a much better idea of how the rooms were used back in there time once through the main state rooms you then enter the armoury again this is poorly displayed with little explanation of when and where the weapons were used again simple use of manikins would have greatly enhanced the exhibit. on then to the last part of the exhibit the prison which consists of a number of completely empty cells which apart from feeling cold and damp give you no feeling or understanding of what it would have been like to be imprisoned in one
to sum up an amazing building but you left feeling short changed as its very hard to imagine what it was like when it was fully in use as it was just a load of empty rooms/spaces

The way to circumvent that is to use a combined ticket with the Correr Museum - the museum at the other corner of the Piazza San Marco. The line at the Correr Museum was much shorter.

The Palace was opulence itself. The walls and ceilings were painted by the most prominent Venetian painters, such as Tintoretto, Titian, and Veronese.

It was interesting to walk through the Bridge of Sighs to get to the dungeon and prison cells.

But at 25 Euro per head its too exensive for what you get, compare with similar in Europe and you come away feeling overcharged and shortchanged.

Through the palace is where you go to go through the Bridge of Sighs, though you can see it from outside of the palace if you don't want to visit the palace. We spent a couple of hours here and I would say, well worth the money.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We absolutely loved the Secrets Itinerary tour.

We learnt of the fascinating history of the Venetian empire, with a particular focus on how they managed their political prisoners within the walls of the Doges palace. Venice is built in water, nowhere for dungeons, how they managed it was ingenious. Behind the massive ornate Palace rooms were tucked away cells, torture chambers, inquisition rooms, magistrates, Venetian version of the secret service and many more layers of political intrigue. All designed so very few even the Doge knew the whole picture. So as no one got above their station. The Venetian political system was very different to other systems in Europe at the time. A democracy of the elite families, the system was designed to avoid the monopoly and excesses of kingship. Interestingly if there was a weak Doge the power often lay with the Grand Chancellor andthe bureaucracy.

Walking through these cells was a sobering experience. Cold and invaded by water, filthy with disease and rats and shrouded in darkness, the graffiti left by one poor soul proclaimed “ I will die here”. Also moving was the saintly artworks in one cell drawn by a local artist arrested for heresy; his talent did not save him and he died in the flames. The interrogation room where prisoners were tortured for information was also chilling. The rope by which poor souls where hauled up in agony in front of their inquisitors hung still in one room. The presence of such cruelty and suffering literally beside such opulence in the adjoining state rooms was a fascinating contrast.

The well laid out tour was easy to follow and showed us the main areas of the building and its history. We had an audio guide which only covers parts of the tour but it was enough to give us a good feeling for the place. The extra art exhibition was also very good and well labelled in English so we could enjoy the works on display.

One is issue was the return of the audio guide for which I had left a personal document as deposit. The door back into the place where they were issued initially was closed and we couldn't gain access until someone came out. We did ask at the main exit about them and were told we had to get back into the entrance hall which proved tricky but we did manage it eventually.

Due to the tour being €25 euro each and not having the ability to get an audio guide we opted out and had to demand a refund.

I’ve never seen a place like this in my life. It’s a gorgeous, hand carved, polished wood, accusatory Doge frescoed, eyes following you, meandering chamber of stately horrors.",Dec 2019

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We missed this site on our first trip when we only had one day in Venice. Don't do that. Missing it will haunt you until you're able to return. Prioritize everything around it. Plan on 2hrs minimum, 3-4hrs better. Best advice: show up an hour before opening, take pictures of the Bridge of Sighs/San Marco, enter at 8:30am before anyone is there and tour for 2-3hrs, jump on a pre-booked Secret Itineraries Tour later in the day, then finish up by going back to anything you missed or want to see a second time.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Doges Palace, Venice, Italy :- Doge’s Palace was probably built between the 10th and 11th centuries on the basis of a fortified central core. This nucleus was constituted with a central body with towers in the corners forming one of the masterpieces of the Venetian Gothic. When the Doge’s Palace was built, it had a design similar to a castle, with towers in the corners as it was in a strategic point of access to the sea. With the pass of time, remodeling and fires, this majestic palace has become what we know today. Keep in mind that from this Palace, 120 doges directed the fate of the city of Venice for almost 1,000 years.

Currently, the Doge’s palace is a museum that offers exhibitions of great historical interest and is open to the public offering a wide variety of itineraries, including: Special tours of the ""Secret Itineraries of the Doge’s Palace"" and ""The hidden treasures of the doge"". The color of Doges palace changes depending upon the time of day. Venice is a city that does not know the meaning of ""low season"", so even to enter the Doge's Palace there is always a long line.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Words cannot describe the size and beauty of this palace. Besides frescos, wood carvings and pictures, there are antique relics (armor, weapons, etc.) and other amazing sculptures around the area to see.

Allow at least 3-4 hours if you intend to really look around, read descriptions, visit all the rooms and really take in your surroundings.

A few additional hints... 1) ""water shoes"" (during acqua alta) will need to be removed before going upstairs in the palace, 2) almost everything is indoors so worth going if the weather outside is poor, and 3) we didnt get the audio tour (just used Rick Steve's) and theres plenty to read to keep one up-to-speed with where you are, etc.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Mid-October must be a good time to go. Went to the palace about 10 AM, waited only about 10 minutes in the buy-tickets-now line. If you're a senior, great deal - only 13 Euros entrance. Glad I opted not to buy ""skip the line"" tickets. Not near as crowded as summer, plenty of room for a good view of everything. Beware - you MUST check backpacks and there are a LOT of stairs. I have bad knees and walk with a cane but I survived, go slow and steady. Someone passing me noted there was an elevator but I never saw it or any sign of it. Also a great photo op from inside the Bridge of Sighs looking out at the lagoon and all the tourists taking pictures of the bridge. Also nice pictures of the lagoon from above from the upper palace windows. Real opulence that it's impossible to describe but definitely worth seeing!

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"Number one complaint (and I'm usually not that American-centric), but no one but the guide for our English speaking tour (who I'll get to later), spoke ANY English. When you arrive at the entrance, the guards are unable (or perhaps unwilling) to communicate information as to where to go. Considering the large segment of Venetian tourists who are English speaking (Americans, Brits, Kiwis, Aussies, etc), they should learn words like ""where"" or ""how."" Barring this, smile and be kind. Of course I tried to communicate in my basic Italian, but they were rude and unresponsive, even as I repeatedly said ""Dove,"" ""per favore"" and ""grazie.""
We almost missed our tour because we were waved away when we tried to submit what I thought were the tickets that I purchased on line. We thought the woman at the gate was telling us we were too early, but another American clued us in that we needed to turn in the paperwork in the adjacent office to receive actual tickets. This scenario was played out several times while we watched. Maybe some genius could post a sign in English in the window at the gate so everyone would understand that the piece of paper we received on line when we purchased our tickets ahead of time was not a ticket, even though it had a barcode on it. Obviously, it was a common tourists' error and a sign would have solved the problem quickly and easily. When we finally made it inside we were chided by the guide because we still had our shoe protectors on (the square was flooded). Once she started the tour, she refused to speak up so everyone could hear her, even after I asked her to (I got a glare).
Rudeness by staff in the important venues here was a recurring theme.
The actual palace was interesting, but once the tour was over and we were on our own, the signage was non-existent, in Italian only, or unclear. Most of the time, there was no one to ask for directions, or the people we asked spoke absolutely no English. I came away from this excursion with a very negative view of Venice and it's people (although it's doubtful any of these people actually live in Venice).
It's kind of a must if you're in Venice to tour the Doge's Palace, and we decided to do the Secret Itinerary Tour because it had the best reviews, but it wasn't cheap and the experience was not great.

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"As far as architectural sights are concerned, the Doge's Palace left a lot to be desired. I was on a self-guided tour and would allow that it may have been more interesting to have been on a guided tour.

There are a number of very large rooms, but the decoration was more overwrought than tasteful and interesting. If your time in Venice is limited, I suggest skipping Doge's Palace. St. Mark's Basilica next door is a thousand times more worthwhile as an example of fine architecture and design.

If you do decide to tour through the Doge's Palace on your own, be aware that the one-way tour path takes you through every square foot of the prison, a time consuming, boring, and, frankly, claustrophobic experience. Our group of four was only about half-way through the prison when we began to walk quickly looking for the exit and wishing we had bailed out before getting committed (you can't reverse course as the passageways are too narrow to permit two-way traffic).

If you have a backpack, you will need to check it inside the entrance before going upstairs. The bathrooms tend to have long lines, so don't wait until the call of nature is trending toward ""urgent"".

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"This palace is definitely worth a visit. We did not prebook and were lucky enough when we arrived at 1pm that there was no queue.

There is little furniture, but apparently this is due to the fact that each doge left his furniture to his family. The painting in the Council room is the largest in the world. It was great to be able to go around on our own, although we did rent an audio guide which covered every room.

Also able to cross the Bridge of Sighs, which takes its name from sighs of despair, depression and desolation. The small covered bridge connects the Doge’s Palace to the Courts of Justice and the dungeons.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"The Doge's palace stands right next to St. Mark's Basilica. A visit to this palace cum museum is a thorough immersion in Venetian art, Gothic architecture and the history of the Venetian Republic.

The palace was constructed as the Doge's (supreme authority of the state) residence and the grandeur is representative of the riches. The staircases are ornate; the waiting rooms, halls and the chambers bedecked with breathtaking art and the dungeons separated by a water way but connected by the iconic ""Bridge of Sighs"".

Access to the Bridge of Sighs is included in the admission. The bridge juxtaposes the regal splendor of the palace against the sombre mirthless prison cells. A tour of the prison quarters is highly recommended.

I spent over 3 hours here, and while the entry at 25 euros per head is a little steep, this definitely should be on your things to do in Venice itinerary.

For those short on time or the budget conscious, i recommend that they at least get a good look at the Carta gate right next to the basilica, which once was the main entrance to the palace.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"This Palace is steeped in history. Yes, you can walk through without a guide and see everything. However, unless you've spent time immersing yourself beforehand in Venetian history, you won't understand what you are seeing or it's significance.
Crowds gather in the halls, the ornate staircases, the waiting rooms, and the descent over the Bridge of Sighs as there is so much beauty to see and take in. The Palace interior is absolutely among the most magnificent we've seen in Europe, so much to absorb. But most seem to visit without knowing what they are seeing or its importance, having no knowledgeable guide with them. Instead, I suggest you try to absorb the history, not just see the buildings and grounds, to get the full effect of this place and maximize your experience. Engage a knowledgeable tour guide who will do that for you and, in my opinion, is worth the cost of their expertise.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Doges Palace is just behind St Mark's Basilica and if you have limited time, definitely put this on your must do list. With a rich history and a comprehensive artwork collection this is a superb experience for Venice. Cost is 25 euro per adult, and while expensive for those on a budget, I'd rather do this over any of the other things in Venice. The palace saw justice administration and senators wrote much of the law at the time. They claim to have very little trouble from the 13th century forward, but their extensive prison attached and their impressive execution rate, one would question their claims! The prison attached is included in the ticket price and is a sombre place indeed. As you go through look for the 'Bridge of Sighs,' so named because prisoners to be executed caught their last glimpse of Venice and sighed at the sight, on their way to their deaths. The artwork contained here is superb and the justice rooms are ornate, to say the least, built on the back of the massive silver resources of the time. The entire visit, if you read the exhibits and artwork would easily take 5 hours. There is lots of stair climbing and walking, so wear very comfortable shoes. There are very few places to sit and staff can be over the top and quite rude if you get too close to read the exhibits (one older woman was scolded for doing nothing wrong, but leaning in to read a description - the staff are very rude, proprietary and ungracious, especially considering they're at a major tourist Mecca and they hover, untrusting, around the entire palace in swarm numbers). There appears only one set of toilet amenities so there was always a very large queue at them when we walked past.

The ""self-guided"" entrance leads you from room to room and floor to floor with the art, the gold and the room sizes just getting more and more impressive. The one thing I wanted to understand was the ""politics"" of the place, in that there seemed to be so many rooms set aside for particular groups to make laws, judge wrong-doers and condemn them to the prison...handily attached to that room via the Bridge of Sighs!

We were there on a particularly miserable day n October, where think everyone else was partly there just to shelter from the rain! My wife - however - was on a mission to completely overload me with ""culture"" and ""art""...which the Doge's Palace provides in the bucketful.

I was more interested in the Bridge of Sighs and the Prisons (also part of the self-guided tour)!

However, the advertised closing time was 7pm, so I had carefully timed things so as to have a few minutes in the bookshop and to go slowly down to the courtyard, and it turned out the shop had already cashed up at quarter to, and I was ushered swiftly and firmly (although politely) to the exit at ten to, with the attendant saying they needed to make everything secure. As my ticket is a one-time-only entrance, I can't go back tomorrow without paying another 25 euros. They could have avoided me leaving disgruntled if they either a) did their locking up after 7pm or b) advertised their closing time as 6:45.

The building itself is vast and well maintained, don’t forget to look up at the amazing ceilings in the main palace.
Not quite the same level of luxury in the prison cells though - very clear difference between those with money & power and those down on their luck.
Good value, and we booked ahead, so straight through at the tills.
Could be a bit dull for younger travellers though.

The highlight has got to be walking across the Bridge of Sighs to the Prison, where there were only about 4 other visitors. A very spooky place to be on your own; in the lowest levels of the prison; as the light faded outside and we scampered up and back across the bridge.

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"In order to avoid the crowds waiting to enter the Doge’s Palace my wife and I chose to visit in the late afternoon when there was no line. We entered about 5:30 and the Palace supposedly was to remain open until 7:00.

The Palace is magnificent with a larger number of beautiful rooms than I was expected. The wall coverings and paintings were magnificent.

Unfortunately the Palace is not well lit and it can sometimes be hard to see the room decorations. In addition, although supposed to remain open until 7:00, the Palace floor where the Doge and his family lived closed almost immediately after we entered about 5:30 and we were not able to see this area.

I enjoyed my visit but I would suggest that you enter when it will be daylight for your entire visit so that you get the maximum enjoyment During your time here.

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"I had been looking forward to enjoying this palace. We arrived and there was not one person in line. There were 3 workers talking to each other behind counter and not one acknowledged us. We stood waiting for someone to look up and let us know the cost. After waiting a few minutes a women turned and looked at us as if we interrupted her chat. She did not say anything so we asked the cost. She asked how old her daughter was (16) and just rang in the amount of 63 euro. We were surprised at the high cost as we had been told it is 18 euros for adult. And 1/2 price for under 17. We just paid the price and started to go in but went the wrong way as again we received no direction or assistance and there was even another lady sitting doing nothing just watching us. We made our way to where there were headsets. We again assumed wrong thinking they were included in price. No one acknowledged us here either. We stood waiting and another family saw how we were being ignored and came to chat. They said they paid 39.00 euro for the 3 of them and got headsets. They showed us their tickets with each ticket marked at 13 euro. We felt we got ripped off so went back to beginning where the original women were still talking. We said excuse us as she again would not acknowledge us. She turned to look at us...again no ciao or pleasantries. We said we felt we had paid too much and she escalated her voice immediately and pointed at sign on italian . It did not go well. So sorry we visited. This was to be the highlight.

We toured the entire facility including inside the Bridge of Sighs and the cells where prisoners were held. It was very interesting. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to climb numerous stairs. Remember much of Venice was built long before elevators were used so walking up & down is a requirement.

Each room had its own history and played a part in the judicial and regal proceedings of the time, along with the connection with the prison next door and the ""Bridge of Sighs"". being able to tread the pathway of prisoners of the past provided insight into a prisoner's last glimpse of freedom before being committed to their sentence.",Oct 2019

We then had a good coffee and cake in the café, with decent prices. This was followed by a 1,5 tour - Hidden Treasures - with a great guide who showed us the prison incl. the inside of the Bridge of Sighs, torture chamber and cell of Casanova (before he escaped).

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"I was in Venice last week, Oct 2019 and really loved it. Of course a visit to the Doge's Palace has to be on the list. I also hired the audio guide for 5e - be aware you need ID which they will hold on to. If you are into art of the period I imagine this must be heaven for you - Titan, Rubens etc, the place is chock full of spectacular old masters. However there isn't much else. Almost no furniture to speak of. I found the audio guide extremely dry and dull. It gave no local colour to a building that must have a huge fascinating history to tell.

I waited 50 years to cross the Bridge of Sighs, so am pleased I did. The prisons were interesting but again no information about what went on there. The prison was surprisingly big, I imagined half a dozen cells, and there may have been 50.

I prefer the more human stories of a building and am not a huge art fan although the ceiling decoration in a couple of rooms was certainly impressive. Hubby rightly didn't visit and he would have been bored rigid. I'm glad I saw it but it's not something I'll ever visit again.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"The only complaint I have about this place was the walk from the train station. It was far and don't kid yourself sore feet will be the result. I highly recommend taking a water taxi to get there and just shorten the whole walking thing. Once we found the main square I was amazed at how many people were there before us (930 AM) and there was already a formidable line at the palace. Just the night before I purchased advance tickets to ""jump"" the line which I HIGHLY recommend as there were at least 200 people in line already. We waited maybe 5 minutes and went in make sure to grab an auto guide and start your tour. We were there 3 hours and picture taking is allowed with no flash. The tour is completely self guided, YEAH! The rooms are very sumptuous and gilding is everywhere! The audio guide is extremely informative. My only suggestion for the folks that run this place would be to suggest you leave your kids elsewhere as some were running amok! This is not a playground people!

The Triumphal Quadriga should leave you very impressed if the feat of architectural engineering of the building is not enough. I am not an expert but I think some of the paintings dating back to 1310 may have been touched up.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We bought a combined ticket for the Ducal Palace, The Corre Museums and 3 choir route churches. This was for the quicker entry but in truth the day we went there I'm not sure it made much difference although we did not have to wait long.

The place is impressive outside and inside the walls and ceilings of room after room are filled with the works of the more famous Venetian painters.

The private appartments were given over to a terrific exhibition 'From Tiziano to Rubens' with some wonderful Van Dycks thrown in for good measure.

The rest of the palace is worth a whole day's perambulations taking in those enormous Tintorettos and Veronese' and onto the famous Bridge of Sighs which was was genuinely different and interesting leading to the prisons and dungeons.

It is a tourist cliche of course but it is a sight that should be high on the to do list if in Venice. Not only worth the time but the money as well and that can be a rarity in this city.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Make sure you buy a jump the queue ticket online or get there when it first opens. It really is amazing. Be warned there are two more levels of the dungeons across the Bridge of Sighs, so save your legs and just head back over if you're not too bothered. There are some stunning views from the Armoury windows. Toilet queues are long as there are only three female ones, so leave plenty of time.",Oct 2019

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We did self guided tour with skip the line. Well worth it. It is a beautiful place. Get your waking shoes and enjoy. The prison under neath is astonishing. The open court yard, the architecture just all of it. It’s a must see. Right in the middle of St Marks square",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"Although we bought tickets on line we were lucky enough to visit at a ""quiet""time. The spaces , rooms are enormous, the frescos were many and told such a story. Because all the rooms are bare of furniture it is difficult to get the feel of the place although there is so much to see perhaps furnishings would detract from the paintings.if it was crowded I think it would be difficult to take your time as we did and to savour the beauty of it all.",Sep 2019

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We were on a pre booked guided tour to skip the line - essential even in October. The ceilings are magnificent as are the paintings furniture. The history surrounding the palace is incredible and everywhere you look there are reminders of the massive influence that the Doge had on life in Venice.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,We took this tour recommended in Rick Steve;s book. I had been there on a regular tour before. This was very interesting as it was where the prisoners were kept. Mostly all wooden and no fancy anything. It was up a total of 4 floors so lots of stairs and the ceilings were low. Area were narrow. We saw Casanovas cell. Guide was excellent. Then afterwards you got to go into the palace and finish the tour. I liked that we were able to go by other cells and inside the bridge of sighs which is not a romantic place but a path to the court from the jail.,Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"I have visited many times and I always purchase my tickets online. The queues can be horrendous even off peak season.

A must see when in Venice.",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Our guide (which I highly recommend you consider) took us through the Palace and in the off-the-grid locations such as the prison cells and back corridors. If you really want to get a feel for the history of Venice, this is the way to go. It is hard to believe that such a small area has so much history. Make sure to hit St. Mark’s square at night, it is stunning.",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"You have to see the Doge's Place. My wife and I were captivated by the art, the intricacy of the architecture and the beauty. It's huge on the inside and the tour kept going and going.",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Piazza San Marco is the magnet for all tourists. I would not go in the summer but at the end of September, there were fewer folks lining up to go into Doge's. I imagine also that these spots would be terribly hot in the summer.",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"This place is just amazing, I got a crick in my neck looking up at the stunning artwork on the ceiling.
Every room you go through will feel you with awe. Lots to see so allow plenty of time.
We crossed the bridge of sigh into the prisons this was very emotional to imagine what it must have been like for a condemned prisoner.
A must see in Venice",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"Obviously, the DP is a 5. But I took off a point because the audio guide was so insubstantial. Definitely visit the Doge’s Palace, but do arrange a good, human-guided tour if you really want to understand anything about the building, Venetian history, or the art of the place.",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We were not interested in standing in line for an hour or so to get into St. Marks church, and getting in here was as easy as walking up, buying the ticket and walking in. It was worth the time we spent here",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,Nicolette was our guide and she was awesome. We learned so much more about the history than we ever could touring the palace on our own. We did the early morning tour so we could do the Basilica tour later. We enjoyed Nicolette so much that we requested her for that tour too.,Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,We chose to self guide our way around the Palace. You can pay for headphones but a lot of people were listening via their phones. The upper rooms have various art works on display from around the world in visiting exhibitions. The walk through the prison cells was interesting as was the walk over and back via the Bridge of Sighs. Organised tours were everywhere and areas were very busy at times. Take your time a few hours could be spent enjoying the works on display.,Sep 2019

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,A great Palace to see great history and well presented. Certainly worth the visit. A bit expensive for food and very crowded you need to be aware of what you will face.,Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,The rooms and architecture are stunning - although they are quite empty - there is not much to see apart from the paintings on the walls and frescoes on the ceilings.,Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"What an impressive place, history seeps through every inch of the grandiose building. Im glad I was never a prisoner in the lower cells, walking across the bridge of sighs made me shiver, thinking of how they must have felt, looking through the patterned frames at their beautiful Venice for the last time. the palace itself is just so beautiful, but after a while everything looks the same. there was an expo on Belgian masters, showing beautiful impressive works, a nice extra. Im happy to be able to say ""been there, done that"", it was worth it!!!",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"Each room of the Doge Palace was filled with beautiful old-world art by Masters of the time. Paintings adorned the walls and most of the ceilings in each room. Just the effort to paint these surfaces must have been challenging! We enjoyed our travels from room to room very much UNTIL....we were tired and decided to leave the building. We followed what seemed a logical path to EXIT, but wound up going through the jail portion of the building with NO VISIBLE EXIT and a padlocked Exit! We backtracked, with several DEAD ENDS. Finally, with help from another lost visitor, we were able to EXIT the Doge Palace. I don't know if this was someones wierd sense of humor, but we DID NOT find it funny. We were quite tired by this time. I believe the EXIT should be clearly marked in such a vast building!

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"Doges Palace was my favourite tour, we were a tad concerned as we didn’t have ID allowing us to hire the radio set and ear piece, trust me you really don’t need it!!! This place is spectacular, there’s enough information in each room to read, we spent 2hrs walking through taking our time in each room, walking over the Bridge of Sighs, WOW this is history personified, not sure we would have spent as much time here if we had managed to hire the radio set, we had checked the price of this tour prior to our visit, it states €13-€20, however it actually cost us €50 this was a bit disappointing, fortunately we really enjoyed Doge’s Palace so didn’t feel ripped off.
Negative point- the staff member hiring the radio sets, she was rude, no explanation offered as to why we couldn’t hire radio sets, she just pointed to a sign and turned her back on us 😱.

Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"We stopped here as part of a tour. As reference, I am not really a fan of art, so that helps to understand where I am coming from here. It was fine to see and the bathrooms there were free. Neat to see the old gondola. I think we may have accessed the Bridge of Sighs from in here -- not 100% sure since two buildings we saw at similar times are a bit blurred for me. My guess is kids and those who don't like art won't want to spend much time here. I would have rather spent my time in other spots around Venice...people watching, shopping, sitting in a piazza to people watch, etc.",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,This palace has ornate ceilings walls and - well everything. Everything in the palace is interesting to look at and the art is really spectacular. If you go here I recommend the audio tour.,Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,Beautiful palace with an unbelievable amount of gold guild. Lovely historic amazing oil paintings. Scary to think of this is a place where he were imprisoned. Casanova had his own cell and escaped. However we did not go to see it. You really need a lot of time to see everything in it a day at least,Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"If the Basilica San Marco was underwhelming, then the Palazzo Ducale (Doges Palace) was quite the opposite ... magnificent in all its opulent, gilded rooms that underlined the superiority of the Venetian Empire to all nations.
Magnificent paintings abound, many by Tintoretto & one you can't miss is ""Il Paradiso"" which dominates the main hall in the Doges Palace.
The Bridge of Sighs - viewed from inside - is really unique , as are the extensive dungeons which are intriguing & conjure up impressions of prisoners due for trial.",Aug 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Try to book in advance and you will skip the line. Also, try to book the Itinerary segreti tour in advance for a bit of fun history of the place, the story of Casanova and a few secret places. It's just 3 euros more than the entrance ticket.",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"It is a pity to come to Venice and not to visit the Doge’s Palace . This place is like a journey through time, were you can find Venice’s history .
I recommend you to take the audio guide during your visit and also allocate 2-3 hour for the tour because it is fascinating.
Best hours to visit are early in the morning or during the lunch time :)",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,This palace the best attraction in Venice and it must be visited. Unfortunately there are a lot of tourist here but in September when we visited palace there were a few tourists.,Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"It is really beyond what we think of as a government building, I would recommend the secret itinerary tour to get more background on the impressive building, also, you see Casanova’s jail cell. There is one HUGE room which is amazing and worth the admission.",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"We booked Viator’s Walking Tour and Doge's Palace Guided Tour with the meeting point for the tour being under the blue clock in St. Mark’s Square. Easy to find landmark, but whilst they advised to show up 15 minutes before the tour start, the staff didn’t show up until 5 minutes before.

We had only 1 day In Venice so we wanted to cram as much into it as possible starting off with a gondola ride followed by lunch and then this tour. Word of advice: don’t aim to do too much unless you’re extremely fit. Seeing Venice involves PLENTY of walking! And in summer, it is sweltering with little or no shade so you get very hot and tired easily!

We had done an all-day Florence tour with 8 hours walking on the previous day so we thought Venice would be a piece of cake with these 2 tours! Wrong!

After more than 2 hours walking around the Doge’s Palace on top of all the walking from Rialto bridge and walking around Piazza San Marco, we were beat! Our feet wouldn’t carry us another step once we exited the Doge’s Palace, and so we skipped the Venice Walking tour portion and bade farewell to our guide.

There are a few staircases in Doge’s Palace to climb, very long corridors and barely a moment to sit and rest your weary legs, not to mention the meandering at the end through the prison on uneven ground, so our feet had had it!

The Palace interiors are only cooled by the open windows, so after 2pm in the afternoon, it is sweltering inside! Make sure to walk with a cold bottle of water!

It’s an amazing tour with so much information to astound, learn and to digest! Thus, doing anything more would have been total overload on our brains as well.

Highly recommend this tour! PLUS: There are so many great spots to get multiple Christmas-card worthy snaps!

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"It was interesting to get some insight into the lives and lifestyle of the Doges of Venice. The buildings, architecture and art are truly something to behold.

Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Fantastic place, the art and history is incredible; the additional bonus of an art exhibition by Tintoretto, Titian, and other Renaissance masters was great! Note: takes longer than you think, at least 2 hours without any of the add-ons. A 'must see'",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"As with most of Venice, this was an interesting piece of history, ruined by overcrowding and walking tours. We walked through some rooms just to get away from the guides and their ducklings. The art exhibition about Rubens and Antwerp was nicely done, and the prison is great. They could do with putting up more information down there so tourists can see which prisoners were held etc. I would recommend getting the tickets online so you can bypass the MASSIVE queue",Oct 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,5.0,"Tried my luck at 4pm on a Wednesday and there was no queue whatsoever. You can't buy a ticket just for the Doge's Palace; the default is the St Mark's Museum Pass, which I duly bought as I prefer not to do guided tours, but to be honest, the price was worth it for this place alone. The architecture and rooms are absolutely magnificent, most of the latter with sumptuously ornate gilded ceilings, and I got to walk across the Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs) and take a picture from the prisoners' point of view - one of my holiday goals. The café (Ristòart) was good too - the Tiziano sandwich was absolutely delicious. This place is well worth its reputation.",Sep 2019

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"Booked tickets before journey so we went straight in with no fuss. The place is stunning. We didn't get a guide book but there are plenty of information boards,around in 3 or 4 languages and you can listen to some of the guided tours as well. The restaurant/cafe could be better organized, bit of a language problem on both sides,they were trying to tell us we needed a table first and couldn't but hot drinks and food at the counter, easier said than done as it was full as it was raining and they had closed a large room with more seating for a very small guided tour,a bit chaotic. I would recommend a visit to this attraction.",Sep 2019
Italy,Doge's Palace,3.0,"This was our second visit to the Doge's Palace, the first being 15 years ago. As expected little had changed, but we were disappointed to find the Apartments were currently closed for refurbishment. There was no suggestion of this when we bought the tickets. As the interiors of the apartments were some of the highlights of the previous visit, it was a shame to miss them. I would definitely recommend the audio tour if you visit as it brings much of the history of the palace to life. Also as a tip, check the charges at the cafe if you are going to eat there. The initial price quoted us for three soft drinks and a packet of crisps was 20 euros more than it turned out to be when I asked the person serving to check again. It is also worth noting that the advertised prices are for take away, if you sit down the prices are higher - we knew that but there was still the attempt to significantly overcharge us. If you are combining this visit with the museums, have your snacks and drinks at the museum, much cheaper and a very pleasant environment.

You also learn about the sociocultural history of Venice and its legal structures, and get to visit the prison cells and the famous bridge of sighs.

Would have liked to do the “Secret Itineraries” tour which sounded good but was booked up when I looked a few days before. However, each room has a sign describing its purpose and history and audio guides are available so you can still wander at your own pace enjoying the opulence and grandeur and imagine yourselves as part of the lucky aristocracy who kept themselves in power for so long. Or more unfortunately, a prisoner enjoying their last view of Venice from the Bridge of Sighs.

Italy,Doge's Palace,4.0,"We bought out tickets online to skip the queue,we went early as it opened,and had time to see and read about the exhibits.You can rent out an audio guide but need to leave a form of ID which is returned when you return the guide.The guide is in the form of a cell phone worn around the neck by lanyard,you press the corresponding button at each location.The Palace is magnificent but unlike stately homes is not furnished,it's all about what's on the wall and ceilings .You wind your way around culminating a visit to the prison via The Bridge of Sighs.The bridge is tiny and you cannot linger on it as an official shouts you to move through at haste but I guess given the volumes of visitors it's the only way it would work.The palace is full of steps and uneven floors in the prison area,not for the infirm.By midday the palace was very busy,but if you love art and history it's worth it.

Be aware: arrive as soon as you possibly can. We got there for 8am (opening time) and enjoyed a calm walk around - it was busy but fine - no waiting and very civilised. However, as we were leaving, swarms upon swarms of tour groups from cruise ships were ascending and I was so relieved that we had avoided the nightmare; the site has many steps and is uneven, so to have to manoeuvre the site with so many people would have been uncomfortable and would have spoilt the visit.

Mark my words, avoid peak times to ensure your enjoyment and safety and pre book your tickets so that you can skip the queues.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"It was incredibly windy when we visited but so worth it. Would not advise visiting after a rain -- as it was, the stone paths were smooth and slick from years of wear. We got tickets from the side entrance -- didn't check out the front entrance but we were told the side entrance would be less crowded. Even so, there was a line. If you go to the front of the line, you can download a QR code tht allows you to buy tickets on your phone and skip the line. Recommended! The site is huge. Never realized how big it is. When I think of the Acropolis, I think of the main structure ... not all the other structures on the premises. They are doing a lot of renovations so lots of scaffolding and other equipment on site but well worth a visit.

If time permits, visit twice. First to get the idea, and second, after buying a guidebook and reading it, to consolidate. If no time, buy the guidebook beforehand.

I went recently on a Sunday morning with the intention of visiting the Acropolis Museum in the afternoon. By mistake, I entered the wrong line and ended again in the Acropolis Park. I had no idea that the Acropolis had more than one entrance and one of them is very close to the museum so it is very easy to get confused and get in the wrong place.

Italy,Acropolis,3.0,"TL;DR version: As one other reviewer posted here, visiting the Acropolis is more stressful than it is enjoyable, romantic, or fun.

While the Acropolis is beautiful and certainly worth the effort to climb and enjoy, the staff there make it incredibly difficult for visitors to do so. The flow of traffic is somewhat difficult to navigate, and many visitors have audio tours in their ears. When they happen to wander in the wrong direction, the staff attempt to steer them back on course and have to do so quite loudly or harshly — atop of patch of very slippery marble. Disappointingly, the staff try their hardest to control the way people take photos, and this is where we ran into trouble. A rather overzealous woman stationed at the southeast corner of the Parthenon shouted at us from across the marble field to delete our photos “out of respect for the site.” Unfortunately, the fact that she had screamed so loudly to us meant that every single person in the area had heard the commotion and turned to watch the (non-)drama unfold.

After we approached the woman (it took a minute or so to actually walk over to where she was), we asked her “Which photo was the problem so that we know not to do it again.” In the end, after reviewing our photos, she apologized (we had not crossed a barrier, we did not pick anything up, and were not climbing anything; it should also be noted that pictures may be taken of all the structures without flash). It made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience, and we departed from the top of the hill not shortly after (due in part to simply being tired).

Unfortunately, it is now painfully clear the awful reputation of the guards at the Parthenon is one they deserve to have — they are, for all intents and purposes, mall cops. Not even one minute after our collision with this woman, we heard her whistle again at another group of people. Athens has been an absolute joy so far, home to some incredibly nice people, and all of our interactions at other attractions, supermarkets, and retail shops have been lovely. I’ve been able to practice my Greek as much as I can, and I’ve loved every second of it. It is a shame that the staff at the Acropolis are so hyper-focused on fighting the wrong battles. I saw many children climbing the ruins, people slipping on marble, and elderly persons in need of assistance with no guards around to offer any. Also, the rather large guided tours clog the entryways (particularly at the Propylaea), making the Acropolis a rather precarious site. In my eyes, efforts could certainly be made to improve safety over policing those who had not been doing anything wrong. If you are expecting the same level of kindness or professionalism one would see at any museum across the EU, at the Colosseo, Palatino, Les Invalides, or the Catacombs of Paris, forget about it.

Italy,Acropolis,3.0,"The view and buildings are impressive. What I personally missed was the storytelling in the information that was provided. Many of the signs were (too) literally translated from Greek, which didn't make them really pleasurable to read. There were some guided tours, but they weren't advertised at the ticket office.

When I visited there was no waiting line, so at least around this time of year it's not necessary to buy a skip the line ticket or anything like that.

Tip: buy the combination ticket (€30) which allows acces to various archeological sites. When you're under 25 the ticket is free.

Secondly get a licensed guide. We had a gentlemen named Angelos Kokkaliaris, who I recommend very strongly. A guide will really make this place pop. If you're not a total history buff, a lot of what your looking at is just piles of rocks.
In summary, this was absolutely a bucket list visit. The site is overwhelming. You really feel like your walking through history. And craftsmenship that went into this temple, 1500 to 2000 years ago is nothing short of mind blowing. This is a must do.

Italy,Acropolis,4.0,"Obviously a must see. We followed the advice abs series at 08:30 (its open form 8-8) until October. It’s similar to the Forum in Rome with temples for the gods. It used to be a walled city and considering that’s it’s built on a hill makes the architecture even more impressive. The views are stunning and stretch to the port. There is nowhere to buy food or drink but there are watering taps and toilets at the top. Check before you drink as the heat turns the water into bath water temperatures.
We entered from the main gate and exited through the theatre (not the amphitheatre which is still in use) and we’re greater by a string of restaurants with cold water and cold beer.

Unfortunately the experience was tarnished by a NATO delegation doing a media tour. There was no prior notification ( I understand that for security reasons but simply stating that it’s open later would suffice.) We arrived at half past 8 and had to wait in the searing sunshine until 11:00 without any access to toilets as they were also locked, before the last VIP’s sauntered down the path to the exit to much boos and hand clapping. One delegates comment summed the NATO up perfectly “you learn to ignore them”.

There is a ton of walking and it is very, very hot so make sure you have water, sunscreen, or are fully covered.

Pro-tip: You can buy tickets to many of the monuments in the city at any of the monuments--Acropolis is the most crowded, so avoid the lines and buy your ticket elsewhere so you can just walk right in.

Italy,Acropolis,4.0,"Went there just after the opening in teh morning and the lines were quite long - lucily I bought the tickets online which actually meant I skipped the line and went straight in. A bit crowded inside. It's a nice place, but don't expect the ruins to be something magical - at least for an average visitor. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool place, but my favourite thing about the Acropolis were actually the vies of it from various places around the city - Aeropagus Hill and Panathenaic stadium.",Aug 2021
Italy,Acropolis,1.0,crap - over staffed and inaccurate info. the last entry time does not match online info so we travelled across town with kids to be refused entry.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"From the moment I was in contact with Faye﻿ about my upcoming trip to Greece, she was extremely knowledgeable and accessible in helping me plan where I wanted to go in Greece. (Rick Steve’s trip was cancelled due to Covid). Every suggestion and recommendation she had was excellent and helped me navigate efficiently and joyfully through Athens. From her extensive knowledge of archeology and history, she fast- tracked all the important information that I needed to know without reading every placard in the Acropolis Museum. It can be overwhelming to be in Athens in the summer heat, but enthusiastically and energetically, Faye lead me to the great sites and her guidance was invaluable!! I would beyond recommend this classy lady to guide me wherever I wanted to explore in Greece! Do yourself a favor and just trust her guidance. She knows what she is doing! From finding a shady spot at the Acropolis so she could go into more detail about a marble sculpture- to how to get to the airport: Faye is who you want by your side in Greece. I would highly recommend this guide.

We booked with Dimitris Papandrou – knowledgable and understanding about my slow mobility – we found him at the entrance. There was a small line, maybe 20 people, at the ticket booth. We went right when it opened to try and avoid the heat of the midday. Be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen! It is an uphill climb, but it doesn't feel like one as our guide kept us enthralled with historical facts and history lessons – most of which is not on the reading plaques around the artifacts. The view is spectacular and the history is remarkable. Well worth the climb and remember to take your time and soak all the ancient history in.

From our hotel it looks as if the climb up the hill will be a long, hot tiring one, but with our private guide (which I highly recommend), it was quick and easy and painless. Be sure to wear a hat, sunscreen, and take a bottle of water. Thanks to COVID, and going early in the morning, there was no line at the ticket booth. We walked right up and right in! The ruins are breathtaking, and so beautiful. Be sure to take your camera! Sadly, there were those with no respect, who were climbing over the ruins, standing on top of the ruins, and generally not being their best selves, but luckily the crowds were not bad before noon. As we were leaving to walk to our lunch in Plaka, the crowd had begun to pick up quite a bit, as did the heat.

Italy,Acropolis,4.0,"Loved seeing the Acropolis. Some tips. Go in the morning - it does get hot and there is no shade. Also, they advised us that a few days prior they had closed the site from 1-5pm because there was a heat advisory. There were guides outside the Acropolis offering tours and we joined up with another couple to pay 20 euros per person. We found it well worth it.The ticket for the Acropolis is 20 euros, but for 30 euros you can get access to a few other sites around the city. We did the 30 euros and regretted it as we didn't end up using it (we only had a day in Athens). Also, it doesn't include access to the Acropolis museum (which we wrongly assumed) and that's an additional 10 euros. The museum is really great - nicely designed space to learn more about the history and see the original artifacts.

Although there is quite a bit of restoration going on, it doesn't detract from the visit. It's good to see they are doing the work.

The people came from all around the world.",Mar 2021
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"Setting out at sunrise along Athinas past Monastiraki and taken with the ever approaching vista on high, we arrived before the 8am opening.

A gorgeous sunny morning in low season made it a perfect time for visiting, having it practically to ourselves.

Entering through the magnificent soaring Propylaia we admired the gorgeous Temple of Athena Nike, constructed in the 420s BCE to celebrate Athenian victories over the Persians.

Even though the Erechtheion Caryatids are replicas, it is a great sight infused with myth and mystery. Later we saw the graceful originals in the brilliant Acropolis Museum.

A Statue of Athena Promachos was a striking monument in antiquity. It honoured the Protectress in gratitude for victories in the Persian Wars and stood about 9 metres high.

What can be seen today of the Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia comprises elements of foundations and walls. It is likely that the Cult of Artemis commenced on the Acropolis in the 6th century BCE.

Walking around the Parthenon was marvellous yielding many fabulous views of the stunning Temple. The Pentelic marble changed appearance as the morning light progressed. It was easy picking out the modern segments in the columns, all part of preservation and renovation that has been underway for decades.

On the way to the Theatre of Dionysus we first gazed at the wonderful Herod Atticus Odeon, where many famous artists have performed, including Maria Callas in 1957.

On the route we saw some notable remains of ancient remains - Stoa of Eumenes II, Byzantine Cistern and Temple of Asclepius and Hygieia.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"My husband and I visited the Acropolis as a day trip whilst on a cruise and it definitely a beautiful sight.
The stunning architecture with plenty of other ruins to see, plus beautiful views out across the land and to sea make for a great day out.
We had to queue in the heat and then it's quite a climb up fairly slippery marble amongst massive crowds so maybe better to see on a sightseeing bus (as my parents and sister did) if you're less moble.
There were lots of people (and we arrived around 10am) and it was quite disorganised getting up to the Acropolis but far more orderly getting down. However once you're up, the crowds don't seem quite so bad and people are happy to make space for photos. If you're in Athens, this is a must visit, particularly if you like architecture or history.

But my main reason for taking this tour is to see the Acropolis and that is where I stayed the most during this short stop over.

When I reached the Acropolis there was already a long queue for the tickets. It took me around 30 minutes to queue up and get tickets. After that we climbed the hilly steep path towards the Acropolis. Along the way I took photos of the view overlooking the city.

My trip to this place fulfilled my childhood dream of seeing the ruins that I only see in textbook and my history classes.

the fact that the Acropolis is in the middle of the city center and you can spot it from different locations it just give a special vibe to the city.
Make sure to have comfortable shoes!",Oct 2020
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"The most astounding piece of Ancient Greek history left with us and it does not disappoint.

Would 100% recommend going to the Acropolis museum before you go up as you learn everything there is to know about this magnificent structure and its history. This makes the difference from looking at an old marble monument to using your imagination looking at every Parthenon frieze with it telling a story.

The only downside was the scaffolding as they are doing restoration works however rather a Parthenon with scaffolding than no Parthenon at all.

We entered by the gates nearest to Acropoli metro station and got in for free as it was Oxi Day (28th Oct). We spent around 2 hours here but you can take as long or as short as you like.

The views of Athens once up there are incredible with sights of Piraeus and Glyfada on one side and the white washed walls of Athens all around on the other.

Please note that the attractions included on the €30 ticket are all FREE every Sunday between November - March. We would have paid the €20 entrance fee to see it though as it is just spectacular and a must if you are in Athens, it just so happened that the day we had planned to see it on was a Greek national holiday so we had saved €40 and counted our blessings!

The €30 combined ticket is definitely worth paying for if you are interested in the Temple of Zeus, the Acropolis Museum, the Archeological Museum and so on.

However if you are there to just see the Acropolis, go on a Sunday between November to March and spend the money you have saved on a meal in a local restaurant around the Acropolis and a well deserved drink!

*WHEELCHAIR USERS OR MOBILITY ISSUES PLEASE READ* ———

To finish I’d like to add that I had dislocated my knee during the week we were in Athens and still managed to hobble to the top with a good partner and a slow pace. There IS a lift for wheelchair access but it has been suspended as works for its replacement are in progress (this was emailed to me 4th November 2020). So please do email or ring in advance so you can plan ahead.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"So obviously the Acropolis was amazing but the main thing I want to talk about is the walk to the top.

A lot of the reviews make out the walk up to be a bit of a nightmare. I am very very unfit and it was a piece of cake. I was so over prepared, I brought my hiking shoes, gym leggings and a massive bottle of water and honestly It’s a gentle uphill stroll with a few steps here and there. I was honestly shocked when we got to the top.

If you are elderly or disabled I could see this being tough but I think it’s the same as walking up any steep road in Athens because it’s well staggered.

It might be different in the height of summer but it’s honestly nothing to over prep for. Do start from the Acropolis metro side though if you want a longer walk round to the top.

There is a lot of ongoing restoration work at the Acropolis which is interesting in itself, we spent around 3 hours there and walked miles up and down to the Parthenon, temple of Athena Nike, and various other temples mostly from 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD. Incredible amount of history here and you can just imagine yourself here a few thousand years ago. Really gives us an insight into how life might have been. The route around the site takes us around and down to the old theatre of Dionysus, which is well preserved from 500 years BC, which was really interesting and gave us an idea about cultural life around that time. The orchestra was an important part of performances even then, and apparently there was an annual festival for poets and musicians to show their talents in a competition. There was an example of a bust made in honour of one if the participants even though he didn't win, but must have been very good, Menendere. There were hundreds of seats (5000), in the auditorium, so the concerts must have been good. They listened to plays, comedies and tragedies and satire. ( I had never heard the word tragedian before!).

Familiar names performed here, such as Euripedes, Aristotle).

We opted for the audio-tour (with own smartphone as device) and although the tour is well prepared and in general very easy to understand, the COVID-caused new routings (walk on the right path) on some of the areas - and especially the top of the plateau with the Akropolis itself - deviated significantly from the flow of information and that was very confusing (as there is no option to select specific numbers according the attraction you’re in Front of you have to follow the one and only order of the lecturer). While this issue is understandable, it detracted quite a bit.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,The Acropolis of Athens and its monuments are universal symbols of the classical spirit and civilization and form the greatest architectural and artistic complex bequeathed by Greek Antiquity to the world. It’s one of the UNESCO world heritage. It’s €20 entrance fee for foreigners.,Oct 2020
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"I feel robbed and extremely sad that there're still companies like Get Your Guide which unprofessionally insult the consumer's trust.
I purchased a regular ticket to visit Acropolis, which resulted validated three days before. At the entrance, the security informed me that this unpleasant inconvenience happens often times when tickets get bought through Get Your Guide.

I called Get Your Guide five times and always received the same vague explanations. One time I've also trusted them when the customer service person promised me to send a new (hopefully valid) ticket. I was relieved...until I realized she sent me back the same invalid one, with the same booking reference and details. a complete mockery!

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens staying at the Grand Hyatt (Review to follow) and this morning we visited the Acropolis.

The conditions were ideal - a gorgeous Autumnal Day and very few (certainly by normal standards) other visitors. On arrival at the Payment Booth, we opted for the Adult 30 Euros Combined ticket which can not only be used to gain entry to a number of other Attractions (Ancient Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Kerameikos, Aristotle’s School, Olympieion & Roman Agora) but is valid for 5 days.

Although parts of the Acropolis resemble a Building site (and this has probably been the case for many years as so much more work remains to be done) this is a world class attraction and no visit to Athens can be regarded as complete without having witnessed this experience at firsthand. Believe me, there will never be a better time to do so than right now!!

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis is the centre of the ancient world and is still an amazing site with its impressive walls and containing the iconic Parthenon and other historical sites. Your approach up a series of ramps and steps to the main entrance with its partially restored Propylaea gives a sense of its importance. The Parthenon is the main attraction and is being systematically restored which means there are building works and scaffolding on parts of the structure. The Temple of Athena Nike and the Erechtheum are the other main extant buildings worthy of a visit. Fantastic views right across the city in all directions from the walls. Several sites around the slopes of the hill such as the two theatres are also worth a look. With the current restrictions there is a marked route around the Acropolis with marshals to guide you but with lower visitor numbers and no crowding this gives good separation and excellent views of all the monuments so this was a great time to visit.

We came at 6PM the site closed at 7PM but it was still nice and enough time to see it all. Only thing is that we been told rudely by the staff “you cannot pose here” which was so out of place because the reason people go there is to also take pictures even though the site was almost empty..

You are only allowed to bring in water so be warned as we brought some nice slushy drinks and then had to finish them before going in and the people who know your going to the Acropolis won't tell you that you cannot enter with the drinks they are selling.

Arrived early and found the south entrance which is closer to the metro line and museum. Steadier incline to the top with stunning views all round. Some slopes and steps so not wheelchair friendly and not great if you have walking difficulties. Not many hand rails. Due to covid one way system is in place.

The entrance was opposite the acropolis museum and I believe there is another entrance on the exit too.

No queues to buy the ticket , could also book tickets at the self ticket kiosk about 100meters before the main entrance.

It cost 20 euros for just the acropolis or 30 if you like to visit the other 6 sites offered in a 5 day period.

We downloaded the free audio from Rick Steves which is about an hour long. The first 20 minutes is a hot hike up to the theatre of Dionysus and then to the Propylaea.

Then through the Propylaea you will see the pantheon in front.

We were there at about 1030am and there we some shady spots. The status of the maidens in Erechtheum was beautiful.

Toward the far end is an amazing view point of the city of Athens. There was toilets half way up near the theatre of Dionysus as well as adjacent to the pantheon.

An amazing place! Wasn’t too crowded on Tuesday 15th September 2020!

It is very slippery and rocky so don't make the mistake I made wearing flatform wedges. You need trainers with grip or else you will slip. You have to climb over many rocks and steep slopes, so if you are afraid of heights make sure you have someone to hold your hand. We bought the €30 euro ticket to see all 5 sites which we didn't end up getting to due to the heat (we couldn't hack it lol). It was worth it though the sites are beautiful.

Italy,Acropolis,2.0,"The only time I've visited a major tourist site in Europe and made to feel very unwelcome, borderline unwanted.

The acropolis was, architecturally, stunning, the views were magnificent and the facilities were pretty good.However, I'd suggest management perhaps invest in some signage, or arrows to indicate the one way system and out of bounds areas, rather than instructing staff to shout at visitors for crossing invisible lines or moving in the wrong direction along lanes whith no visible dividing lines. Teaching the ticket kiosk staff to recognize the acropolis's own online ticket voucher would also be a good start. If you really want to go overboard, why not suggest to your staff that paying visitors are essential and should be made welcome, rather than a nuisance. In essence, an amazing site, staffed by very irritable, officious, unhelpful and grudging individuals, who seemed to view their job as harrying us through as fast as possible.

They were extremely rude and wouldn’t acknowledge the pre-paid tickets my partner and I had already bought, forcing us to purchase even more at full price. They were also very rude and abrupt when telling you where to walk as the paths are not clear at all. The plaques explaining the exhibits are boring and only explain the way they were put together, nothing about what the buildings and things were used for or represented. I’m lucky my partner is an archaeologist so we weren’t at a total loss but I would definitely say to the average person to purchase a guide book as otherwise it is very boring and confusing, not laid out in an interesting way at all. Also there is construction machinery everywhere. Only worth it for the temples at the top of the hill and the views. Also don’t go in the middle of the day as there is almost no shade. If you are a tourist, be insistent and don’t let them scam you out of more money, which they will try to do.

HOWEVER - we loved it and really enjoyed the experience.

I would make sure you bring suitable shoes and water - the shop there only sold fizzy drinks and sugary juices!?!

The tour guides at the top are actually very off putting - they try and outbid each other and get slightly angry at one another. In hindsight I’d pre-book a tour and include the museum.

We did persevere and found Simon a lovely tour guide who did a fab job and took us round for €60+ entry. We were in there over an hour, he was informative and engaging (hard in the heat).

Instead, it felt pretty quiet, and you could really take your time over it. It was extremely hot, and there is not much shade at the top, so please bring a hat and a water bottle (there is a drinking fountain where you can refill). The scale of the whole site (not just the Parthenon) is very impressive and there is really detailed information boards through the place to tell you about the history.

Italy,Acropolis,1.0,"Visited the Acropolis this evening (because of the heat in the afternoon) with my sister and her 3 little boys. All very excited to see the Acropolis. We bought our tickets at 19:15 but we were not told that you have to start leaving the highest point at 19:50.

We start walking assuming we would have enough time. After 10 minutes a lady tells us we have to walk faster and when we reached the top we were told we had to walk immediately back downstairs.

The way the people were asked to go downstairs was not friendly. It was quite aggressive. The people were treated like cattle and I really couldn't believe my eyes. We had to walk so near to each other because they wanted everybody out at 20:00 o'clock. Walking with so many people so near to each other not taking into account that there is the corona virus.

The stairs are quite slippery and my sister got nervous because of the workers yelling at the people. She fell off the stairs with her 2 year old son in het arms. My nephew of 6 years old also fell off the stairs and the same happened to a man walking behind us.

So I paid 20 euros to go through a gate to be told they will close and then to be treated I a way that was far from human.

Tip 1: tell the people you're closing at 19:50 if they enter after 18:30

Tip 2: find another way to get everybody out of the Akropolis at 20:00.

We picked up the combi tickets of €30 per adult (the children went free as under 18 and British passports) the previous evening at Hadrian's library. No que which was brilliant.
Got to the Acropolis via the South eastern gate at 9am. Skipped the ticket ques(hurray!!). Walked through the entrance check barriers. Got up the hill and visited all the 8 structures within an hour and 10 minutes, with several little water breaks and several photos at each spot.
By the time We finished and got back down the sun was getting hotter and more people were flowing in.

And in your opinion the student must have a lot more money than the under 25 years old person with a full salery because there isn't even a discount. Why do you think that?

We visited Athens in March, the weather was great but more importantly the volume of people was much more manageable to see the sights without huge crowds.
The Acropolis was one of the highlights of our holiday to Athens but maybe think about exploring yourself or with a private guide.

The Greek people have done an amazing job preserving and restoring much of the original structures here. NOTE: Restoration work is ongoing so be prepared for some ares to be closed off and construction cranes may be a challenge to omit from your photos. The site is simply amazing. The engineering skill used by the Greeks to create this place is incredible, especially given the era these structures were designed and built. NOTE: Crowds can be really bad so be prepared. The ascent to the Acropolis is steep and may not be suitable for everyone. Also, bring a jacket. The wind can be quite brisk up there even on a warm day.

Smelling the hot air, watching performances in Herodotus Theatre and having the Acropolis as a crown, looking up in hope. Hope for eternity and beauty. Do visit but also experience as an Athenian would; stroll down the many sokakia, eat a fish or meat ""pikilia"" (tapas plate) at Dioskouri, stroll in all laziness around Dionysiou Areopagitou, go to Psyri for a coffee that lasts for hours.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"I will not attempt to describe the most important cultural site in the whole western world! Nothing that I write will do justice to this treasure of human civilisation. I will just give two small bits of advice: Firstly go to this place with a guide or join a highly regarded conducted tour. I was on a group tour, and we had a wonderful guide. He gave us an enormous amount of information, and regaled us with numerous anecdotes. You may go only once to this place in your life, don't try to save money by not using a guide! My second bit of advice: it is positively dangerous to go here with inappropriate footwear. The ground is very uneven, and there is a bit of climbing (and descending! coming down is more dangerous than going up!) I saw two people slip and fall. We went on a bright sunny day, so everything was dry. On a wet day, it would be dangerous even with good shoes. So take care!

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis in Athens is more than just the Parthenon. There are several buildings, temples and theaters on this world-famous hill.

Of course the Parthenon stands out and is the most famous of the hilltop buildings of the Acropolis. But don't rush up there, there's lots else to see and wander around.

We came in through the south entrance close to the Acropolis Museum. A sunny day, no lines at at all at around 10.30am. A better choice than the main entrance.

It's a nice stroll going up to the Parthenon. Some really nice views on the way. And you will also pass the very impressive Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus, something you might miss out on, when you enter from the main gate.
The biggest crowds are just a the entrance to the top, around the Statue of Athena Promachos and Propylaea.

Once you're on top, you'll be able to really take in the amazing views of Athens. A very large town, suprisingly big. The Parthenon of course is the heart up here and an eye-catcher. But take your time to wander around and to visit the other sight. Most visitors spend maybe half an hour or so. Pic, Selfie....and they are on their way. It's a shame, because the whole area here is full of history and wonderful architecture. Even though hugely popular, it's well worth a visit. It's busy for a reason.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis is a must see for every visitor to Athens – it’s said to be the most important ancient site in the western world. If possible, go first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds. We went mid-afternoon on the day we arrived in Athens as we were leaving the city again early the next morning. It was not the best thing for us to do for when we approached the entrance to the site we were swamped by hundreds of tourist groups talking in very loud voices and pushing and shoving. So it’s better that you enter at the east entrance near the Theatre of Dionysis as tour groups don’t use this entrance.
The ancient temples on top of the hill are gradually being restored. The grandest is the Parthenon, dedicated to Athena Parthenos, goddess embodying the power and prestige of the city. Built in 438BC, it is the largest Doric temple ever completed in Greece and the only one built of white pentelic marble. Restoration of this magnificent structure is ongoing and unfortunately scaffolding is ever-present. Other temples are also undergoing facelifts and most of the original sculptures and friezes have been moved to the new Acropolis Museum and replaced with casts. Tour groups start arriving around 9am so if you can get there earlier you get a head-start. Wear sturdy shoes as the area around the site is uneven, stony and slippery.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"My father lived in Athens for 2 months back in the 70s and I was interested to visit the country first hand myself. I found my first visit spell-binding, very unique and grand, but the temple of the gods was derelict. What was obvious when I went there was the country was falling apart. Lots of grand old buildings graffitied with political slogans

My perspective of Greece was always a Euro football win in circa 2002, and bearded philosophical artistic people, like the ones I met on my degree, so was keen to meet the greeks in there own country.

The country much like downtown Rome has remanence of Byzantine empires and a legacy of greatness which was in the center of the greek people. I was fascinated by the things id heard from the city and went to the Acropolis on the second day.

How will the Plato book I received make sense, compared to the architecture - or the mythology I studied as a child? I was not disappointed this was the place the wrestlers, the gladiators, and the fighters.

It is an iron age fort, a palace to the kings and homer once spoke about this in nietczhes 'birth of tragedy', built to defend the royalty from invaders, it has strong pillars made from stone, a grand entrance and is very high up.

There were only a few other people there, so we took our time and wandered around the site, taking it all in. It was delightful! We actually managed to get some photos without other tourists in them! We saw the imposing Parthenon ahead of us (covered in scaffolding) and headed past the Temple of Athena Nike and on to the far side wall. Looking over, we had a perfect view of the Odeon (Theatre) of Herodes Atticus below. Continuing on, we saw the Theatre of Dionysus and the New Acropolis Museum below. The lookout at the very back provided a beautiful view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch, and the city below. We watched the sun set over the Parthenon and then made our way to the Erechtheion with its magnificent Caryatid statues. It was a truly magical experience!

I highly recommend the Rick Steves audio tour to give you a basic, light hearted and interesting background to what exactly you are looking at ... I am not a big history buff so didn't want too much information.
We went at 3 in the afternoon .. sunlight was perfect for photos .... Marble stones are very slippy so watch your step all around the area ...
1 hour was more than enough to walk around... it's not a very big area ...
A must visit on your next trip to Athens ..
As for the museum, we whipped around it very quickly .. it's just 5 euros in the winter... Fabulous building and display .. but too much for our interest ... if you are a student or interested in archeology, I imagine this would be like Disneyland for you... but for me it was not so captivating.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"Not sure why people would come to Athens and not bother with the Acropolis, unless they've seen it before. It truly is a marvel! I only wish that the construction was a lot further along so that I can see more of its previous splendor. However, what's left of it is still cool to see and experience.

I didn't research the venue before my visit but because of how truly great the structures were, it encouraged me to educate myself on the subject afterward. It made me wonder why the restoration was taking so long; why the roofs have all blown off; what the space was originally used for; and the list goes on.

As one of the main attractions of Athens, it makes me wonder why it closes so early (3pm). Even if it's for safety reasons (the grounds are very uneven), surely they can extend hours to 5pm. NOTE: My friend and I got there at 8am and had the place to ourselves for a solid hour until all the tour groups started coming in in droves.

If history or architecture is not your thing but you were dragged to the Acropolis by family, then at least enjoy the 360 degree view of Athens.

Italy,Acropolis,4.0,"the Acropolis and acropolis museum are walking distance from plaka, sitting high up on a mountain in the middle of the city, this beautiful monument is a must see if you’re ever in Athens, even for a day. When traveling in February and March there is no need to book online skip the line tickets as it’s not so busy especially if you went early morning. The attraction opens up at 8:30 in the morning. And if you need a guide you can hire a lovely lady on spot at the attraction site. (Although she did ask for the hefty sum of 100 euros). We ended up getting the 30 euro tickets that included entry to multiple touristic attractions within the city, with the exception of the Athens museum and the Olympic stadium. I would highly recommend purchasing it if you’re doing the one day Athens tour.
At the top, the view of Athens is breath taking and you can even catch a glimpse of the temple of Zeus below.
I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes that have good grip on the ground as the steps are incredibly slippery since they are made out of marble. If with kids, pay extra attention as no fence around the edge.

One of the most iconic buildings/sites in the World standing resplendent on a rocky outcrop in the centre of Athens it can be viewed for miles around, but get closer, walk in the steps of history.

The Acropolis is actually the rocky hill that dominates Athens on which stands the Parthenon or Temple of the Goddess of Athena, to say it is steeped in history is an understatement, completed in 438 BC.

The whole area is riddled with history and places of interest such as the Acropolis Museum the area is a 'Must See' attraction for all ages.

One of the stops with the ""stop on stop off buses"" and easily accessible to the whole area by buses.

Nearby you have the obvious tourist extras of cafés, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"A few tips first. (1) Suggest you visit the Acropolis museum before visiting the Acropolis, to get a feel of the history of the ancient city. (2) Read up on the Acropolis online and download a map of the Acropolis on your mobile, before your visit. You don't need a tour guide. (3) if you are visiting Greece during summer like we did, keep in mind it is going to be very hot. Carry water and use sun cream. Proper walking shoes is a must since you have to climb stairs to reach the site. The climb is easy. No worries on that at all. (4) visit Acropolis in the evening, after 5.30 pm so that you can see the Parthenon lighted up. Also a good idea to escape the heat. (5) Buy a ticket online in advance, to beat the queue. Buy either a solo ticket or a combo ticket which covers Acropolis plus other historical sights of Athens

The visit to the Acropolis would take one and a half to two hours. Amazing to think how the Greek built a city on a hill, with such imposing structures with huge columns and beams, centuries ago

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"An amazing experience which shall be experienced by all. We decided to use the East entrance which is the less crowded and take the ancient Peripatos Way which goes around the Acropolis. This was a great way to see the grandiosity of the place, so many different details that you will never be aware if you just go directly to the top. It is also like going really back in time and win your chance to enter the citadel above. Of course reaching the top and having the opportunity to learn so much about how this extraordinary place was in the past, it is definitely the highlight of any trip to Athens.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"It's a bit of a walk to get to the Acropolis, but worthwhile. Watch your footing on the smooth marble - as that can be quite slippy. Be prepared that many of the structures are in ruins - it is 2,500 years old after all! My favourite was the view down to the Herod Atticus Odeon - an hemispherical amphitheater intended to accommodate 5,000 people. While the Parthenon is the main attraction, there's also the impressive Propylaia columned structure that you walk through to get up to the top, and another smaller structure, called the Erechthelon, that reasonably intact. It's also a great place to get views of the city.",Feb 2020
Italy,Acropolis,4.0,"The site is amazing and you really need time to read all the information plaques and make sure you search everywhere.

The floor is also uneven so wear decent footwear! Walk around the base of the acropolis to see the hidden caves and the fountain. The views are great from the top.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"This is definitely a must-see if you are in Athens. It is truly amazing to see the ancient architecture. Visiting during what is considered the off-season still drew quite a crowd, so I can only imagine how crowded it is in the summer. As the other reviews state, wear comfortable shoes because its quite a bit of walking/climbing and the terrain is uneven. The site is also very exposed to sunlight, so don’t forget a hat and/or sunscreen. Also, there are quite a few people outside of the park who will try to put bracelets on your arm for “free”. They are not free and it’s a really awkward situation. My advice is either say no and keep moving or plan on bringing a euro or two per bracelet (which are actually very cute).

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"Our hotel was very handy for this visit so we just had an uphill stroll to the entrance. We purchased a combined ticket for 7 sites which cost 30 euros each - a great saving on summer prices but check if they are reduced for the winter season as a couple of the places do not need close inspection. We were approached by tour guide who wanted 100 euros for an hours talk a thought she did come down in price - feasible for a group but not just two of us. Wear non slip shoes and there are quite deep steps to the entrance although I think there is a lift. Stunning views and the Pantheon still gives a sense of awe. On reflection we wished we had visited the museum first as they show two interesting films which give background information. Information boards around the site and interesting to see the restoration. Luckily weather was perfect but imagine it is unbearably hot in summer.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"This is the Acropolis, after all -- beginning of the western tradition in art and urban design. Not much more to day. The restoration since our first visit -- fifteen years ago -- has highlighted the elegance and beauty of this place and these buildings. Leave time to linger and watch the sun change the buildings. It is a bit of a hike up, but we are over 75 years old, took our time and enjoyed the hike up, the splendid buildings and the easy walk down.
Go early to avoid the crowds (not so bad in February), and DO NOT get vouchers in advance which you have to trade in for actual tickets at someplace other than the Acropolis itself. If you are early, there is not much wait to get tickets at the entrance -- we walked right up to the ticket booth at 10 am on a Thursday in February.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"Going to Acropolis in the winter was a blessing. The weather was not cold at all, just a sweater and it was perfect. We went early in the morning just before the Acropolis opened so there were no crowds. Our Tour Manager mentioned that in summer there are line up to even get in and taking pics then becomes difficult for tourists.

Also with the crowds there are lots of pickpockets in summer so we had real relief.

Even though we were told that the climb is tough and difficult which really deterred me, I decided to go with the mindset that if I could not cope with the climb, I would get back and sit in the vehicle.

Everyone who is in Athens should definitely visit the Acropolis. It may seem just like pillars if you go without a guide and do not get the background of the place but the history is very interesting and the views are what you will not get from anywhere else in the city.

Enjoy your trip with this, walk slowly and make some stops along the way and for sure you will be fine and will be able to go up the hill.

Also since it was cold we did not need a lot of water. The place is full of various ancient sites in which some the structure are there while in others its just stones and a history. The main part which is the Parthenon is under repairs however the restoration have been stopped since last year probably due to lack of funds. Since it sits on top of a hill there are various points to see Athens. There are guides who will charge you 30 euro per person for the tour , trust me it not worth it as everything is clearly marked and written down. It should take you a maximum of one and half hour to see the place completely provided there is no crowd. This is must see if you come to Athens

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"I am mobility impaired. I thought the Acropolis would be one of places that would be off limits to me. We were smart enough to book the Viator full day Athens private tour, and our wonderful driver knew exactly where to take me and who to talk to. (There is a discount for disabled people and their one companion.) He took me as close as possible to the chair lift that goes to the elevator. Without that you are looking at what would for me have been an impossible climb up hundreds of rough uneven stone flights of steps. The lift is a platform that slowly ascends up the long stairway. Those stairs are shallow and doable if you can walk at all. When you get to the top of that you then are taken into an industrial cage elevator that ascends the vertical cliff. This elevator is NOT for the faint of heart; in fact I was asked in broken English if I had any heart problems. I am severely claustrophobic but this elevator, being an open gauge cage, did not bother me at all. It takes you in your chair slowly up the face of that cliff and when you roll out, facing the magnificent parthenon, and slowly roll past the 7 maidens of the temple, you will find you cannot catch your breath because of the spectacular scale and beauty before you. Pictures fail, words fail, nothing can prepare you for the spirit and aura of this place. The views are incredible- all of Athens, Lycabettus hill, churches and mosques, the entire Agora, Mars Hill, the far mountains, even the coast on a clear day. It was difficult to navigate up at the top- much of the terrain is very rough even for my sturdy chair. Even where you can navigate the chair, prepare to have your kidneys rattled. But I am so so so grateful to the extremely helpful and encouraging staff, my family, and my knowledgable driver for making this possible for me. It more than exceeded anything I could have imagined.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"You can buy tickets in advance but u still have to pick up ticket bought online. So be prepared for the queue. A visit in the afternoon is more relaxed, one hour for the way up to see all the excarvations on the way and another short hour up on the hill. The Parthenon is still under construction, so it is just the general view and experience up here you will embrace.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,This is definitely a must-see. Make sure to prearrange or ask for that special lift if you have a disabled person in your group as climbing the rock can be tough for some. Another thing to be aware of if you visit Acropolis in summer is that the temperatures are really high with no shelter as you are basically at the top of a huge rock so it would be wise to have an umbrella and a bottle of water with you!,May 2019

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"We were lucky enough to go to the Acropolis twice during our visit. The first day was sunny and beautiful and seeing each piece still there the Parthenon, the Propylaia
the Erechtheion, and The Temple of Athena Nike just to name the most famous. And then imagining all the pieces missing, the sixth Caryatid waiting to come home and join the others in the Acropolis Museum, and The Old Temple which you can see outlines of, but can only imagine what it once looked like. As we were exploring a storm came in and washed us literally off the Acropolis, but it just added to our adventure.

Our last day in Greece, we went back in the morning, it was gray and dreary, but we took pictures that turned out to be amazingly beautiful. I am not a photographer but the light appears to have been perfect for the pictures. It actually snowed while we were at the top! Be prepared to walk, hike, scramble, and in some places climb a little, and it can be like walking on ice when it rains, but it is truly an awe inspiring site/sight.

There were lots of people there, even in mid-Winter, but the history and atmosphere transported us to a place where we hardly noticed them.

We walked to the Acropolis from our room with the help of google maps, which took us about 20-25 minutes. Being comfortable walking shoes if you plan to walk around the area.

I suggest to visit the Acropolis early in the day when it is less crowded. When we were just about touring the place many people were there which was around noon. The normal price of admission is 20 euro (22+ usd depending on rate) per adult.

Simply amazing how this historic place has survived the times. There is continuous restoration going on.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,I was so excited to visit the Acropolis and i must admit that it did not disappoint. Pictures do not do it justice and you really get a sense of the scale of it by seeing it up close as well as seeing it on the skyline as you approach. It is busy and the locals recommended going early or late to visit. It is quite a steep climb up so be prepared with suitable footwear. My one regret is not taking a guided tour as i feel i would have learnt so much more.,Dec 2019
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"A tour guide will make the visit much more meaningful since history is so rich in this place.

Italy,Acropolis,3.0,"Oh dear, wanted to give it more and it of course remains a must see in Athens but there are some really quite simple things that could be done to improve the experience. Firstly, the route up from the stop of the hop on hop off bus is not signed at all and isn't easy to find without having to double back on yourself. We also thought it ironic that the disabled elevator seems itself to be poorly signed and up a considerable climb (unless we missed something).

There are around a dozen separate parts to the site and it would seem tailor made for an audioguide. There isn't one though and you have to make do with the static signs (in english and greek). A good suggestion on here was to download an 'unofficial' one beforehand but there really should be their own one, as seen after all at the Panathenaic stadium for example. As it was, we were pleased we'd taken some guidebook pages with to assist in interpreting things.

Even still, it's a tremendous place, particularly the Parthenon and the Temple of Dionysus.

We took amazing photos which will be treasured forever..... YES, YOU MUST SEE THIS - bucket list material, for sure.....
The rest of our stay (2 days) was disappointing to say the least - Athens is totally covered in graffiti EVERYWHERE! No real sense of an ancient city - apart from the odd ruin here and there (which looks like it just happens to be ‘blocked off’ and forgotten about)...... doing a hop on hop off bus tour on the 1st jan (as there was nothing open at all!) only depressed us to be honest - we were glad we got the highlight done in high spirits the day before!

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"We arrived shortly before opening to purchase tickets & were not surprised to see a line already formed. We utilized one of the side entrances though, so with only about 10 parties ahead of us, the line moved rather quickly. Once we entered & made our way around to the main entrance, we were met by hordes of people pushing their way up the steps. With our Rick Steves guide book in tow, we decided to take on the monument without a tour guide. (& I’m glad we went this route as being in a tour group just looked like a hassle.) We found it fairly easy to navigate around, & while there were informative plaques throughout, we opted for the descriptions in our book instead. The massive crane inside the main structure was an unfortunate eyesore, but I believe they are currently working on a preservation/restoration project. The views of the city were spectacular though. The ground was very uneven throughout & even slippery in some places, so be sure to wear appropriate shoes. I’d also recommend bringing water & patience as it warms up early in the morning & the number of clueless tourists is absurd.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"If you go to the Acropolis then we highly recommend Rick Steves audio tour. You can download this for free and it is gives a great insight in to site.
If you just enter the site on your own there is very little information available as there are few boards - and having a guide book means you are looking down not up.

The tour lasts an hour, but you can pause it whenever you want to stroll around at your own pace.

It isnt too heavy going but still paints a great picture of just how amazing this would have been back in its heyday.

We can also that in December the crowds are much lighter which means you can enjoy the site more easily, especially if you get there for 9:00 when it opens.

As a final point, the Acropolis nearly always has works going on to maintain it, so dont be too disappointed if a crane gets in some pictures!

The acropolis is very inspiring. Sadly most of it has been rebuilt so it’s hard to tell but is old and male. But the story is almost 2000 years old so one can expect some weathering .

This time, it was much easier to climb to the top; however, there are barricades around the major monuments... and lots of cranes due to restoration.

The Parthenon was a disgrace as being a super important site to the Western World, has a crane inside the structure that negates and blemishes the importance of the site. It is no wonder the Acropolis did not make it to the list of the new 7 wonders of the world due to the haphazard restoration the site has experienced .

Italy,Acropolis,1.0,"On our shore excursion trip to and from Athen’s cruise port, we took bus, train, subway and walk to Acropolis.
1. A couple looks like from Morocco approached us with a widely opened map. We were also having a small map of how to get to the hill of Acropolis from a nearby Subway station. Since we took an opposite direction ( counterclockwise) we had to look around. A decently attired husband asked me something in English. I thought he was going to help me. Instead he put his body close to me, then his wife started to say something. My wife immediately pushed me aside away from the couple. I was saved from pickpocket.
2. On the way back we took a train from Acropolis STN. The train car gradually became full and just two stations before Marathon stadium (a big event at the stadium) it was so full as all pax bodies touched the others. When the train stopped one station before the stadium, my wife suddenly pulled my arm and got out of the car. I followed my wife and stood on the platform. Surprisingly, there was an old Greek (?) man standing by just next to me. I felt a bit strange, but I chased my wife who already inside of another car. I pulled my wife’s arm and brought her back in the same original car. There was the same old man next to me back in the car. Within a minute, a lady in front of us talked to me with Greek accent English (similar accent to my Greek student during my US college time) which somewhat made sense so I replied. Very soon the train stopped at the Marathon stadium - all crowded people got off. We two were left in the train soon arrived in the final destination and walked back to the cruise terminal. I became thirsty and picked up one beer can and tried to pay for the can of beer, I’d noticed, then, that my small coin holder from left hand side jean of front pocket is gone! A bit lucky it had only less than 20 euros. How smart the thief was amazingly. This was one of the funniest pickpocket experiences. The man had his hand in my jean pocket while I was standing at platform!

Acropolis was the same condition of my previous visit a few months before the Athen Summer Olympics ant this place is for only one visit - 10 euros each. Note that washroom are available without entering the gate.

Italy,Acropolis,5.0,The Acropolis has been a place of working for near about 5000 years. One can feel the power and energy of the place. You can only see buildings from the outside. Most buildings are being worked on. Access through the gate by Theatre of Dionysos. Fewer crowds there. The whole walk- even at leisurely pace- took 2 hours.,Dec 2019
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,Perfect ancient site. A must see for all the human beings. You can also see the Athens city with 360 degrees view.,Dec 2019
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"It's one thing to see the Acropolis from afar in Athens, but it's quite another thing to walk among it. The walkway to the top was constructed using rubble from other remains. It is a beautiful, easy walk to the top. The view of Athens from the top is incredible. You can see the Agean sea from there, too.",Dec 2019
Italy,Acropolis,5.0,"Just like you imagine, but just know there is always scaffolding and restoration efforts there so be prepared. I can’t imagine going in the summer when it’s hot and crowded. November was perfect and even more crowded than I would like. Enjoy!",Nov 2019
Italy,Acropolis,4.0,"One of the most famous places seen, the Acropolis is kept from development. The only drawback to this awesome place, is the long climb up the hill to it; we are in our 70's and this was a burden, but we did it. We attended on October 30th and there were several thousand people going. We were part of a tour group, our guide being very good at keeping us away from much of the crowd. Greece and the UNESCO people have done a good job keeping the Acropolis from being 'Disney-fied'. The ruins are everything you'd expect.",Oct 2019

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"This is the 'official' Sotteranea in Centro, just past the north end of ""Christmas Street"", not the other one with the same name.

Their advance booking system is poor, no indication of the tour language. When I contacted them by e-mail, they replied three days later that they weren't sure when the English tours would be so I should write to them again a day in advance. This made sense, so I wrote to them again a day in advance. Three days later I got exactly the same reply, they weren't sure when the English tours would be so I should write to them a day in advance!

Anyway, things were clearer in person and advance booking was not needed. We booked and took an English tour. Our guide was perfectly good, we did not have the bored and detached guide described in earlier posts. However, her accent was sometimes hard to follow given her high speed.

The tour itself is only of moderate interest. It did illuminate some of the water supply issues of the city and how Romans tried to address them before they had pumps. The fake German(?) tank was not interesting. Our guide was frank about the fact that the water in the pools had been added for our benefit. The supposedly claustrophobic passages were fun to walk/run through, and not very claustrophobic.

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,"Terrible terrible company. I booked this trip and looked everywhere for an address. I even sent a message before the trip giving my mobile number and telling them where I would be (I googled the trip and found the address and asked them to confirm this was the correct address). I even rang Tripadvisor and they put me through to a call centre person who had no clue and the call cost me ££. I turned up at the address I guessed the tour would start and the tour operators told me it was the wrong one and I had the wrong company. The address I needed was 30 min across town.

When I booked a tour in Pompei the tour people rang me to make sure I knew where to meet. I heard absolutely nothing from these people, neither email or call. I have never ever left a negative review. Appalling they didn’t offer a refund. Do not book. We ended up in such a seedy unsafe feeling area too trying to find the tour.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,Very interesting tour. Really good guide. We can definitely recommend it (especially on a rainy day).,Oct 2021
Italy,Underground Naples,2.0,"our guide wasnt very engaged, it sounded like a very mechanized talk, we were told the tour would take 1,5 hour, in the end we finished in less than an hour. I am not saying this in order for guide to get minus points, but in order for the sotterranea or the agency to train them better. There was no option for us to ask questions, no one told us we would need to use our phone during the tour and that if you're ""claustrophobic"" half of the tour is not for you. 
Also, in covid times, I think the groups should be limited to less than 10 people.  The structure and organization of tours wasn't that good either, we had to constantly wait for other groups to finish their talk at certain location so we could enter. All in all, too many tours and with too many people. which, at least in my personal opinion would mean: very money  driven, which partly ofcourse makes sense, but it should also be value for money. However, the concept of the tour is pretty unique, but its presentation could be improved. 

iI want to add that it could be that we simply had bad luck or that the guide had a bad day, so I wouldnt like to generalize my experience. See it for yourself :)

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,"Went to the English tour (29th of august 18:00). The tour consisted of little information and waiting for about 1,5 hour. The tourguide didn't give us any information about the sights and was on his phone all the time. The Italian tourguide ahead of us did tell a lot of things but our English group just had to wait and didnt get anything. After a while other people started to complain about this but the tourguide just didn't care. Also our group was way too many people (around 60). The underground caves were interesring (part 1 of the tour) but you could skip ecerythint else. Will not recommend this whatsoever!!

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,"This tour could have been great, but unfortunately turned out to be the worst guided tour experience I’ve ever had. The underground sites are really cool to see, but our guide, Micheal, was the worst tourguide I’ve ever encountered. He gave very limited information about the different sites we visited, made us wait for 10/15/20 minutes at a time before moving on to the next site because there was a group before us, but didn’t bother to interact with the group during the long waits. Instead he was on his phone ALL THE TIME. When someone in our group commented on this fact he got angry. Furthermore; the group was supposed to be a maximum of 30 people, our group consisted of at least 60. Long story short; this was a waste of time and money. We saw some cool sites, but most of the tour consisted of waiting and I didn’t really learn anything. Felt like a tourist trap to me and I’m not surprised people left the tour at different points in time. Tour: August 28 2021, 6PM.

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,"I visited the underground today, Saturday August 28 at 4:00 p.m. with the guide for the group in English. It was the worst experience I have ever had with a guide. He didn't bother to introduce himself, he didn't explain ANYTHING to us, he was going so fast that we passed all the other two groups that arrived BEFORE us (Deutsch, French). He rushed us from site to site, he made his little explanations even shorter, had no interaction with the group, didn’t show us all the places he was supposed to show. He was on his phone all the time. Someone in the group dared to ask him a question, he didn't even bother to look up from his phone to answer her. We were all shocked and disgusted by his behavior. Some people even left in the middle of the tour. The tour ended when the guide left us alone in a hallway. Unfortunately, we were unable to get his first name because he didn’t tell us his name. Some of the people in the group told me his name was MICHAEL. I strongly do NOT recommend anyone who wishes to visit the undergrounds to visit it with this English speaking guide who might be MICHAEL. I assure you that you will have a really bad time. He disrespected us all and wanted to rush the tour as quickly as possible. It’s a shame for a tourist site like this. You have other undergrounds to visit in Naples, go there and don’t waste your money on this site if you need an English guide. The English guide has long hair with a small ponytail and is in his thirties, always on his phone. You can't miss him, no one can't be more unpleasant than him.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"Yesterday’s walking tour of Napoli Solterranea was great exercise and an awesome history experience. The Romans were amazing engineers! Their aqueducts built in the 4th Century B.C. brought water for Napoli to these underground storage caves from mountain sources that were 400 km distant. Those aqueducts still working today. The tour is offered in Italian and English. I didn’t have time to wait for the 6.00 PM English tour so I went at 5:15 on the Italian tour. I was fortunate to have a family from Switzerland on my tour. The husband translated for me. The tour guide speaks at great length with many stops through the caves. Some are very narrow and require sideways movement. It lasted about 90 minutes and was a lot of steps as well as walking. Very worthwhile if you like a vigorous walking experience and don’t mind a few tight tunnels. Cost is 10 Euros. Yesterday they could only process cash.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"This is a really great tour - but be aware that there is a rip-off version around the corner. Only go the the one with the big “suterraneo” arch over the door. The tour goes for 1.15h and includes squeezing through narrow tunnels, along aqueducts and seeing an old Roman theatre. Definitely worth going. Maybe prebook your ticket. We waited in line for quite a while",Aug 2021
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"We had seen pictures with underground gardens and were expecting to see things like that. We didn't, but were told that was at the tour at the other end of the aqueduct system, however, those aren't old. They are current projects of the university for experiments they are conducting.

However, what we did see was interesting, and helped us understand how this system worked, first as an aqueduct system for the city, but later as a series of bomb shelters during WW2, and how the army retrofitted it for that purpose. Lots of information and stories. I highly recommend!

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"My boyfriend and I did not initially plan to visit the underground of Naples, however we happened to be in the area and thought we might give it a look, and I am glad we did.

When we arrived there were just two spaces left for a tour in English 20 minutes later, we paid 10€ per person for entrance to the underground and a guided tour.

I feel like it was very high value for money compared to a lot of other things in Naples. Our guide was really great and explained a lot of interesting things.

I am very claustrophobic and although being underground was a little uncomfortable, there was plenty of room and no tight spaces. The only time where I felt uncomfortable was when there was a tour inside the old acueducts, that part of the tour is completely optional, and I didn't go, which I was really glad I didn't after I heard how my boyfriend described it.

All in all we had a really great experience, and I would recommend this tour to anyone!

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"Nice and cool to walk underground when it's over 30 degrees (C) outside. The narrow hallways offered some extra excitement. Arriving at the large halls with clear water pools was nice. The tour was on Sunday at 16:00. Tour groups were much too tightly spaced. At some points in the tour three groups were packed into the same hall and we had to wait for our turn. The guides should have left more space between groups. Our guide Michael seemed to be in a bit of a rush and at times it was hard to hear him. At one point he gestured toward a board with pictures from important historical events, but these were never explained nor did we have time to read the texts. Our tour ended abruptly at the end of a sentence.

I would recommend this tour to anyone who has an interest in WW2 (I apologise for my countrymen), Greek history buffs, Roman history geeks. Also I recommend this tour to everybody. It is interesting.

In the catacombs itself, it is a good tour, but if you are claustrophobic, or worry about the coronavirus in closed spaces, you won't get too see - and hear- about the key thing in the catacombs, which is about the aqueduct.

As for the tour itself, my wife and I found it really interesting and engaging, and our tour guide Eva spoke brilliant English.
The underground water systems part was actually very interesting, much better than expected, although not for those who don't enjoy close spaces (tight passageways are involved but optional).
The Roman theatre part of the tour was also interesting, but you need to use your imagination to a degree.

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"The tour itself was really neat, perhaps I expected to see a bit more but that's just myself having unrealistic expectations. The best part for me was actually the end of the tour that I don't want to spoil for the uninitiated.

Our tour guide for the day was Eva. She was fantastic--knowledgeable, energetic, passionate, informative, and kind. My wife (non-native C1/2 level speaker) struggled to understand her accent a bit, but I didn't think it was that strong. Would definitely recommend going with her if you can.

MAJOR RED FLAG!
The main issue I had was the blatant COVID precautions violations by the tour that followed us. Eva was VERY clear about how masks should be properly worn and why the regulations are in place (which, if you can't follow, then stay home). However, the 4 o'clock French female tour guide on August 29 must have missed the COVID training session. Most of her group was wearing their masks on their chins (hope they get tested!) and the female tour guide would REMOVE HER MASK every time she stopped to speak. When I motioned to her to move her mask up she had the audacity to shush me.

Eva told us that the powers that be actively read these reviews. If that is true and no action is taken, I would encourage ALL potential patrons to skip this tour entirely as it is not worth the risk that you are putting yourself in if management doesn't care.

Additionally we got the runaround in which entrance to go to, and the guide was inside the whole time instead of just coming up 10 m to help us out.

Whe had a nive walk around. There was a project od green house underground operated without Sunlight. I liked the part with water tanks underneath there.
Then we were led to an appartment that use to be a part of dressing room for actors when the place was ampgytheather. Also we saw a workshop with the miniatures, just see my pictures. Shame I can't show more, but if you go, you will see more of those and like them due to detailed looks.

The only down side was that larger groups nearby tended to be noisy and drown out what our tour guide was saying and some other guides had a microphone so made our guide even harder to hear.

In summer they say it's a good place since the tunnels are cool but now in December it was even colder then outside.

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"First of all, the organization is a mess. Once you find the place (hidden somewhere between a regular building and a church), you will see a long line of queued people waiting and not sure what to expect either. I tried asking the staff where to buy the ticket and they trued to rush me back to the queue before I even get to ask.Then they asked which language and when I said English, they told me to come back in one hour. No other information given whatsoever on the price of the ticket, length of the tour, what to expect, etc.
The tour itself lasted one hour and 30 min, the ticket was 10 euro. The group was not large, probably due to the fact I had chosen English.
The guide was knowledgeable about the underground galleries and Naples history, but the overall tour felt very confusing between the bomb shelter, plants cultured there, the closed church and Roman theater ruins. At some point, after getting out of the galleries, I almost left since i had no idea there was a second part of a tour covering the Roman ruins of the antic theater. Overall, not a bad experience in terms of information and things to see, but a very confusing one and certainly with poor customer focus.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,We really enjoyed the tour even though we missed the English one. The Italian speaking tour guide was kind enough to give us a small detail in English throughout the tour. There were some very narrow walkways and taking smaller children would be difficult.,Nov 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"First off, we did enjoy this tour, but almost missed it due to the confusion of trying to find it.

This is the tour that goes deeper underground, and was the one we were interested in visiting, but it is difficult to find as it is close to another underground tour that doesn't go as deep underground, but is next to a church and has much more prominant signage. We only realised there were two different tours due to photos on tripadvisor which showed a very different entrance. To find it you want to go down the steps away from the church and entrance to the other underground tour, and take a left down the street at the bottom of the steps. A few meters down you will see some signage pointing you down an alleyway to your right, and at the end of this you will find the correct entrance.

There is also the other common issue that we discovered all around Naples..... Alot of places don't take card payments! So either bring cash, or pre-book your tickets online. We had to do a rush online booking as we didn't have enough cash on us.

The negatives aside, we did enjoy the tour itself. They split you in to groups of English speakers, French speakers etc, with many of the guides speaking 2 or 3 languages, and from there you are ushered underground. The tour groups follow on from one another pretty quickly, so there isn't much time to ask questions, but the guides follow a script that gives plenty of information. We also found our guide to be quite brash, and there were strict instructions not to speak to each other or intterupt her.

There is a portion which involves going down a narrow corrider and in to an ancient aqueduct. Sometimes you do have to turn sideways to get through, so it wouldn't be good for those with a larger build or claustrophopia, but it is optional and you can sit it out if you prefer.

The end of the tour involved going back up and changing to a friendlier and more passionate guide, who took as through the streets and to a home with a secret wine cellar under the bed, which led round to a portion of Roman theatre they have uncovered. Unfortunately they can't reveal the whole theatre as, like the tenaments in Edinburgh, Naples has been built on top of on top of over the years and there are homes sitting right above it.

The tour is a nice way to cool off and see something interesting at the same time, just be prepared and leave plenty of time to find the entrance as Naples is a very old and unconventionally laid out city.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"The tour gives visitors a fascinating glimpse into Naples’ Greek, Roman and 20th-century history.

I agree with another reviewer’s comment about the unprofessional setup, the irritable demeanour of the front-of-house staff and the haphazard pre-tour queuing and payment “procedure”. Like, no-one has actually planned this out properly even though the tour has clearly been running for a number of years. No timetables or instructions were displayed in the “waiting area” near the entrance (or maybe I had missed those) and I had to ask the other visitors in the queue to clarify details such as the starting time of the English tour, where to purchase the tickets etc. As it turned out, you just pay the staff member in cash as you walk through the entrance.

It was all smooth sailing after the tour finally got underway and our enthusiastic and hardworking English-speaking guide made the walk an informative and enjoyable experience.

It’s also true that the front-of-house staff rush the groups through and two or three groups often ended up in the same echoey underground cavern, making it difficult to hear the information given by your guide. A few times, our guide had to wait for the Italian-speaking group to move further ahead before she could resume talking.

Truth be told, I felt my anxiety level rising while sidling through the narrowest section of the tunnels, which also happened to be the darkest. I was more worried about slipping or tripping because the “fake candle” we were given was only bright enough to illuminate the tour participant in front me and not the ground beneath my feet. Yes, definitely use your flashlight for this part of the walk, if you have one.

The last part of the walk, with a visit inside a house built over the ancient Roman theatre, was literally a peek into the “layers” of Naples’ long history. But, as our guide pointed out, the Roman theatre may never be fully excavated due to the lack of government funding and uncertainty over the structural soundness of the ancient building.

For 10 euros, I thought the 1.5 hour walking tour was excellent value and truly worthwhile.

The ancient underground tunnels and water system have huge historical significance, which the English speaking guide explained to us in detail. There is a very narrow tunnel which some people found a little bit claustrophobic, but having experienced it added to the excitement and interest of the visit. The second part of the visit was equally interesting. This involved going down a passage in a seemingly normal house to see the ruins of a Roman theatre. Naples has been continuously occupied as a City since pre-Roman times, and there is evidence of this everywhere. It really is a unique and beautiful City.

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"We decided this would be be the perfect wet day activity. If you're staying anywhere near the train station, it's only a short walk, approximately 1km to Napoli Sotterranea. English speaking tours are conducted every hour on the hour and groups are taken in groups of about 60-65. The tour costs 10euro and lasts for 1.5 hours exactly. Be aware the front of house people taking payment are rude and angry, getting short and annoyed with tourists who are expected to queue in a tiny, stuffy area which would comfortably accommodate 20 people, NOT 60. The rules change depending upon which minute you show up. Pre-payment required prior to the tour, next minute, pay as you begin....who knows. The tour guides are nicer than the front of house people and somewhat knowledgeable on the topic they're presenting, though know very little actual fact about Italy's role in WWII and their allegiance to Germany and swapping to the allied forces side! The underground tour was interesting in that it was Greek ingenuity that saw 400km of aquaduct constructed to supply hundreds of thousands of Italians with potable water. The tour includes a walk through very narrow aquaduct tunnels so I don't recommend this if you're claustrophobic and obviously, no bulky bags or backpacks.Naturally, in Italy, there are many, many stairs to climb, so wear comfortable shoes. It gets very hot and stuffy down there, so wear layers that you can easily take off. The tour also incorporates a 30 second church walk through with zero explanation (why even bother?) and the Roman theatre that has been built over with 40 odd houses, but discovered 8 years ago and partially excavated those areas accessible or bought off residents. They rush people through and often several groups end up in the same place making it impossible to hear the information given by your guide. The whole process is executed poorly and it feels like they just want your money and care little about your experience. However, it's a worthwhile diversion and history lesson if you don't mind the utterly rude staff who seem like they'd rather be anywhere than where they are.

In addition, there is a very ( VERY) narrow long dark passageway ( you are given a small battery operated candle - I found my IPhone flashlight much better) that if you are claustrophobic you definitely should not do!

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"We enjoyed this tour, especially the evidence of tunneling by the Ancient Greeks and the remains of the Roman water system. The World War II bit was less interesting. As to the Roman theatre that would once have hosted Nero, unfortunately it is but a fragment. Still that may change over time if there is a chance at further excavation.

A couple of things: the tour in my opinion was overbooked. At certain times the group was really too large to be workable. So try to pick a quieter time, if possible. It is also not suitable for people who may be impacted by tight, narrow spaces, including very tall people who may have to crouch over. It is a must-see? No, there are other things I would do first, if I had limited time in the city. for instance, visiting the archaeological museum or the royal palace or the opera house. It was our second time in Naples, so I thought it would be a nice 'add-on'.

We did, some different languages were sent on different tours ahead of us, then people on English tour with tickets the we were allowed to join. Tour guides very strict good information although not huge details. Had to stay in line and stay silent!! Covered lots of steps, ww2 shelters and greek/Roman water system. Then out above ground to visit a newly discovered bit of amphitheatre round the corner.
Took 1.20 mins, a real change from usual city tours and great to just Tue up to. No need to book before. 10€ per adult. Very very narrow dark bits!

Historically it is amazing but this visit was bedlam.
Lined up to be first in and it was so poorly organised with more people than they could handle to put through safely and with the numbers the walk through was cut short by 30 min and at the end you are left in a different part of the city so if you are not yet oriented with the city you are lost .
Poorly managed and even staff were stressed not as good as it was previously.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"First heard of underground tunnels was from the captain of our cruise ship and decided to follow up on the information which is within walking distance of the cruise terminal. It was 10Euro each for 2 hours. Our guide was excellent and never missed a beat in explaining things to our group. It was fascinating to know that these tunnels go for miles and miles under the city of Naples and have been there since the Romans were using them for water storage. There are stairs into and out of the tunnels and some parts where we had to ""walk like an Egyptian"" (in other words side on) but I still felt safe even though the lighting was dim.

Two tours in one: first city underground, second underground theatro.
It's quite a large group of 65 tourists, so be prepared not to hear much of the explanation. Quite impressive underground structures and ok for 10€ - it's basically 90 min because of the size of the group!

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"Good experience. You don’t need to book ahead, however depending on the time of day the line could be relatively long. We waited about 30 minutes. We went with the English speaking guide and our group was very large with approx 40-50 people. The experience would have been improved if the group was less, say 20. However, you could hear the guide easilyTour goes for approx 80 minutes. There were more than 100 stairs to go down and then back out of the tunnel as you are 40 metres below ground level. There is one part for approx 50 metres where you are given a candle and you need to squeeze between rocks sideways.so if you are claustrophobic you may wish to reconsider. Although the other parts of the tunnels are very spacious. After being in the tunnels you are taken to 2 separate houses, where there used to be an 8000 seat Greek theatre but now there are houses built over. If in Naples definitely worth your time and it is only 10 Euro, bargain.

I am marking it down as the tour for English was so large that the people in the back heard nothing and the guide had usually finished his descriptions before the last lot had come through.
The children in my group did not have a chance of seeing much.
There is a lot of history here and with a smaller group would have been great. We were later taken to a house where we could see some of the theatre structure.

I can sometimes feel a bit claustrophobic but this was okay because there was space around me most of the time and the really tight bit was optional. Quite fat (or heavily pregnant!) individuals might struggle a bit in places. The most interesting part was after the underground tour when we walked to a nearby site and saw a recently unearthed amphitheatre. Just that would've been worthwhile.

Typically unorganised and chaotic and non-informative queuing / ticketing at the beginning and treated like cattle. The staff were rude and flippant at the beginning and we had to queue for half an hour without any idea what was going on. Then we were herded into a group of 60 people, so it was impossible to see or hear everything, especially because we were rushed through everything. The group was way too large and we were often caught up with other large groups of other languages which made it even harder to hear, and we were rushed through because of the other groups. It was very disappointing and just seemed like a money making scheme, I wouldn’t bother with it.

It's really interesting, and the descent takes you down to the foundations of Naples, where you navigate very narrow tunnels, see hydroponics labs, ancient mines and learn the history of Naples through the war.

There is also a slightly chaotic walk along Naples Streets to the submerged amphitheater located in the basements of several buildings at another location.

All in all it's very much worth a visit. But if you are horizontally gifted. There's a lot of stairs and a lot of squeezing. So you might get stuck.

I would say that you do have to have a reasonable level of fitness to do this tour, there are lots of steps and narrow dark passageways to deal with and there’s a very high humidity down there. We’re both in our 60s and probably average fitness and we just about managed it. Don’t do it seriously if you suffer with claustrophobia. It was really interesting and we enjoyed the main part.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"My wife and I were very entertained by this tour and found it to be very interesting. The tour group walks down a lot of steps (maybe 100 or 150 steps) and the entire tour is underground. There’s one part that will be uncomfortable for anyone with claustrophobia but it’s an optional part and you do not have to participate in it. It’s the part where everyone walks in a single file line through a very narrow tunnel (maybe 20” wide). Parts of the tunnel are only 6’ tall but most of it is much taller...like 20’ tall. If you’re a wide or fat person, you won’t be able to do this part. The guide was very knowledgeable and did a good job keeping the group moving. After the underground tour, she took the group through an old theater and that was pretty cool too.

The only reason I’m not giving this tour five stars is because several of the tour group workers stood next to the line and smoked cigarettes as we were waiting in line. I understand smoking is common in Italy but it was hot and muggy and they were smoking right next to the line and that’s gross and rude.

The story of the underground tunnels from Greek to Roman and then more modern times when they were used as a rubbish dump then as air raid shelters is fascinating.

I was booked on a 4pm tour. Upon arrival we where told the English tour was to wait up the front. There was maybe 15 people in this group, but we where made to go last in, which was around 4:20pm. We where definitely the smallest group.

A few of the elderly tourist where getting hot and a bit frustrated with the long wait as they whrre told that tour would start at 4:05pm, and decided to ask the male staff member with the tied back long hair, what the hold up was. They where responded to with a screaming show in front of everyone to see, with foul language and words like "" who do you think I am your slave?"". I have never seen such a foul display to our elderly, especially a staff member speaking to a paying customer in this way.

The tour was good and done by a very apologetic staff member, and it was a sad that this experience ruined it for me. But it definitely is a interesting tour.

I just hope they remove that staff member, because there is no place for that sort of behaviour in any place.

In parts it was a squeeze to get through, you had to turn sideways to shuffle through in the dark with a small hand held battery candle, so not suitable for pregnant women or larger (rounder) people in general and not advisable for people who don’t like confined spaces.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"We (family or 4 including 2 teenagers) did this tour on our first night in Naples. We chose the 6pm tour which was the last of the day.

As many have said, it's easy to find but the queuing system is chaotic. That said, it works, because within 5 minutes we were in an English speaking group and taken inside to wait for the guide.

The guide had very good English and good knowledge of the history. She was able to explain everything very well. The group was quite large with maybe 30 people and they do not provide headsets/earpieces so you have to stay close which can be difficult. The guide did her best to speak loudly and to wait for other noisy groups to pass.

For us, we learned a lot about the history of Naples, from the Greeks who originally mined Naples for construction materials through the Roman era to the tragedy of the 19th century (when the underground mines were used as 'landfill') and the 20th century when the war forced many Neopolitans to use the mines as a bomb shelter.

The tour ends by coming above ground and a short walk to a 'hidden' Roman Theatre (think Rome's Colosseum - but with 'modern' houses built over it!) - truly amazing that they've been able to uncover such a substantial Roman architecture that is still mostly under modern Naples buildings and apartments.

Given the price, and it's only 90mins - we think it is not to be missed. We'll certainly remember it for a long time.

PS: We didn't book via an organiser and just turned up on the door and paid less money than the tour operators on Viator were advertising for!

Some of the tunnels are very narrow and so you need to edge sideways along for quite a long distance, but there's decent height so not claustrophobic and it adds to the experience.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"Bit claustrophobic in places but otherwise fascinating visit. Deep, huge, ancient, subterranean galleriy system with tunnels between, for water storage - good guided tour. Well worth the visit. Atmospheric (and some welcome cool on a hot day)",Jul 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"We visited today and just bought ticket when there. There didn't seem to be any point in buying online necessarily - certainly not this afternoon?

It seemed a bit organised chaos splitting everyone into language but it happened somehow! We visited the toilets before start - glad we did but toilets are pretty poor.

Once inside it all ran very smoothly & the guide was very clear & informative with some wit coming through. It was fascinating & I totally recommend a visit....it also gives an idea of how Naples has been developed & formed over time.
The recent discovery of the Roman amphitheatre is interesting but also shows how the city has developed & built over and used older buildings as foundations.
I'm quite an anxious person but I managed the tunnels...it was challenging but Ok. Worth it if you feel able to.
Only 10 euros for 1 1/2 hour tour - worth it.

The tunnels were narrow and exciting.

Italy,Underground Naples,2.0,"It's €10 and that's pretty steep for a tour of 40, so it's not something I'd recommend.
Guide was fine, she did well to keep us entertained for 90 minutes. It's probably a 45 minute tour maximum.

Historical discussion was fine, but the frankly weird Nazi tank, plants and final theatre discovery was so disjointed it was a bit weird. All interesting but it didn't flow at all.

It would be a better tour if were shorten in both length and price. Not something I'd recommended. Well, it's pretty cool walking underground though and cooler than the Naples heat.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,Very impressive underground tour through the narrow channels of ancient Naples. Must see attraction!,Aug 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"This fascinating place is a definite ""must do"" in the historic centre of Naples. It is deservedly popular as witnessed by the fact that our English language tour was a group of 60. Our guide for almost 90 minutes was a Greek archaeologist who explained everything about the underground space with great enthusiasm and the final part of the tour to the Roman theatre was an unexpected surprise.
Probably not a good idea if you suffer from claustrophobia but in reality the narrow passages to the water reservoirs are not particularly restrictive.",Jul 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"The guide was good, but unfortunately there wasn’t much for him to talk about. It’s an impressive place with underground caverns dug out by slaves 2500 years ago, but there isn’t much else. You have to walk through very tight tunnels at times, and if you’re slightly overweight I think you would probably get stuck. Also if you suffer from claustrophobia you may have a panic attack. The second part of the tour you are told you will see part of the Roman amphitheater under the city, which sounds promising, but it turns out to be just roman brick work in someone’s basement.",Jul 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Our English tour had around 40 others on it and this was after the group had been split into two due to its size.
This massive group size meant there was a lot of standing around waiting for the group to catch up and we occasionally missed bits of the tour as explanations had started before we'd got through the narrow tunnels.

Regardless of this we learned a lot about this fascinating world under Naples and would say this is definitely worth a look. The coluseum ruins were also a great and interesting addition.

I'd say this trip is one to avoid for anyone who doesn't like tight spaces. Around an 80m stretch of the tunnel was narrow enough to require walking through sideways in the dark. This can be avoided but this and the section immediately after were the most interesting of the tour so if you can't handle the spaces give this one a miss.

During WWII, the people of Naples used the underground as bomb shelters.

Today, you can walk through cavernous rooms still showing the water line, squeeze through narrow channels of the aqueduct & check out some interesting WWII artifacts that were found down there.

A word to the wise, those tunnels are tight. We had to walk sideways and crouch in some parts. If you are bigger than the average person (i.e., not thin), you might just get stuck. And those stairs are steep and long. You will get a work out. If your health is not good enough for that (canes, walkers, etc), I wouldn't recommend this tour.

The tour guides were very good and there were tour groups in Italian, French and English, all running simultaneously but taking different routes so we weren't on top of each other. Get there at least 10mins early to ensure you get in a group. There are some very narrow tunnels and you even go down in the dark with and electric candle to get the full experience. But if you are claustrophobic you can sit that part out without missing too large a chunk (10mins or so). Was worth the €10 entry price (€8 for those with student cards). Also a great little limocello shop right by the entrance that gave us free samples, very recommend a visit on your way in/out of the caves

These underground passages offer a unique look at the history of Naples and the region. They were originally carved out by the Greeks for building stones. The Romans turned them into aqueducts, which remained in use for nearly 2,000 years. During World War II, Italians used them as shelters from bombing by the US and the Allies.

There is a section which is very narrow and the guide gave fair warning about it, but the section was very long!

Some slower members of the group were left completely behind in the tunnels and therefore took the wrong turning. There were almost 80 people in this group: I have worked as a professional tour guide and no responsible tour organiser would ever allocate a group of this size to a single guide in any situation, let alone on a tour with a large number of safety hazards such as steps and low narrow passages. Be aware of these issues before deciding whether to take this tour.",Jun 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,There is quite a bit of history in these tunnels dating from the Greeks all the way to present day. It is quite an interesting tour and you get your money’s worth. Tour took about an hour and 20 minutes. Guide was very knowledgeable.,Jun 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"I was initially confused about the various options to visit the Naples underground. There are three options: 1. The Bourbon tunnel, 2. The Roman market, 3. The Greek/Roman aqueducts. We went to the market initially (50 minute tour though I don't think you need to choose the tour option but it's only 1 euro more) and then the aqueducts (about 1 hour 20 minutes). If you're choosing one I can't comment on the Bourbon tunnel (we did not visit but I heard it's a decent choice) but choose the aqueducts. The market tour was quite disappointing (it felt recited and fairly rushed with poor English pronunciation and he was not passionate about the subject - I don't know if we got unlucky with the guide). You go about 10 metres down and there is not a huge amount to see (a couple of excavated market streets). The aqueducts are about 35 metres deep and our Sri lankan tour guide had almost native English and was informative and managed to control a large group of ~50 people well. You can only visit with the tour so check the times and arrive 10 minutes early. The aqueduct underground is larger and you have an optional 15 minute squeeze through a small aqueduct with an electric candle where you see the area of the old public water pool storage/well. The market and aqueducts were both 10 euros each, so overall visit the aqueducts as you get more for your money! The entrances are close by to each other and I've attached the picture of the aqueduct entrance (it is down a small street with a gargoyle face above the entrance). Enjoy and I hope this makes your planning easier!

Italy,Underground Naples,2.0,"Ok Naples is a vibrant city the food is good overall. Let’s start with the city some great shops and architecture , sadly it’s scruffy graffiti nearly everywhere and rubbish in the street, that no one seems to collect. The food is good restaurants can be a bit expensive so find a good street food restaurant. Traffic and crossing the road, the rules are there are no rules. If you want to cross the road wait until there’s a crowd of locals, get in the middle and cross with them. It’s like playing Russian roulette with cars and mopeds. Insect repellents are a must! Carry an over the shoulder bag and hold it in front of you. Watch out for touts, pick pockets and undesirable people. If your a single Male, don’t try to chat up the girls. There’s usually a husband, boyfriend or psychotic knife carrying uncle near by. Finally, based on my experience DONT USE JET2 FOR YOUR HOLIDAY. This has to be the worst airline ever, on my return flight delays, confusion and broken down baggage carousels. I had to leave my case as I had to get a connection. A Jet2 rep said don’t worry we will forward it to you. However they refused to do this in the end. The woman who spoke to me on the phone was rude, bad mannered and just had a couldn’t care less attitude. Also no one would admit to the conversation, now what a surprise. My advice fly Easy Jet or some other airline BUT NOT JET2.

Something that I personally like a lot, is that a the couple who brought their dog was also welcome to bring the dog down underneath the ground.

For those who are a bit afraid of the dark, or of narrow places there is also an option to wait and avoid the narrowest and darkest passages, so it really is a good tour for all people.

Our tour guide spoke nice clear English and waited for everyone to be present at each stop.
There were clearly other tours going on so we waited a few minutes sometimes for them to move on.
I chose not to go through the very narrow tunnel but my husband and mother say it was probably the best bit.
I found the history of the Romans and also how the tunnels were discovered and excavated for WW2 very interesting.
An unexpected bonus was the tour round the newly discovered ruins of the amphitheatre. Absolutely fascinating to think that Naples is built on top of of old Roman ruins.

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,I have been in Italy for 3 weeks and have taken many tours. This is by far the worst tour I have seen. I'd go so far as to call this tour a scam. Even the tour guide seemed ashamed to have to give such a poor quality tour. There were people leaving the tour because it was that bad. Imagine getting a tour of someones unfinished basement. It is almost as boring as that. There is no underground city. The description is a lie. The water you see in the photos is pumped in by the tour company. This tour really is horrendous. You've been warned.,May 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"It’s a bit of an experience going very far underground and moving through the very narrow section of tunnels but that’s mainly it. Tours are organised by language and on our English tour, there was 50 people! This was too many. We were near the back and on 2 occasions, the tour guide was finishing talking about something just as we got into that area! There’s a bit at the end where you go back up to street level and then into 2 different rooms to look and old sections of a theatre. Not very interesting at all in my opinion",May 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"€10 tickets to go explore naples underground. They run English tours every 2 hours and I would recommend turning up 20 minutes early, buy your ticket and then relax in the little square eating something sweet! The tour is very informative with plenty to see as they tell you about all the different uses the sotteranea had.

One thing to note is that to get to the best part of the tour you have to go through some very narrow tunnels so if you are claustrophobic or an XL man you can still get through but may find it a struggle

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"10 euro entrance .
Very interesting story about underground aqueduct and water tanks
Our guide spoke very loud. So big group was not a problem. Part with very narrow tunnels is only 10 minutes and can be skipped . Very exciting and interesting! For a few people ou should come 5-10 minutes in advance to join the group.",May 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"It was certainly interesting - lots of chat about WW2 as opposed to the Roman days 2300 years before; which was interesting but I personally was more interested in learning about the Romans.

Guide was fine - difficult to hear what he was at times as we were part of a 23-strong group.

For the price, it's interesting - something to do when it's raining!

If you're not comfortable in very tight spaces, maybe not for you (you're not told this until you're halfway through the tour).

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"We were told to arrive just before the hour for an English speaking guide, but it appeared that all other language tours started at the same time. (English, French, Spanish and Italian)
The organisation wasn’t very good and there was a lot of confusion between everyone standing in a narrow street as to where they should be. It was almost half past by the time we actually started the tour. I had read somewhere online that you can enter the underground area on your own without a guide, but this wasn’t true, due to some of the narrow tunnels.

The guide, I believe was from Greece, was very good. She delivered the information in a interesting way and was encouraging for the people who were struggling with all the steps back up. There were some good sights and then after a short walk visited part of an old theatre below some apartments.

The tour was good value for money and a nice break from the busy Napoli streets.

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,Is it worth it? Yes I suppose but how good? 50/50. Probably better to spend your time at one of the museums or seeing the city. Not seeing it will not change your life,May 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"The place itself is interesting, especially the cistern with water and the narrow tunnels where you walk through with a light. However we had an english speaking guide who was absolutely terrible. She had all the charisma of a laundry basket and her diction was rather odd. She didn’t seem to be that knowledgeable, or interested. It was sometimes quite painful to listen to her. What a shame. This place is like a tourist factory, huge groups in and out, quite a lot of waiting around. Still, it was worth visiting.",May 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"If you are on the fence about doing this tour - do it. We almost did not go because we are older and I am not in the best of shape at the moment. But surprisingly - there was no problem. There are 140 steps up and down. But there are railings the entire way. The narrow passages are narrow but we did not have any problem with that. The hardest part for me was going down the 140 steps at the beginning of the trip. I could go at my own pace.

I LOVED the entire experience - including the visit to the roman theater after the visit underground. One of the best tours ever.

We were lucky in that there was not a long line - I understand that there is on other days.

I highly recommend.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"I couldn't believe what I saw. Amazing place to discover. Around 400km down the town of tunnels made by Roman people and then used also during Second World War. Incredible the story on how the built, the common story about the pipers...it is a 1h30min journey very good. Only pay attention if you feel panic on closed places but only in one part there a really really tight path which you can jump in case you have fear. After that they also bring you to watch the theatre which not is included into buildings...Amazing!",May 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"This was a really interesting tour of the tunnels under Naples. It was something a bit different to your usual city tour. You learn about the different uses for the caves from Roman times till now. The tour took our group around 90 mins and was €10 each. Pretty good value for money. Our guide was really informative and friendly.

If you don’t like small spaces don’t do this tour. The most exciting bit involves making your way through some very very very narrow caves with only candle light. I loved it but it’s not for everyone. There is a place to sit and wait if you want to see the caves but not squeeze through the narrowest ones.

The only negative for me was how groups are organised. It’s a bit of a free all. However, I wouldn’t let it put you of.

I seen a couple of reviews say that group size was a problem. There was 25 in our group and it worked well. I could alway hear our guide.

The tour takes about 2 hours but I think it was a bit rushed on the day we visited as it was a wet day and there were lots of people wanting to get in. You are taken down to see the aqueduct and some Roman ruins – it is really interesting but what they don’t tell you beforehand is there are 142 steps down (and back up) which can be very tough if you have any mobility issues.

Italy,Underground Naples,2.0,"Ok, it was a very busy evening as it was the last day of the Easter holidays but the queue was totally disorganised and chaotic out on the street and not running to the schedule. I defy anyone to understand the 'system' they use to organise entrance for the tour. Our
Guide was called EVA who was from Greece and she was lovely, as was the girl at the back of the group making sure everyone was ok and kept together.
It was so busy with groups that it was sometimes difficult to hear Eva as we could also hear the other guides and it also meant there was little time to take in what was on view.
Personally, I didn't doo the claustophobic section so I did miss out a bit but I took cold feet when we were there. There is a part of the tour that goes outside and up the opposite street. Overall, it was about of a disappointment, especially after the long wait

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"This was on our 'to do' list while staying in Sorrento. We got the boat across to Naples specifically to do this tour. We arrived in the Centre and it took a while to find our bearings. We found the entrance and were told to come back at 2pm to start the tour, you can't purchase your tickets before or queue earlier so it was a bit confusing as to where to wait or if we would actually get into the 2pm tour.

We came back at about 1.45 and just stood around near the entrance. At 2pm they called all the English Tour Group to go straight through and pay. At 10 Euro Each we thought this was reasonable but didn't have high expectations.

Our tour Guide was great and really informative, our group was huge though maybe 40/50 people so was hard to hear him at time especially as we had a couple with 3 babies (one that screamed the whole time). We started the tour in the main section on the Water Area and then moved on into different sections, it was alot more in depth and interesting that we first thought it would be. We came to the mid-point where you can then proceed to the tiny walkways which are very small or wait in the main section for the rest of the group to return.

We were given lanterns and climbed through the tiny walk ways which was really interesting and a great experience. The tour was a good 60 - 80 minutes long and then proceeded back onto the street where we learnt about the Roman Theatre, we were led back to the main street and the tour finished.

Really Interesting, Very Reasonably Priced & Nice Break from the Crowded Naples Streets!

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Have always been interested in the underground of cities, and Naples has an especially fascinating one. There's a long queue to get in, but the interior is worth the wait. My favourite bit was squeezing through a tiny crack in the rock - which is definitely not for claustrophobes!

Also, our English tour guide Medeina was fantastic throughout the trip - it's a long and tricky guided tour and she absolutely nails it.",Apr 2019

If you can climb back up the steps from the beach at Sorrento then you can do this, though there’s a section about 110m long with really quite a narrow passage which wouldn’t be recommended if you’re claustrophobic (you can sit this part out and still enjoy the rest).

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"We took a tour with Napoli Sottoteranea (not to be mistaken for Neapolis Sotterrata! Those are 2 different things.).
It wasn’t very good organised to be honest. The people for the tours of all the different languages stood together. After that they tried to divide us but they put us in a small area.. didn’t work.. Very strange.
We had a very large group (I think about 50 people) and the different groups started one after the other.. Because of the noise of the other group it was difficult to understand the guide.. After a while it became better because the distant was a bit bigger.
Except the weird organisation of the tour it was nice to see the city underground. After the underground-part we went upstairs and saw a roman teatre.

We had a guide who was originally from Lithuania (sorry, can’t recall her name). Her English was very good. She also made some jokes and was open to answer questions.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Took the guided tour of Underground Naples which is excellent. Tour is ~1.5 hours through the underground tunnels and water cisterns built by the Greeks and Romans and later used as garbage dumps and bomb shelters in WWII. Really informative tour and worth the reasonable cost. However those with mobility problems or of very large size may not be able to do it. Also be aware there is another Underground Naples website which goes from a place in piazza Plebiscito near the Royal Castle but this outfit is not recommended by Naples people. The preferred one is located at Piazza San Gaetano on Via Tribunali next to the Basilica.

They were also many, so you might have to wait for one group to finish before you can go on to the next thing. Can't imagine how it's like in high season.
Tunnels are very small so not suitable for ""large"" people, or if you are claustrophobic. If you go with toddlers, you would have to carry them for large parts as there is no room for strollers.. Maybe not recommended to bring small kids if you don't have strong arms",Mar 2019
Italy,Underground Naples,2.0,"A very interesting tour and certainly worth doing with older children - we had been really looking forward to this! However we had not thought how unsuitable it would be with a 5 month old baby, even in a sling! It’s obvious to us now (narrow tunnels, hundreds of steps), but I’m surprised none of the staff stopped us (we waited 40 minutes for the next English speaking tour) or gave us advice rather than just selling us tickets - we just wrongly assumed it would be a lot more accessible having never done anything like this before. As a result, I felt quite nervous when we got down into the caves and had to sit out the bits accessed through the narrowest tunnels. It’s the staff selling us unsuitable tickets that made me rate this poor.
The tour also left late so we weren’t able to stay till the end (we needed to make our boat home) so missed the Roman amphitheater which is above ground and everything that came after that. A shame but we should have checked I suppose. I just wanted to warn other parents considering this.

The tour going through the small tunnels appears to be completely set up for tourists and the water in the tunnels is purely there for the tour. It is not historic in any way.
The addition of the ‘theatre’ was totally unrealistic and did not look anything like a theatre at all. It could have all been very much made up for tourism as far as we were concerned.

Watch out, as there are several entrances and tours for the underground, we’ve tried many and this is by far the best you’ll see!! (Next - not across the street - across you’ll find San Lorenzo Maggiore, but that is small and quite boring comparing to this one- NEXT to the Church San Paolo Maggiore on Tribunali street).
The guides (Vincent and Eva) were so funny and great hosts for the tour.
The tour is fascinating, full of relevant and interesting information. The views underground are amazing. There will be some norrow tunnels (that is the funny part full of adrenalin, as they are VERY narrow and dark, you’ll walk with candles inside) to get to the spectacular things inside.
The tour (with guide, as that is the only possibily) that was about 1 hour and a half cost us 10 euro - the best tour you’ll find for the Naples underground.

Fascinating large water reservoirs from the Roman days. The underground caverns were used in WWII for refuge during air raids. There is 5 minute portion of the tour where you go through really narrow passageways - exciting, but they do harp on about the claustrophobia. It's optional. If you're claustrophobic just skip this part - simple!

Our only disappointment was that the visit was very crowded - there were about 50 of us for the one guide so we often had to try to be upfront to hear her. There were lots of other tours going on just before and just after so we were moved on quite fast through each part.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Steps 40 meters down are quite easy to do, coming back up is a physical exercise, but well worth the fun. Some of the caves are very narrow, for a fat person those might be tight, but for slender people and for teenagers they are a piece of cake.

As the Greeks have built the canals the stones cut out from them were used to build the city. As the system then distributed water underneath Napoli to all wells, the caves were not accessible. At some point water could not been drank anymore because the stone walls captured cholera bacteria. The caves were emptied and during the second world war the caves offered security for people. Napoli was so heavily bombed that all people did not have homes even in the 1950's.

The second part of the trip showed us the remnants of a Roman Theatre. As Napoli was built on top of old structures after every earth quake and wars, layers on top of layers has piled up. A Greek-Roman Theatre had been found at some point. We see its remnants through an apartment recently an old lady was occupying. She did not know of living inside a theatre.

The guide, Ava is so good. She put everyone at ease, spoke very well about the trip and made it so pleasant! My wife is not much for underground happenings but she (Ava) re-assured her and maybe even cured her while instructing about the underground and beautiful Napoli.

Only drawback, DO NOT buy advanced on-line tickets!!
We purchased the tickets in advance for all my family, charged an extra € 3,90, but had to attend a 1 and a half hour long line at the counter with all the other people without tickets. No separate lines for ticket holders or not, terribly stupid and frustrating!!",Jan 2019

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,Dead center in the busy old town of Naples is the entrance to the lovely and storied tunnels of the underground. Our tour guide Eva was excellent and used language simple enough that everyone got the gist of thing (some people in our group had weak english) and took us on a lovely walk around the tunnels and a few old buildings. An amazing contrast to the other busy and gilded sights to see in Naples.,Dec 2018
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"All tours are guided and in different languages at different times. We were on a tour of approx 30 people. We were taken down a lot of steps into the underground of Naples. There were some remnants of the war and we were told a great deal of history. At one part we were given electric candles and had to go in single file sideways through some very narrow dark passageways in the rock. When we came up from the underground tunnels, we were taken round the corner into a private house, under which was an old roman theatre. We entered this through a trap door into the cellar of the house. The tour ended in an area with lots of nativity scenes in glass cases. Interesting tour, well worth the money.

Italy,Underground Naples,2.0,"My wife and I found the ""official"" Napoli Sotteranea tour particularly underwhelming.
If first impressions count .... the surly ticket collector certainly didn't help. Every question regarding tour times or facilities to leave a bag somewhere were met with annoyance and aggravation (you would think that a tour that requires people to walk through very narrow passageways could provide even basic facilities - e.g. a corner to leave bags out of the public eye - for customers paying the tour fee?)
The tour guide was pleasant enough, her English was reasonable/good although spoke too fast and due to poor acoustics of most places, we found it difficult to follow.
The spaces and exhibitions - The exhibits were very old and dusty and of general poor quality, a lot of emphasis was placed on the war time use of the underground spaces. A bit of professional guidance on setting up simple but meaningful and visually appealing exhibits would go a long way.
The visit to the old cisterns was interesting enough although very little was mentioned of the ancient period or artefacts that would have been interesting from an archeological point of view.
I never got the significance of the giant posters of a naked woman and man that seemed to be from a discarded perfume promotion..... and what was was it with the plant growing experiments....??.
The visit to the basements of the ancient Roman theatre was the most interesting part of the visit although the visit to the tacky recreation of a Neapolitan ""Basso"" ( street level house) was bizarre and rather banal.

I really enjoyed it plus we had the option of pizza afterwards which was very tasty and welcoming.",Oct 2018
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Eva from Greece was a great guide. We had almost gone to another underground tunnel across the street (almost same name) but we realised it wasn't what we wanted. We stumbled across the entrance to this tourist attraction which was perfect for us. 2 adults and 2 boys, 10 and 7 years. They loved it! Thanks Eva. My husband suspected he might be claustrophobic but he was ok and the boys loved this part. There is only a small part of the tour that would be a problem but you don't have to do it, or if you realise afterwards that you are claustrophobic you can take an exit and resume tour 2 minutes later. We then moved to 2 other areas nearby and that was great too.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Let me start by clarifying, this is NOT where you will see underground tombs or crypts. This is a tour of the ancient water systems built by the Romans. I give this ""excellent"" because the entrance for the guided tour is only 10 euros, the guide we got was this lovely greek young lady, she was fun, very knowledgable and made the tour extremely enjoyable. I did the guided tour in English, it was aprox. 1 hour 20 minutes. Part of the tour is to go through very close spaces, but the guides give you a heads up in case you suffer from claustrophobia. I really enjoyed the rythm of the tour, I didn't get bored and in addition to the underground water system they take you to old houses that have been discovered to be built on top of homes built by the Romans and Greeks. Napoli is a city with sooo much history underground, if you enjoy that type of tourism - I highly recommend.

To start the tour, you have to walk up 120 stairs & at the end you will be going back down those same stairs. The second warning is that to see the aqueducts, you must pass through some extremely tight spaces & if you are claustrophobic, this is NOT the tour for you.

Cost is €10 each and you start with a decline down a large number of steps to the sub terrain. Once there you are guided through a serious of areas that evidence the centuries of human occupation and utilisation of this alien environment.

We found the guide very good and greatly enjoyed her insight in to the various historical uses of the space. This combined with the left over evidence from the ""inhabitants"" helps to really bring the story to life.

A big bonus was the tour of the theatre afterwards. This was really amazing too. The way in which the modern city, and every previous layer of time are so intertwined is terrific. It makes you appreciate so much more the amazing history of the historic centre of Naples.

We paid 10 euros each for the tour in English, which was interesting. There are rather a lot of steps so you need to be fairly fit.

By far the most interesting part is visiting the old theatre under the traditional bassio house. Two stars for that.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"One of the most fascinating and unique things you can do in Naples. Many people are not aware of sea massive underground city that lies beneath the city of Bella Napoli. It has not been open for tours for very many years but now you can see it for yourself and it is absolutely fascinating. This is one of the most unique and fascinating things you will do on your trip to Italy. Venture beneath the streets of Naples to the ancient Roman ruins. Stand in a Roman forum very deep beneath layers of the city and look up and actually see the windows of a functioning apartment above you where people still live. This is Bella Napoli. A City built upon a City built upon ancient ruins. View the underground city that once held the inhabitants of the city of Naples hiding from the Nazis during the war and rising to the street to fight them off when there was no one but the peasants of Naples to protect their City. It is truly fascinating you will not forget. Many people visit Italy and many people visit Naples but many people don't know about this hidden treasure and this is the one thing that will make your trip more unique more interesting and more memorable. There are many different underground trips taking different routes of the massive underground city that runs all the way to Pompeii. You could do this 4 times and do totally different tours in different parts of the underground city. Whatever you do, do it at least one time.

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"The history given in the tour was interesting and for 10 euro it wasn't a bad deal. I probably wouldn't pay more than that. My 4 year old child was free which was nice. There are a lot of steps so if that is a problem for you, you would not want to go. There were also some very tight corridors (optional) that it would be hard to fit through if you were heavier or were carrying larger bags. They provide electric candles to see during that portion otherwise I used my phone flashlight. The underground itself was similar to other caves and underground spaces I have seen so the history is necessary to put the experience into context otherwise it could be boring. We opted to go on the 2nd part of the tour which was the Roman theater. It was also interesting but a lot was left to the imagination. It was a several block walk through masses of people in the street so that was a bit awkward. There was also several dozen people in the tour so it was sometimes hard to hear the guide and made it awkward to move along as a group.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"10 euros and worth it. Firstly, if you're claustrophobic and a bit overweight it might not suit you. You start off by going down 120 steps. Don't worry. After the tour you have to come back up! Basically the first part is underground. It starts off as a bomb shelter from WWII that just happened to be a roman underground water system. They didn't have to be extended that much as it's such a big system. To get to see the private roman reservoirs you have to go along a tunnel that is extremely narrow and not lit. In parts you have to go sideways. Be warned, it ain't nice.
After the amazing underground, back up the steps for a short walk to a lady's house where you go under her bed to the wine cellar. Go and see what's there. It's worth the trip.

As well, she spoke quickly, delivering a speech rather than telling a story. She also asked if we had questions but honestly, it felt like she hoped we had none.

Other groups with other guides speaking in a different language impede you from hearing what your own guide is saying due to their proximity. I realise this is the underground and therefore ""echo-y"" but staggering the entrance of groups might help with this aspect?

The way they managed the visit made it feel rather tourist-trap-like... in with this group, hurry up, get out and then, ""next!"".

Sounded and looked good so we made our way to the place only to be told the English tour must move aside. So there we were squashed in whilst hordes of other groups went down all paying there 10 Euro entry.

It was group after group after group so even when we were finally allowed to enter, the tour was ruined as you could hear the other groups speaking so you couldn’t hear the guide. The group sizes were also ridiculous - far too big - it really is all about how many people they can rush in and out.

The tour itself was boring and nothing like what was promised in the adverts. The only good part was stepping sidewalks down the thin walkway to the aqueduct. Definitely it’s saving grace but the whole thing just seemed like a man made tourist trap to make money.

For only 10€ (cash, collected at the door), we had a great tour guide who was super engaging and had pretty decent English. We were led through the underground tunnels (some very narrow, but people of all sizes and ages made it) and told their history. The story was very interesting and touching (some very real suffering happened during the war).",Oct 2018

Italy,Underground Naples,3.0,"While the underground is extremely interesting and different from others we have toured, there were too many people on our tour and the guide left many of us stuck in the narrow passages as she started and finished the descriptions of each room. When it was asked if she could ensure everyone was available before she presented details, she had a snarky reply and continuously failed to wait. It was as if she was rushing through the presentation. As it was, we were left to read online about details.",Oct 2018
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"We happened upon this tour as we were having a coffee, quite unplanned! We heard if there was anymore for an English speaking tour so we paid our €10 each and headed in. We didn’t know what to expect but it was truly fascinating to find out the history of subterranean Naples. Expect stairs and narrow tunnels so not for the claustrophobic and those with large backpacks! The guide was very informative. the tour lasted about an hour and a half and was worth it for a small insight to ancient times. If you have some spare time in Naples do try it out. It is in the historic quarter. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"We visited the underground aqueducts in Naples today. We did the English speaking tour which was very interesting.
These aqueducts have been around for centuries, supplying water to the old town. I believe the aqueducts covered over 200km of Naples and surrounding areas
The aqueducts were used in the second WW2 as air raid shelters
The aqueducts were closed in the late 18th century
This tour is well worth the money and time
I recommend it if in Naples. do the tour as you won’t be disappointed.
Approx 1 1/2 hour tour.
Also not to forget the 128 steps to get back up.

Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"This is definitely a visit worth doing. The guided tour takes your to the underground city of Naples - orginally a cistern system, then converted to air raid shelter during the wars.

You will be amazed at all the different walkways (some of which are so narrow that you have to squeeze through sideways) connecting the different areas under the city.",Sep 2018
Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,Took the guided tour which lasted a couple of hours. Really well informed guide explained the workings of the underground water system and how they were built and adapted over the years. Amazing engineering considering when these systems were built.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"Very interesting tour about life underground in Naples, with a funny and charming tour guide. Some bits are very narrow and dark, some members of our group took a later tour and got lost as they could not keep up through the narrow passageways so missed some of the good bits but they did find their way out without too much of a problem!

I am definitely pleased I did the tour 😊",Sep 2018
Italy,Underground Naples,4.0,"We did this tour more as a way to fill in time, but it was such a little gem. Yuri, our guide, was very knowledgable and funny. There are some claustrophobic parts, but the main one (and it really is a bit of a squeeze!) is wholly optional. However, it is worth it if you’re able to manage it : the cisterns that open up after the small tunnels are amazing. When the first part of the tour finishes, listen out and make sure to follow the guide - it’s not over yet, just because you’re back at the surface! There is another part to see, what’s left (to the public) of the original roman amphitheatre. For 10 Euro a person, and around 1.5 hours tour, it’s very worth it.

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,"We visited here yesterday as we thought it would be a great insight into underground naples. We actually came away due to the lack of professionalism of the staff. Not normally one to complain about service but my god, there was no way we were giving our money to them. Talk about rude. Firstly as someone else had mentioned in their review there is no info as to where to queue or get a ticket. Not a major issue until you open your mouth to ask one of the tour guides and get lambasted by them. Queued for 20 minutes before watching the guides all smoking, laughing and shouting at people who just wanted to know how to get out of their tour, then got bunched into countries like cattle, no point being in a queue is there? Then the tour guides decided all italian speaking people are going on the tour first and the english last. 30 minutes in,the manager is shouting at a tour guide telling her she is working tomorrow, it was still chaos and they were still speaking to the paying public rudely we had had enough and walked out. This seems over the top but 30 minutes into a queue and watching a half an hour show of how not to do service we couldnt take anymore, no matter how beautiful it is underground. We re sorry we didnt get to visit but they should be sorry for the shambles they are taking money from people for.

Don't be fooled, the real thing is the one just behind the church with the big face statue, not the one directly in the square. To attend you need to queue up and wait for the next tour. Staff is pretty tough during inital crowd control, but very knowledgeable and professional (our guide was Yuri). 10 euro for adults, 6 for children, 1 euro discount with ArteCard. They do tours in English, French, Italian and probably a couple more languages. Duration ~90 mins, including ""above the ground"" final part.",Sep 2018

OK, but not what we came for. “Napoli Sotteranea” is tucked away in a corner of the square and is 100% better than the fake one.

Great tour with a guide for €10. Don’t be afraid of the narrow tunnels or the stairs. We are a couple in our mid 70sand we did all of it easily.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"We’ve been looking for this place for quite a while in Via Tribunali and ended up going by mistake to a fake place right across the street. fortunately, we realized pretty quickly that it wasn’t the place we were looking for, and when we finally saw the blue flags of Napoli Sotterranea we were relieved.
Here are the reasons this place deserves a 5-star review:
1. The exceptionally good English the staff has - The best we’ve heard in Italy.
2. The way the staff handles multiple large groups (English and Italian tours simultaneously for example) - They didn’t shout or get mad, but very peacefully coordinated everything.
3. Stefania, the tour guide, was very enthusiastic, had a great sense of humor and gave a very interesting tour.
4. The place itself - it’s hard to grasp the size and complexity of this underground labyrinth, but walking through those narrow tunnels was a unique experience.

The only thing we’re sorry is that we had to leave early due to another activity we booked, and missed the second part of the tour (the Roman theatre), which I’m sure was as great as the first.

So, when you’re in Naples, be sure to go to the real Napoli Sotterranea with the blue flags and avoid all the fakes - you’ll know right away this is an entirely different level.

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"You can choose the tour guide based on language spoken. I chose the tour that the guide spoke English. The Greek/Roman aqueduct was amazing. If you do not like confined spaces or are claustrophobic you probably won’t want to take this tour. To get to the different aqueduct chambers you must pass though a couple very narrow passageways. On the second passageway you take a flashlight candle light and go though passageway walking sideways for about 100 meters before you reach the next chamber. I think the guide said it was 20” wide. The guide I had was very good and was checking with everyone to make sure they were doing ok. After the aqueduct tour is complete you come back to street level and go down the street to visit the discovered theatre that lies underneath a Neapolitan home.

But in its own way this is equally impressive. You can see the contents of the tour elsewhere so I won’t repeat them save to say that the ingenuity and vision which led to the building of this remarkable network of tunnels and tanks is deeply impressive as are the stories of those who worked to maintain them. They were told with wit and intelligence by the professional guide Steffania who then took us on to the separate underground remains of a Roman theatre where Nero performed his own works. It was discovered in the basement of an old woman’s house and is accessed via a trap door under her bed. You can’t make this stuff up. Wonderful.

Impressive architectural feat from the Greek before 400 BC to the Roman n Spaniards during the 15th century !

Italy,Underground Naples,5.0,"One of the many ""must do's"" in Naples. Our tour guide was Yuri and at 1.5hrs this tour is a total bargain. It covers multiple layers of history as you descend more than 40m into its cavernous depths - Greco tufa mining, Roman aqueducts, WWII bunkers, and Nero's lost amphitheater, the foundations of which are still used today. The stories of those who used and worked in the cisterns/aqueducts are harrowing.

Go early in the morning if you can because this site gets busy. We went late in the afternoon and encountered long lines and at times, chaos down below. Be advised that groups are large and it can be surprisingly easy to loose your guide when they overlap/pass each other, so stay close to him/her because they talk and move at a good clip (due to the amount of material and ground to cover). Much has been said about the aqueducts being only for the adventurous--way overstated imho. I'm claustrophobic and the only time I felt remotely uncomfortable was at the entrance, where the first 10-15ft has a low ceiling. The rest is a blast. I wouldn't recommend this for large individuals, however, because the passages do get narrow. It's slightly coolish in the aqueducts but not so much that it's worth carrying additional clothing--it will be a welcome relief from the heat of summer.

Our guide told us tales of how the cisterns were used and maintained in the past. We did a candle-lit, sideways shuffle through a VERY narrow passageway to get to a cistern that was filled with water. It was very cool to stand in the candlelight listening to the sound of running water. After making our way back to the surface, we visited the remains a Greco-Roman amphitheatre that was discovered under someone's home. The whole experience was amazing and I recommend this tour to those visiting Naples. The only caveat is that there are a lot of stairs going down and you have to climb back up. Those with mobility issues and anyone with claustrophobia, this tour is not for you.

Italy,Underground Naples,1.0,"Let me begin by saying that rarely do I make a public complaint. However, my experience of the Underground Naples guided tour has forced me into unusual territory.

My family and I arrived relatively late in the day (after 4pm), and requested an English tour. Before we knew it, we were whisked down 178 steps into the heart of the underground with a group of Italians.

Upon reaching the bottom, we were ushered to the left and the Italians went right. This was no “full English” tour as we were promised though. English yes, full no. We hared through the bunkers with a person who we initially thought to be our guide. His ‘encouragement’ was to shout “keep up” or words to that effect, as he aimlessly tried to flag down a half-completed English tour.

There was no regard for anybody’s health and my 70 year-old father understandably struggled to keep up. Health and safety regulations were nowhere to be seen as we bumped and bashed our way through the underground. There was no time for photos, questions or anything of the sort either.

Eventually we found an English group who we tagged along with, but they’d already had the bulk of the tour. We were charged 10 Euros each for 15/20 minutes of angst, panic and limited information. The tour felt like a scam, which is a shame because it was something we had been looking forward to.

We took a tour and our guide was able to bring the Roman town to life much more than we could have done if we had gone down there without her. It’s not exactly Pompeii but there is something about being down there, in a world where the sun hasn’t shone for centuries that felt just as intimate and revealing as a day at one of the bigger Roman sites around Naples. We paid about 25 Euros for a family of three and it was well worth it. At the end is a great gift shop.

The tour takes about 1.5 hours and covers the extensive history of the city. Not for the faint of heart or lover of wide open spaces--the tunnels and passageways can feel a little stuffy and claustrophobic at times (full disclosure: I chickened out at went topside, but my companions took amazing photos and had a great time!).

Plenty of items of the Nilotic civilization are shown on several floors and many rooms, such as statues, sarcophagi, papyrus, mummies of humans, cats and even a monkey which could be quite embarrassing for some people, so keep that in mind. The audio-guides (in quite a number of languages) are preferred, especially if it is crowdy because it might be hard to get close to the descriptions of the exhibits.
We did not choose the ""skip the line"" option, just went there a little earlier and the line was not too long - buying tickets took about 20 minutes at max.

The detailed explanations in English are really informative. However be warned the collection does include a number of mummified bodies of both humans and animals ( including cats and a baboon ! ) The cost of entry is normally €13, however as one of the temporary displays was not available the cost was reduced to €9.

Over several floors, so many exhibits and explaining very well in many details different aspects and also the evolution of Egyptian culture over hundreds of years. The original book of death, the mummies, and all the rest, are truly unique and invite to spend hours immersing yourself.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"This was an amazing museum! The collection is enormous, and displayed in forward-thinking ways with a mix of glass cabinets, videos, ""light shows"", and interactive displays. We spent about 2.5hours here at a leisurely pace, but could easily have used 4hours if reading more of the information displayed.

Count on at least 2-3 hours for a visit. The museum has really matserpieces in its collection, and the new set-up and arrangement is of a very high quality indeed. It can be rather crowded though in the museum, and, not the fault of the museum, many visitors spend more time on taking pictures and selfies than learning from the collection and audio guide. If you do not want to queue up to get in, please buy a ticket in advance, which specifies a time slot. That saves a lot of waiting time.",Feb 2020
Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"This museum is incredible. Very comprehensive, beautiful and informative exhibits. We arrived early Sunday morning to avoid the crowds. Note that backpacks or large bags are not permitted inside. They have a complimentary coat check, or you can use lockers on the premises. You will be provided a headset with recorded descriptions of the displays (many language options). Don’t be put off by the tour duration options (ranging from one hour to three hours), you only need to listen to the descriptions of interest to you so it’s completely self-controlled. We actually found that the descriptions on the exhibits were sufficient and didn’t use the pre-recorded information very much. Aside from the artifacts, there are displays showing the excavation methods and much more about the research techniques-it’s fascinating. This is a definite must see. Allow at least 90 minutes to appreciate this museum and increase the time based on your level of interest. Flash photography is not permitted but the lighting is very good so flash is not required.

There are 3 main floors and it is organized very well. If there was one complaint I did have, it would be that they have too much stuff. I don't like standing for too long and it took us around three hours to make the rounds. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting, but bring comfortable shoes. There are great shopping areas around the area and even a market on certain days, but I recommend the museum first, then the shopping if your feet allow. They do have a ton of free lockers. Ask the coat check for a key to a locker. You will have to leave your ID, but I feel it's more secure and in your control that way.

When I made my entrance, purchased the 15euros ticket, I left my backpack and went in. Too many people, not clear signs about where to go. Luckily they give you a free guide with headphones and you spend time, in line, listening to history. Sometimes the story is in German or other Language that you migh not know but you must be wonderwoman or superman if you are able to walk and read the translation at the same time. Those headphones are good and bad at the same time because you are completely in other space and some people are really Out Of Space walking like zombie absolutely absorbed by the listening, not aware about where to stand or walk.
Beautiful museum.
Funny inscription like Emergency Exit in English only. Are we in Italy or what?
Watch out for your children, even if you are making the treasure hunting that they give you at the entrance, you are not the owner of the place! Keep them close to you and avoid to run from a window to another.
Coffee shop is very little but clean. I had a good espresso there.

So much thought has gone into the design and presentation and the audio guide is comprehensive and well pitched. The objects themselves are incredible - the first painted cloth, a whole tomb's worth of grave goods, the delicately painted walls of another tomb, removed completely in a process called ""strappo"", which literally translates as ""rip off"". A whole, dark, mirrored room is dedicated to statues of the gods and pharaohs and another encircled and entire temple, gifted to the Italians as thanks for their help in moving rhe temple of Abu Simbel to save it from flooding when the Aswan Dam was built.

The written explanations in both Italian and English are very clear. The audio tour concentrates on selected exhibits. It’s helpful but I found navigation difficult. I was glad that I had bought a guide book at the shop before I looked around. It helped me to identify bits that I’d otherwise have missed. The gallery explaining the museum’s own history is well worth study, and sets the context for the careful excavations that yielded so many exhibits.

The museum is very popular and there are lots of school parties. Highly recommended, even if you don’t have a close interest in Egyptology.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"This is a very well organized and very large collection of ancient Egyptian objects. Easy to spend a day here. Lots to see but the main attraction must be the total contents of the tomb of Kha and Merit from the workmen's village of Deir el-Medina. Amazing. There are several books in the shop in English covering the collection, but sadly the book on the tomb of Kha and Merit is only in Italian. The audio guide is included, and may be very good, except it would take many more hours to listen and follow it. All the labels/text in the displays are in Italian and English but it can be hard to read the small text in semi darkness - in which case take a photo and read that! The small cafe is completely inadequate - but is about the only place where you can sit down.
I got there just 15 minutes after opening time and had to wait 30 minutes to get in - so arrive early. The problem seems to be that the ticket office processes people very slowly. The crowd inside builds up during the day. Probably best to visit Kha and Merit as soon as you inside.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"Popped in to see this museum of which we had heard so much.
The permanent exhibition is beautiful and among the richest we have seen and very well laid out. You flow smoothly through the kingdoms and dynasties with a rich collection of artifacts of all types in beautiful perspex (?) cases. From coffins with mummies, to all the contents of tombs, to the daily utensils used at the time. You can examine the exhibits from all angles and under good lighting. What is more difficult however is to read the legends on the perspex cases since the lettering is often too low down and on a transparent background. What is the greatest pity however are the audioguides. The idea of suggesting tours which last X minutes is excellent but it is difficult to follow such tours without a map which neither the ticket nor the pamphlet you receive really provide. Moreover it is frustrating when you follow a tour not to be able to deviate from your route. The audioguide for some reason won't let you introduce an exhibit number which is not on the selected tour. Finally we ended up sharing one audioguide because the other died on me. But don't hesitate to put this museum on your list and then follow your visit with a visit to the romana ice cream parlour round the corner.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"I have never been to the Museum in Cairo, but the Museo Egizio in Torino was excellent. We purchased small group tickets (up to eight people) through Viator, thinking that the Museum would best be visited with someone who could add color to the fabulous collection. It turns out that my husband and I were the only two people on the tour, so we experienced a private tour on the day we visited. Our guide was very nice, and she showed a great deal of excitement explaining the history and mysteries behind the artifacts. I believe she was an architect by trade, and at times we were not able to comprehend what she was telling us. At times, it was rather overwhelming. Two hours was sufficient to take in the highlights. I saw a lot of people using the headphones, and some of them looked overwhelmed with information as well. A visit to the Museum is something you must do while in Turin. You can spend hours in the Museum, but two hours was sufficient to take a lot in without being completely bogged down with an inordinate amount of information.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"I didn't know what to expect but everyone I spoke and every travel guide I read said this museum is a must see. I fully agree! We could have spent a full day here, so impressive if their collection of Epyptian historical items. By visiting the museum, you get a sense of the craftsmanship that already existed in the era of the Egyptian empire, from large things such as the pyramids, to the tiniest of things such as measuring instruments. Also on display are very daily items, such as flipflops/sandals, where it shows that flipflops one buys nowadays, are basically still the same design as the ones the Eyptians used.

A small tablet with audio guide with multiple languages is included in the admissions price and I found this useful on some occasions. I found the collection, and the historical impressions one gets from seeing all this so interesting, that it was almost too much to take in on one day. Very impressive!

If you plan on visiting two or more museums in Turin and/or want to take the elevator to the top of the cinema museum building, make sure to visit the tourist office of Turin, where friendly staff will help you plan the most efficient and cost-effective itinerary. There a different museum passes and tourist attraction passes that are really cheap compared to paying several regular entrance fees.

Italy,Museo Egizio,4.0,"Great Museum, go do it if you can. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because of the bag check-in guy. and also the bag policy in general. If you are wearing anything that is on your back (backpack or drawstring bag) you will have to check it. Ridiculous. My husband and I had 2 small drawstring bags and they guys wouldn't let use take them. While women were walking in with huge purses. Also, I traveled with an 10 month old. He wouldn't allow me to bring my formula or diapers! You need to redefine what a backpack is and when a baby is involved you need to allow formula and diapers to be brought in. Italy is supposed to be baby friendly, but you won't find that at this museum. If you do go and you have a baby, I would suggest arriving at 5pm. Its $5 per person and you get 1.5 hours to explore, which might be enough if you have an infant.

Italy,Museo Egizio,3.0,"Being one of the few places in the world where you can see so many Egyptian artefacts we put this on our must see things to do. Other than the sheer number of visitors in the place, the things that you could see and touch, it was amazing.",May 2019
Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"This has to be the top destination for anyone in Turin. The exhibits are all well lit and beautifully placed. Scholarship about Egyptian artifacts and life are ongoing; the staff is working on deciphering papyrus and so it is a very ""living"" museum as opposed to those who can become static and untouched.

The collection is just amazing; everything about Egyptian life is represented and some pieces in particular are just indescribable and better experienced than discussed. The statues on the first floor - I could have stayed a lot longer had I not been with friends. Those lion faces and regal bodies....go.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"I was hesitating to visit this museum as I've been twice in the great Egyptian museum in Cairo, so thought what more could I expect to see??
Now, when I've visited I'm more than happy I did. As many others said it's a world class one and there's no way you'll be disappointed. The exhibition has a perfect layout starting from the second floor, from the pre-dynasty era, descending down in a chronological timeline. Every item has both, Italian and English explanation so you really don't need an audio guide and add to that many LED TVs with short movies about the exhibit you're looking at.
TIP: Be there around 4.50 PM. From 5 PM the entrance fee is only 5 Euros (instead of 15) so you save a lot. The museum is open until 6.30 and those hour and a half are quite enough to see it all. Also, the museum wasn't crowded then, so we admired it in peace. I suppose there're much more crowds in the morning as it's one of top Torino attractions.

There's tonnes of exhibits and interesting displays. I wouldn't have expected that out of an Italian Egyptian museum. I also love that it wasn't too touristy and that it was pretty chilled and relaxed. I had a great time. If my feet weren't hurting, I would have stayed way longer.",Jun 2018

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"I was in Turin on 1 May so decided to do a couple of museums. I got there shortly after opening time, which was just as well as it had got really busy by lunchtime. I could have stayed much longer but it was getting tricky to get proper views of all the displays. I've never been to Egypt but this must surely be the next best thing. There was also a fascinating temporary exhibition on the top floor, entitled ""Invisible Archaeology"". The useful audioguide is included in the ticket price, always a bonus! You can choose various options, including a quick tour if you only have an hour or so.",May 2019

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"This museum has an amazing collection of Egyptian artefacts, all wonderfully displayed, with informative information panels. It is worthwhile buying a year's pass as there is so much to see here that you will probably want to make at least one return visit, if not more. The pass is valid for entry to many of the other wonderful museums and palaces that Turin has to offer, so it is well worth purchasing if you're planning to be in Turin for a few days/longer.

If you are interested in Ancient Egypt, then this first-class museum is a must-visit. You won't be disappointed.

While overall it was impressive with an amazing number of displays, I did find it confusing to use the audio guide which offered both a short and a long tour - a good idea in theory but confusing with different corresponding numbers for each tour. And it wasn’t always clear which direction you should go in to work your way through the museum. Still, I think I managed to see most everything and it was all very interesting.",Apr 2019

We went the only day it closes for the afternoon, so felt we probably missed out on a couple of bits, but having said that, we had been there for around three hours!! You won't be disappointed. March was a good time to visit, it was busy, but I can imagine what it would be like in the height of summer.",Mar 2019
Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"We really never had an appreciation or realized that various dynasties existed in Egyptian history until we visited this museum. It is organized in chronological order with a much appreciated coffee shop occurring in the right location for our visit. The audio headset added immensely to the exhibits. They use technology well however an incremental improvement would be like what they do at the Palais des Papes in Avignon where you can hold up the screen and get a recreation of the room as it looked at the time it was being used.

Some of the things we really liked include: lives of ordinary people, learning about the colors especially Egyptian Blue, the Temp Exhibit where we learned about 3D imagining of archeological sites, the evolution of how mummies were created, how archeologists had to create a way to date objects within a dynasty, and so much more.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,I have always been a fan of Egyptian history. We were looking forward to visiting this museum because of wonderful reviews saying that it had many artifacts. I was quite surprised to see how many sarcophagi were present and in such good condition. There were also other pieces of furniture and many other household items which were in quite good condition. They even had some papyrus with very clear colorful writing on them. I will say don’t bother with the audio tour as I didn’t find that useful. It was much more useful to walk around and read everything yourself.,Mar 2019
Italy,Museo Egizio,3.0,"Museum is great and has an extensive collection. The biggest collection outside egypt. Unfortunately some of the people in the museum are not that nice. Especially in the counter were you can deliver your bags etc for storage that you are not allowed to carry inside. In order to deliver the bag the lady wanted to keep my passport. Not over my dead body that i deliver a passport in order in order to let them keep my bag. The lady showed an item that contained a hell lot of drivers licences, passports etc. that the people visiting the museum had delivered. Guess this thing would be an eldoardo for some one who wants to copy your id. F.ex in my country you can be able to get acces to a lot of things only by having the personal number (which is in the passport). When i saw her extensive collection of id's i could mind thinking of how easygoing people are with such documents. Anyways after som arguing and quarelling i was allowed to deliver my bag and allowed in to the museum with my passport in hand. The lady said som dirty words to me in italian i assume.

So I was then shocked how nice the man i the royal palace was after meating this rude italian woman. In the royal castle the had traditional boxes where you locked your things self if you wanted.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"Being a historian, I am always struggling to present my studies, often boring and hard-core, to a larger audience. The Museo Egizio presents an excellent example for me. The audioguide offers both stories and systematic explanations of historic general trends, and the museum also attempts to explain how historians, archaeologists, and others worked on these materials: the dating of ceramics, the classification of mummies and sarcophagi, the recovery of items, and the reading of hieroglyphs or papyri, etc. Also good for children, but perhaps don't go there on Saturday morning since there are so many visitors.

The collection is so rich that even a professional visitor may be a bit tired when arriving at the middle of the exhibition. Luckily there is a typical non-expensive Italian café on the first floor.

Italy,Museo Egizio,2.0,Really looked forward to this one. Sadly it completely fails to deliver any kind of narrative. Instead you will find a lot of impressive pieces that are thrown at you without being put into context. Especially the videoguide is underwhelming. If you are interested in particular pieces it will blow you away. If you would like to learn anything about history there are so many better places in other countries. This is just pure randomness. Especially dont take your kids. They will be absolutely bored.,Dec 2018

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"I was a bit taken back initially by the ticket cost, and the ticket area was rather crowded so I expected the museum itself to be jammed as well. It turns out my wife and I spent the entire day in the museum and it was a wonderful experience. The museum is so large that there were never any crowds around the displays. The audio guide was really great and provided very good context for the displayed artifacts. The museum itself is layed out so that you can make steady, chronological progress through the many dynasties. In addition to the audio guide, the regular written explanations for each display case were written in Italian and English. So there was information for objects that the audio guide didn't cover. Finally, this museum covers all of the Egyptian dynasties and has wonderful, world-class objects. It makes me want to go to Cairo to see objects they have as well. My wife and I plan to return to Torino and revisit this museum again.

All descriptions are in Italian, English and (standard) Arabic.
The staff is very helpful; audio guides are available, as well as museum guides.
The path is clearly shown, and it is consistent throughout the whole exhibition.
There are not-to-be-missed rooms, and others that could be either skipped or briefly visited: the choice is yours.
You surely need at least three hours if you want to visit it properly. Possibly extra time is needed if you are going during peak season (from April until October) or peak hours (e.g. week ends).
Highly recommended to adults and families alike, especially if the kids are learning about ancient Egypt at school (i.e. 8 and above).

If you're taking a bag of most descriptions you'll have to get a locker, that'll cost you €1(you'll need some ID) but it's actually a godsend. Put your coats in there too. The museum is pretty warm, especially with the 500 other people all vieing for a good spot at each artifact.

You'll slowly walk around with your headset and handheld device, stopping systematically at exhibits and listening to the short video on your device, a nice way to do it I thought, many languages available too.
When they say they have the largest collection of artifacts outside of Cairo, you'd better believe it.
For €15 you could literally spend a half day here and probably still not take in everything on display.

I wanted to buy the tickets in advance (15€+2€) but discovered they were sold out for those days months ago! So we went there about an hour before opening time, and queued with another hundred visitors or so. We managed to enter quite easily, but the museum was already crowded.
The museum guides were kind of aggressive, stepping on you to get closer to the windows, families had strollers (which is insane since the passages are narrow), people were bumping against you from every side.
The museum is trending in Italy lately, while it was sort of neglected before. Thus, all the people visiting it just because.
If you are really interested in its collection (which is probably not the most stunning you’ll ever see, but it’s well organized and has some hidden treasures) and want to visit, buy the ticket on line, especially on weekends, and avoid public holidays!

When you buy the entrance ticket an audio guide is included. Great way of getting info with options of how long a tour you want to make (1 hour tour or 3 hour tour). backpacks have to be stored.
This collection is just amazing - and you also get the history of the collection and how and by whom it was built up which is also interesting. Amazing to see such old objects so well preserved - from the intricate and delicate drawings on the papyrus scrolls,even coloured sometimes, the old cloths, a wig of natural hair (!), the mummies, the sarcophages painted in bright coulours, temple rebuild, statues changed from one pharao to another, animal mummies (a film in a small room explaines how they preserve these hundreds and hundreds of animal mummies they have), frescoes showing cattle slaughter and the favourite dog of the 'master' and the harvest of grain... Really great! Go and see for yourself!
Long w-e à Turin - le musée Égyptien est un must si vous aimez l'histoire et les musées. Un audio guide est inclus avec le ticket d'entrée - avec des options de tours plus ou moins longs du musée. Personnellement on a passé 7 heures avec une pause au milieu dans le mini café du musée pour manger une tranche de foccaccia et pizza et boire un coup.
On apprend sur l'histoire d’Égypte mais aussi sur comment et par qui la collection du musée a été rassemblée - ce qui est aussi très intéressant. Incroyable la longueur des 'livres de morts' avec hieroglyphes et desseins merveilleux, parfois en couleur. Si vieux et si bien conservé! Des habits en tissus plissé, une perruque de vrais cheveux, bien sure les sarcophages peint, les momies, des momies d'animaux (un film montre dans une petite pièce comment ils sont conservés), des fresques montrant des vaches qui sont abattus, le chien favori du commanditaire et la récolte du blé, des statues refaits par un pharaon plus tardif à son gout, un temple reconstruit, de petites statuettes montrant des scènes 'ordinaires', ou ce bris de poterie peint montrant une danseuse acrobate.... bref - merveilleux!

Italy,Museo Egizio,3.0,"This is an outstanding collection of Egyptian antiquities. My major complaint is the organization (or lack of organization) of the museum. We did use the audio guided tour but found it very frustrating. There really is not a language problem as the guide is available in multiple languages including English. The problem is a lack of a clear starting point and finishing point. Also the signage is a hodgepodge of numbers, e.g., room #10, exhibit #10, audio tour #10 — all pointing to different things. Many of their audio tour numbers are not visible on the exhibits or are very difficult to find. We started somewhere in the middle on the second floor, not being able to figure out the proper starting point at the beginning of the museum. It was very difficult to even figure out where the first floor is located, as strange as that may sound. Part of the reason may be that the ticket sales are at level -1 and the first floor seems to be about six or seven escalators higher. We have been in museums where the audio tour seems to know where we are and tells us what we are looking at in that location. This audio tour program definitely doesn’t work that way. I think a museum like the Chicago Art Museum has a much better audio tour program and a much more clear-cut path to follow if you want to see different displays. I thought this one had great displays but a real lack of organization in finding them. Maybe the problem is me?

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"When most people think of seeing Egyptian artifacts in a museum outside of Cairo, I think they think of The British Museum (I know I used to)---how suprsing that a much larger Egyptian collection is in Turin, Italy (it is the largest collection outside of Egypt). There is so much here, and it is well laid and out explained----very, very worth a visit.

Good things to know:
-no backpacks of any kind (even string) are allowed in the collection rooms (nor larger bags of other kinds). There is a paid bag check which is 1 or 2 euro depending on the size of your bag. The system is a bit odd. First you wait in the bag check line to the right of where the entry ticket windows are. They'll access the size of your bag and charge you accordingly. You have to hand over a photo ID and then they give you a key to a locker which will either be by the restrooms behind the gift shop or on the far side of the escalators.
I wish I had thought to put a small tote bag in my backpack that I could take out at the museum as it was a bit much juggling the audio guide, map, my cell phone (to take photos--whici is OK without flash), the key and my wallet with no bag while I toured.

-I went midweek in Setember and there was no line at all. certainly no reason at that time of year to buy any sort of ""skip the line"" pass.

-The audio guide is one of the best I have ever encountered (and it is included with museum admission). There are three choices, a 60 minute ""quick tour"" a 90 minute ""family tour"" and a ""long tour"" which I think was 215 minutes. Even within the quick tour, you had several times you could click for more information. And you click on an item when you get to it and an go in any order within a room. I used the quick tour but spent about two and a half hours in the museum, including a snack break midway.

-There is a small snack bar halfway through the museum, with coffee, jouce, water, and sodas as well as pastries for reasonable prices.

-yu need your ticket to EXIT the collection at the end---so do not throw it away.

I had a day free so I took a train from Milan to Turin and my first stop was the museum.
I was very happy to come here.
The collection is amazing.

The items are well-displayed and there are English descriptions nearly always. An audio guide is included in the price of the ticket.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"Great museum, with an enormous collection inheritance of the first archaeologists, many of which were Italian, such as Schiaparelli, an Egyptologist, born in Occhieppo Inferiore (Biella), who found Queen Nefertari's tomb in Deir el-Medina in the Valley of the Queens (1904) and excavated the TT8 tomb of the royal architect Kha (1906), found intact and displayed in toto in Turin.",Jul 2018

It's worth it to get the audio since it highlights the notable objects. I think this is important if time is limited as you'll be able to view the collection in a day. This is definitely a museum that you could go to for more than a day and still want to see more. There were a lot of people when we toured but I never felt like it was too crowded.",Aug 2018
Italy,Museo Egizio,4.0,"The museum has a large collection of artefacts from the old kingdom which is different to many other Egyptian museums and the more well known artefacts. There are many examples of carved wooden sarcophagi that are very detailed and in great condition. This is the oldest Egyptian museum in the world and has an extensive collection. The last room contains fabulous statues which are the highlight but by the end of the visit you may be a bit too tired to fully appreciate it, which s real shame. The route is also a little confusing. You start in the basement where the ticket office is and then go up escalators to the second floor and work your way down to the first second and then ground floor. If you choose the long tour on the audio guide you get all of the numbers of the exhibits but like most guides it can get tedious. Spend 5 minutes working out how to use the maps and guide before starting as it can be quite confusing. In fact it is bit like driving around Turin...I only marked it down because of the convoluted route of the visit which detracts from the overall experience.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"Very well done exhibits. My recommendation is that you start early, when they first open, to avoid the crowds and give yourself the best experience to see up close the artifacts without a crowd of people. Then when you finish in 2-3 hours its the perfect time for a cafe or drink at Piazza San Carlo. There is much to see. I recommend 3 hours. There is a 1 hour expedite route with only the top highlights indicated. Follow this route if your time is limited. Audio guide docent is included with admission. Pictures are allowed without tripod or selfi-stick.

To start go to (-1) level to get the ticket, and then go up to 2 Floor to start. following the route down to ground level. The route is prepared chronologically with the first artifacts from the pre-dynasties, and then progresses through the historical periods. Very interesting to see the historical progression of the mummification process and changes to the burial traditions throughout the dynasty periods.
Many staff are available for guidance and help should you need anything.

Italy,Museo Egizio,4.0,"There is just so much material at this museum, as an archaeologist I found myself thirst for more information that was presented, it seems as though there is just too much for them to handle although what they do have is beautifully presented. Lots of information on the acquisition of the artefacts but not as much about the artefacts themselves, but I guess it would be easy to go the other way and overload people with information. You would need a lot of time to get around this museum, give yourself a good few hours, make sure you are fed and watered and wearing comfortable shoes, respect the displays and people around you.

The tour starts in the basement of the building moves to the top floor and works its way down in roughly chronological order.

The exception is the end point which contains the over life sized statues from the collection. These presumably cannot be located in the upper floors alongside artefacts that they are contemporary with. They are situated in a darkened gallery and are spot lit and are larger than life size.

The video guide though is a nice idea, but unfortunately it generates a horde of headless zombietourists who don‘t pay attention to they surroundings at all, which is a pitty. Combined with huge crowds (why don‘t you reduce entrances and raise the price for example) it makes a visit a bit nervewrecking.

The museum is fabulous. We thought we would be there for about one hour but it took over 3 hours to see this massive facility. Beautifully laid out, our admission included an audio tour and it added to the extensive written explanations in Italian, English and other languages available. It covered the Egyptian history from thousands of years before the Pyramids we all know, to 600 years after Christs passing.

Italy,Museo Egizio,4.0,"Museum quality and content: I’ve only visited about a dozen museums, but I was told that this one had the best Egyptian collection outside of Egypt itself so I felt like it was a must-see. It was mind-blowing how many artifacts of various sizes and significance were on display. There were mummified remains, pottery, tools, jewelry and even sphinxes. One thing that I appreciated is that the content of the museum didn’t overly focus on just Egyptian royalty, but also commoners and slaves. Be aware that the outside of the museum is deceptive – this place is HUGE with multiple levels and you could easily spend six or more hours there.

Logistics: We went to the museum within an hour of it opening on a Saturday and there was already a line outside of the building. They only let a certain number of patrons in at a time to try to control the crowding, which is good since even after we got in we had to constantly dodge and walk around people – very busy. Our ticket price did include an audio tour device but very shortly we abandoned them to work our own way around the crowds and since most of the signage was also in English. The portion of the audio tour that I did experience was good, but it would have worked better during off-peak times. Keep in mind that the museum has multiple levels so you will have to use stairs and escalators quite often (there are elevators for those who need them, but they’re not always convenient). There is a snack bar available, but due to the multi-level and labyrinth-like nature of the building, I highly recommend bringing along some bottled water.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"Museo Egizio in Turin is the astonishing collection of Egyptian artifacts, the largest and most interesting outside the Egypt and second in some ways in my opinion only to Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Museum was founded 1824 and is an oldest museum of Egyptian artifacts in the world.

Museum is situated in the center of the city, large building is easy to find as it is the most popular tourist destination in Turin. Large statues of goddess Sekhmet (not original) are flanking the entrance to this fabulous museum and can be seen from afar. There is usually a line for entrance to the museum, longer line during the weekends and vacation time. Very convenient option is to buy tickets in advance on internet, those tickets can be bought for exact time of entrance, and thus you can skip extensive line and go in directly at noted time (note that you must be by the entrance exactly in time). Take with you a print of ticket confirmation, show it to the guard at the entrance, and pick up your tickets in the ticket office, inside the museum. Ticket costs 13 Euro, large bags and backpacks should be stored at the cloak-room of museum, right from the entrance.
All visitors follow the visiting path through museum, so to say all visitors moving mainly in one and same direction through the 5 floors of museum, beginning to go up by the escalators to the top floor and then consequently proceeding down through exhibition halls until all the floors are seen. There is a café on the second floor, serving tee/coffee and some lighter food like croissants, very convenient indeed. The temperature in the museum halls is kept constantly at 24 degrees, which is good to know in order to dress comfortable and not be overheated.
The museum collection includes the most known, best preserved and perfectly exposed papyrus scrolls of the world, among others the most famous Turin King List, the Turin Judicial Papyrus of Turin, The Turin Erotic Papyrus and the ancient geographic map, the Turin Papyrus Map. Every period of ancient Egyptian civilization from Pre-dynastic to Roman periods is thoroughly shown through the extraordinary selection of exhibits, including a hall containing the rock-cut Temple of Ellesiya moved to Turin from Qasr Ibrim location in Nubia during the construction of Aswan High Dam in order to preserve the structure which would be otherwise submerged by waters of lake Nasser. Two large halls of the ground floor called Gallery of Kings contain perfect examples of statues of the Kings and Gods, the one hall nearly entirely dedicated to the architecture and sculpture from Temple of Amenhotep III in Thebes and its statues of goddess Sekhmet.
As a curiosity, on the way to from the main exposition, museum shows also a collection of forgeries and doubtful pieces. By the entrance there is a rather large and well-sorted museum shop, mostly books, postcards and some replicas of artifacts.
We were most satisfied with our visit to museum. The day we spent in the museum to see its large and very different collection compared with other museums of Egyptian antiquities will be long memorable.

Spectacular collection that is for the most part well organized although the audio guide does not always match up perfectly with the items being described.

I had recently been to the great museums in London and their collection of Egyptian artifacts pales in comparison to the Museum in Torino.

WOW!!! Beautifully displayed! The mirrors to see the back, the lighting) .... I had no time left. Oh well, I thought, we’ll go for lunch and come back. Had to hand in my handset and went to meet my husband.
What!!!! No return back in allowed !! What kind of bad vibes is this!?? No map of the displays was given, so I could have timed my visit better!, no where did I see that it was a no returns kind of place. So, you out there, reading this, take heed!
I still give it 5 out of 5.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"The main reason for coming to Turin was to visit the Egyptian Museum, which is one of the 10 largest Egyptian museums in the world. It was a modern museum, as it had been totally renovated and reopened in April of 2015. Thus, the displays were excellent and the rooms easy to navigate – except for one problem: Hordes of school children! Some of the rooms were clogged with them; so, we deviated from the “normal” way to visit the museum and ventured into relatively quiet displays.. The Museo Egizio is the only museum other than the Cairo Museum that is dedicated solely to Egyptian art and culture. The collections that make up today’s Museum were enlarged by the excavations conducted in Egypt by the Museum’s archaeological mission between 1900 and 1935. Some important items not to be missed are the Drovetti Collection, the Ellesija Temple, and the Tomb of Kha.

After nearly 4 hours, I had to rush through the end sections as I had to catch a train. Remember to pace yourself throughout the museum & they do have rest points because it does become overwhelming.

It's hard to explain the volume of artefacts there are & the incredible condition they're all in. it's a great place to experience & learn the history without traveling to Egypt.

If you're visiting Turin this should be first on list of things to see, it's absolute incredible & I wish I didn't have to live all the way in Australia because I'd love to visit again & really take my time seeing everything.

Also to the all the school kids visiting this museum, get off your damn phones & be aware of how incredibly lucky you are to have this museum in your reach. You have no idea how much I envy the fact you live in a country so rich with history, we don't get exhibitions of this quality back home.

Italy,Museo Egizio,5.0,"are just two of the remarkable objects (see photos) on view in the Museo Egizio, the world’s oldest Egyptian museum. The tombs of Kha and his wife Merit were discovered in February 1906 near Deir el-Medina. Although non-royal, Kha held the prominent position of “director of works.” In this capacity, he oversaw the building of the Pharaohs’ tombs and, during his career, served three 18th Dynasty kings. The couple’s burial goods reflect their status, and the scope of the objects unearthed is astounding – among them Merit’s beauty case, Kha’s work tools, underwear and food offerings. The exhibits are presented with attention to detail - one wall even had a box installation so visitors could smell a combination of spices such as cilantro and tarragon that were used in Egypt.

The Gallery of Kings with its statues of the Pharaohs and Sekhmet, the lion-headed goddess, is jaw-dropping. The figures are multiplied by mirrored reflections making it one of the most impressive installations I’ve ever seen; I actually got chills when I entered this gallery. An interesting fact mentioned in the guidebook is that Jean-François Champollion, the French scholar who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs, came to Turin in 1824 to study this collection. He was particularly taken with the statue of Ramesses II (see photo) which he called the “Egyptian Apollo of the Belvedere.”

The only drawback to my visit was the overcrowding; I went on a Saturday and there were so many people that I had a hard time getting near the cases to see the displays. Finally, I stationed myself in one gallery and listened to the audio guide (included with the admission fee) until the crowds had thinned.

If you’re staying in Milan, it’s very easy to get to Turin. I took the Frecciarossa high speed train and arrived there in an hour. If you opt for a tour of the city, make sure that it includes a stop here and that you see the Gallery of Kings. It’s a mistake to leave Turin without visiting this fabulous collection.

Not feeling safe to go to Egypt itself, she has toured the Metropolitan Musuem in NYC and many other exhibits and had wanted to go to this one for sometime.

We were not let down. The collection was vast and besides the Musuem in Egypt itself, it's the largest in the world. Well organized over a few floors where a very good self guided, audio program takes you through a collection of artifacts covering thousands of years of this great ancient culture.

A must while in Turin and a must if interested in ancient Egypt!

Italy,Museo Egizio,3.0,"Though this museum is chock-full of artifacts, the organization leaves lots to desire, especially when entrance for our family (paid for 2 kids and 2 adults) was over $60. For instance, when we entered we were handed audio guides that were not user friendly. They were organized by floor - but not all the sub sections of a floor were together, so were not easily identifiable. It was also not posted which part of which floor you were in (tombs vs artifacts), which means you couldn't then find which items within the subsection had audio support.
In addition, when you entered the museum, one of the first displays gave information on a person who was instrumental to bringing the museum pieces to Turin, but later in the exhibit there was more information on the person who actually started the movement 10 years before. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to the organization.
My favorite parts were the room of sarcophagus & the Hall of Kings; if you visit, I suggest skimming much of the repeat displays (hundreds of small almost identical figurines, hundreds of pieces of broken pottery, etc) before you get tired and bored and devote more time to the final two areas of the museum.

Inside the beauty and craftsmanship is extrordinary. We took the the sky experience for 5 euros (cash only, no credit cards). The staircase up was fun, but not for the mobility impared.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"If you have a few days in Bologna, then I would definitely recommend doing the walk. If you don’t have much time, then you can get the ‘San Luca Express’, a novelty tourist “train” that leaves from Piazza Maggiore (€10 return). There’s also a public bus (#58). Whilst the views from the top are nice and the basilica is lovely, the walk is what makes it special.
The walk is quite unique. You walk uphill under porticoes the entire way, following in the footsteps of 15th century pilgrims. Since the 1400s, the sacred picture of Mary is carried down from the basilica to the city in an annual procession every May. In the 1600s the porticoes were built to offer extra shelter and protection to Mary during the ceremony. That seemed like a special enough thing to make me want to do the walk.

How To Get There:
To start, we walked along Via Saragozza. Look out for the Arco del Meloncello, a striking salmon and yellow coloured Baroque style overpass. Use this to cross above the busy street and from here you simply follow the porticoes. You really can’t get lost.

Level of Difficulty:
The walk is relatively easy in one sense because it is a stepped path so the uphill walk is even and fairly gradual. However, it is a long walk (3.8km) and whilst the rise might be constant and steady, it is also unrelenting.

What To Take:
The porticoes provide shelter from the sun (or rain), but you can get pretty hot on a warm day. Make sure to take water because there’s not really anywhere to get water on the way up. At the top, you can refill a water bottle.

Points of Interest: the Mysteries of the Rosary are set in 15 small side chapels along the way. Most are faded and enclosed by fences and railings, but they are a reminder that this is a religious pilgrim’s walk.

At The Top:
Once you make it to the top, the views across the countryside are lovely and there are several seats positioned so you can sit back and enjoy the views. The San Luca basilica is a striking building but unfortunately it is closed in the middle of the day. We didn't think to check this before leaving so for anyone else who is planning to do the walk, you should plan to arrive before 12.30pm or after 14.30pm when the basilica will be open. Entry is free. The main thing that we wanted to see of course was the image of Mary that gets carried down to the city each year. Whilst we were disappointed to miss this, to be honest the walk was still pretty special and the views at the top were worth it.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"The Santuario di Madonna di San Luca stands high on a hill and over looks central Bologna and here are two ways you can get up there.You can catch a land train which goes from the Piazza Maggoira and costs 10 Euros return or if you feel energetic you can walk the two mile portico that goes from the old town up the steep hill to the church.The church interior is quite impressive with a lovely alter but be aware that the church is closed between 12.30pm until 14.30pm each day.Aswell as the church itself the other bonus here is the panoramic views from here.The hill is directly above the old town and has great views right across Bologna one side and across the hills the other.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"You can get to the sanctuary by walking up through 666 porticoes from Piazza di Porta Saragozza. Many people run or walk or cycle up and back down. It is 2.3 miles. I took the San Luca Express train which travels through the streets up to the sanctuary. It has a pick-up point at Piazza Maggiore. It costs €10 return.
The church is beautiful with wonderful views of the lands round about. In the church is a much revered Byzantine style image of the Madonna.
It can be very busy at weekends.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"The commentary talked about a hermit who visited Hagia Sofia, saw the painting and then persuaded the monks that it belonged on a hill in Italy which by a magic set of coincidences turned out to be here. Great story. I think there was an additional miracle of the hermit being cured of his handicap.

My wife and I have been to Hagia Sofia and she detected ""quotations"" in the architecture... I agree that
the roundness of this Baroque structure reveals a
special architectural message.

The price of €10 is perhaps a bit too much for the ride and the information received. But if which walk you should have taken otherwise, then it is worth it! However, if you are not afraid of some training, go on foot. (Don’t forget some water) Start your tour at the ""Arco Bonaccorsi"" and walk through the longest covered colonnade in the world!

Once you have reached the top, you can relax on the benches or in the ""Santuario"" itself (Free). Be sure to check out ""The icon of the Virgin Mary, allegedly painted"" by Luke the Evangelist!

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"We took the toy train up to the sanctuary. Previous reviewers talked about the bunfight to begin the train. They seemed to have listened in the up direction. The train provides an interesting tour of the south west of Bologna, following the line of the porticoes for quite a bit of the route. The hill up is a killer. I would suggest don't try walking if you have buggies or wheelchairs. But once at the top the views are majestic. It is worth paying the extra to go up on the dome. It provides wonderful views, but a shame the terrace is only on the south west side of the dome. This leads to limited views down over Bologna. Watch the times the place is open: the dome closes at lunchtime and the church closes for services!
The train back is still a bunfight. But be polite and respectful of the needs of those around you.

The walking path was easy to find & follow, just follow the constant stream of people & steps! It's quite a long walk & gets a bit steep at times so if you're not used to exercise, you can easily take a break to the side & admire the views.

The views at the top are stunning (although it can get a bit busy), with 2 free water fountains (which is really handy) & a toilet for €0.50 (well worth it as it's so clean!).

For those wanting to cycle, the road is steep & gruelling but there were plenty of cyclists enjoying the challenge!

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"I did this with my 10 year old and it was quite a hike. But worth it!
Tips: comfortable shoes (sneakers), bring plenty of water and wet wipes to wipe off the sweat at the end of the hike.

Also, ladies, if you are planning to visit the church at the top, don’t wear shorts and bare shoulders. This is a religious site. I constantly saw American tourists inappropriately dressed for visiting churches throughout my trip.

And yes, it saddens me to say this, but by far Americans were the biggest culprits. Some outfits were outrageous. If you wish to dress like that please don’t go into a church. Carry a long skirt in your backpack that you can slip over your shorts. Or a maxi dress. There are so many solutions. Remember that you are a guest in the country - respect their customs & traditions.

The Basilica di San Luca sits atop Monte del Guardia about 300 meters above Bologna. It is connected to the town below through a remarkable 3.8 kilometre covered walkway (which is said to be the longest portico on the world). The walkway is steep and full of steps, incorporates works of art dating back centuries and provides many spectacular views along the way. The serenity of the Basilica itself is complemented by an upper level panoramic view of Bologna and the surrounding countryside which we enjoyed. For us the hike up and back was about ten kilometers including the kilometer each way from our B&B to the start of the portico. It was both exhilarating and exhausting and perhaps our fondest memory of Bologna.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"To be honest the interior and exterior of this church are good but I have seen much more spectacular in Italy, and especially in Sicily. But what makes a visit here so special is the total package of the Church and the unique climb through over 600 arches of portico with a total length of almost 4km if you start from the centre of town to get there, and then the commanding views over Bologna, both from the steep section of the portico at the top and the church itself when you do.
You can reach the church utilising the San Luca Express land train from Piazza Maggiore that costs 10Euro, but for those that are fit and able I would recommend setting aside 2 to 3 hours and walking it. Yes, the top section is steep and will give you impressive heart rate readings on your Fitbit, as well as murdering the daily step target. But this way you get to take in the impressive Bonaccorsi Arch and the even more impressive Arco Del Meloncello before you begin the final climb to the church. Our B&B was close to the Bonaccorsi Arch and we joined the portico here. From this spot it is 3.4km to the church and will take about 50 minutes to an hour. The church is free to enter and there are toilets (which will cost you 50c) but no refreshments at the church but on the way back the flat section of the portico between the two arches has plentiful bars and café’s where you can grab a drink and something to eat.
Advice I would give after our experience would be.
1) Pick a fine weather day and walk it if you can.
2) Do the walk early in the morning. This way you avoid the crowds and doing the climb in the heat of the day.
3) Take a couple of bottles of water
4) But utilise the flat portico section on Via Saragozza for its bars and café’s.

We started off our travels at the Piazza Maggiore making our way through the streets of the inner Bologna city wall before reaching the first of the 666 Porticos. Walking the first 300 Porticos is relatively but during the second half, and in particular towards the end it becomes a major workout routine! Fitbit warriors rejoice! Even though we are keen walkers we did get quite out of breathe. However once reaching the top we were greeted by the impressive sight of the basilica. We arrived at the Basilica exactly at noon and mass had just started at the basilica. Being Catholic we sat in during the mass admiring the beautiful surroundings of the church and its calm atmosphere. I'm glad we went in for the mass because as soon as mass had ended and we had just began to further look round the basilica we were frantically shooed out of the basilica by an attendant and then the church was locked up for 2 hours! This is quite disappointing as we wanted to have far more time to look around the church and it just seems odd to close such a prominent site during the middle of the day! Still it did not ruin our time at such a beautiful site. It was definitely a much easier descent down through the porticos. For those who do not want the gruelling effort of walking up to the Basilica there is a tourist train up to the site.

A very pleasant way to get fresh air, exercise and see the Santuario di Madonna di San Luca.
There are toilets at the top (50cents), pleasant area to sit as well.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"We got a taxi up from the main square, 11 euros, beats the San Luca “train“ if not walking up.. We walked back down which was pleasant and took a while.

Looked like locals on the track don't bother with gym membership. If you are fit and feel you have work off the local delicacies you might find walking up helpful.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"We were advised that the best way to see the Basilica is to take the train from Piazza Maggiore (10€) and then walk down. That was great advice and we are glad we did this. The train leaves on a regular basis and maps can be obtained at the Visitors Centre in Piazza Maggiore. The train provides head phones which gives a commentary of the surrounding area. Once at the top, we got off, walked around then took the walk back into town. It was a pleasant walk down but was very crowded. If you buy the train ticket, you can take the train back down but I think it is preferable to walk down and see the area. Along the way, there are fruit stands and coffee shops to take a break.",Mar 2019

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"First of all its outside of the city, you can decide if you take the bus and climb from the bottom or take the car or train from Piatza Majore which drives up directly to the monastry. Its a hike up for 30-60mins depending on your speed. The train is including info from headphones but with limited view as 4 people sit in one row. The church is nice but dont expect view on Bologna.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"We had intended to catch the little train from the main piazza to go up and then walk back as previous reviewers have suggested. Sadly, we visited at the very end of the off-peak season so the train only travelled on Monday and Friday. We had arrived late afternoon Monday and were returning Friday morning so decided to go it alone. As two young 60 somethings we are of average fitness so decided to walk on a hot (for February) day - 19 degrees. We were grateful that the entire route is underneath the porticoes so we were in shade.However, I would hate to have done this in the heat of Summer. Some parts are paved inclines; some have steps; we didn't race and still managed to make it to the top in 1hour 15 mins. Coming back it's easy - 40 minutes max. To be honest, we were slightly disappointed with the views so paid an extra 5 euros each to climb the 110 steps inside the santuario to see the view of Bologna using the binoculars that are handed out. The porticoes make this a unique experience so well worth doing if you have time. There are toilets at the top if needed, but no refreshments so take water.

The walk is not as hard as it sounds, the portico provides shade and, although a little shabby in places, its a lovely thing to walk up. The views at the top are well worth it both of the church and the surrounding countryside. the church was just closing when we arrived so if you are intent on seeing inside its worth checking the opening times before setting off.",Sep 2018
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"We visited it at the beginning of December 2018. We took a hop-on hop-off train from Piazza Maggiore (10 EUR pp both ways) as we felt very tired to climb up the hill. The train ride was quite satisfying itself. The train stops on the top the hill where passengers can hop-off a short walk from the Basilica. I suggest to walk some 100m in the opposite direction. There is a great view from over a bridge or something like that. The Basilica is very beautiful and there is a very nice small park surrounding it. You can climb the dome if you wish (5 EUR donation). Have in mind you can only get to the top through a very narrow spiral staircase. I don't think it is worth the effort. There is a side view to the town and you can maily see the surrounding hills.

The basilic a itself isn't up to much, fairly standard Italian baroque church but in a great position with views over the surrounding country and parts of Bologna.

The graffitti on the porticos detracted from the piety of the place. The drawing attributed the evangelist Luke is interesting, and engenders tremendous devotion from many devout Catholics who were there on pilgrimages.

From the centre of town, the walk is 4km long through the world's longest portico, and includes quite a bit of climbing and stairs in the second half of the walk. But the view from the top is worth it! (Plus it's a nice little workout.) You get a view down into the city of Bologna on one side, and towards the hills leading to Florence on the other.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"Whoa, this was amazing. Had read about some intrepid soul in the 1930s building a cable car up the steep hill to the summit and Basilica of San Luca only, after public outcry that this circumvented the effort of reachingbthe top to such a sacred place on foot. With this in mind we walked to the top from the beginning of via Sarragozza. This, although exhausting by the end, was the best thing we could have done. At the top we felt like we had acheived something worthy of entering what turned out to be an amazing sacred building - San Luca Basilica. It was breathtaking. We listened to the audio via headphones (situated inside near the entrance), sat in contemplation, high above the altar looking at the sacred relic if the Madonna and baby Jesus, and then ascended the 100 steps to view the panoramic 180deg vista of Bologna far below. It was an experience that, for me, will live in memory forever.

They even stop past the church so you can take photos of its hilltop position,Sep 2018
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"We walked up to the basilica from the centre of Bologna. It is about 3 miles so, if you’re doing it from the Centre, wear comfortable shoes. It is all under porticoes so sun exposure is not a problem. En route there are several Mysteries which are paintings depicting scenes from Christ’s life and finally the assumption of the Virgin and her crowning as queen of heaven. They are not very good, frankly, and not worth making the trek to see.
The view from the Basilica is worth seeing. You get great views over Bologna and towards the Appenine hills. You have to pay €5 to go up to the top of the cupola which allows slightly better views but you are restricted to only 2 sides of the cupola. The interior of the church is sumptuous and magnificent and there is a Byzantine mosaic which is particularly revered there. There is a cafe outside the Basilica as well so you can get refreshments and there are toilets at the Basilica too.

At the 666th portico is a giant crucifix representing good dominating over evil. Fantastic views from the top.

We found when we got there that you can also get a bus. The views are stunning and the church itself lovely. There was a mass on at the time we were there on Saturday morning so we didn’t look around inside but the singing to be heard on the way up to the panoramic view from the top of the dome was a bonus.
You don’t pay for the church or grounds but it’s 5€ to go to the top which is good value and goes towards conservation.
There’s a restaurant/bar just past the bus top which is a great place to have a drink and the food looked good and was reasonable.

Alas, I decided to take the San Luca Express from the Piazza Maggiore. Your ticket is a return. It was a great decision as 1. I saw a part of Bologna that I would have not seen, 2. It was a very hot day. The ride to the top makes you grasp the true length of the portico. Once at the sanctuary, you get stunning views of greenery on one side and the city on the other. You may enter to have a look and it is serene inside with fine art all round (for females wearing sleeveless tops there are shawls near the door free of charge). €5 gets you a ticket to the San Luca Sky Experience, which go towards the church’s maintenance. It’s a viewing platform (balcony with astro turf grass) that’s quite small but it wasn’t crowded at all when we went. To get there you have to climb over a 100 steps on a very tight winding staircase (not for the faint hearted or claustrophobic!)The views there are stunning but there is no shade.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,2.0,"Santuario di Madonna di San Luca is a local pilgrimage where Catholics go to pray. It is located on the top of the hill just in the outskirts of Bologna and you can go there, either on foot, following a long arcade or by bus.

According to the legend, a miracle happened when Bolognezi prayed to Virgin Mary begging for long and severe rainfalls to stop. To rememeber the fact and to celebrate the miracle, the Holy Statue is transefered every year ever since downtown Bologna for a week celebration, a big fest for the locals. Although the story might sounds interesting, being there is totally different.

The arcade is long and you can make it to the start of the stairway again either on foot from the city center or by bus. If you are to take a bus be aware that bus drivers do not speak English and therefore you need to have all the information needed in advance. However, there is a mini bus riding up the hill every hour. This is the best option if you are not willing to walk but you may be standing all the way since there are only 7-8 seats. Then again, on your way back you need to get off from the mini bus and change to an other one.

From a toursit point of view, personally, I think it's a big don't and you miss nothing if you do not pay a visit. You spend so much time being there and it's not worth it. If you are on a city break and you haven't rented a car you need to consider this. Also if you think that you get a lovely view of Bologna's red rooftop, nope, you don't. Do not be misleaded having in mind views like the ones you get in Rome from Piazza del Campidoglio or in Florence from Piazzale Michelangelo or in Paris from Sacré-Cœur etc. Be happy with a partial view of Marconi Airport and some green field around. No view points, not even on the way, no stands and nothing to do around waiting for next bus to arrive. Lucky me; it was a sunny day! Otherwise I would have to pray to Virgin Mary for the rain to stop. And in Bologna, it rains a lot...

The local small train also goes there for 6 euro from the Piazza Maggiore.
The chapel is indeed pretty and peaceful and it's possible to get very close to the relics for those who want to pray.

Hats off to those locals running up there.",Jun 2018
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"This church is beautiful. At the end of a long colonnade, and a strenuous enough climb, the church and surrounding did not disappoint. Overlooking Bolonga and the surrounding countryside the view was spectacular. I would highly recommend a visit. It can be accessed by road but it is better if you walk there. A tip bring comfortable shoes!",Jun 2018
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,3.0,If you want to see the city from afar this is a good site but the building itself has seen better times and there is nothing else to see or do.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"To get to this incredible Sanctuary you can walk through the longest portico in the world uphill through 666 arches. Or... if you are a bit less than in perfect physical condition or have bad knees, you can take the San Luca Express tram from Piazza Maggiore in the historical center of Bologna up to the Sanctuary which sits on top of one of the tallest hills in the area. The tram provides a nice tour (with audio commentary in a number of languages) of many historical aspects of the city on the ride to the Sanctuary so you get a nice overview of some of the sights. From the top you can look out at the city of Bologna on one side, and at the mountains that form the border with Tuscany on the other side. After you have gotten your fill of the beautiful Sanctuary and the breathtaking views, you can then hike down through the Porticos and continue seeing amazing views of the city as you go. Or you can catch the tram line back into the city center and see the rest of the city tour. We almost didn't go because some of the reviews said that the views were not that great but we are so glad our airbnb hostess said that we should go. We walked back down to the city through the porticos and it was quite a wonderful experience. Being able to ride up and walk down, rather than having to walk both up and down, made it doable for us fit but older folks who wanted to be able to walk the next day!

We walked all the way from the Saragozza Gate...under every one of the 666 arches. Definitely worth it for the view and the gelato we treated ourselves to afterwards. There are a few places under the portico that you can get out and walk on the road...still steep, but those last sets of stairs are killers! Bring water and wear comfortable shoes.",May 2018

I’m glad we decided to visit .",Apr 2018
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"We visited on Sunday during main service was a little odd, especially as some tourists were not very respectful. We queued for the 360 degree views from the top which was well worth it.
Do take food with you as there isn't much on offer. We took a tastey breakfast with us and enjoyed that on the grass outside the church. Lots of jealous looks!
A cab to the top cost €18. There is also a tourist train, but not really my style.
We walked the 4km to arch number 1 back now which was very pleasant on a hot day. Much better that seeing the red faces of people walking up the hill.
DO check opening times, after hiking up there you would hate to face a closed gate!There are toilet clean toilets to use, although again I think they are only open when the church is open.
Well worth the visit.

The fact that you can walk all the way in a covered path adds value in case the weather is rainy (or too hot, for that matter). It´s a relatively long, but easy walk for anyone who can walk, some parts are more steep, some less. But sooner or later your reach the basilica, which is definitely worth the visit.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"The options for getting there from Bologna are either walking the Portico di San Luca(which we did) 3.2km plus getting to the start or taking the tourist train the runs from Piazza Maggiore. I think you get a better sense of achievement if you walk, it’s a challenge that’s rewarded with some great views, free potable water(keep your water bottle to refill) and a toilet, happy days. But realise not all people can walk it. The Basilica is free to enter but if you want to go on the roof it’s 5 euros. Remembering that the Basilica is shut daily between 12 and 230. You have to sign a damage waiver. The roof is accessed by a spiral staircase, some stop off points. It’s a challenge. Some good views from the top but it’s a 180 view that doesn’t include Bologna. The staff are really helpful and friendly. You get a pair of binoculars to borrow for the views. Thanks.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"Just outside Bologna, located on a hill is this 19th century church. It houses a painting of Maria and child, supposedly painted by Saint Luke, hence the name of the church. The painting is in Byzantine style, and is mostly covered with silver, in the eastern orthodox style. However, the main reason to visit is to climb to the viewing platform (about 100 steps), and have a great view over the hills surrounding Bologna. There is also a view of the city, but you are a bit too far to maken out many details and buildings. Easiest way is to take the little tourist train (running on normal tires, and leaving from piazza maggiore). Otherwise, you can follow over 3 km of arcades to reach the church. Note that the church and viewing platform close at midday for siesta, so if you want to see the church inside, avoid the trains arriving between 12 and 14:30.

You are walking under porticos that cover many pavements in the City, so even on a sunny day you are protected from the sun. This is a long steady uphill walk with sloping walkways and sets of stairs. At the top the church itself is fairly modest but the setting is very attractive. In February there were no facilities other than some fairly grim toilets, so think about taking a drink with you. There are many cafes en route though. Parts of the view are restricted and others only open at certain times, as is the church itself, so check before going.

When going uphill, you have your back to the views, at one side the wall, at the other side a road and fences and tall trees.........behind which you can sometimes see a glimpse of a villa.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"Getting to San Luca takes some planning. You can buy a ticket on a train that will take you all the way up to the church drop you off and you can ride back when it returns (more than an hour later, I believe.) That's a long time to be up there- and, you miss the beautiful stroll up the famed porticos. Instead, I recommend taking the bus (#20), which takes you from the city center to the entrance to the porticos. You can get directions from the tourist office- and can buy tickets (one there and one for the return) from a marked tobacco shop. The walk through the porticos was wonderful- just as, if not more, interesting than the church itself. Thew views from the church are stunning and inside it is beautiful- much more so than the main basilica in city center. You can purchase a ticket to access the top, but I didn't do that. I viewed the church (free), took photos and descended the porticos, all quite satisfied!

Nice sanctuary at the top and for a small fee you climb 110 steps to top of church for the Sky view. Steep narrow climb however!
There were many people walking up but if your not fit I would not try it!
Some nice views walking back down also great view of Bologna FC for footie fans.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"My nephew told me that walking to portico to San Lucca was his favorite walk in Bologna and now I know why. It is the longest portico in the world with 618 arches and rises nearly 1000 ft up a series of steps and pavers. So steep in places that The cyclists on the side road were doing the Paperboy! And to add to the suffering, every 100 meters or so there was another station of the cross. Quite a pilgrimage feeling and so glad I did it, though by the time I got to the top I had sweated clear through my shirt! Nice views at the top, too.",Oct 2017
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"What a great place to visit.
After walking up 666 porticos (arches) you are greeted by a rather unassuming church surrounded by rather pleasant gardens with views down to the city.
Go on - brave yet another church as you will not regret it.
The church is modest but wonderfully decorated in blue and green marble.
Additionally, for the measly fee of 5euros you can ascend the 107 steps up to the base of the dome where you can view Bologna and the surrounding hills with the supplied binoculars.
A great day out with a little exercise as a bonus.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"A must do in Bologna - esp when you indulge in the local food - walking up the porticos to the top.

It took us approx 1 hour from the centre square to reach the top, and we're good walkers. It's a lovely walk with great views and scenery overlooking the town, but wear walking shoes as it does get relatively steep.

We didn't actually go in the Santuario but just walked up and went back down!

There are lots of lovely local cafes, food shops and stores at the start of the walk that are worth a look!

My friend and I walked from the hotel in the city centre the more than 660 arcades to the top and back which is definetely a good exercise. You can also take a small train up there or the bus/taxi. I found the church very beautiful, with pink/blue marble and nuns were chanting when we were there and made it into a magical experience. The views are mostly towards the countryside and very peaceful. When you walk up you can find some shops and coffee places, but once you will leave the citygate and arcades there are no shops anymore.

We took it both directions, though next time I would perhaps take the train up and walk back through the longest portico in the world. Instead, we just walked a little ways down the portico from the top and took some pictures, which was definitely enough to get the feel of it. The views were lovely from the top of the hill, and the outside of the church is very nice. Inside is nothing too spectacular, though it is very light and airy. There was a service going on which was cool to see that it is still an alive place of warship.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,2.0,"At least I can say I walked up the longest Portico in the world . It`s length varies depending upon which description you read, but could be 3.8km according to Wikipedia. It is steep, consisting of steps and slopes and is some physical challenge for an someone with walking difficulties like me. Imagine walking around 2.5 miles but up an incline of probably 35 degrees or more.

You can get the ""Train"" and I would recommend it if you are intent on seeing the building as the walk is simply exhausting unless you are fit or take it very slowly. It is quite interesting from the outside but disappoints on the inside being large and without atmosphere, in my opinion.

The much publicised view must be seen from the Cupola ,so check if it is open on the day you visit. It is a great disappointment from the grounds ,as the panorama is limited and partially obstructed and overlooks the mainly industrial area of western Bologna only giving a great view of the aircraft taking off from the airport.

There were four Portaloos at the top but on the day I visited with my companion, but none could not be flushed through lack of water, the hand cleansers were empty and the loo contents had not been been emptied for some days, so you can imagine the condition they were in. They were quite simply blocked. One of the most disgusting public convenience provisions I have ever seen.

Preferred the View from the Chiesa di San Michele in Bosco. Hop of the Red HOHO Bus there or catch a number 30 bus which stops right outside.

The 58 bus goes from Villa Spada to Basilica San Luca, where you can pay €5 and climb to the top viewing platform if you like. In any case, it's a lot easier to walk down the hill through the immensely long colonnade in the shade with a pleasant breeze! Bus 58 only runs on Sunday's and festival days. You can travel on both the 20 and the 58 on one bus ticket (€1.50 if you buy on the first bus or €1.20 if you buy a 10 journey ticket from the tabacchi) but the 58 only goes straight from Villa Spada to the Basilica without stopping anywhere else en route and it only goes on Sundays or festival days. Otherwise, you'll have to go up on foot or by the tourist train from Piazza Maggiore. The tourist train costs €10 each. It's a nice excursion for a Sunday.

Thrilling ascent and wonderful views as the pink-hued San Luca soars majestically, surrounded by green Apennine foothills with valleys and mountains in the distance and Bologna on the other side. An incredible sight and impossible to do justice in a photograph. As we entered San Luca many who had walked up the hillside broke into 'Ave Maria' as they processed up the aisle to kiss an icon held by an elderly priest, who wiped it after each one, speaking encouraging words to the children.

There are 666 (yes really!) arches which form the truly impressive porticoes from the Ponte Saragozza up to the top and the Basilica. From there you can climb the cupola (for a 5 euro charge) for stunning views of Bologna and the surrounding countryside.

Well, well worth the visit but there are a few top tips! Take water - there is a vending machine at the top but you will be walking for almost an hour before you get there. The church and viewpoint close between 12.30 and 2.30pm and apart from aforementioned vending machine and some portaloos there's nothing on site.

As a simple tourist who has visited many holy places and climbed many hills I was totally disappointed by the hype. It is a big building with great significance to the people of Bologna and that is appropriate but it is not a destination I could recommend for tourists. We chose to take the taxi up (10e from Maggiore) rather than the San Luca express goes up and comes straight down with no pause to allow a brief visit. The basilica is big but not particularly attractive - quite gaudy inside. There is no signage or information to explain or direct visitors - even the sign for a 'cafe' is totally misleading - there isn't one! - just a small 'cave' with vending machines that do not always work - so make sure you take any drinks etc you might need with you. The views are good but covered in about 10 minutes. The toilets are a disgrace - 4 bunged up portaloos filled with all manner of wipes, nappies and goodness knows what else by midday - filthy.
The porticoed climb is a feat of engineering but quite plain and frankly uninteresting after the first hundred or so porticoes. There were plenty of fitness exercisers - which is fine and maybe you would feel a sense of achievement doing the climb but honestly what greets you at the top is simply not worth it. I found far more interesting places in the city itself.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"My wife and I have been to Bologna three times. And, on the first day of each trip, we have gone to the Santuario di Madonna di San Luca. It is a wonderful way to help rid yourself of jet lag. The church itself sits atop a hill on the outskirts of the original walled city of Bologna. To get to the church, there is a path up the hill which is covered by 666 porticos. On our first trip, we walked to / from the church from the base of the hill. It is a strenuous walk / climb, but, I will say that we saw many, many people in the seventies and eighties making the climb without difficulty. The church itself is beautiful, but, the experience of making the climb is what makes this attraction special. On our second and third visits, we took a taxi to the church and then walked down .... much easier ! And, on our third visit, the cupola was open and we were able to to make the climb (which is not strenuous) to the exterior portion of the cupola and enjoy some of the most wonderful views of Bologna and the surrounding countryside.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"It´s a nice Basilica for sure, but the ""SkyExperience"" was the height of the visit. For a donation of 5 Euro you get to climb the 110 steps to a platform outside the dome. They say it´s the highest located dome in Europe. You get a 180 degree stunnig view over the surrounding landscape and Bologna.
We thought this was the best attraction we went to on our stay in Bologna.

Get here by buss, 20, from the city center and walk up the hill/mountain for 20-30 minutes. It´s a steep climb. you could also take the Sant Luca Express from the city center, close to the tourist office at maggiore, for 10 euro. It wil take you all the way up to San Luca.

The building, at the top of a hill, was imposing, both externally and internally, unfortunately shrouded in mist on the morning of our visit - On a clear day the views over the city and the surrounding countryside would be impressive.
A note of caution - if you choose to visit in the morning, be aware that the only cafe/restaurant only opens later, at least at the season of our visit, and the only alternative is a vending machine and portaloos, which, on the day of our visit, were unusable.

Mass was being held as we were there; the sanctuary is beautiful and well worth spending time to appreciate. The train is packed full, and the line waiting for the return train was not well organized. Nevertheless, everyone eventually got on and we returned to the center of Bologna.

There were lots of walkers and runners looking like they were doing their routine sports. Don't take a bus! Just slowly enjoy the walk! The sanctuary is huge and pretty inside, though I did not feel the warmth and spirituality like in San Setano.

We were not warned either by information in the book or the guide on the little train that just as we were arriving the doors would be shut for two hours for lunch and that there would not be another train returning for two and a half hours. So we found ourselves with two hours to kill and then a high speed sprint around the church in time to get the last train back. So our opinion was somewhat tainted. I would say on a sunny day it would be nice to take the train out there and walk back under the porticos. Not a huge amount to see once inside the church, you are guided up some stair to view an image of the Virgin then down the other side leads to the exit. The views are good but not sufficient to occupy two hours.

The first sanctuary was built in 1433 d.c. and rebuilt in 1713 D.C. it is built in baroque style.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"I had read that this was a pilgrimage site, but I hadn’t imagined that hundreds of people would be climbing the 666 steps to the top of the hill, a stiff climb even though they were sheltered by a colonnade. I opted for the #58 city bus, more like a large van. (A regular bus wouldn’t have fit up the narrow street.) We passed intrepid cyclists in spandex and hikers with trekking sticks. At the top of the hill were a food vendor, a market stall selling leather belts and handbags and a pleasant-looking bar and restaurant that proclaimed itself “dog friendly.”
In many ways, this spot is more remarkable for its view than for the church itself. The day was overcast, and a light haze kept the view of the city from being as spectacular as it might have been, but the vista was striking nonetheless. Inside the church, most of the frescoes are undistinguished mid-19th century religious works. However, behind the altar, and accessible via a marble staircase, is an image of the Virgin and Child, set icon-style in polished silver hung with jewelry – not jewels (although some of those decorate the golden frame), but strands of gold beads, pearls, earrings, rings of rubies and emeralds.
San Luca is Saint Luke, the Evangelist. There’s a statue of him next to the exit, with his bare left foot atop the head of a black bull.

I chose the easy option of the little Hop Hop Train which leaves regularly from the Piazza Maggiore (cost 10 Euro).
The views across Bologna and the surrounding hills are quite magnificent. November offers them a softness which is quite painterly.
Be respectful inside the Sanctuary. It is still very much a chapel for prayer. There was no objection to my cameras and tripod but I did feel the need to creep around and give worshipers their privacy.

There is a really long set of Porticoes that lead up to the church from down town and the sight of the church is really magnificent. That being said, after awhile, once you have seen the inside of one of these churches, they all tend to blend into each other after awhile. There is noting about the interior of this church that is particularly special. The exterior of the church is somewhat rundown and needs a coat of paint. The views from the hilltop location are very nice.",Nov 2016

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"The climb and the stairs just keeps on going. The guidebook said 3-4 km and take some water with you. The walk across the old city in Bologna was very straightforward and quick from the 2 towers, and thence to the start of the climb. Leaving the 2 towers at 11:15 we got to the top of the stairs at 12:29 just in time to hear the basilica doors thud shut. So we appreciated the view, looked at the tourist train and minibuses which bring visitors up the hill, admired the enterprise of the cyclists making their way up the road, splashed drinking water over our faces from the tap at the viewing grassed area (toilets also available) and decided the icon could wait for another day. Students and locals bring lunch up. Quite a few locals using the stairs for a run up and down workout. The bends in the staircase are quite deceptive you keep thinking you're at the top and another set presents themselves.The full shade must be a blessing at other times of the year

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"I visited this wonderful location on Sunday October 30, a beautifully sunny day with blue skies. I had read the directions of others and looked at google maps from my apartment to the Santuario and found them either misleading or just plain pointless. If you are travelling rom the middle of the city it is best that you get the 14 bus from Via Rizzoli which is just in front of the two two two towers,the bus stop is next to the Maisons du World soft furnishings shop.Via Rizzoli runs into Via Ugo Bassi so in essence it is the same street. Take the bus for ten stops to 'Stadio' which is the Bologna FC Stadium. The driver normally announces each stop and the bus stops have the name painted on each bus shelter (where there is one).The bus cost is 1.5 Euros. When you arrive at Stadio,after about 12 minutes,get off and cross the street to the Staduim and go to your left for then take the next right (Via Petro De Colbertin) follow the arches down past the Bologna FC Stadium for about 15 minutes and you will come to the steps/archway which will be the beginning of your trek.
I truly enjoyed the walk up the gradient and when you get up further it becomes stairs with a 8 metre or so gradient for every 7 steps. The walk itself is taxing but you can sit on the walls every so often.The views are quite something when you reach the top and well worth the effort. I have not enjoyed a day like this since I climbed Mount Fuji a few years ago! There is a pizzerias later further over.A coffee shop would be nice as
it is not one of those chain places.Ther is no shop selling water up there,so take some with you. Someone mentioned a washroomin their review,but I never found it,nor did I see any signs for one.Ther are some beetles on the walls but they never tried to crawl on me so no harm done! I saw some people taking this little train back down probably those who did not have the energy or inclination to walk back down.Walking back down was as enjoyable as walking up for me.You will enjoy your day and I hope my directions have taken the 'mystery' out finding this place!

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,A good walk along a very impressive collonade. The first half is flat with a number of shops and cafes alongside the collonade. This leads to a covered bridge over the road where the path steepens. There are a couple of sections with long flights of steps interspersed with flat slopes - all under cover.

To walk there... if you're used to it, just do it, must be nice, but we didn't. I'm so glad we didn't! We are traveling with our 5 month old baby so it would be too much for all of us. We took the train. Nice drive, you get to see a few further from the surrounding areas... at the top is really nice indeed but I can't stop thinking about the bugs! Flying bugs all around! They are noisy when flying next to your ears and they stop for nothing... the stairs, the Santuary's walls, outside the restaurants, at the stop... you don't see one... you see hundreds and they are ugly...
I would have enjoyed more if they were not around! I couldn't relax... just couldn't. It got to me... but hey this is the cost to be around nature here...

Just over a mile of a steep walk under portico and I found myself utterly exhausted but overwhelmed by the magnificent views towards tge Apennines and over the historic red brick city of Towers and churches that is Bologna.

It was meant to protect the icon as it was paraded up the hill. A yearly procession from the Cathedral of San Pietro in the centre of Bologna to the Sanctuary goes along this path.

What makes this unique is the ""portico"" (arcade) that leads from downtown bologna all the way uphill to the sancuary, which was built on the ""colle della guardia"" (literally, the watch hill, a place that since the time of the early Romans was used for defense purposes on account of the sight over the surronding plain in alla directions.
The portico is about 3.5 km, which makes it the longest in Europe and to my knowledge in the world. It goes uphill, occasionally it gets really steep and a few stretches are actually stairs. It crosses the hills on the south side of Bologna.
It is entirely roofed and sheltered (it was built so that the pilgrims could go to the sanctuary in spite of adverse weather). One can walk and stay dry even if it should be raining hard. The view is unparalleled. Autumn and spring are my favourites for this walk. It might be too hot to wallk uphill in the middle of the summer. It is fascinating if it's snowing.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,3.0,"The walk to St Luca can be regarded either as an exercise in piety or an exercise in exercise. We walked from our hotel in the city centre to the Porta Saragozza, stopped off for a beer, and began strolling along the arcades. After about 15 minutes it became interesting as we began to climb, and made the discovery that we were at portico number 330 and the next 330 were all uphill. In 90 degrees of heat.The steps marked the steepest bits, and we began to speculate that the side chapels along the way were probably intended as rest stations for the revival of the pilgrims who had forgotten to bring their oxygen cylinders along. And if there is anything which adds to discomfort in such situations, it is the sense of inadequacy which results from being muscled out of the way by young Bolognese (both sexes) bounding up the pathway for their Sunday morning recreational run. The view from the top is pretty neat once normal vision returns, although the city centre is largely screened from view by trees. The Santuario itself struck us as being unremarkable, but that might have been by comparison with some of the churches we had visited in Verona and Ravenna over the previous few days. For some reason, the walk down was more comfortable than the walk up. Overall, the sense of achievement when we walked back to the hotel was the best part of the experience, but since we are both almost 70, we may have under-appreciated the spiritual aspects of the gig.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"Our experience going up to the church following Google Maps directions was indeed one to tell our children...

First of all, I have to say that the church itself is not something to die for. Also, for better panoramic views of Bologna go to San Michele in Bosco.

Secondly and most important, DO NOT TRUST GOOGLE MAPS to get to this place. It is going to take you through a terrible route which takes 9.8 miles to walk and it is not fit for pedestrians. The funniest part of the story is that on our way to the sanctuary we had walked under the porticos for at least a kilometre following Google Maps when it suddently decided to divert us through a park and up this paved road. Of course, we didn't have any idea that those were the porticos that lead to the top of the hill (Bologna has a lot of streets with porticos so we didn't realise that was the start of our route). When we finally got to the sanctuary having walked for 2 hours and 15 minutes, the views from up there were a bit disappointing after visiting San Michele in Bosco the day before.

I was perplexed by how high this attraction was rated on Tripadvisor given the fact that we had seen nobody walking up. At that moment, we realised that we hadn't followed the right path, as there was a lot of people in the sanctuary once we arrived. We decided to go around the church to see if there was a viewing point and we came across with the famous porticos. However, Google Maps did not recognise that path as a desired route to follow for pedestrians (OH, THE IRONY).

To sum up, make sure you know which way is the right way to go and do not trust Google Maps to get to this place under any circumstance. Overall, the porticos are amazing and worth a visit.

You get headphones so learn a little about the church and area as you get to the top which rakes about 20 minutes. Views from the top are fantastic and it's another great Bologna church to look in. Walked back through the 666 porticullis(sp) which takes at least an hour to get into the centre from the top. Well worth it but wouldn't fancy walking up and back if you have limited time.,Aug 2016
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"Compared to most Italian cities, Bologna does not have many top sights. This is the best, in part because of the view from the beautiful building, and in part because of the unique porticoed walkway that goes there. A great way to walk off lunch.",Aug 2016
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"We started the walk at about Arch 300- it is a steep walk up to the church but worthwhile. It was a hot August day, so if you are not fit or not wearing comfortable shoes go home and change.
The walk itself is great. Seeing the passageway with the 600+ arches is quite something. The view at the top is worth the walk. The church is beautiful- but you may have noticed Italy is full of beautiful churches.
If like me, you're wearing a sleeveless top, which isn't a bad idea given you will work up a sweat on the walk, you can buy a 0.50eu top in the church.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"Basically, it's a challenging walk uphill under miles of porticoes. It's a religious pilgrimage for those who are looking for that, and a wonderful workout for anyone who's had too much pasta in Bologna. The views and photo opps are well worth it once you get to the top. When you get back down, you know you have earned your gelato break for the day. The church was closed when I went two years ago. For this visit, my son and husband went and got to enter the church. They reported that is is pretty basic. The real reason you do this is to see the view around the church.",Jul 2016

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"I don't remember the last time I went to San Luca, but I can say that this place is magical.
If you want to walk you can reach the church on foot, walking under arches (the so called ""Portici), climbing up to the hill. Once on the top the view is astonishing and it is possible to rest on the benches or visit the chirch inside.
I suggest that you check the opening time because it is often closed. There is no café in the nearbys (there are vending machines near the toilets, but sometimes this room is closed).
It is possible to reach it by car or bus, but walking is really worth.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"Yes it is a good walk to get here, but it is well worth it and also gives you chance to see quieter little shops and bars on the way. The walk under the 666 porticos get steeper as you go with a flat walk, becoming a slope and then a steeper slope and then steps .... but you can pause and admire the views across Bologna. At the top the views of the hills beyond the city are wonderful.

If you want to visit the church do get there early as it closes for lunch, we were lucky as it had stayed open a little later than usual for a visiting party of school children.

If you want something to eat there are a couple of vending machines, but we returned to the small bar we found on the way up.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"This Baroque sanctuary church built in 1723 tops the Monte della Guardia, a 300m hill overlooking Bologna, and its distinctive shape can be seen for many miles around. It proudly boasts a small icon painting depicting (according to legend) Holy Mary and reputedly painted by St Luke the Evangelist, brought by a Byzantine pilgrim in the mid-12th century and embedded into the Main Altar of the basilica. Not much to look at, but revered by the Bolognese for over 800 years. It is brought down to the city cathedral once a year in a celebrated procession, and in order that no rain may fall on it, one of Bologna's characteristic porticoes was extended to a total length of 4 km (663 arches!) to reach the hilltop - it also passes right by the entrance to the FC Bologna football grounds. There used to be a cable car connecting it to the city, but this closed down in 1976, so nowadays visitors have to either walk (if you're fit enough), take the €10 tourist bus (taxi fare is similar), or drive themselves up: A surprising cross-section of the population chanced the walk on the Sunday we were there. This Extraordinary Jubilee year of Mercy, the archdiocese has provided an additional Holy Door for pilgrims here, and quite a few of the intrepid climbers were heading for this benefice. Extraordinary indeed.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"We, two mature couples, caught the Sant Luca express one morning and enjoyed an interesting ride to the Sanctuary. There was a reasonable commentary on board the bus that left Piazza Maggiore spot on time. We had an hour at the destination that was ample time as there is really nothing else to do. The Sanctury is amazing. Very ornate with much to see. We return on the bus although we had not realised that walking back was a reasonable option. The bus left on time and took a slightly different route on the return. All in all well worth the €10 for each of us.",Jul 2016

The Santuario is a large church overlooking the hills above Bologna. Great photo opportunities with stunning panoramas. High Recommended.,Jul 2016
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,These is a great little trip - about 30 mins travel on an open topped bus. Plan on spending about an hour there. We purchased supplies for a picnic before hand and extended out time. Remember to bring a hat/sunglasses/water/camera.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"We're both in our sixties, and we walked up to the top from our hotel which was close to the piazza. We left before 8:00 am, and aside from the extreme heat and humidity, it was a great trek. The portico is truly a fascinating feat, but once you reach the top, be prepared, the views overlooking Bologna are far more limited than we anticipated due to restricted viewing access behind church. That being said, the alter in the church is simply breathtaking. We timed it so we could attend mass, which made the whole event all the more spiritual.

If you do take the hike vs. going via car or bus, as others have mentioned, beware of dog droppings, and bring water!

Can't really see Bologna centre from the top but nice view of surroundings.",Jun 2016
Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,3.0,"First the good news. We - two people in our mid-sixties - walked up from Porta Saragozza at the south west corner of the Centro Storico on a hot (30 degrees plus) weekday morning, and then down again, and did not find this walk as arduous as some previous reviewers might have suggested. On the way, we did encounter a couple of people who appeared to be really struggling, but they had not brought water with them. For this walk, even in winter, water is a must.

Now the not-so-good news. And in making the following observations, I am sensitive to the fact that the Santuaria is a historical and holy place, not a purpose-built tourist attraction, and that for many, the walk up to it can be as much a spiritual experience as a physical one.

Ok, but the fact remains that the porticos are scruffy and graffiti'd in some places, and most of the frescoes are now very faded; the views at the top and on the way up (mostly of hedge and road) are partial and certainly nowhere near panoramic; and the walk is used by local dog walkers - I'm a dog lover myself, but was saddened to see dog-evidence here and there on the pathway.

At the top, the church itself is imposing, cool and tranquil. But facilities outside are meagre to say the least: a souvenir shop, a couple of drink-vending machines adorned with notices disclaiming responsibility if the machine swallows your money and doesn't deliver your drink, (not exactly encouraging), and a rather tired old water-tap. Yes there are toilets up there, but when we first arrived at the top, there were probably only about four dozen people up there in total, and even so there were queues for both women's and men's loos. The latter was neither particularly clean, nor in a good state of repair. We shuddered to think what it must be like when there are hundreds of people up there for a special religious occasion...

But to put all this in perspective, walking down it was heartwarming to see so many young families and school-age kids making the climb, and the joyous looks on the faces of the very young, upon realising that they were nearly at the top.

The walk up to the Santuaria is an important historical and religious walk, and good exercise too. But if you're going to do the walk, research it first and do it with more realistic expectations than I had, and do make sure you take water with you.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,5.0,"A definite highlight of our trip to Bologna. We did the tourist thing and took the San Luca Express (or Thomas as we called the little train) from Piazza Maggiore for €10 each. It was easier than figuring out the two local buses and a possible shuttle bus.
San Luca sits atop a hill overlooking Bologna below. It is a beautiful sanctuary and well worth the visit. It is quite stunning inside with different types of marble adorning the walls. As you walk around the church you can see where others have etched their names into the marble - some dating back to the 1950's and 1960's.
We noticed that some people just got Thomas to San Luca to take their obligatory photo and get straight back on the 'train' to go back into town. Please don't be one of those people. Spend at least an hour walking around and taking in her beauty. The colours of San Luca herself are so warm and inviting and she is a truly beautiful place to behold. Admire the paintings and the marble and the gold and the richness she has to offer.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"This grand basilica on top of San Luca hill is visible day and night throughout much of Bologna. At night its golden illumination makes it ""the shining city on the hill"" beckoning to the tourists of today. It is a challenge to follow the covered path consisting of 666 arches from the base to the top. The strenuous walk up the steps and ramps took us about 45 minutes. This final accent is the end of a historic pilgrimage route that took weeks and maybe even months for medieval pilgrims to complete on foot from their distant homes. Now, it provides cover for the annual procession of the icon. Once you enter the basilica (no photos allowed) you will be awestruck by the artwork, tile work and carvings throughout the building. There has been a shrine at this location for about a thousand years. This magnificent structure was built around 1723. If you don't want the breath-taking walk, you can take a bus to the top. Visiting the shrine is a serene and moving experience. If you don't take the path, you can plan to spend less than an hour in and around the shrine.

Italy,Santuario di Madonna di San Luca,4.0,"The sanctuary sits on a hill about 4km outside Bologna. You can either walk up the continuous portico or take the small tourist train.

Once there, the church itself is worth a look although I do tend to get church blindness when in Italy - they all start to merge in to one.

Outside, you can wander round the grounds and take in the views of the surrounding hills.

So we were pleasantly surprised when we started walking uphill and the arches were numbered and it was already on 340!
The walk itself was ok - fine if you are good with walking. If not then there is a bus you can get. I wore new shoes which wasn't ideal as my feet hurt a lot at the end so wear comfy shoes!
The building at the top is beautiful and the views were lovely. We were there for a long time and it was so peaceful. We couldn't go into the basilica itself as there was a service taking place which I believe is quite common. But we didn't feel as though we missed out.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"YOU MUST GO TO THIS PLACE. I landed in Palermo a total tourist, with no notion of what to see. Luckily, I stumbled across a sign to the Palazzo Conte Federico, and came across a nice young man, standing next to a red racing car. I had no idea what the hell a palazzo was, but decided to give the tour a chance, it was the last one of the day, and they were closed the next day (my only other chance to go, as my stay in Palermo was super short.)

First off, you have to understand that a family member gives you a tour of this historical masterpiece hidden in the center of Palermo. Formed around a former Arab watchtower (which you get to see because it’s INSIDE THE GODDAMNED PALAZZO), the palazzo is hundred of years old. It’s incredible family held hosts to people such as Garibaldi, Wagner and Bellini. Each room is filled with treasures from over 400 years of family heirlooms and treasures.

The current owner is an 80 year old Italian sportscar driver, and the contessa - a soprano. I got a tour from one of her sons, who looks like a musular Ronan Farrow, and has a sense of class, style and self-respect that is completely foreign to most Americans. He tells stories of each rooms, about the frescoes, the paintings, the weapons - everything. It is easily the best thing I did in Palermo, and I went to the Archeological musum, a puppet show, the tour of the main theatre (terrible - the guides there seem to hate tourists, and vaguely show you a room, tell you something you could wikipedia, and then hastily escort you out), the Cathedral, the Palace and the markets. If you do one thing in Palermo - this is it!

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,Between the Royal Palace and the Ballaro market this Palace is in a strange setting. It contains the last preserved Tower of the Arab- Norman 12th Century City with amazing tiled floor containing maps and emblems. It costs €10 per person with child reductions but not seniors. Tours are by family members who live in the Palace now . Part of the charm are the memorabilia of the family including the fathers racing cars and trophies and mothers swimming medals . There are historic connections with Garibaldi and lots of family portraits. The tours support the upkeep of this historic building. You get to see private rooms as well as go up the beautiful tower.,Oct 2019

We tried to peek at the palace and for only €10, it's a steal!!! This is the best thing that we did today! Inside the 12th century palace is incredibly beautiful with the handsome son of the count (a Federico) as our guide. They still live in that place which amazes us that they actually lived there til now and maintaining the place. We felt really privileged to have a tour in a very well preserved and beautiful place.

I happen upon Palazzo Drago by accident and was delighted to have my own personal guided tour from a member of the Bertolino family.
I could imagine as a young child, Celeste running though these great rooms, little feet echoing as they pass tall ceilings and breezy windows.
Each room is a step into the past with care taking to preserve all that has come before.
But there are new developments in the walls of this palace ,with plans to bring guests into private suits ...
I have “The Leopard “ in my bag ... stepping into Palazzo Conte Federico brought echoes of the past centuries to the present. Our tour guide is also a family member. We moved at a nice pace through each room without being hurried along and were presented with facts and stories both from the past and in modern day .... in English German and Italian .. it was fantastic and not too long. Some of these rooms could be in The game of Thrones especially the dining areas. I found both guides charming patient and very informative.

The tour was well planned taking in a lot of detail from the last remaining Arabic defensive tower of Palermo, protected within the house, through the Norman times and other periods, right up to the current day and the Contes historic motor racing participation.
Salvaged examples of previous floors and ceilings are presented in frames in the rooms they come from. There is an interesting collection of armoury... I could go on and on, but I strongly recommend you visit and see for yourself.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,4.0,"This home, in the family of Frederick II (Hohenstaufen) for about 800 years, is one of the oldest in Palermo. One of the towers from the old city wall is actually incorporated directly into its structure. The wonderful floor tiles are different in every room (offset by interesting oriental rugs). Thirty-foot ceilings reflect various artistic styles. The 45 minute tour, conducted on the hour, highlighted the public living areas (as the family still lives here). Our group was rather small (4 people) and the family member who conducted it was charming. Our only problem was that we couldn't easily locate the property (streets and small alleys are not always clearly marked). If, like us, you miss a start time, relax in one of the nearby cafes and await the next. Definitely worth it.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"This Palace is a beautiful and interesting insight into Sicily's history. The family that currently resides here has done so for centuries and are very knowledgable. Because of the age and constant inhabitants the build has been added to over the years and this makes for some great architecture and historical power shifts being reflected in the art work and furnishings as well as the building itself.

We did not book but there were only about 5 of us in the guided tour. It's not as busy as other buildings in the city. Worth hunting it down.",Feb 2019

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"What can you say about a palazzo that is built on the old Roman wall circling the city, incorporating one of the towers as a room. How neat is that? The tour was given by the present royal descendant's son, a cavalier. He was remarkably charming and gave a great presentation on the house and the lineage of the family going back hundreds of years and even his own mother and father. His mother sings and his father has won oodles of trophies for racing cars and we see them all. The stories truly enhance the experience. He was generous with his patience answering our small group's questions. I loved it. It was as I say in the title a truly unique experience and a welcome serendipitous find. We only found out about it an hour or two before we went to it and we only went because it was fairly close to another place we went to. Good choice. Oh, by the way, it turns out that they are a very, very important family in Sicliy, perhaps the most important. You see references to them in multiple places. When I realized this, in retrospect, it made our visit there that much more significant. A second by the way - it appears that they have only recently started giving tours. So they may not be as well known as other sites, but they will be. Goi.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Only read about this palazzo on our arrival in Palermo and decided to visit and that was one of the best decisions of our holiday! Visits are every hour on the hour 11am-4pm and are conducted by one of the members of the family - our was taken by one of the sons who was so knowledgeable and welcoming. We were there at the same time as an Italian couple so the tour was conducted in both languages. The family has lived in the house for centuries so you also learn a lot about the history of the property and the family. We arrived about a quarter of an hour before the tour started and the man who was at the desk was really friendly and chatty about the palazzo and Sicily in general.
The building has been added to over the years but is built around the only remaining 12th century Arab-Norman tower of the city walls - you can see an illustration of this on the tiled floor of one of the rooms. This same room has many masonic symbols which are also to be found at other places in the house - the family were friends with many famous historic masons including Garibaldi who they financed. You can see beautiful painted wooden ceilings, frescoes and antiques and everything is explained in detail. in one room, you can see a piano that was once played by Richard Wagner. You go up the tower, which is easy to climb, and you have a lovely view over the city and hills beyond.
The family is very talented - the count is a racing driver and there is a racing car in the entrance to the palazzo that he raced in the Targa Florio as well as many cups and medals in the study some of which belong to the countess who is an award winning singer and swimmer.
We spent about an hour on the tour which seemed to fly by. I would highly recommend that you visit during your stay - you will learn so much about life in Sicily both now and over the years.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"We were fortunate to have arrived when the 45 minute English tour conducted by Contessa Federico was ready to begin. The price for the tour was 10 euros and well worth it. The Contessa was very personable and explained that she was originally from Austria, a competitive swimmer and a professional singer. Her sons also give tours and even introduced one of her sons to the group.
The Palazzo is the oldest building in Palermo and has a tower that dates back to the 12th century. The building is of Arabic/Norman origin. One of the rooms has a piano that was once played by Wagner. We were shown many rooms throughout the house including the master bedroom, guest bedroom, dining room, kitchen, study, and the tower to name a few. The palazzo seemed more like a museum than an actual residence.
The Count was quite the car racer and won many trophies. His 1930 Fiat is on display at the entrance to the Palazzo.
She stated that they pay $48,000 euros each year to pay for trash removal. The fee is based on square footage of the residence.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"The first thing we noticed was the racing Fiat Ballila parked in the courtyard front entrance of the 12th century Palazzo - something different here? We were soon charmed and entranced by what followed. Met by a smiling Andrea the younger son of Count Federico we were taken round his family home where generations have lived since the 12th century. The Palazzo is built around the only surviving Arab Norman tower in Palermo and elegant room after room follows the outline of the old city wall. This is a microcosm of the history of Palermo where Arab, Norman, Medieval and Renaissance to modern influences are all found. Yet this is a warm and inviting family home too - Andrea gave us glimpses of his own family life with his father and grandfather deeply involved in motor racing - both the Mille Miglia and the Targa Florio to be exact - hence the Ballila at the front door. His mother too is a record breaking swimmer and opera singer to boot! Both Andrea and his brother continue the family tradition of the need for speed. Quite simply this experience, expertly explained in Italian and English together, was a tour de force only lasting an hour but so worth it - unique and special. We will be talking about it for a long time - don't miss it.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"We were advised by our walking tour guide to see this place. It is just incredible, our guide was Andreas the youngest son of the Conte Federico. His pride and knowledge of his ancestral home makes the tour, while we were there we had an extra treat of hearing his mother sing. She is a soprano it was beautiful. This place is a little off the tourist track an has no government funding or protected heritage listing, the family live there as they have done for centuries and are the careful guardians. Make the effort to go it’s the best 10 euros you will ever spend. The photographs don’t do it justice. We feel very lucky to have found it.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"This was a tip from our walking tour guide so went with few expectations and went away absolutely overwhelmed with what we saw.

This is the best 10 Euro we have spent in all our 3 weeks touring Sicily. We were hosted by Andrea one of the sons of the family who was brilliant in the way he told the story of his family and the amazing home where they still live today. We were also so lucky to hear his mother who is a soprano singing. It felt like we just stepped back in time and lived through the generations of the family.

The history, the renovations, the stories, tha art, the objects are just indescribable - miss some of the other mass market stuff and support this place. Very sad that there is very little financial help from the Italian or Sicilian govt. to support and help maintain such historic monuments.

Very personal and very moving
Thank you Andrea

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Thanks to the positive TripAdvisor reviews, we visited this wonderful Palace, one of the oldest buildings in Palermo and it was an amazing experience. We were greeted warmly in the courtyard by a beautiful young girl who then introduced us to Nicholas, the son of the family who resides in this stunning palace. Nicholas was wonderful and spoke so passionately about the history. He spoke exceptional English with humour. We were gobsmacked at the splendour. The magnificent tiled floors, chandeliers, ceramics in glass cabinets, knight’s room with a weapon collection, and the talented family history is worth the visit as you will not be disappointed. And I have not even spoken about the 13th Century Tower - that is for you to discover as there is so much more....

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Tucked away in a scruffy corner of the city centre, this Palazzo is authenticity writ large. It was one of the last things we did in Sicily and one of the most memorable. The tour was conducted by the lady of the house who charted both the history of the building and of the ancient family now obviously fallen on leaner times than before mostly due to taxation. She joked that her husband was given for his 18th birthday a Maserati (there are a few notable racing cars on display and yards of photos) but her two sons had to make do with Vauxhall (or Opel, I guess) Cavaliers. The building is sumptuous in every respect and a treasure trove for your camera. Tiled floors, ancient rooms, gorgeously decorated ceilings, views to die for from windows everywhere and, in the very top, you can see false ceilings of Norman and earlier Arab origin. At the end, a glorious array of local food was offered. Do visit - you will not be disappointed.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"A really lovely experience... Andrea was a very welcoming host with a wealth of knowledge and pride in his extraordinary palazzo home. His family are the custodians of one of the last 11th century towers of the original wall/watch towers of the medieval town of Palermo... this is located right inside the palazzo as the palace was built on the medieval wall. This is an important part of not only Italian but also global history. The palace is a fabulous example of 11th century, 17th century and 18th century architecture. Thank you Conte Federico, Andrea and family for opening your amazing palazzo home to the public. Visiting this palace will give you a deeper knowledge of the history of Palermo.

The son of the present owner and resident of the home, Andreas, gave us a delightful tour throughout the home and up into the tower. It is very personal since they are still living there - including his mother's swimming medals and his father's car racing trophies. It's a little hard to find, but not far from the cathedral.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Had a 40 minute tour today around Palazzo Conte Federico. It was the highlight of my trip to Palermo, maybe even my road trip around Sicily. We were shown around the beautiful house by the Count’s son and he brought the house to life with the stories of the history. In modern times the family are also prominent racers, and you get to learn all about this during the tour too. It is such a special experience to have a member of the family show you around the house as he told stories of his mother, father, grandparents and ancestors in a way a non-relative could not. A unique experience you are unlikely to get elsewhere.

We also got a discount on entry as we had visited Chisea del Gesù (my favourite church of the trip) and they are part of ‘Il Circuito Dell’Eccellenza’ seen in the picture.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Walking through the historic rooms of Palazzo Conte Federico guided by one of the family members was quite a highlight during out visit. Of course already because of the charming and well informed son Andreas who was our guide, but also because the Palazzo really is quite incredible in it's role in the history of Palermo and Italy as a whole because of the family's ties to Giuseppe Garibaldi. So fascinating and exciting! I could have asked questions for hours and hours. And the family is doing a great job at taking care of the palace! All over town palaces are falling apart and they invest every last penny in keeping this heritage of mankind in top shape. Absolutely wonderful!

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Really interesting palace dating back to Emperor Frederico II. Still owned and lived in by the same family that is directly descended from Emperor Frederico II. Many different styles of architecture, including parts of the ancient city wall, and interesting features that the tour guide points out. The tour guide was the son of Count Frederico, which struck me as quite unusual, and of course he was an expert on the palace as he was born and raised there.
Insider Tip 1: If you are interested in Automobile Racing (I am) ask about the Count's racing history. He was very active in the 50's and 60's including many Targa Florio's, Sicily's famous road race lasting from 1906 through the 70's. Check out the antique car he now uses in road rallies. I also really liked his trophy room.
Insider Tip 2: If you're a Mason (I'm not) look closely at the art work/murals on the ceilings, or just have the tour guide point out some details you'll be interested in.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"What a real gem of a place is this!! Hidden away down a back street and built into the ancient city walls it remains a real working family home to the Federico family and as such is not only beautiful and historic inside but it's also querky.

Something of a shrine to the current Count's career in motorsport and the Countess's music - one of the more recent Federicos created the Targa Florio for Pete's sake - we were given the tour by the current Contessa herself, a charming and glamourous lady who, due to her Northern European origins, has more than a touch of the Baroness von Trapp about her. and who is herself a gifted musician and world class swimmer.
We were there as part of a pre-arranged visit so I don't know how accessible the tour is to ""walk-ins"" but if the opportunity arises it's a fascinating hour and shouldn't be missed.
And she see's you out with a glass of their own wine.

We had to wander a little bit around those narrow streets of Palermo to find it. We were met by Claudia, she was lovely and presented the place really well while we waited for the excursion to begin. The countess herself met our small group and walked us through her family rooms, talked about the history of Palazzo which includes the whole history of Palermo (Palazzo has a part of the old city wall). Perfect visit, I really recommend it for those who appreciate history, love architecture and want to have an authentic experience. The price is ten euros per person (they offer discount for those under 16), their working ours are not long, you have to check them before coming. If you decide to visit don't be dismayed by the atmosphere around the place, once you find it, inside is magical. The family still lives there.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"We were recommende to visit by some friends, but nevertheless went reluctantly as this kind of tours is not usually a priority for us. But this changed very quickly when we first met Claudia, who did the first info/sold tickets - better service can not be delivered. And then the tour began with the Contessa who gave us a personal, sympathetic and knowledgeable tour arond her house and the history of Palermo. A more down to earth person in such a position cannot be found, and so generous in showing us her and her familys living quarters. Shame on you if you don't visit this gem in the midle of Palermo! We did the tour in english and german, but I'm sure they can manage in even more languages - and Italian, of course.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"The tour of the palazzo is undertaken by the family who live there and have lived there since the middle ages - the 'conte federico' is their ancestor, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, when Palermo was (early 13th century) the equivalent in status to London and Paris. The house is fascinating, being built on the Punic/Roman walls of old Palermo and incorporating an Arab/Norman tower. Its subsequent history covers other great periods of Palermo's architectural past, with some wonderful paintings, floors, ceilings - and the family's recent history is no less interesting as well. The palazzo is close to the cathedral, accessed via a narrow street, and will give you a better feel for the city and its past than anywhere else.

He only speaks Italian, but gave us such a great tour of all the premises. The Palace is a hidden gem, but I suggest you look for it!

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"The best and the most surprising attraction in Palermo for me. Palace is opened only during summer season, only several hours at week, because it is really visiting of residence of old sicilian aristocratic family - they are still living there. Although it is not possible to recognize it from outside, palace has really beautiful and good maintained interier, quite spacious. There is only one tour a day and guide is countess herself. Countess is very pleasant guide, she speaks several languages and knows history of Federico family and palace too. Her telling is very kind and interesting, but humorous too and she is willing to answering visitor's questions. Tour guides not only thru living rooms, representative rooms and historical kitchen, but also private bedroom and study.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"Like Chatsworth (in Derbyshire, UK - often used as a stand in for Pemberley in movies) the Palazzo Conte Federico is joy because the current family live and work there, in fusing it with their hobbies and interests they make the place seem lived in. Conte Federico is a classic race driver and there is a beautiful car in the courtyard and the Contess is a music lover with so Verdi's signature is on display and there is a piano that Richard Wagner played. The house it's self is a beautifully kept masterpiece ranging from the Arabic/ Norman to the Baroque but the house favors the 1920/30's which some complete sets of travel toilet bags and some great pictures from a party at that time. The Contess speaks German, English and Italian and teaches languages so worth asking about other languages. Worth every penny. So glad I saw it.

Do not be put off your the appearance from the outside of the palace, the inside is a real gem.
Our only regret: that we could not stay in the palace, since they have only 3 rooms.
Our tour, which we booked via Internet, cost 10 euros per person , it was worth every penny, it was in this palace that Garibaldi was elected grand master of the Freemasons, where Richard Wagner played the piano, you can some paintings,porcelain,jewels,weapons and armours, but also the medals won by th e countess and trophies won by the count in the targa Florio automobile race.

The most interesting to me personally were the many family mementos, portraits and the frescos on the ceiling referring to Freemasonry.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"I have been at the Conte's a few times yet and like it so much. It's just the perfect way to feel at home in the majestic beauty of the city of Palermo. I first read about it by flipping through the pages of my girlfriend's Elle magazine some time ago, and could not wait for the chance to be there ever since. It is located at literally two minutes' walk from either Palazzo dei Normanni, the Cathedral and the Ballarò market. A one week full-on visit of the amazing city was possible by plainly walking or taking the bus, fantastic! The Conte's elder son - Nicoló - is a very charming landlord, truly passionate about his city and naturally proud of his family's exceptionally special heritage. The palace is so beautiful, yet not a museum. They still live in it, and this of course makes it even more special. The great comfort is matched by the feeling of taking part to history, and savouring ""cannoli"" and ""pasta martorana"" on one morning in the Sicilian kitchen of yours is really a pleasure to experience, definitely more than only once.

Italy,Palazzo Conte Federico,5.0,"This is one of the many palaces of Palermo that testify to the past glories of the city. From its Norman Tower (~11th century) to its association with the racing cars of Targa Florio (20th century), the Palazzo is beautiful and impressive, enhanced, if possible, by the affability and approachability of the present Duke and Duchess, he the racing driver, she the international swimming champion. The decorations, the chandeliers, the furniture, the tiled floors mimicking the intricacy of Persian carpets, all bring to life a world of beauty that does not date.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Forecast for the day when Aida had to be performed said: ""Disruption due to thunderstorms"" with 90% rain probability. 
Myself and husband had been very much looking forward to watch that Opera, so we tried to stay positive.
During the day rain has been on again and off again; when we arrived at 8.40 pm, scattered drops were falling while vendors were selling cheap rain ponchos outside the amphitheater (and ffp2 face masks, mandatory to attend the performance). 
By 9:00 pm there was still a light sprinkling, enough to block the start of the performance (musical instruments get easily ruined by rain drops), then the rain stopped … then restarted … and again … Aida started and stopped three times; from our seats we could see orchestra musicians going up and down the backstage with their instruments. Fun moments: enthusiastic rounds of applause did welcome,from time to time,the cleaning company trying to dry the stage between sprinkles.
Most audience at that point were wearing ponchos and even opening some umbrellas (yes, you can bring an umbrella inside Arena,providing it has no sharped tip)
Eventually Aida really started (9.45pm ?) and went on.
There was just one break: remind that restrooms are very few, decently clean but quite “old fashioned”.
There is a bar for coffee and spritz;you are allowed to bring bottled water (plastic only) and sandwiches inside the Arena, but metal objects and cameras are forbidden. These items have to be left outside the entrance, no receipt given at all, so you need to be lucky and find your stuff at the end of the performance ! Conclusion: don't carry with you anything that you don’t wish to loose!
Even if we had rain and delays , we fully enjoyed Aida and would recommend to tempt fate and book your seats at least one month in advance, as Arena offers an exceptional, wonderful experience.
Cast, orchestra, lights, sound and scenography were excellent!! In my opinion it's worth to spend some more money in order to get a side stall (poltrona) not too far from the stage.

It’s cool, but people, one euro would be too much. History is amazing in here though… In Imperial Roman times, duels between gladiators, hunts, and men battling ferocious animals was the entertainment held in here. Later, in 1287 over 200 people were burned alive in this amphitheater. for being witches. In the late 13th century the city’s prostitutes were ordered to live in this amphitheater. On June 15, 1805 Napoleon Bonaparte was entertained in this theatre by watching a bull hunt below. It’s been standing here since 50AD!

One, was a concert by an old rocker Umberto Tozzi (remember 'Ti Amo', 'Gloria'?) from the 70s & 80s, and RAF. What an unexpected brilliant show they put on for the capacity audience, of young kids to grandparents, and everyone new and sung their songs. Tozzi is now better than when we saw him back in Sydney in the 70s @ the Sydney Opera House.Great atmosphere.
Our second concert was an opera/musical 'Notre Dame De Paris, based on Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" A truly wonderful musical, and everyone should see it when in Verona or Italy, even though it is in Italian. Another fabulous experience. The experience is the Arena

There were large screens translating the opera and was a fantastic set with hundreds of actors, horses etc. Only gave 4 stars as the ampitheatre is so large that it can be difficult to see and hear from the rear, although we were on seats and not the terrace area.

At first you might be put off by the long line, however have now fear it is worth it. They move very quickly and before you know it you’ll find yourself in the breathtaking arena.

Difficult to imagine the brutality and rage that use to fill the arena. However the history and structure itself is something to observe.

Verona and is a place that is full of history, culture, romance, bars, restaurants and shopping and much much more 😉 ... we booked an apartment in city centre and it was fantastic, spacious and super clean, lift and super cosy even with a 60” Sony Bravia TV and 5 minutes walk from centre 2 min walk for one of the most popular restaurants Bella Napoli and 15 minutes walk from train station Verona Porta Nuova and we could go anywhere we planned to visit ... from Peschiera di Garda to Bolzano to Vicenza to Padova to Venice to Trento to Milano with cheaper way to travel but obviously not that comfortable as when you rent a car you can travel how you want and you don’t have scheduled time ..., such as you miss a train and have to wait for some time as the weather was very cold .... but we always made it on time 😊
Verona there are many attractions you must visit ... the Arena of Verona €10 ticket entrance Romeo & Juliet home and famous balcony for free ( but we found house closed as it was on New Year’s Day ) Ponte Pietra which has amazing views when you’re on it and surrounded by fine restaurants and always check prices before entering and sitting down... Piazza Era is very lovely as well with an amazing Christmas Market, Vin Brune served in many different recipes and the smell of spices and baking sweets it’s iut of this world, you want to eat and drink this warm wine all day long 😉...

It is cool that this place has been used continuously for such things as farmer's markets and hangings for almost 2,000 years and, unlike the Coliseum in Rome, can be wandered about freely but after the initial awe subsided, and I realized that it has been extensively refurbished, I got rather bored.

It must be incredibly to see an opera here and aficionados would probably love seeing the stage and everything when it's not in use. But I am not one of those and the fact that it is constantly under construction for theater season was just kind of annoying.

Even though were where up with the gods we could aee the stage without any problems. We rented two cushions for €6 and it was well worth having them as the seats do get a bit unconformable. The one thing that I found odd is that there is only one souvenir shop and there is no restaurant or cafeteria. There are people, as in a baseball stadium, going up and down the aisles selling drinks, ice creams and sandwiches. The performance tends to start at around 08:45 pm when it starts getting dark. This means that the opera ends at around midnight or even later so be prepared for a long evening. All in all, we enjoyed going.

The exit staircases are simply cut into a step with no warning strips or rails. No doubt it is well-lit during a concert but lighting also produces shadows and I would think you would have to watch your step and I would be very worried about attending a crowded night-time event, especically as the terraced steps are very deep because obviously, they are also the seats.

The marble steps are quite high and steep - mostly no hand-rails, so do be careful. Dotted around are some half steps (cut into the full step) that make climbing to the top a little easier.
Unlike the Colosseum in Rome, there is no access to anything underground, but it is possible to walk into the arena itself. There are free toilets on site, with all ability access, however they had 'run out' of paper, and soap, on our visit :( Concessions are available, and while it would not be possible to get a wheelchair or buggy to the top of the arena, you could push a wheelchair/buggy into the rough arena floor area.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"One of my favorite things about traveling is seeing history at its finest, and that is exactly what the Arena di Verona is. While not as large as the Colosseum (or more accurately, the Flavian Amphitheatre) the Arena di Verona is equally as beautiful in its own right, and has the added wonder of being so well-preserved. It was incredible to be able to go inside and walk through the seating area to actually sit on the marble seats at the top and look out over the arena area. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see as much of it since the stage was under construction for an upcoming show, but that didn't take away from the experience, in my opinion. We still got to see it, and I highly recommend stopping in to see it for yourself while visiting the city.

The Arena was a tip - full of litter and debris from an earlier performance. Signposting is virtually non-existent so you wander down steps or a passageway to meet yet another barrier. The ""modern"" additions are a disgrace - far too many ugly and intrusive barriers, doors, conduits and random junk. The place needs a thorough clean-up so you can better appreciate the beauty of the architecture.

There was a full symphony orchestra. There were actors standing up on the arena behind the stage standing with torches. On stage there were dancers, one scene featured a mini ballet. There were musicians on stage in Egyptian costume, playing harps and trumpets. At one point, there were two riders on live horses that went across the stage. The singers were great and, fortunately, there was a screen with English subtitles for the non-English audience members

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"The Arena in Verona has been in use since the first century. Unlike the Colosseum in Rome, no one died here. It's seating capacity is close to 30,000 people. It was used for festivals, and other get togethers, now it is used for operas and concerts. If you are around for the opera season, which is late Spring through early Fall, do try to get to see an opera. There are seats on the flat area in front of the stage, and on some of the circles around the stage, but the cheap seats are huge stone steps that you sit on. The higher up you sit the less it costs. Not very comfortable, and they can get quite hot in the Summer. If you arrive early you can grab a cushion or even buy one, but you have to sit pretty erect for most of the time, because if you lean back, you are leaning on the person behind you's knees, same with the person on the step below you, where you have your knees in their back. You can buy tickets on their website. BEWARE that the Arena's opera musicians are not in a covered space, so if you see them get up and leave, it is a sign that it has begun to rain. Most of the time, you can wait it out, bringing or buying a poncho there, but if the storm is particularly bad, they will close up, put away the sets and close up shop. This is different for the various concerts that are given there, generally the bands can step back out of the rain, not the classical musicians whose instruments are quite valuable. There is ample parking, there is also an online parking system in place called Easy Park, not sure if it is in Italian or not, but if you get there early enough you can find places to park. Many bring sandwiches or other things to eat with them, Piazza Bra has lots of places to eat or you can stroll down to Piazza Delle Erbe where there are also many places to eat, drink or simply get a gelato. The Arena is magical, if you go during the day, you can pay to get in and walk around to your heart's content and take in the history. Notice that on both sides of the Arena, one often hidden behind a stage set, is the ""royal or VIP"" seating area, do climb up there and check it out. Careful where you put your feet, the marble is often smooth because of all the years of use. There are also souvenirs and snacks that you can purchase. We live not half an hour from here, and I take the train often to Verona just to walk around. Don't miss it. Oh, before I forget, if you go see an opera, you will see people with a booklet and a candle so they can follow along with the opera, which you can purchase as well, but DO NOT talk during the opera, only during the set change, the oldtime opera fanatics will kill you with a glance, or shush you, or even tell you to be quiet in Italian... that said, it is not a venue for small children...forewarned is forearmed, enjoy.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Definitely one for the bucket list when in Verona: you don't have to be an opera buff to appreciate the magic of this place. We went to see Tosca which was outstanding. We enjoyed our experience so much that we returned the following evening to see Aida.
The 'cheap seats' are more than adequate (they are the ones high up at the back of the amphitheatre, but the sound and views up there are still really good).
It is an outdoor arena though, so come prepared for changes in the weather: we took ponchos as large umbrellas are not allowed. We also took cushions as the seats at the back are the original stone steps. If you don't want to carry these with you, you can hire cushions at the venue and it is possible to buy a plastic poncho (albeit at an inflated price!) when you get there. You're not allowed to take in food and drink but we and lots of others did. You can buy a small selection of drinks and ice creams inside though.
It can get cool once the sun sets, but seeing the sky change colour and the moon and stars come out just adds to the experience.
It really is a wonderful thing to do in Verona, especially if you go prepared.

The arena is very interesting with many of the huge stage props sitting outside. Although we sat on the upper seats towards the opposite end of the stage it was still easy to hear the music, but was a little hard to clearly see stage details. My neighbour used small binoculars to get a better view of the actors. To help follow the action there are screens on two sides showing the words translated to English.

I'd recommend hiring cushions for a small fee as the seats are solid stone, and you can buy refreshments from vendors in the breaks (note take enough cash for this - I didn't have enough so we had to dash out to a supermarket nearby to buy cold drinks). We went late August and it was still very hot even as the show closed at nearly midnight. Only slight issue we had was a woman sitting in front of our daughter at one point decided to sit back against where my daughers legs were (we were in the row behind) which was inconsiderate, so try to ensure you sit somewhere where the next row down is empty. We are not opera buffs in any way but it was a great experience and if you are visiting Verona I'd thoroughly recommend going.

Whilst this is fine, having better information on things like how animals were introduced into the arena, etc. and more pictures of what the place may have looked like at different times during its history would have been welcome, especially as the floor was completely hidden with seating.

If I had had more time to plan, I would have booked a week when we could have attended more than one opera. They start right on time so you better arrive on time. We were in the seats where they ask for formal dress. You can basically wear whatever you want except we didn't see anyone in short in the seats. One guy was in a tux, some where in suits but most looked like they just walked in off the street. Most of the woman weren't any better dressed. If you buy a program, hold on to it! The woman behind me stole mine. I had it next to me. When I got up it fell between the seats. Everyone in our row left during the intermission so when I had a clear view of all of the seats in our row and below-if anyone had kicked it as they were going by. When my chair flipped up, I'm assuming it fell towards the row behind us. The woman had a large bag and I could see a program in it. She denied seeing my program, but it couldn't have gone anywhere beyond her and her two companions that were sitting behind us.

Italy,Arena di Verona,3.0,"This is a spectacular building and it is in great condition considering it is 2000 years old. It's big and is one of the best examples anywhere in the world of a Roman amphitheatre.

It doesn't take a lot of imagination to imagine what it might have been like when the gladiators were doing their stuff. So, why only 3 *?

We didn't see an Opera here but I would imagine it is pretty spectacular to do so. We visited one afternoon because we wanted to go inside a building of this type. In truth, we felt it wasn't one thing or the other, we couldn't decide if it was a modern concert venue or an ancient Roman amphitheatre.

The arena itself was full of plastic seating as technicians were busy building a stage and a lot of pre-concert work was going on so the space to move around once in the arena is very limited. This definitely detracted from the buildings original appeal so we felt our 10Euro entrance fee per person was not great value. It's a shame as this could have been so much better, there was a lack of information inside the concourse area - particularly the Roman aspect which was a shame as no doubt this building has many stories that could be shared. If you're going to visit it for the building itself and not to see an Opera, I would save the 10 Euros per head as it can be enjoyed from the outside which is where it is at it's most impressive.

It is hit and miss whether you can get food and drinks into the arena, our security guard wasn’t bothered but in the next lane they were taking things off people. So just decide whether you want to risk it. Drinks inside were €5 for a beer and €2 for a water.
We arrived 90 minutes early to get a good seat on the non allocated stone steps but this wasn’t necessary we could have arrived 45 minutes before and still had a good view, again it depends how central you wish to be.

To attend the opera must be amazing but I feel that the installed seating and all the lighting stands etc have detracted if not ruined this arena from its original beauty and atmosphere.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,Saw Carmen at the Arena - just fabulous! Very atmospheric. We had allocated seats but it’s a long performance and the seats were very small and uncomfortable - even with the cushions you can hire.

Over half of it was cut off from the public due to a performance later that day - but there was no discount for people visiting throughout the day.
Could hardly tell it was an old amphitheater as of all the metal chairs and modern stage covering the original stone seats.

I was glad we splashed out on front row seats again as Tosca is a really beautiful, intimate opera. I preferred the music of Tosca, although the spectacle of Aida was certainly more awesome and probably a better experience from the higher seats.

Tip-up Seats are available but the basic seating is a wide (Roman) stone step (cricket-style cushions to hire or take your own) When the staff saw my stick they led me up an easier access. Large company and orchestra plus (perhaps) Spanish horses. No apparent strict dress code and they come round with ice creams! A highlight of our trip.",Aug 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Incredibly place to experience the opera. Very well preserved and clean.
We saw Carmen, and it was absolutely brilliant.
The outdoor experience was amazing; and during the show there was even lightning in the distance which made it all the more surreal.

If you are sitting on the stone steps, be sure to take a cushion for your butt (maybe even two...you'll need it).
Also in hind sight, take some snacks and water bottles with you, we thought you weren't allowed but everyone brought them.

One thing I'd say is to make the translation screens slightly larger. My parents could not read a thing.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"During the Summer ‘Opera’ season, try to visit the Arena on a day when they have an Opera that evening…. you can sit and watch as the stage crew rapidly transform the stage from one set to another. The speed they build and work in the heat is impressive and it’s fascinating to watch. You can play a game of ‘what piece of the set will be craned in next’. Also worth walking around the outside of the Arena before/after your visit too, as the rest of the sets are stored outside and you can see all the props etc.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"What an incredible place to experience my first opera. Outdoors, incredible acoustics, every seat has a great view - in fact, those seats that are cheaper probably have a better view than the more expensive seats. The only drawback is that the cheaper seats do not have a back. We cheated, and after we were seated by an ""army"" of ushers, we came at them again when they were seating the first row, which allowed us to lean against the back of row behind us (don't ask me how, but it worked). Do, buy a cushion as you enter the arena, because the stone seats are not only hard, but they hold the heat of the summer sun! The opera is at least 3 hours and they have the translations in both Italian and English on a screen.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"This huge Roman coliseum was as impressive as you can imagine. A great place to see grand opera, which is what I did rather than do the tour. I sat in second tier seats, and was glad I had a seat with a back rather than sit on the stone seats higher up. Pricey, but worth it. I was really looking forward to the spectacle of thousands of candles alight, of which I had heard; however, it seems they no longer do this with every performance. We had rain the night we were there, so that may have prevented the candles, as the start was delayed two hours. We ended up seeing only about 40 minutes of the opera because the drizzle started up again. So, buyer beware, if it rains, you won't see the whole show. It is a grand spectacle with monstrous sets and big voices that fill the arena with no amplification. So, despite some disappointment, I am glad I experienced what I could.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We have been to the arena four times, the first time 19 years ago and then again last month. It is an amazing experience but had more impact the first time when we saw Aida, Nabucco and Rigoletto, all of which suited the setting very well. This last time we saw La Traviata and Carmen both much enjoyed. We sat, on both occasions, on seats not stone. I would recommend taking a cushion if you sit on either. On our first visit the weather was extremely hot and the second was warm - we had no need for anything but very light clothing and I did take a fan with me which was useful on the first occasion. We went to Mantua before the Rigoletto performance which made the opera all the more memorable. I think the Opera in the Arena is a must do if you are in Verona area. There are toilets in the Arena which I do not remember on our first visit.

The performance of Verdi’s enduring love story “Aida” was without doubt my personal highlight.

However, when leaving there were men dressed as centurions that asked if we wanted to take a photo. I didn’t, husband did, so we took some cheesy pictures. At the end, one pointed to the 20€ noted he had taped to his wooden sword and demanded a tip. Nope. You asked for photos. The man then grabbed my husband and demanded a tip. He informed him that I carried the money and said no (this is why I carry the money). A couple minutes later he followed us around the corner, grabbed my husband again and demanded money. He got nothing but if he had grabbed anyone else in the group he would have probably gotten a fight. It ruined an otherwise great visit to an ancient arena.

Outside the arena and inside when at the opera. Seeing Carmen opera was fantastic- hundreds of adults, some children, horses and great set on stage. Brilliant large orchestra and fab singing, acting and costumes. Skin tingling listening to the whole cast singing together.

Toilets are an absolute dirty disgrace!! Worse than in Roman times! Not enough and only a couple of sit down toilets for ladies - mostly hole in the ground ones and dirty!! At least provide decent portaloos where we can sit in a cleaner area!

The bar and program sale areas only take cash and are expensive. The large cellophane wrapped program only has 4 pages in each language so not worth purchasing.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We chose to see Tosca for our night at the opera and it was an unforgettable experience. We brought inflatable cushions and we bought 2 more (€4 ea) for our backs as it's a long time to sit with nothing comfortable to lean on. We queued for ½ hour and the gates opened at 7:15 for the 9:00 performance. Our seats were on the top row of the stone steps directly opposite the stage and you couldn't ask for a better view. Security was tight and everyone's bag was searched before you walked through a metal detector. Cameras are allowed but not video cameras however mine got through. I wasn't intending to record any of the performance which is strictly forbidden but just wanted some footage of the Arena and the wonderful ambience which I was able to get. There were a few spits of rain just before the performance started - enough that the orchestra went under cover. There was only a short delay of 10 min. and the rain wasn't serious. As you would expect from Puccini, the music was just beautiful. For those not familiar with the libretto, there were 2 large screens in English that were easy to read but not distracting. Small bottles of water are allowed but you could also buy ice cream, wine, beer and water from vendors moving through the audience. All in all, a night to remember and hopefully to be repeated.

We were provided a list of dos and dont’s which included “elegant dress is required, no shorts, tank tops or beachwear is permitted” what nonsense, every second person had shorts on, we ourselves were dressed for the theatre and were disappointed with the lack of enforcement to the rules,

Italy,Arena di Verona,3.0,"Really wanted to see an opera at the iconic Arena Di Verona and Carmen fitted our plans. The musicians were wonderful, and it was lovely to be in such a historic venue and the singing was excellent too, however there were some factors that let it down, and I'd only rate it as a 3 star therefore.

The costumes were all very similar and blended into each other, so no one stood out, not even the main characters! Therefore hard to get any real focus. Lighting was poor too and didn't fully pick out the main people, and also meant a lack of clarity. The choreography was poor too, as would have liked a bit more dancing/ acting. The sound system too was a bit weak and so felt that for a venue the size of the arena it could have been a bit louder.

Having said all this, there were some great aspects like having live horses on the stage, and of course a truly historic venue. So its a slight pity that key things let the performance down slightly.

Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"While not as large or famous as its cousin in the capital, Verona's Arena is a ridiculously well preserved Roman amphitheatre located nice and centrally in the small put picturesque city.

So good is the condition the structure actually finds itself in that they actually still conduct operas and shows within its ancient walls. I'll admit neither of these are my cup of tea but I'll also confess there is a part of me would actually love to take something in when the venue is along these lines!

If visiting during the day, between 8:30am to 5pm you can pay €10 to enter and have a look around. I'll be honest I thought this was a bit steep considering there's no museum or anything in there, you are literally just getting to walk about an empty venue, albeit a spectacular one.

I would still recommend visiting it if in Verona, because it is quite spectacular, but that doesn't mean I'll ever feel the entrance fee is justified

The seats were very hot and they sell cushions in there but we didn't opt for them. The only issue we had was when the staff were slotting people in directly behind us, which meant we couldn't lean back. This was also a bit of an issue when someone spilt a drink all over the back of my dress which I didn't realise until we stood up! One of the members of staff was also quite rude. However the opera experience was a good one and I would recommend it. We didn't stay for the whole thing though as it was pretty long!!",Aug 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We went as music lovers including a teenager to watch the opera Carmen. We went on a Saturday night and even though it was Carmen I’d say it was 2/3 full. (Although it holds 22,000 people!)

The opera itself is totally amazing - the cast is vast; at least 100 actors. The orchestra just as impressive with no less than FIVE harps! That tells you something! The performance was spectacular with 6 live horses and massive American trucks - and they looked tiny as the stage is colossal. The ambience and experience is absolutely incredible- the quality of the music, the chorus, the soloists is phenomenal. Tight performance - staggeringly perfected. The strange thing is that the sound has nothing to bounce off so it is somewhat ‘dampened’ despite how large the orchestra is.

1. Tickets
We booked the cheap tickets at €26 directly from website (although there is a service charge of €4 and another charge of €3 so they are actually €33).

2. Seating.
The tickets we bought are for the stone steps - Thing is, the next price range is €90 and if you get front row on stone steps it’s pretty much the same.

The big difference is that the stone steps are just that - stone with have no back rest, but the more expensive ones have seats. You might be better on the sides of the stone steps because you’re ultimately nearer to the stage and it is a long way nonetheless.

Cushions - you can buy these from the vendors outside or HIRE them for €3 each. You DEFINITELY need to do this. Especially because the feet of the person behind you share the space that you actually sit on, so a cushion gives you your own space requiring the person behind to negotiate your cushion rather than put their feet on you!!!

3. Food and Drink
They sell drinks in there - water and alcohol but NO food. They let you take good in. We took in huge ice creams and it wasn’t a problem.

4. Toilets
There are toilets are in those ports-cabin things, by gate 51 - so it’s just a case of going down the steps and out to them in the interval.

5. Weather
There was a lovely breeze the whole time which was nice but there was a few drops of rain - at the interval the guys were there with their €5 rain macs! So be prepared just in case.

6. Programmes and binoculars
These are on sale with 4 languages - English, Italian, German and I think Spanish. These are €5.
The binoculars are €10. I definitely needed these as it is quite far away. I have bad eyesight and unfortunately even with the binoculars I couldn’t really see - neither could I see the subtitles.

Second ring, almost opposite to the stage, 83 Euro pp. Make sure to be there on time, there might be a long queue at the security checkpoints. The venue was only half full, which was surprising in the middle of the tourist season. The metal seats on ring 1,2 and 3 are really uncomfortable, so buy pillows before the show (appr. 3 Euro each). The opera itself was good, but due to the huge stage and the massive scenes with literally hundreds of people involved, it felt quite different from other versions of Aida we have seen.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"No matter where you sit - if you are an opera lover, Arena di Verona is a must! The open air opera festival in the summer (June, Juy, August), is spectacular. As with all performances, of course the quality of the singing can vary, but the venue is totally unique. A word on choosing your seat: if you really want to do this - don't go cheap! Yes, you have perfectly good views from the cheaper seats up the sides of the arena, but the arena is BIG and you are very far away from the facial expressions of the performers. If that means less to you, then by all means, go for one of the cheaper seats. If you want the best seats in the stalls, go for row 31, centre. Here, you have no rows directly in front of you, and since the arena floor is only declining very, very little, the 3 metre gap between rows 31 and 30 is a huge advantage. You can stretch your legs, you can see everything on stage and at the same time you are far anough back in the area, so that you get the full ompression of the grand desplays that take place on and behind the stage.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Friends who are opera aficionados said that on our way from Venice to the Dolomites we must stop in Verona to experience opera at the Arena. On that advice we purchased tickets for two operas at the Arana: Carmen and Aida.

The Arena is a large amphitheater from the Roman empire days and is impressive on its own. For an opera production it is an amazing and spectacular venue. The productions with wonderful sets - Aida in particular - and the company utilizing every part of the the Arena stage and amphitheatre itself were thrilling. We left Verona saying that these operas would be a high point of our travels.

You don't have to be an aficionado to enjoy the experience of an opera in Verona.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We saw Aïda mid-August 2019. We got there at 7:30ish for a 20:45 start and didn't have to queue at all. We took a small backpack (think ladies' handbag size) with 4 x 500ml water in and some snacks and were allowed to take them in. The arena wasn't full and we managed to move forward a couple of rows to row 11 which is a gangway row so had lots more legroom just as the performance started. The performance was wonderful, it was our first time at the opera and we were hooked, started talking about going back next year. They are very strict about people filming or taking pictures during the performance and police it strictly. One couple in front of us were repeatedly asked to stop and then had their tickets inspected during the interval and were moved from their seats, I think because they had tried to sit in a better block than they had booked but it is unlikely they would have been picked out for a ticket inspection if they had not tried to film the performance on their mobiles. If you do sit on the stone steps be very careful, a lady fell off after missing her footing and hurt herself badly, thankfully the crash barrier stopped her falling further than she did and the paramedics were right in front of her. We read a review of Aïda that said if anyone outs an interval between Acts 3 and 4 they should be shot and although that's a bit harsh I'd say the interval between those Acts did break up the dramatic tension a little. An experience I would highly recommend, magical to be in the arena at night. It does get a little windy and chilly so take a jacket.

Italy,Arena di Verona,2.0,"Aida’s cast of hundreds made for an amazing spectacle. Shame that the performances were so wooden. It seemed that they were more focused on having huge tableaux than generating some emotion. Interesting decision to have children dressed up in fuzzy wigs and black face to represent child slaves. Didn’t feel comfortable with that.
It was a complete contrast to Traviata, wonderful energy and audience engagement. A huge rumble of stamping feet after each of the incredible performances. Aida was greeted with polite applause and increasing numbers of empty seats as the evening progressed.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Personally I'm not an opera fan, and up until now I've never been to one and never really wanted to. But we were in Verona and numerous people had said to us that we should visit while we were there, when in Rome so to speak....So, not without a little pressure from my wife, we and our 2 teenage sons we purchased (cheap) tickets for Carmen. We're so glad my wife persuaded us. It was a fabulous night, a wonderful experience and probably one of the best locations to take in our first opera.

I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of what you think about opera. There are large screens that give translations to that you can follow the story. I would definitely recommend taking / buying / hiring a cushion for the 'cheap seats' 3 hours is a long time to sit on a rock.

There are lots of signs regarding what you can and cant take in and dress codes. The latter only really applies to the central seated area right at the front. But you can take in water and snacks. These items, beer and wine are available to purchase inside but not sure of the cost as we didn't partake.

Ticket prices vary from around €25 (for the marble cheap seats at the top) to €250+ (for the opera mosh pit at the front.)

Go for it, you wont regret it.

We stood in line in the rain from 9 pm to midnight and the guards never let us in. We finally left at 12:15 am with all the other people. I emailed the ticket office to get. Refund on our tickets. They said the opera started at 12:30 am and ran for 50 minutes so there was refund due to us. Are you kidding me? Complete rip-off scam!! We actually sat across the street out of the rain and got a drink and never saw a soul go inside or lights come on to indicate there was a show going so I know they are lying to Keto their money. Beware everyone ... if you go and the weather is bad you will forfeit your money.

Unfortunately there was a heatwave while we were there and many patrons were passing out from the heat. Cushions are available to hire and are essential - not only for a soft seat, but the stones were around 40C. There are all sorts of regulations regarding cameras and dress codes. Mostly the patrons ignored all these. Unless you have one of the expensive seats you don't really need to worry about that. I found sound to be fine. Visually it's a large spectacle, but binoculars could be useful (or use the zoom on your camera). They had both English and Italian subtitles so it was actually quite easy to follow the story without knowing anything in advance.

Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"The opera itself was fantastic as was the venue! We paid about £250 in total for our seats and weren’t disappointed. Our seats were cushioned and 7 rows from the front although seated at the side however, each row of seats at the side are positioned elevated higher than the one on front so, even really small people can see (I’m 5 foot and could see everything). I’d pick these seats again over any others as even the middle section is flat so you won’t see if you’re under 6 foot tall. Prepare to pay over the odds for drinks such as Spumante and water (we were €16 for about 2x 100mls of Spumante!). Despite paying a lot for our seats, there is very little leg room or at the sides and in front, ur practically touching the person next to you. That said, I’d do it all again, it was amazing and I’m no opera buff! When ur positioned low however it is very hot (there was a heat wave and it was about 32 degrees at night with no breeze!) but still the best seats in my opinion.

No queues waiting forever, all gates open, security check quick and effective.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"An absolute monumental bucket list event set in the stunning surrounds of the Romam amphithatre. This production is on an epic scale, with a cast of over 350, amazing sets, horses, 60+ orchestra and simply exquisite voices, you don't need to be an opera buff to appreciate the grandeur of this masterpiece.

By all means get there early if you're in the cheap seats, but be warned, it's hot, hot, hot. I bought a fan and it's the best €5 I've ever spent! And you are sat on stone steps, a cushion is advisable. At 4 hours, this is not a performance for families with small children, it's too long, there's no escape once you're in there until a scene change or interval, and you're completely at the mercy of the elements. That said, organisers kindly have subtitles in Italian and English, and for sheer scale, ambition, once-in-a-lifetime events, it is just breathtaking, and a great place to make lots of international new friends wanting a fantastic shared experience.

Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"My wife and I went to La Traviata and left it till the day before to book but had no problem getting seats. The price was reasonable at 83 Euros for a mid year seat not sitting on the stones at the back (which we'd been told retain the day's heat so you are slowly cooked for the evening!).

There were big queues 30 mins before the start and it's not clear which entrance to use for metal detector and security checks but thankfully plenty of multi lingual guides to help. Once in then there are people selling drinks (you cant take in your own) and cushions (which you can). You will need both! It was a 3 hour performance and even at night it was 28c degrees. The Sears are hard metal so fairly uncomfortable with little leg room and I'm only 5' 10"".

The performance however was sublime with English subtitles on a screen and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening. However we'd go for the expensive seats in the stalls if we go again and take a fan though its formal dress for there and I got away with shorts and t shirt where we were.

It was the third Carmen I've seen and by far the grandest with a cast of about 150 (I was counting) and a massive orchestra (including four harps). It was a 'full on' production with horses and fireworks. Tickets were not pricey given the scale of the show; about £70 where we sat in the mid-range seats. Beware the rain as it can stop the performance and you won't get your money back. Our evening was paused for a brief shower but this worked out well as it had been very hot and this cooled the air down. If you are sat on the stone seats take, our hire, a cushion.

This being a venue review, they need to clamp down on visitors using phones during performances.

Seating in areas C and D is fine, and well worth the money. You can pay €3 for a cushion or take your own here. No spiked umbrellas allowed. Alchohol, soda and snacks available from the sellers in the stands during the breaks. If it rains, it gets postponed rather than cancelled - take a poncho / rain jacket in case.

All food and drink are checked before you go in,so beware they may take things of you .After two to three hours the marble steps begin to take there toll,so would suggest you either take a cushion or buy one at Arena for about four euros.The concert finishes very late around 12.30to 13.00,but if you are in need of something to eat,or a drink there are many of the restaurants near by still open

Bring a light rain cover just in case of thunder showers, and a fan in case it's too hot.
It was our first visit to this opera venue and we've decided we'll make it a yearly treat and dress up in proper evening wear (long dresses and tuxedos) in future. You can make it as glamorous an occasion as you want.
During the intervals you can leave the Arena and go into the square, buy an ice cream and properly stretch your legs. Even though it is such a grand venue, it's incredibly comfortable in this regard.

We did have reserved seating on the next level. Very cramped, very hard (even with a cushion). It was extremely hot and so many people suffered during the performance, the paramedics were kept busy! Take water in a plastic bottle with you, you’ll need it. Security can mean long queues but that’s a fact of life these days. One thing to be aware of is the lack of hand rails when getting to your seats. It can make you feel quite vulnerable, even the young and fit struggle. The good thing though is how helpful other people already sitting can be. Lending a hand to help steady people is a must if you are in aisle seat. All of this is worth it though, as the light dims this arena is magical. I’m only glad I did it before I’m too old! If I do go back, it’ll be to the seats in the stalls. I tried one during the interval and the were spacious and comfortable. I didn’t use the loos whilst here, but some of our party did and were not impressed. Of course it’s a Roman arena but the facilities seem to be very basic. Go if you can, it’s worth the hassle.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We had tickets to Aida, which is one of the best operas to see here and the best place to see Aida.
Unfortunately the weather changed from baking heat to violent thunderstorms just before we set off for Verona.
The rain was expected to stop by evening but it started again and was pouring down when we arrived. So we settled in to see how this wold be handled and experience for ourselves the extreme determination required to avoid all the circus of cancellations and refunds.

We sat for over an hour in macs and plastic raincoats while there were periodic announcements in three languages, reminding us that they were considering the current meteorological situation and would be back soon. The program sellers rushed around selling plastic raincoats. The interval bar opened so people could stay hydrated. Some of the staff was employed only to wipe down the seats.

After 1 hour, a huge host of staff turned up and wiped down the stage for what seemed an eternity, the orchestra appeared and disappeared a few times, as the rain teasingly stopped and started. Many expensive instruments can’t handle even a few drops of water. The program sellers started selling programs as well as raincoats.

Finally we experienced the first two acts, with just one interruption when the rain came back. The first interval was skipped to save time.

After the interval, we had an almost unbroken (dry) act three and four! Everyone did a great job and we still appreciated the wonderful production despite the interruptions. By the end, my eyes were closing so I could hardly focus to read the surtitles in English and Italian but many of the audience had left so my view of the stage was great. Leaving the arena at 3am, most eating places were closed so do take a small snack in with you. We didn’t get time for dinner that night ....

We bought the tickets for Carmen for 27th July, we got there at 9 o'clock as it was raining many announcements of wait and see were made, afterwards, we waited 2 hours.

Don’t miss it!",Jul 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,1.0,"Absolutely horrible experience. We bought the tickets for Carmen last night, we got there at 9 o'clock as it was raining staff said we would have to wait 2.30h to see if they decide to do it or not( which is already completely out of order to have 1000 people getting soaking wet under the rain), afterwards we waited till literally 23.25 which was still raining not as hard as before but it was still raining, so yeah after 2.25h the Arena was completely empty no actors or musicians were seeing around whatsoever. Somehow they made up the simphony in about 5 min and said they started the play at 23.30 which is completely impossible as you need to set up the stage for the musicians etc..
After that went on the morning to the office to get our money back obviously, but as I said before they tell you that the play started at 23.30, one of the staff told me they went on from 23.30 to 03.00 as I asked another girl from the staff she said it went on from 23.30 to 02.00 not even the staff know when it went on. Apart of that absolutely no one there to fix this. All the staff will say ""ohhh no I only sell tickets"" without giving you the option of a refund or not even a discount in a future. No ond showed up his or her face to sort out this problem to all the people affected. To be honest it was one of the BEST ROBBERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL TREAT. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE AND NEVER BE BACK.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,We were lucky enough to visit the Arena for La Traviata on my birthday. The building itself is incredibly well preserved and simply stunning for the opera. I would highly recommend a visit. This is a must do if possible when in Verona.,Jul 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,Sadly could only view from the outside. This is an amazing example of Roman architecture. A lot of ‘sets’ for the opera season around the grounds - they looked amazing so I imagine the opera would be quite something. Having the dog with us meant we couldn’t experience the opera but would like to in the future - it looks spectacular.,Jul 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"I was privileged to be invited to join my son and a group of friends for his epic birthday trip to Venice and Verona. Part of the Verona leg of the trip was a visit to the Arena to see Carmen.
I have to admit, I have generally avoided opera up until now, finding it all a bit too... intense..., but Oh boy.... this was a momentous experience!
We had ‘proper’ seats very close to the front (thanks son!) so were very comfortable, although I would imagine the stone seating would be rather hard on the rear by the final act...
The toilets were pretty grim, but doing a decent job with these might have compromised the 1st Century structure, so no complaints from me.
The Opera itself was brilliant, with a cast of hundreds, awesome singing, horses, cars and a pretty realistic dead bull on stage, but the real hero of the night was the Arena itself- to sit and watch this event, on a warm, starry night, with nothing but the sky above you, was truly awe-inspiring.
The stage was huge and the chorus were spread across the whole arc of the steps behind the main stage area. Being so close to the action meant we had to constantly look from one side to the other, just to take it all in, but it was worth it.
Being a bit of a philistine, i really appreciated the multi-language translation that was scrolled onto screens either side of the stage.
Fabulous, fabulous venue! Only drawback is that i will never want to see Opera anywhere else!

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"An arena thats well over a thousand years old that hosts major bands such as U2 and the Opera. Get a cushion 'cause you'll be sitting on the same stone bench that the citizens sat on 1600 years ago.
Vendors stroll the isles selling wine, beer, icecream and snacks (think Monty Python & the people's front of Judea!) The vendor will pass your stuff up via the people in front of you and the chain will then pass your money down, so try and take small denomination notes if possible.
It holds 25 - 30,000 people and fills from the front to the side, so the earlier you get there the better your seats. Seriously if it's summer and you can plan your trip to include the opera or a concert do it. It will be a story you tell for the rest of your life.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"I visited during the opera festival and went to see the fantastic Carmen (twice). the first visit was in the seated are, the second in the stone benches (only 26 euros!). A cushion is a must and they let me take in water and food (just make sure you leave it in the bag as you go through security!). There is something really magical and evocative about listening to opera in the open air.
If you aren't going for reserved seats and want to take your chances on the stone benches then I'd offer a couple of tips:
I thought my back would ache (it didn't) but I'd take a thick cushion as the concrete seat is unforgiving. Standing up between breaks helps, though. Take water and a cardigan/jumper because it can get chilly once the sun goes down.
If you are in the stone seating I assumed you could pick where you sit so got there early. Actually it's very organised and you are filed in from the centre and then fanned out left and right. It occured to me, therefore that some of the best seats were on the 'wings' closest to the stage. If you want to sit there (as I wanted to) then get there for about 8.30/8.45 (for a 9am start).

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Plenty of OK restaurants and the start and finish point for the little train.

The Roman Stadium dominates the piazza and for those lucky or rich enough, the opera presentations are magnificent.

The area around the arena is occupied by stage “props” from current and past productions, which gives a clear indication; of the size and scope of the stage.

But, for me, the fascinating thing was the series of printed panels, forming the fencing around the arena, each printed with a picture of the stage for a given production in a defined year.

The printed detail is a record of so many compelling stage sets and their associated opera productions.

How great it must be to have been lucky or rich enough to have seen just a few of these fantastic opera productions.

On a previous visit we were able to see inside the arena while the staging from a popular music concert was being taken down.

What a tremendous location and a dominating stage.

The huge stage within the Roman amphitheatre meant that a cast of hundreds and half a dozen horses, trucks and other vehicles could be used. Initial access to the amphitheatre was easy but, even in the best seats, it was difficult to get in and out at breaks. Money needs to be spent on lavatory facilities, particularly those (I understand) for women. Clearly what you can do in a historic building is limited in some respects but there is no excuse for old fashioned and unsanitary fittings.",Jul 2019

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"The summer opera festival of Verona is a lifetime experience for those who love art and opera. I just read that even people who watched an opera for the first time enjoyed it. The 2000 year old arena itself is beautiful from the outside and inside. The performances during the summer festival are special and feature very good artists. We enjoyed Carmen but Zeffirelli’s Il Trovatore was a masterpiece in every way. Magnificent Anna Netrebko was performing that night and it was beyond words.

The arena is in central Verona, therefore easy to reach. The decors from the previous performances are displayed outside which is very interesting.

There are always long queues to go in, so go a little early. It is allowed to take small and plastic bottles of water inside but no big or glass bottles. No cushions are necessary for numbered seats but you will need them for the cheaper seats. These are very cheap in the kiosks outside. Of course, the more expensive the seat, the better the sound and sight. Good seats should be booked in advance but the arena is so big that you can always find tickets. The summer festival lasts for about 3 months.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"It is a night to remember and they have added overhead or SurTitles in English so you can follow the songs and the plot easier for those of us that cannot speak Italian

Tips
Doors open at 8.00pm. Carry small bottles of water. Several people had to be treated by paramedics because of the heat as there is no shade, possibly this is why the performance doesn’t start until after 9.00 pm when night is approaching. Bring your own cushions, as to rent them at the arena is quite expensive. However stalls outside the arena sell them quite cheaply. We took our own from our hotel patio chairs.
I would advise people to get to Verona in the afternoon and bring a packed meal.There is a small shady park at the side of the Arena to eat it. Whilst in Verona you must see of course Juliet's house and wander through the Market on the Piazza della Erbe which was the old Roman Forum and ringed with lively cafes. For those staying at Lake Garda you can get any local Bus to be ticketed through to Verona for 6 euros changing at the bus station in the town of Garda which then drops you off by the Arena in Verona, and coming back a special Arena Verona bus leaves half an hour after the opera finishes from the Porta Cittadella, 5 minutes walk from the Arena round the side of the large building with white columns which is the Town Hall, and through an arch in the city walls This bus stops at all the towns on Lake Garda from Peschiera to Malcesine and costs 10 euros . You must book this Arena Verona Bus at your hotel or the local tourist Information centre.
Book your tickets in advance over the internet or your hotel can do this for you. Wherever you sit you will have a good view. It is truly one of life’s great experiences and it will never be forgotten. I have now seen Carmen, Traviata, Aida, Turandot and Il Trovatore. Each of them I will remember always.

Stage set was particularly impressive for Carmen as it incorporated creative lighting into the overall design. Lyrics subtitles were provided in both Italian and English. Stick to upper deck stone seats and imagine what it was like to watch gladiators and animals battled one another, except now enjoy a much less brutal and more refined performance. But make sure you bring, buy, or rent a cushion to make your time watching the opera more enjoyable.

Smaller yet older than the Colosseum, it's definitely worth a visit. I felt the €10 entrance fee was a bit steep for what it is - there's scant visitor information inside, you just get to wander around - but one hopes it goes some way towards conservation. The Arena was dominated by preparations for the opera season when I visited - which is definitely worth returning for!! I believe there are only a few months over winter when you get to see the Arena in its natural state, without any modern event preparations in place. This I find this all the more appealing, that this ancient building isn't just preserved for history and is actually still in use!

You can rent a cushion for 3 euros as your go in. The proceeds go to charity. There is a security check but it was minimal. You need to be able to climb those steps though. We were told to go early but it did not matter. There are ushers to point you to a row and when you are with a group they put you together. My only complaint is that the intermission was extremely long because they had to build the set for Act 2 and were having difficulty fitting the pieces together.

Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"No opera lover should miss at least one performance at the Arena.
The Roman well preserved architecture adds to the 19th century music. We had bought well in time tickets for Il Trovatore with Ana Netrebko as Leonora. The excitement was unbelievable. 20.000 people shouted, stomped their feet on the wooden floor, clapped standing in ovation and whistled in her honor. The least we could do in appreciation to this superb talented Prima Donna. Unbelievable voice and dramatic skill.
I have to praise the logistics, the sound technicians and all those who worked hard to enable an unforgettable experience hold in the ancient Arena which had witnessed performances during more than 2000 years.

Quite a lot of queuing in the sun, but eventually got our stone seats - take a cushion !!!!
You can take snacks and a water bottle - take them it’s a long night - but fascinating seeing the arena fill up , it go gradually dark , and the performance begin !

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"My wife had always wanted to see Aidea performed in the amphitheater in Verona so I got us tickets for her birthday. The arena is beautiful and between shows you can see the stage furniture stored by the green in the square. We had to que for an hour with little information comming from staff but they delayed the start to let every one in. Once in there was no time to get food or drink or go to the loo. I had just enough time to rent some seat cushions. It started at 9.45pm and went on for 4 hours. They structure it to have 4 acts with a break between each but because we started late they skipped the first intermission. If you get up during an act you can't go back to your seat incase you disturbe the performance. Having said all that (and as an opera philistine) I throughly loved it. The site and sounds were amazing and seemed like nothing I had ever seen before. They had the words up on a screen so we could follow the story. This is definitely the best thing about Verona and I would go back to see another show any time. Also my wife was in tears of joy watching it so in the end all was well.

We had a drink in the main square in front of the arena beforehand and it took around10 minutes to get through security and to our seats. We had booked seats 16H which are right in the centre, front row above the stalls behind the gold seats. Couldn't have a had a better view and loads of leg room and about half the price of the gold seats which were the row in front of us. We took in our own wine in plastic bottle so avoided any interval queues. The performance had us enthralled from start to finish, the music, the singing, the dancers and the sets were all first class. A wonderful evening that will live in our memory for al long time to come.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"If your travels will take you to Verona during opera season, be sure to get tickets as early as possible. The show is incredible, even for those of us who have not experienced opera before. The show's take place in the open air in the ancient arena. In our case, the opera was Verdi's La Traviata. The staging and music were amazing. Don't miss the chance go if you can.",Jul 2019

It's just a big circle of bricks. I don't know what I was expecting, but I feel really stupid for paying £10 to go and look at a big empty brick circle.
I have to say though, I think it must be amazing when the opera is on. However, on a rainy spring day, it's just not very entertaining. There aren't any displays or anything inside. It's literally just bricks.
There were a lot of Chinese tourists visiting at the same time as me. They were a bit underwhelmed too.",Feb 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,3.0,"At first I want to note, that La Traviata for me is the best opera and performance at Arena di Verona was really great ( the scene, english translation on monitors, decorations and etc.) Violetta played great!!!
Now I want to speak about organization, that for me was very bad.... When I bought tickets for 25 euro, I just realized that the seats are located high that's why the price is so cheap, buuut ..... the tickets don't have a seat number, so they sell thousands of tickets and don't care how can this crowd be placed!!! We were sitting so close to each other, that someone from up put his feet very close to my back)))) Then we were sitting on the hot stone ( I think 55 degrees or more)))) ) During antract we went out and wanted to buy water in the front of gate 1 ( parter) Can you image, they told us no you can't because you are with cheap tickets!!!! So, I wanted to BUY, NOT FREE!!!! they said go out and buy water in bar, considering very hot weather I think it's crazy!!! And my last point was a rude security, when I entered back with water from the street, he spoke very very rude italian, I explained that I don't speak italian, but he didn't care at all, at last I opened my bag and showed him everything, so he don't know the word OPEN!!!! I think if you become money from tourists you should be more polite with them and learn 2,3 elementary things in english to explain people what you want!!!! So, everything is only for reach people, true discrimination!!!

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"I saw quite a few queries about the Opera season in Verona and thought I would try to answer some of them. I have been to the Arena many times before but things have changed quite a bit over the years so I thought I would use this review as a bit of an update as I spent the last 2 nights at the opera we always sit on the unreserved steps so this is a review from that point of view.
Firstly arrive very early if you have unreserved seats on the steps, the arena opens an hour and a half before performance so 6.30 for a 9pm performance. I would suggest arriving at 6pm.Even if you have seated reservations I would still arrive in plenty of time due to the extra security they will not let you into the seated area if the opera has begun until the interval. Everyone has to pass through metal detectors and have their bag searched. This is surprisingly efficient there are however some rules about what you can take into the arena. NO BACKPACKS, UMBERELLAS, OR FOOD AND DRINK NO GLASS OR DOGS(just in case you were thinking of bringing Rex!!). However we did see some of the smaller backpacks being let in without an issue. They will also let you take in bottles of drink as long as they are no bigger than 0.5 litre. Anything bigger they will make you leave in the bin, they also don't seem to mind snacks so as long you don't turn up with a three course meal you should be fine if you are on the steps.
They don't particularly mind what you wear as long as you have a top and bottom. So no bear chests or bikinis. However in the reserved seating you are expected to be more formal with long trousers NO Shorts, several people were turned away whilst we were there.
Now most importantly the way you go onto the unreserved steps has changed, before you went through the gates up the steps found your own bit of step, now they fill the areas in an organised manner so you can't just sit where you like you maybe lucky (the early people) and be pointed to a seat near the front or more likely you are going to have to haul yourself up several very un even steps. My advice is if you are unable to manage ordinary steps or can't do 15minutes on a stairmaster then pay the extra for a reserved seat. It is organised chaos to be honest but the ushers do try to help if they can remember if you need the loo you will have to climb up and down them again you have been warned.
There are refreshments available from sellers who go up a d down the steps they range from 2 euros for a bottle of water to 5euros for a BEER. In the reserved seats you have to go to the bar not sure what prices they are.
Now some people do not seem to know what to expect, this is not Opera in a cosy theatre. It is a roman ampithetre in the open air. If it rains (unlike Wimbledon) there is no roof, likewise if it is very hot there is no air con, the steps really are very hard stone so take or hire a cushion (unless you have a particularly well padded bottom)..
The acoustics are good in the arena but there is no amplification of the performers voices so don't expect opera house quality remember this is an historic building.
If you can put up with all that with good humour then you will see and hear a unique performance in a unique place. This is a special place to hear Opera and I hope you will go and enjoy as much as I have over the last 15 years. La Traviata and Il Trovatore are stunning this year.

Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"What a stunning experience not just the opera ( La Traviata ) which was amazing but the sheer experience is highly recommended. We sat in the stalls which even with my disabled mother was accessible, the staff were polite and helpful speaking several languages and there were refreshments and facilities easily available.

The performance ran to time (be aware of late start / finish) and was simply stunning - just watching the scenery changes was mesmerising! The opera as you would expect was fabulous, singing flawless and acting excellent.

I admit I was a little apprehensive not least because of the accessibility and length of the performance (I’m not an opera addict just interested!) but wouldn’t have missed it for the world!

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,I saw Il Trovatore here and the music and scenery were beautiful and wonderful. I particularly enjoyed watching them crane the set into the arena on the morning of the show.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We went to the opera to see Aida, which is one of those 'once in a lifetime' experiences', and was a stunning spectacle, starting at 9pm and running through to around 12.30am with two intervals. Daylight was just beginning to fade as the opera started and gradually night fell, giving the event a great atmosphere.

The Roman's didn't believe in comfort though. The seats at the top of the auditorium are on the stone steps and it is worth paying for an upgrade, both for the better view and for the comfort of a softer seat (though you can hire cushions), and the toilets are inadequate for the numbers in the audience. We had great seats just alongside the stage, the only problem being that the subtitles at the top of the arena were a little disrupted by the obelisk on the stage in our sight-lines.

The stagecraft and scenery were very clever, the orchestra was magnifient and the singing was superb, though the softer lines sometimes were lost with the noise of the audience waving fans - it was one of the hottest evenings of the year (and water was essential).

All in all an enjoyable evening in this historic setting.

Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"This is a very good example of the Roman arena. However we had queues to get in, but it was worth it. Try to get there before lunchtime as a lot of the cruises and tours do arrive and it gets a lot busier. For the arena itself we had limited access due to them building a performance stage for the next run of Opera. However, if you climb the steps right to the top, and also the emperor balcony with the dignitaries or the emperor would be seated. Nat easy access with a pushchair and unless the children can climb the steps I would admire from the outside. Plenty of toilet access and then do have ramps, but if the children do want to explore it would be difficult. However, we thoroughly enjoyed it

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Can only reiterate previous reviews about this being an amazing experience attending the opera in such a stunning. A few extra tips:
We started queuing at our gate at about 8.00pm which allowed ample time to get through security and take our seats.
People seemed to be taking food in without any problems
At the intervals people wander round the seats with trays of cold drinks to be purchased.
Dress code- we were seated in Tier 2 and dress varied. It's an opportunity to dress up if you wish. A lot of people did.
The script is shown on a big screen in both Italian and English
Bars and restaurants in Piazza Bra remain open after midnight enabling you to have an after show drunk or bite to eat.
When trying to book the tickets online we had problems getting our credit cards excepted. So we called the Arena and selected the English option. A v helpful operator was able to sort our tickets out. If you buy tickets pre Christmas there is a discount.

Built in the 1st century AD, the exterior is incredibly intact and presents a quite imposing feature in the centre of Verona. Inside is also in really good condition and there are great storyboards that tell you about the restoration projects.

Italy,Arena di Verona,1.0,"It's been my worst experience with opera in a lifetime by now.
I've been to many opera theatres but I have never faced such bad organization before. We bought the most expensive tickets and were very excited about visiting the event.
Upon arrival 25 mins before the show and passing the first checkpoint, we had a glass of wine and then were going to take our seats, but I was stopped as my long shorts were not accepted by the ticket lady. Lucky me, I rented an apartment at the Arena Square so I got back home and got changed immediatedly. However, that was a huge mistake as it's hardly ever enjoyable to listen to anything being wet under +39 degrees centigrades.
I went back just in time but anyway we were not allowed to proceed to our seats as they closed.
As a result, having paid over €200, I had a great desire to get completely wet through sitting at a seat somewhere backwards.

The decorations were great but the performance and its organization are not worth coming to Verona for it. If you want to enjoy a performance, choose La Scala instead of this nightmare.

First night of Aida in the 2019 season. Amazing setting, luckily the rain held off, and after the nightmare queue the production was breathtaking. Hundreds on the huge stage and just spectacular. However, the sound is pretty poor, and unless you are in the stalls the voices loose their power by the time they hit the steps. Add to this the noisy, rude, and simply ignorant crowd and youou can forget any real appreciation of the music.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"We finally managed to visit Aida in Verona amphitheatre. Before going there I read a lot of suggestions here on TA and many of them were very helpful. So I will try to add my point of view.

Our opera was scheduled for 9 p.m. and we went there at about 7 p.m. Each sector has its own entrance gate. At our entrance there was already a very long queue and we were waiting about 45 minutes to pass the security control. There was a security staff member walking around and giving instructions to the visitors in the queue. While the weather forecast was not very good and some visitors had umbrellas he sad it was not possible to take umbrellas and big plastic bottles (1 litre) inside. But the man at the security entrance did not complicate about that so visitors could enter also with umbrellas and big plastic bottles.

After the check-in we went to find our seats. We had the stone seats in sector C (26€) which was on the right side of the stage. So our view was not central, but on the other hand we were closer to the stage and we could see and hear the actors better. If you take the stone seats bring a cushion with you or you can also rent it there (we borrowed it in our hotel). The performance lasted 3,5 hours, we were there about an hour before the beginning, then there was a 45 minutes delay (see below) what makes all together more than five hours of sitting. You can only stretch your legs during the change of the scenes (up to 20 minutes).

At 9 p.m. when the performance should start there was an announcement that due to technical reasons there would be a delay. We soon found out that the reason for the delay were the visitors with numbered seats who came just some minutes before the beginning and security check couldn’t handle them in time. The delay lasted about 45 minutes.

Some advices:
Bring some water with you because it can be hot (or you can buy it there from your seat). Bring something to put on if it is cold. Bring something to put on in case of rain (there is no way to use umbrella in that crowd). Go to the toilet before the start of the performance, because later it can be quite a challenge. In case of rain be prepared for delays or interruptions. Making photos is not allowed but many visitors were making them.

Well, that was the dark side. And here comes the bright one.

Luckily the heavy clouds went away and stars appeared in the sky. At 9:45 the performance finally started. Hearing the famous performers in those stunning scenes was like a fairy-tale. Verdi is my favourite composer and Aida was fantastic. Yes, we made all those efforts sitting there for many long hours but finally we were fully paid out.

If you have an opportunity to visit opera in Verona don’t miss it!

While it is in fairly good shape it is not not as spectacular or interesting as other arenas like Nimes, France for example. There is no good view of the city from the ""top"", which is guarded by fences",May 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,We were told to try and see an opera while we were in Verona and Carmen was it! To sit in the Arena where people have for centuries was absolutely mindblowing and wonderful! Highly recommend to everyone!,Sep 2018
Italy,Arena di Verona,3.0,Most of the arena is closed off because of the set up for a concert. Access is limited to the seating area and a damp vaulted area. The toilets are discussing and queueing disorganised and limited to one ticket office. If I had been going to a concert then the experience might have been different. The views of the city are nothing special.,May 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"You find yourself in Verona & of course you must visit the areana, an awesome site as & atmosphere. It costs €10 each to enter but it is worth the money, take plenty of water as it does get very hot 👍",Jun 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"Verona amphitheatre, nice but once you've seen one then do you want to wait in a long queue and pay to see another.

Best way to see it would be to book one of the shows or events inside",Jun 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,My wife and I stayed in Verona for three days and had coffee and/or wine here several times. It's a great location to people watch and rest between visiting Verona's many attractions. The Arena is beautiful and creates a wonderful ambiance,Jun 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Great place view it...it's impressive! !!
Would be a great place to see opera or a music concert but the whole of the arena is not open to the public as of the stage access for the performances.",Jun 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"if you want to experience outstanding operas with brilliant performers in a 1st century amphitheater ambiance....it is the place in the whole world...completely different...especially, the opening...turning off the lights...highlighting the tea candles in everyone's hand. what a way to open an event...breathtaking. creative set, light, costume, makeup designs and skilled performers...overall a spell bound experience. my better half and i attend every year. it's a sheer treat.",Sep 2018
Italy,Arena di Verona,4.0,"I was told that this the third largest amphitheatre in the world and it certainly looks very impressive from the outside and indeed is huge. However I for one was a bit disappointed with the interior. As the venue is used for a lot of concerts the whole of the arena floor and and good two thirds of the standing areas are permanently covered by metal seats and whilst I do accept that the arena has to maximise its income it did detract from its beauty. There is still a fair bit to see that's not covered with modern seating and its well worth the six euro entrance fee I agree its a must see attraction, and a great photo spot, but it did loose a bit of its magic for me.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"The Arena di Verona is the must-see sight in Verona if you are short of time. The ancient amphitheatre is huge and sits at the heart of Verona. It’s a nice place to wander around and offers some great photo opportunities. If you come during concert season you will be restricted as to where you can go due to the fact that seating is set up for the audience.

It is definitely worth getting the 24 or 48h Verona card if you are planning on seeing more than 3 sights as it pays for itself. Plus, it can save you queuing if you already have one, otherwise it can be purchased here.

Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Visited the arena before, however to be in the crowd on a good music event is much more. Even the rain stopped just when the show began.",May 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"I have seen the Colosseum in Rome and this Arena is equal to it. We were told by our guide that this was built before the Rome structure to test the plans. We also learnt that Arena means sand? Now used extensively for performances and events, ( Elton John was due to perform) the inside is well preserved. The spectacular outer ring has all but disappeared but 4 arches of 31m high remain giving some idea of what an amazing structure this was when first constructed.",May 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,We went to the arena to watch Elton John in concert and it was amazing. The arena itself is stunning and I felt privileged to be able to watch Elton play here. Overwhelming experience. I want to go back!,May 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Managed to see the Seat Music Awards 2019 in here and the atmosphere was incredible! If you have a good imagination, you could picture the ancient times. From the outside, it's a marvel to behold and think how its survived for nearly two thousand years.",Jun 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"The city itself is underrated, especially this beautiful Arena di Verona. Unlike the area around the popular Colosseum in Rome, this one is quite tourist free, better experience to enjoy this historic architecture, doesn't dissapoint. There are some nice restaurants and Cafe's around to chill and people watch.",Apr 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,Going to see an 'Open' opera in Verona is mint!! Certainly recommend it for anybody going to this region!,Jan 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"Verona is a beautiful area. Loved ambling through the narrow streets. Had to see Juliet`s balcony with my own ""Romeo"".",Sep 2018
Italy,Arena di Verona,2.0,The arena is very impressive from the outside. Do not pay to go inside it is used for concerts and has most of the original seating covered in stadium style seating and a giant stage in the middle. It is a crime they charge people to look inside when you can't see the arena at all. It is almost intact and build before Rome's colloseum such a shame corporate greed is withholding it from the public.,Jun 2019
Italy,Arena di Verona,5.0,"I was lucky enough to see Elton John perform in this wonderful location. I sat in the unreserved stone steps. I thought it was well organised and there were a lot of helpers on hand, I was able to enter the arena and exit quite quickly.

The stone steps aren’t comfortable but it’s part of the experience in an amphitheater. The character and charm of the venue added a lot to the concert experience of a legend like Elton John. I had to pinch myself that I was actually there at times and it will be a treasured memory.
