618a255e6fe3f9d3e4408447,UK,Tower of London,4.0,The beefeater tour with Gary was truly excellent. He managed to make everyone laugh but also teach interesting facts about this incredible place. The Crown Jewels and Tower of London building itself were the most interesting areas and unfortunately the Royal Mint building was closed for an unknown reason hence the dropping a mark.,Nov 2021
618a255e6fe3f9d3e4408448,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This took me right back to childhood and visiting here with my dad. I would recommend getting there early if you want to see the jewels as by lunchtime the queue was massive whereas a few hours earlier we were able to walk right in.
Give yourself a few hours to visit everything as the place is seeped in history with lots to see and it would be a shame to miss anything.
Some of the places to visit involve stairs and narrow spiral staircases so this is something to bear in mind if you don't like that kind of thing but you can walk all the way around the site if you walk up the walls.
We also had lunch in one of the on site cafes and that was lovely good service and great food
Definitely one of the highlight of our trip to London.

Beautiful grounds so old with the modern city in the background.
I would say 2 hours is enough time.
A cafe on site.
Visit the crown jewels.
I would recommend and return!",Nov 2021
618a255e6fe3f9d3e440844a,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We booked online and got our dates muddled and turned up a day early it was sorted easily with no fuss.
We joined Gary for the Beefeater tour and he was fantastic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and funny. The queues on the day were non existent and getting around every area of interest was easy and hassle free.
We saw all the main exhibits, the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Bloody Tower and time to get photographs with the Ravens.
Well worth the money.

618a255f6fe3f9d3e440844b,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We went on a Tuesday around 13:30, and it was so quiet! We went on the tour with our Beefeater, Clive. Clive was great, spoke clearly and loudly so all the group could hear, was full of interesting facts, and involved the crowd.
The whole experience was good fun for all ages, although I would say there are obviously a lot of stairs, so to be mindful of that.
Would definitely recommend.",Nov 2021
618a255f6fe3f9d3e440844c,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Beefeaters very knowledgable . Cut short due to rain but plenty to see in the towers, church. Will visit again. This was our 3rd visit",Oct 2021
618a255f6fe3f9d3e440844d,UK,Tower of London,2.0,"Nearly £50 for one adult and one child. Admittedly, we went during the bank holiday, so our time was mostly spent in queues. The buildings are iconic, but once you get inside, the exhibits are of a poor quality and little effort to make history come alive. My advice would be to walk around the outside, and visit the Leeds Armouries, which is free to enter.",Oct 2021
618a255f6fe3f9d3e440844e,UK,Tower of London,5.0,We've visited the Tower of London a couple of times before and always have a great day. There is so much to see and the information is very well put together. A great day for adults and children alike,Aug 2021
618a25666fe3f9d3e440844f,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the tower. We were lucky enough to be on the tour with Yeoman Warder Kelly AKA Beefy 409 who was absolutely brilliant! He was very informative and extremely funny, he had me in stitches a few times. He said he was actually quite new, but I would have thought he had been there for years, certainly a great addition to the team.

We got there quite early, so were fortunate enough to be able to see everything whilst it was still quite quiet. It's an amazing feeling stepping back in time and learning all the incredible history that the tower holds. Plus my personal highlight, getting to see the Ravens up close and personal; beautiful birds!

618a25666fe3f9d3e4408450,UK,Tower of London,5.0,Used our london passes and went straight in. We arrived just as the yeoman tour was about to start. Our guide was Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts. He was excellent and very informative and also very funny. I live this place,Oct 2021
618a25666fe3f9d3e4408451,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This was a fantastic day out on its own!

Tip: Start immediately at the Crown Jewels as the queues get massive later.

The place is huge and there is so much to see, read and take in.

My husband and I arrived with our 6yr old in the October half term and used our Go City passes for entry which saved us a significant amount of money.

The famous sights including the Ravens, the Bloody Tower and Crown Jewels were fantastic and we were amazed that people actually lived on site!

Highly recommended trip!

618a25666fe3f9d3e4408452,UK,Tower of London,3.0,£29.90 entrance ticket price. Really not worth the money. All rather dull. Queued for ages to see the Crown Jewels.,Oct 2021
618a25666fe3f9d3e4408453,UK,Tower of London,1.0,"We were very much looking forward to our visit as a fun and educational family day out. We were very disappointed in our visit due to the number of people there. We felt that, even taking Covid out of the equation, there were far too many people. We had not expected this, given that we had booked tickets online in advance. The website says that 'You can safely explore the history of this famous fortress, palace and prison' and all the attractions that were included in the ticket price. However, it was impossible to visit even close to everything, and certainly not safely, due to the volume of people - every tower / building etc had a queue. For the Crown Jewels in particular it was ridiculous. There was no way to social distance, no one controlling the numbers of people in any of the buildings. It ruined our experience. Given that we are still in a pandemic, the number of people was unacceptable. We arrived at 12 midday and had expected to stay until the closing time of 4.30pm. We left around 3pm as we found the crowds of people too stressful and overwhelming. We undertook a 45 minute Yeoman of the Guard tour at the start of our visit and whilst this was both informative and fun, it was again spoilt by the amount of people - it was difficult to hear the commentary. It would have been far more enjoyable and Covid friendly to have split the group into 2 or 3. There were plenty of Beefeaters around, so I think this would have been a manageable solution to improve people's experience. Also advertised for half term was 'Ghost Raiders' - a half term Halloween activity for the children - there was no mention or sign of this while we were there. I could not recommend that anyone visit this attraction during the school holidays. Such a pity when it could have been an amazing experience. I understand that venues are trying to recoup lost earnings, but it seems to me that the attitude of 'Historic Royal Palaces' stinks of greed and arrogance, having no consideration of their visitors' enjoyment or safety.

618a25676fe3f9d3e4408455,UK,Tower of London,2.0,"We visited the Tower with 2 children during half term. I expected it to be busier than usual but was extremely disappointed to find it so crowded. We had booked online for 1 pm but went in early - cursory check. We had paid for an audio guide but such a long queue to get into shop, we didn't wait. It felt chaotic and disorganised - get as many people in as possible. We saw battlements and the white tower, unfortunately not the Crown jewels (queue went beyond the white tower). In time of Covid, I did not expect this. Signs saying to wear masks inside buildings but they were by far and away exception. Only one member of staff on battlements who did not appear to be controlling flow of people into tower. By far the worst experience I have had in a public situation since beginning of Covid guidelines. Value for money would have been good if we had been able to see more. However it turned out to be an expensive afternoon.

618a25676fe3f9d3e4408456,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Tower of London- I would suggest going as early as possible- we went when it opened and noticed it got busier as the day went on.I got and audio tour for my child and it made it so much more interesting - (ended up telling me facts) and engaging. As you don’t have to do it in a set order it was so pleasurable. Every member of staff we interacted , met were polite and had a smile.
We spoke three members of staff asking them questions each one of them had fantastic knowledge of the Tower of London. The cafe on site had a lovely selection of food for all. Highly recommend going to explore the Tower of London. It is definitely a day out .",Oct 2021
618a25676fe3f9d3e4408457,UK,Tower of London,3.0,"Nice, very busy during half term there was quite a que.
There is some confusion over the towers and would be good to hire out an audio for the tour which didn't come to mind when we booked. Need more than just a couple hours here as it could take most of your day seeing the history behind Tower of London. Great day out.",Oct 2021
618a25676fe3f9d3e4408458,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"An excellent family day out, so much history, would reccomend the audibility package to really make the day worthwhile if understanding of the historical events of the Tower is a priority. We had a 7, 10 and 13 years old and they all had a great time. Would suggest to book out the full day to really maximise the tru historical significance of such a landmark destination.",Oct 2021
618a256d6fe3f9d3e4408459,UK,Tower of London,4.0,It was great visiting the Tower of London generally but sadly a bit too busy (being a school holiday) to see everything. But we will definitely be visiting again,Oct 2021
618a256d6fe3f9d3e440845a,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Great visit and interesting facts. Will be back for another visit. Too much to see in one day.
Well worth a visit and very interesting facts.",Oct 2021
618a256e6fe3f9d3e440845b,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"There is so much history here, from the 11th century to today. Yeoman Warders are amazing - what a GREAT JOB! Their tour is excellent and included with admission - be sure to take the tour.

I became a member of Historic Royal Palaces to have more flexibility to go in whenever we wished during a recent trip to London. Membership is WORTH IT. Be sure to book directly.

Go in, enjoy watching the ravens (they truly take their jobs seriously and provide plenty of entertainment for their visitors), go see the Crown Jewels (WOW!) when there is no line, take plenty of time in the White Tower. The cafe is adequate should you need to grab tea/coffee/cake/light snack while you are there.

Wear comfortable shoes...old cobblestones are not forgiving should your choice of footwear err on the side of fashion vs. comfort and function. Enjoy this wonderful place!

There’s a lot to do inside and it’s really informative, it was lovely to see the queens guards doing their marching outside the Crown Jewels area.

I’m glad we went but it is probably something I would only do once in my lifetime. But all in all it was a good day out

618a256e6fe3f9d3e440845f,UK,Tower of London,5.0,Well worth getting there early to miss the queues into the popular Crown Jewels exhibition and White Tower (although they were around 45 mins at peak time compared to 2 hours in pre Covid times). We paid £29.90 per adult and £14.90 for our 8 yr old and it was certainly worth the money as we were there for over 5 hours. The Yeoman/Beefeater tour was both amusing and informative (thank you to Barney) and would say that the White Tower is not to be missed for great exhibits and interactive games for children.,Oct 2021
618a256f6fe3f9d3e4408460,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Really interesting and informative tour of the Tower of London.

A great storyteller and his ""we'll beheading this way"" joke slew me. Well done sir. Then we went through the white tower and I really enjoyed this historical tour. The fusiliers museum was surprisingly small, that being said it was enjoyable. The biggest let down was the Crown Jewels. The crowd control was dismal and the exhibits were quick to see. Felt like a bit of a let down in all truth. The white tower and prince's tower were far better in my opinion. But, and I can't believe I'm writing this, the best part was the cafe! Their cake selection is second to none, exceptional victoria sponge. If it weren't £30 to enter each time I'd be there for cake daily!

I've marked it ""very good"" as I do appreciate the important history of the place and glad we did it. Entry price is fairly standard for attractions in London but don't mind paying since it needs a fair amount for the upkeep and staff.

Starting off with a tour by Yoemen Warder Andy M was a great bonus. I'd normally find these things drab but he made the 45 mins entertaining (think dad jokes and slightly un-PC, which we loved) and very informative. He finished off telling us both about the guards outside of the Crown Jewels and then about how he became a Warder...by the end we were all brimming with the British Pride that oozed from him.
After that a wander round the buildings and exhibits, plus a drink in the Armouries cafe (clean and spacious).

We had a great morning out here. £29.90 each is a bit pricy, but we got two for one by printing off a voucher from National Rail, showed our train ticket at the box office and hey presto, half price.
(You're welcome! :)

We started off as many do with a yeoman (beefeater) tour that were running every 30 mind. The tour was free and starts just by the entrance. We had the honour of being led around by Yeoman Paul who is a real entertainer full of knowledge and a great sense of humour.
He said we made his day by asking his name for a review. Nope, you made ours, mate.
The tour is a fantastic way to start off the visit as its only 45 minutes to an hour and really sets you up to explore the rest of this beautiful historic masterpiece yourself.
We finished the experience with a well earned trip to the Spoons opposite so really did experience the best of British that day. ;)

If you can get a tour by this guy I would suggest it!! He’s very interesting and makes the tour entertaining!

618a25866fe3f9d3e440847f,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Me and my Mum visited the Tower of London on our most recent staycation in London. We were not disappointed. We’d booked in advance online and we got a souvenir book included in our ticket price.

We were expecting it to not last the majority of the day, but oh my goodness you definitely get your moneys worth. We arrived for the morning session at 11am and we didn’t leave the Tower of London until around 5pm. We stopped for some lunch in the restaurant which was lovely.

Take your time to look around all of the places within the tower grounds. The beefeaters know so much and are very knowledgeable so if you have any questions, do ask them!

The most interesting find for me was the fact that Anne Boleyn is buried inside one of the chapels. The chapel is right in front of the place where she was beheaded!!

You will learn so much - and remember it’s a whole day trip - not a quick excursion - so make sure you leave plenty of time to do it - and enjoy it!

618a25866fe3f9d3e4408480,UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The tower and its artifacts are fascinating when you think of the history involved. However I found it to be a glorification of the monarchy, which I expected, and also war, which I didn't.
Looking at the tower's prisoners' graffiti while they were awaiting their fate was harrowing - despite knowing they'd been abandoned to their death, they still prayed to their gods. Blind faith, I suppose.

The attractions and exhibitions are pristine, exceptional and teeming with information and history displayed in such an informative but still engaging way. We first visited in February 2017, and recently visited in October 2021. Still, visiting 4 years later, we felt as if we’d learned so many new things again and had the most incredible, special experience. Beefeater #409, Sergeant Scott Kelly, was just absolutely incredible, so animated with a passion for the country and its history that you couldn’t help but share in and feel to the extent he did, and such a warm and hilarious nature within his tour that you couldn’t help but be engaged and hang onto his every word. He made us laugh, he made us squirm in disgust, he made us come together as strangers to participate and marvel at history and he made us want to delve into our history as a nation further and further. There is so much to see and so many incredible elements to be enraptured by, I would suggest taking the whole day for this incredible heritage site. This is not the first and nor will it be the last time I visit and enjoy with the upmost passion this incredible place and it’s wonderfully put together displays and immersive experiences, as well as the incredible people who keep it running and are walking embodiments of tradition and historical importance.

618a258d6fe3f9d3e4408489,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We knew the Tower of London was one of the top attractions here in London, however, the history and the crown jewels just blew us away. The most important thing is to get the beefeater to give you a tour. Every hour on the hour there is one available just inside the main gate you will see a small crowd gathering around him. They are the most entertaining and funny lot . Facemasks were requested to be worn inside the buildings but not outside. The Crown jewel area was the most crowded but everybody kept trying to adhere to the social distancing. The jewels are very real - there are coronation crowns etc decorated with the most amazing precious stones among which are the largest diamond and the second largest diamond in the world. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Everywhere else you can take pictures. The Armory in the White tower is incredible should not be skipped. When you’re done with the tower of London, take some time to walk along the wharf to admire the Tower Bridge that’s very nearby.

What an amazing place and they must have opened up more of the battlements and turrents since I last visited years ago. The Crown Jewels are still awesome and we were so lucky not to have to queue although i think the pre booking has improved the visit experience as it was far better without crowds of people and shuffling around. The Beefeater tour was entertaining and a must as they really do give you an insight into its history. Loved the interactive part of the White Tower where we tried our hand at dressing the king and shooting a cannon. Views across the Thames were of course amazing. It was certainly well worth the admission price. It gives Goosebumps to think you are treading in the same place as past king and queens - and very poignant moments in the chapel thinking of those executed. A must for everyone.

We started off with a Yoeman’s Tour which I thought was very good, it wasn’t too short or too long and gave me a good sense of foundational knowledge to look around afterwards. I was very surprised at how beautiful I found the jewels however I did feel like the wording of how we “occupied” some of the jewels was a little too generous.
Unfortunately we hadn’t realised that the winter closing times had come into effect since we planned the trip and ended up with only 3 hours to view the place. Which meant we missed a few areas and rushed around some of the exhibits, so do allow plenty of time to look around. In our research we read that the closing time listed was the closing time for the buildings but you would have half an hour to look around after that. This is wrong, we were all ushered out a little before closing time and they wouldn’t even allow my family members outside to wait for me until I could leave the building and were politely threatened with security which left us all feeling a little sour with the place after a pleasant afternoon.

We met a fantastic yeoman there who told us some incredible stories about the tower and his own experiences. The crown jewels are obviously a big attraction but we got a good amount of time to look at them although understandably the distance you can get to them and photography of them is of high security which is a shame but understandable.
Apparently there is an audio guide as well although we didn't bother with it as we were happy just wandering around.
All in all a fantastic way to spend the day. There's also a nice little souvenir shop outside and a few places to get something to eat and drink as well.
Tip: Make your way down to the bottom of the hill in front of the tower where the boat cruises/uber boats are as you get a fantastic shot of Tower Bridge as well.

So much amazing stuff to see from the etchings in the walls by prisoners, Henry VIII’s armour and of course the State Crown Jewels which were absolutely amazing.

Well worth a trip, would definitely recommend looking at going when it’s not as busy!

The Yeoman warder tour is something i recommend you start with. The warders are so engaging and very approachable throughout the day. Save your money for the gift shop at the entrance rather than buying things in the smaller ones dotted around. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to climb a LOT of stairs!

On arrival, entry into the tower was quick and with the right number of staff to keep queuing down to a minimum. We did not make use of the tour guides and decided to make our own way around the tower but from what we heard of the guides, their knowledge was to a very good standard and they attracted large crowds. The facilities inside the grounds were good. The tower cafe was reasonably priced for London, but the selection of foods available could have been improved with more vegetarian options . The toilet facilities were clean and of a good standard. We spent 5 hours at the tower which on the day was plenty of time, however we went at the end of the summer school holidays so it was not particularly busy so more time may be needed at other times.

We visited on 31st August which turned out a perfect day as there were no queues anywhere, we walked straight into the jewel house.

We did the battlements walk where you get some great views of Tower Bridge

Our tour with the Dave the Beefeater was informative and very funny, a quick witted man, it seemed that most people were British therefore mother tongue English which I think Dave enjoyed as he knows we all get his wit!

Beefeater Dave did have to deal with a police helicopter literally overhead (dealing with ridiculous people blocking tower bridge on their protest..but don’t think about the total disruption of normal people we saw 5buses stuck on London Bridge for at least two hours again due to so called protesters ..sorry went off track there!) which meant he had to raise his voice a lot..he did really well.

I have seen some comments about ticket problems..we had none..we printed them off went to the entrance and entered half an hour before our allotted time.

We had a fab day and enjoyed our history which we all know but this visit makes it real and loved seeing the Crown Jewels.

This is definitely a ""don't miss"" on your trip to London, but you'll need at least half a day to see it. You can take photos inside and out, so be sure to bring a good camera.",Aug 2021

618a25d16fe3f9d3e44084e2,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I have just returned from a day out at the tower and have never felt so compelled to write a review! I was with my two children, the youngest of whom has special needs, and my mum (who had an injured foot) I had chosen to come post covid as I knew it was slightly less busy and my son would cope better - however I really needn't have worried, as soon as we entered I got chatting to a Yeoman Warder, he showed me his sunflower wristband and told me about his family members similar to my son, made such a fuss of both of my kids and I felt so welcome straight away! This theme continued with all the staff, my con often touched people's legs, and got the rear end of another warder, I was mortified as usual, but he and another warder laughed it off and made us all laugh too, again making a fuss of both of my kids, as my elder child can often get a bit left out when her brother takes priority, this wasn't the case at the tower! When in the main, white tower the staff again went above and beyond, due to the steps we were all on foot and my son was tired, and lying on the floor, obviously although I try not to react to onlookers it makes you feel stressed, but the staff were able to approach us in such a relaxed manner, I didn't feel stressed or like we were a problem, only supported! One staff member magically got through to my son who has very limited communication and convinced him to walk to the dragon, once on that floor another staff member found his way to us and took both of my kids under his wing, showing them all the interactive games and helping them work them all in a fashion where they could both be involved! We were then offered the staff exit stairs so that it would be quieter, however we wanted to see the dungeon, so this guy held the crowd for a minute so that we could go down an otherwise very busy staircase a little more calmly! Throughout the day Yeoman Warders we had spoken to came over to chat and check we were okay, always including the kids, they also advised the best places for my mum to join in or sit out as she had injured her foot. I became a little overwhelmed with emotion near the end of the day when chatting to one warder because I have never quite experienced a whole venue that is so inclusive of autism and special needs, I would reccomend this venue to any and all families, I really felt like we might miss out not being able to have a guided tour (as my son wouldn't tolerate that) but I feel that we, and all visitors really, totally got the star treatment! I can't wait to come back, possibly on a girl's evening with my daughter and mum again to see the ceremony of the keys. We all had the BEST day!

Various hand sanitizer stations around the whole site. If you love history then well worth the visit, traitors gate, the torture tower, prison tower, the main tower with Henry 8ths armour and other kings and queens equipment. The crown jules is worth seeing and you go on an escalator which keeps people moving. Be warned lots of steep steps around the towers etc so if you struggle with steps maybe just visit and do the ground stuff. Guards on duty same as Windsor castle, ravens roam free around the grounds who are used to people. Plenty of staff around to ask questions too and gain knowledge from. Per visit it takes 2-3hrs to complete. As usual gift shops around. If you live old British history with kings including Charles 1,2 Henry 3, 8 then worth the visit.

618a25e86fe3f9d3e4408500,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Went on a Friday during school holidays but wasn’t too busy, loads of people but not so many you couldn’t walk through the various rooms and areas to see the exhibits. Listened to one of the yeoman give a history of the Tower, he was really entertaining and knowledgeable and could happily have listened to him all day. I personally wanted to see where Anne Boleyn died and was buried, but there is so much more to see and learn.
As with every tourist attraction in London this was a very expensive day out. Food and drink was fairly mundane in the cafe but absolutely astronomical prices (£7.99 for a very basic sandwich) so I’d recommend you bring your own packed lunch.
For the history and experience I’d recommend this to anyone who is able to climb hundreds of steps and doesn’t mind some degree of crowds.

Social distancing was utterly impossible and mask wearing was minimal.

Beerfeater Dave led our tour. It was shortened from 60 minutes to 45 but very interesting and entertaining. Not all areas were available to visit and the queue to see the crown jewels was very, very long in the earlier part of the day. We visited towards the end of the day when the queue was much shorter.

Walked through the White Tower, along all (available) battlements, other buildings and grounds but could not cover it all. Planning to return to compete our visit.

Was made to feel very welcome and all the beefeaters were friendly and happy to chat. I felt that the to the staff this was not just a job but a passion and they wanted to be there, this was evident to how they served the guests with humour and a smile. The only things that could made quicker was the queue to the Crown Jewels and the restaurant only took cards cash not allowed, not made clear until you are at the till with trays full of food.

I would like to thank all the staff for making everyone welcome please keep it up you are appreciated by us guests.

You can get very close to the crown jewels in their glass cabinets (unlike, for example, the Mona Lisa in Paris).

I really enjoyed the beefeater tour and would recommend it. I think ours was called Mark, he was entertaining and funny, but also full of stories from history. The one criticism I had was that it was pretty gory, and there were young children in the audience.

618a25fd6fe3f9d3e440851d,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"You go to the Tower primarily to see the Crown Jewels. They are beautifully presented and it is amazing how close you can get to them. They are well-lit, which makes the jewels sparkle. We visited on a Sunday morning in August 21, so there weren't many international tourists so we walked straight in and spent a long time looking at the jewels without crowds; looking at the queuing system in place I think it must get quite busy.
The rest of the grounds are good too- I was surprised at how much you get to look around.
Many of the Warders are very friendly and helpful but I think some of them are a bit 'clever' and full of themselves. One of them scoffed at my daughter's request for directions as it appeared obvious, but when he realised he was in the wrong because of the Tower's Covid restrictions in place, he 'wound his neck in', to use a military expression.

618a25fd6fe3f9d3e440851e,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We visited for the ceremony of the keys where the tower is locked up for the night. This is after the tower is closed to the public and is a guided visit with in our case about 20 people.
It was a fascinating experience which made me realise that royal ceremonies cary on whether any one is watching or not, in this ones case for each day for over 700 years.
It was made special by the yeoman warden (acting as a guide) who was both informative and humorous.
One thing to note is that the paths are cobbled so not the easiest to walk on.
If afterwards you want to get a taxi you need to arrange a car to pick you up afterwards.
There is a taxi rank opposite the entrance but no taxis and trying to flag a taxi down at that time of night is nigh on impossible.

An hour later queues were very long and continued to get longer. The day was very interesting. We were there for about 2.5hrs. I would say allow more time if your children were older and would allow you to read more! (My kids were 4.5 and 7). It was raining the day we visited.

The list goes on. And with every part there things to learn. Information boards about certain events/people all over. It can take a while to get round so make sure you give yourself plenty of time.

We started our tour with the Yeoman Warder who was incredible. He made the door so engaging through his theatrics and incredibly projected voice.

The tour started by the entrance gate and ended in the central court by the White Tower and took roughly 45 mins. I definitely recommend tagging along, it doesn’t cost extra and you learn quite a lot more.

I also recommend queuing for the Crown Jewels as soon as you can as they can get quite long so best get them out of the way earlier rather than later.

There is SO much to see around the Tower and loads of interesting rooms to read about. Our entire visit took around 3.5 hours but you can easily spend more or less than that.

The museum was very interesting to see the journey of the regiment over time and how equipment and uniforms have evolved and not least the ramparts that defended our city. This may have been my first visit but it certainly won’t be my last as there is still much to see.

There is a travellator system to move you around the crown jewels displays and then there is a good amount of space when witnessing the other spectacular displays.

Was very good be able to get within 2ft of the Crown Jewels used by past and present Monarchs. There’s lots of different area’s so being fairly fit is really a necessity with lots of stairs to climb but well worth it. The only thing I found a little sneaky is when you exit onto the riverside you can only go one way so you have to walk through the gift shop so if you want to visit tower bridge after you have to walk all the way round which is quite a trek straight after walking around the tower for a couple of hours. This could be made much easier if they didn’t want you going through the gift shop and not block the other way off. (Very Sneaky) I wouldn’t suggest it for young children as you could see them getting tired and bored.

I would welcome more diverse exhibitions, touching on issues such as women's lives, more information about royal jewels and where they come from (were stolen from...). The tickets are quite expensive, upgrading to membership seems to be a beter option as it give you access to more than one place.",Aug 2021

Beautiful surrounds - very atmospheric and grand. So much space, so even when it was busy we felt we had lots of room. Friendly and attentive staff. Kicking myself it took a pandemic to visit. Funny how we don't support UK tourism until going abroad is not an option. My husband and I got as much out of it as our children did. Learnt a few new historical facts!

Make sure you go on a beefeater tour - ours was Barry Stringer, he was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about what he does and added humour along the tour. Also a mention to Louisa, who also had passion for what she does and the knowledge she has is brilliant. The only downside to this visit? Was the queues for a coffee, it needs better organisation, I felt sorry for the guy serving us under extreme pressure and people stood there tutting because they had to wait. Other than that?

One word of warning: don't book tickets through Headout: I booked 4 and had a confirmatory email but only 3 tickets were sent. On requesting the 4th I got an email saying that although it was their mistake there were no more tickets available for that slot and they would be issuing a refund. Not much use when you have a student and 2 kids expecting a day out. I got a 4th through the booking office at the Tower and Headout did issue a refund but it all caused a lot of unnecessary stress and Headout's apologies were scant. Just book through the Tower's booking office and have a great day out!

We thought there was too much emphasis on weaponry. Stirling Castle is local to us and in many ways similar to the Tower of London in that many parts of it have been added, removed and changed over the centuries. Would have been good to have characters in dress and acting the part of Henry VIII etc. At Stirling Castle they have lots Royals and a nanny such as Mary Queen of Scots. King James and MQOS Nanny in dress and talking as they did then and acting the part while you asked them questions. This is brilliant. The Royal Rooms have been restored and are fabulous. Yes Stirling Castle was part of the War Machine, but people also lived there. What about the living quarters or prison rooms of captives? We saw lots armour etc but nothing related to the actual living there of people. The Crown Jewels are an awesome sight to behold. Great place to visit but as I said a little less emphasis on the war machine and a little more of how people actually lived there.

The Tower was an absolute joy to behold. As I grew up not far from there, on the Old Kent Road, it brought back many happy memories of my childhood and I remember always having loved the spectacular Ravens, beautiful as always. Scott was the cherry 🍒 on top of the cake.

Easy arrival, (pre booking was required and timed entry) but worked very well. The talk with the beef eaters is a must and Colin who did ours (his first in 15 months )was brilliant, he bought the history alive and gave our visit content. The chapel is very moving and of course the Crown Jewels. Food options were good and lots of areas to sit and enjoy a picnic, watch your food one of the ravens had a packet of crisps off somebody before they could react. Shop had the usual tack as well as some well thought out lines to buy. Can get busy and a couple of areas have a challenging access route, hardly surprising when you take in to what the site is.

618a262f6fe3f9d3e4408566,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It was pouring with rain when I visited but I wasn't going to miss my chance. After buying a £30 ticket I went through the main entrance to be greeted by a catapult and some beefeater guards in their black and red outfits. I went into what was once the bedroom of King Edward the First and heard some of the history of the English kings who lived here in the past on a TV screen. You also see the throne room of King Henry the Third, of course the bedroom and throne room are recreations of the originals. There are statues of animals as the kings of the past kept exotic animals here as well. You can find where people were kept imprisoned and even tortured, with some torture devices still lying around. You'll find weapons like a crossbow and and items such as coins and pots from the Middle ages. You'll also get to see the Crown jewels, however you can't take photos of them. Go inside and you'll see crowns and sceptres, huge wine jugs and golden items costing who knows how much. The queen's crown itself rests separately from the rest with a huge diamond in the middle. In the centre of the complex you'll find the White tower, inside are suits of armour worn by different kings and the weapons they used, along with some games for the kids. Sadly there were no ravens when I was there because of the rain but they are an iconic part of the experience as well.

618a26356fe3f9d3e4408568,UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The tower is certainly worth a visit if you are in London, its a beautifully preserved castle with a wonderful setting by the river and tower bridge. We got there earlier than our pre booked time but they let us in anyway, it was quiet on a weekday morning even in the school holidays so didn't feel uncomfortable covid wise. We looked around independently which took about 2 hours or so including a stop for a drink break. It's quite expensive for what it is though and i felt it missed the mark in some respects. When i think of the tower i imagine Anne Boleyn, the princes in the tower, Catherine Howard and the many other unfortunate souls who were imprisoned or died here, instead we were treated to a load of armour clad dummies on plastic horses in the grand white tower which seemed meaningless and out of place. The most gregarious of the crown jewels are rather oddly viewed from a moving walkway, and it was actually Queen Victoria's pretty and understated little crown-ette in a cabinet all on it's own which I liked the most. All in all it's well worth a visit even if it's a bit costly.

There was a bit of a queue to see the Crown Jewels but it soon went down. This was something I’d always wanted to see and it didn’t disappoint.

We easily spent a good three hours there with a 1 year old and 9 year old.

618a264a6fe3f9d3e4408585,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It’s fantastic. Amazing. Steeped in history. History doesn’t come any more concentrated than this. Superb value for money. Take advantage of the on-the-hour beefeater free tours - not because they’re necessarily brilliant talks, but because the beefeaters are living legends and demand the greatest respect. Every stone has a story; every corner a myth. Ravens. Walls within walls. Jewels that command their own price - you think, stones, NO, dazzling - bewitching, well worth viewing. Even the view from the toilets is legendary. You’re absorbed in Anne Boleyn’s execution site BUT turn around - there are few better views: the Tower of London and Tower bridge, breathtaking, magnificent. An absolute must-see when in London.

What an amazing time we had...
Yeomen Scott Kelly entertained the crowds with lots of information about the Tower's history by getting all the crowd involved in cheering and shouting when needed, he even checked that the children amongst the group were happy to hear all about the blood & gore. The enthusiasm he had throughout the tour while giving you the information made you want to continue the tour and were able to gain more knowledge as it's done in a fun way.
At the end of the tour there was the opportunity to ask questions and take photos, you can see by his smile that it's a genuine smile and that he really loves his job!

618a26536fe3f9d3e4408594,UK,Tower of London,4.0,"It’s the Tower of London, so it’s something with a unique history that’s got to be seen at some point if you’re British. The history speaks for itself and would be worth 5 stars so this is more about the way it’s displayed and managed.

It was an ok and pretty good experience, however I would have preferred more displays about the people who used the tower (to imprison and be imprisoned) and less about the wider context of war and weapons. For example I couldn’t find anything about Mary Queen of Scots despite her being a prisoner there.

The beefeaters and ravens were very friendly/engaging and helped to make it a more interactive experience.

Given I’d paid £30 for one adult and one child it was irritating to be constantly plagued by shops and machines selling trinkets. It was also annoying that we were not allowed to exit to tower bridge and so I had to walk the (really) long the way round with a small child, it seems this was just to get us to walk through another gift shop again!

But now is the time to go, with no international tourists and no queues!

One welcome return are the Yeoman Warder guided tours which are a must. I had the privilege of joining hashtag Beefy 409 Scott Kelly's guided tour. He is a natural orator and really brought the history of the Tower to life. There was plenty of blood and gore, which thrilled the children present... but it was lovely to hear the story of Lady Jane Grey and get a sense of the pity of the place. We were all given homework to research Jane. I suspect there will be a fair amount of google searching going on as Scott brought a real sense of empathy to her story.

All credit to the rest of the Yeoman Wardens working at the Tower today who were nothing but kind, considerate and helpful. A fantastic day out.

You do need comfy footwear as it is all cobbled and can be a little hard walking, make sure you have plenty of time to visit the Tower as there is so so much to see.

To really get the true value of visiting the Tower of London, you should make sure to join the beefeater tour (free with standard tickets) that take place frequently. Understanding the real history behind so much of the Tower of London makes a huge difference to your experience. Our tour guide (the self proclaimed chubby William Shatner) was fantastically funny, inclusive and open to provide even more history than what is just part of the tour. The same goes in the crown jewels area, do spend time asking some of the helpers as they are happy to share interesting aspects that you might not be aware of just from walking around and reading the notes on the walls.

Lines weren't long and the food actually respectfully prices. The only thing I did find was sometimes the one way systems are too long, we got roped into one at the very start of the entrance and it didn't let us back out until halfway around the castle! Similarly, there are two gift shops in the actual tower but you cannot enter them unless you do the whole tour so I'd recommend just skipping those gift shops and going to the one on the pier just outside of the exit. There was a lot of interesting history but I would definitely avoid going on weekends so you actually have more time and space to read the signs.

The staff weren’t particularly helpful, the team on the gate weren’t friendly and the guy serving ice creams by the white tower was a miserable so and so. He made it clear he hated his job.

618a26746fe3f9d3e44085c2,UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Really enjoyed this day out. As English Heritage members it was nice to link the Tower with other local attractions.
The area is a lot bigger than I imagined and I would say to allow more than 2 hours for your visit.
Some areas would not be pushchair or wheelchair friendly as you can imagine...these buildings won't have lifts as I'm not sure they were invented in 1500s.
Cafe very expensive as you cam imagine. Not only because its London but also because its an attraction in London. I paid £15 for 2 coffees and 2 cakes. I mean the cakes were lovely! Staff in cafe very friendly.
Only thing that put a dampner on it for me was getting a scolding in the crown jewels exhibit. I didnt see any signs saying no photographs and as I was taking a picture of the queen's jewels I heard a booming voice behind me trying to get my attention and finally yelling at me 'no'.
I was embarrassed and actually had a moment when I left the building. I went round to check if there were signs and there was 1 small sign amongst other information saying no photographs.
I was stood in a que watching the guards so didn't see this sign. There was someone on the door letting us in in dribs and drabs so maybe they could mention something in future.
Had a really good day though and hope to revisit...where my camera would stay firmly in my.pocket, when I next visit her majesty's precious stones.

618a26756fe3f9d3e44085c3,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"As a London local it was 25 years since I last visited the Tower so the ticket price came as a bit of a shock! However COVID days suggested that this might be a good time and I was not disappointed.

As to the Tower itself, our trip speaks for itself: we arrived before 10.00 am and left at closing time. There was so much to see and it was all well exhibited and explained. The audio tour (an extra £4) was also well worth having. I imagine that the Crown Jewels is normally full to the brim with tourists whereas we were able to take our time and take several rides on the travelator.

The staff are friendly and helpful and clearly value working for such a national institution. If you fancy a trip to the Tower, now (July 2021) is an ideal time to go and avoid the tourist hordes. Be prepared to spend some time there in order to see all the various parts of the Tower (at least 4 hours I would have thought).

Unfortunately their online booking system was rubbish but the staff at the ticket office sorted things out. Make sure you get your Booking Reference number.

Every conceivable element of the fortress and it’s occupants is covered. Real active soldiers guard the Crown Jewels and the residences. The yeoman warders are on hand to answer your questions.
I cant explain how interesting it was.

I would recommend getting there for the opening of the the gates to see the royal guard and the beefeaters perform their ceremony, and on any trip there you need to go to the crown jewels as your first stop. I was lucky to get right in but the line does build up quickly.

The Fusiliers museums and white tower were both splendid with armours from the past

The wardens made up for it, especially Mark, Dave and Matt. The ravens were naughty and noisy lol, and we liked that it wasn't very busy but I know that's a massive downfall for the Tower itself. It's a shame we couldn't have a proper warden tour but we will return another time so we can do that then. Matt told us about the keys ceremony so we'll definitely be back more that, and we can't wait. This is an amazing experience and we truly recommend it!",Jun 2021
618a267b6fe3f9d3e44085cc,UK,Tower of London,1.0,"As a regular visitor to London, both personally and also leading school groups to the theatre and other venues, I have never been to what is, statistically, the most popular visitor attraction in the country. Having taught English for over 40 years, knowing English history was both enjoyable and obligatory; to teach Shakespeare without a sound understanding would have proved impossible.
So, now retired, I agreed to visit the Tower to see what I had been missing. What a massive disappointment it was. I started with an open-minded approach as we walked around the battlements and looked inside some of the smaller turret rooms, which contained clear information. However, the tour started to grate on me with the Line of Kings, all fully armoured on horseback; apart from the absurd historical inaccuracy, what does this say about our history? That we just like to go to war? Ridiculous. Shortly afterwards, we went to look at what is meant to be the outstanding highlight - the Crown Jewels. Yes, I can understand the moving conveyer belt process, but what struck me as more significant is that all the jewels, gold, cups and other finery only came into existence from the reign of Charles II in the 17th C onwards - and he himself did certainly amass quite a horde. In fact, it seemed to me that the Crown Jewels themselves were - and possibly remain - a political statement about the primacy of the monarchy after the Restoration. The collection of armoury, the symbols of historic warfare, also left me cold. Caged ravens too? Really? The rest of our exploration, including dungeons and the chapel, failed to impress by this point.
And the final insult, for me at least, was being obliged to exit through the Gift Shop and walk a long way around, 20 minutes, back to our hotel - which would have bee a brief 5 minutes stroll along the river bank, had we been allowed to do so.

Conclusion - militarism, royalist propaganda and money- making. The best experience of the Tower of London is from the river or from a higher building such as the Sky Garden.

No beefeater tour though. They have clearly struggled to fill some of the white tower rooms with stuff and it feels like they've found whatever they could to fill the space.

The Beefeaters are amazing, wonderful with kids and those young visitors all seem to love them. My favourite but was the Crown Jewels but there is so much more to enjoy. I don't like the fact that they still messAges there and clip their wings. I feel that this is such an old fashioned superstition and that we ought to have left it in the 20th Century.

Upon entering we were directed to the knight school which was set out very well on the lawn just outside the main entrance, it was very well organised and social distancing was not a problem as we all had our own little boxes to sit it. After about 10 mis my son became bored (nothing to do with the event it just want his sort of thing) so we decided to head straight to the Crown Jewels and I am so glad we did. There was no queue and we just walked straight in. My son was amazed at the displayed and certainly lived up to his expectations.

The Beefeaters were lovely and more than happy to engage in conversation about where we had come from and pose for a socially distanced photo.

There are ticket machines nearby, but don't join the queue without a ticket. You don't get to skip the line at the Tower of London, as everyone joins the same queue with pre-bought tickets. Once inside, if you have young children, you can currently take them to Knight School where they'll learn how to become a knight, albeit socially distanced. You'll then follow the route around and see all the different towers, and rooms, but if you want to see the crown jewels, I'd advise going straight to them if you arrive early, this will reduce your waiting time. There really is a lot to see and it will take a good 3-4 hours to see it all. There are at least three gift shops, an ice cream vendor and a resturant on site too, but prices aren't cheap. I'd at least bring a bottle of water and save yourself £3 for a tiny bottle of drink, Royal Palace members get it slightly cheaper.

It was a glorious day too and the =ir weren't massive amounts of people there. My only disappointment was that we did not have enough time to really look around! This is not the Tower of London's fault though. The tube trains on the central and district line were closed so we had to walk about 50 minutes from our hotel. We then had to be at another attraction at 2! I would definitely recommend checking TFL for any train disruptions as this place really does need a good couple of hours to absorb it all in.

We visited at 9.30am in half term. Had a brilliant visit in spite of the rain.

We pretty much had the place to ourselves but that was the excellent and sad at the same time. The lack of tourists means that we could walk round the Crown Jewels and other exhibits over and over with no pushing or jostling but the place generally felt a bit sad.

Also, the Yeoman warders couldn’t give their usual tours and that was a big loss.

Hence, we went round pinching ourselves at how much space and time we had there but also with a tinge of sadness that it needs more people to visit.

618a269e6fe3f9d3e44085ff,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"How do you describe the most famous attraction in London in your own words?

Well starting on a lighter note. There are fat, well fed, most healthy looking anti vegetarian ravens that eat better than most 3rd world country population. And their human beefeating counterparts and tower caretakers, The Royal Bodyguards.

Tower was also the first zoo in London before they moved all animals to Regents Park zoo. How did they transport the African lion, elephant and a polar bear to London in middle ages? Is another Tower secret.

Then we have the crown jewels and the famous or infamous cursed diamond Koh-i-Nûr that works only for women.

The gun and cannon salute is another deafening experience in this place surrounded by glass skyscrapers but you can only see that on special occasions.

And now the less glamorous part. Tower had a chilling horrifying reputation. The dreaded dark side of 'The Bloody Tower' is that just like any other castle/fort in the world, Tower was also used as a prison, torture and execution site for common, political prisoners including royals themselves. Many English kings, queens and princes were beheaded in Tower. King Henry alone executed 3 of his wives here.

Since countless people were killed and buried within these stone walls, unsurprisingly the tower is haunted by the ones who were apparently innocent but punished anyway.

And it wasn't just about the olden times, executions were taking place till WW2 with the help of firing squad. And this capital punishment used to be done in front of public where us tourists roam around now.

Great area for a stage set as well as a drinks reception out of the main room.

For when the events industry can go back I would recommend a venue for something a little different.

Hampton Court Palace has parking facilities. The Tower and Kensington Palace don't but are very near tube stations.

The Crown jewels in the Tower were a highlight, the Queen Victoria tour at KP and the Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace. Henry V111 fans will find much to see at HCP including the superb Great Hall, the Royal Apartments and kitchens.

KP has some spectacular jewellery, a suite of rooms showcasing where Queen Victoria was raised and the room where she was told aged 18 that she had become the Queen.

The Tower was interesting with lots of armour, the Crown Jewels as well as the very poignant spot where prominent Royals were executed. The Yeoman of the Guard were very knowledgeable and were happy to answer questions.

Buying the Historic Royal Palaces yearly pass for £55 was a good move and means that you can visit as often as you like in the year, usually, but is subject to the restrictions of Covid at the moment. 😑

The Tower of London was a prison from which there was supposedly no escape. Throughout its history, the building has been a fortress, prison, palace, and has even served as a zoo. There is a well-exposed armory here, as well as an exhibition of weapons, coronation insignia and jewels. The Tower Fortress is still inhabited today. Its community is made up of Yeomen Warders and their families, the Resident Governor, officials, and a chaplain and a doctor. The symbol of the Tower are the ravens that live in the towers of the fortress. They are particularly protected and fed, and they also have their guardian among the guards. The reason is the legend that says that as long as the ravens live in the fortress, the British Empire will last. For history lovers, this is a real intellectual treat. For many exhibits, descriptions in several languages, A well-guided visitor's route allows you to get to know this place well. A must see in London.

There were no Yeoman tours available that day so we booked standard tickets and paid an extra £5 each for the audio guidebooks which were really interesting and informative and made the Tower visit easy to follow. I would recommend the audio guidebooks if you can’t book a real-life tour. We were able to see the Crown Jewels which was super impressive and well worth the visit, even just for that! We also saw the White Tour which is now a museum (I recommend doing that last), and the famous Ravens protecting the Tower. The only thing we could see was the prison, it was closed. I’m not sure if it was closed due to Covid-19 restrictions or just generally closed as it wasn’t clear but nevertheless there is a lovely space outside where you can sit on a bench and listen to the audio guidebook explaining about all of the infamous characters who were executed there! Just beside there you can see the beefeaters guarding the entrance to the Crown Jewels. A lovely visit and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something to do in London!

618a26ad6fe3f9d3e440861a,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"My travelling buddy & I started our day by visiting the Tower of London as I wanted to see the Crown Jewels. We headed to the closest underground station which was Tower Hill & crossed the road to get to the Tower of London.

Since we had bought the London Pass, entry to The Tower of London which was £28.90 was free. All we had to do was show the London Pass app on our respective handphones to the gatekeeper & get it scanned & we were in!

We joined the Yeoman Tour as it is included in the price of an entry ticket. The tour lasts approximately 45 minutes to an hour & departs every 30 minutes. We were all led into the chapel of St Peter & Vincula to listen to a Yeoman who talked about the Tower’s stories. The Chapel is also the burial place of 3 Queens of England - Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard & Jane Grey. All were accused of adultery & treason.

After the tour, we were led out of the chapel. We caught the “Changing of the Guards” session. It was so surreal. The guards were smartly dressed of course!

We saw 2 of the Tower’s black ravens. They were on the ground & looked pretty much comfortable in the presence of humans. Currently, there are 7 ravens, in case 1 goes missing. Legend has it that if 6 ravens were to leave the court, the Tower will fall. The ravens are looked after by the Raven Master. Apparently, their wings have been clipped. There was also a huge canon on display for that instagram photo!

Our 2nd stop was to the Crown Jewels. The queue was long & we waited close to 45 minutes before going in. The wait was worth it as we got to see the magnificent Crown Jewels on display. In my opinion, the most beautiful tiara on display was Queen Victoria’s Emerald Tiara. The Imperial State Crown which Queen Elizabeth II wore during her coronation was also displayed. Photography & video recording were not allowed as expected.

There was a gift shop nearby & we dropped in as a 10% discount is given on all items to London Pass holders. Sadly, even with the discount, the items were quite expensive. Hence, we left empty-handed.

Next was our visit to the White Tower, an example of Norman architecture in the heart of the Tower of London & one of the most iconic symbols in Britain. The Chapel of St John is in the White Tower. Basically, you can see the Royal Armouries in the White Tower & a dragon armour sculpture too!

We also visited the Bloody Tower. It was where the 2 princes, Edward & Richard were kept before their disappearance. It was also thought that they were murdered there.

Overall, I think half a day is required to visit all the places in The Tower of London.

The guide is actually several different tours to different areas of the palace, each perhaps 20 to 30 minutes so you can choose which you do and in which order. I would say do them all, especially when it was as quiet and comfortable to move about as it is now. Good value at £5.
We had no concerns re Covid the whole time and staff were in evidence throughout cleaning and wiping surfaces.
There were no queues and we saw everything really easily. It’s also important to say that the history, grounds, displays and building are amazing. The difficulty is trying to ‘get your head around’ the fact the tower has stood pretty much as it is for 1,000 years!

618a26c16fe3f9d3e440862c,UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Calling all Londoners. This is the moment to enjoy the Tower while you can! Normally there is a queue of 1-2 hours for the Crown Jewels. I wandered in without queuing. On Saturday! It was as though we hired the place for ourselves. Saw the crowns in peace and on our own.

I would highly recommend engaging the service of a Blue Badge Guide. They are sorely in need of work and highly trained, brilliant people who bring these ancient places alive. Rather than staring at the Tower thinking its pretty and old, having a guide there allows you to realise it was the skyscraper of its day, made of stone that William the Conqueror had brought from Normandy to mark his arrival. We used Keith F Bates, but whomever you choose, it is truly worth it.

However, once you’ve climbed the stairs (lift available for wheelchairs & buggy’s only) it’s a very short experience. The glass floor section is only a few meters long, so everyone up there is huddled around this one section and once you’ve managed to find a space to take a pic of the traffic below, you head back down again. We’re we’re only on the bridge for 15mins! You can then visit the engine room but my kids weren’t at all interested in that part of the experience. Overall I’d say it’s worth doing once, just to say you’ve done it as the unique view of the bridge below your feet is quite something.

The glass floor although it is small ( not as big as it looks in the pictures) it was a thrill. you have to walk up the stairs in the left tower to reach the top of the bridge though.

Anyway, there's a few steps to climb although they also have a lift.
All the staff were lovely and so welcoming, I would rate it as one of the best welcomes for a tourist attraction anywhere. They were happy to talk to you and ask how you were enjoying the visit. Everywhere was clean, the engineering inside awesome and the engine rooms was fascinating. I love Victorian engineering - the frills were added just because they could, now there is little pride in such things.
Two adults and a child ticket we felt was great value and we even got to use some spotless toilets in the bridge!
Highly recommend it - remember to take a photo of your feet on the glass floor and look up as there are mirrors...
You have to do this.

The operators should be praised for installing special windows which can be opened purely to take photos. Otherwise you would be left with the possibility of reflections, which can spoil your image. At the time of my visit only the west side was open to the public, so you are more likely to get a spectacular sunset than sun rise. Elsewhere, there are enough signs (in English) to guide you around the main features of the construction and operation of the bridge. They lost a point from me for having a 30 minute wait for pre-booked admission (it was a busy day, school holiday and I got the final pre-booked slot of the day).

There is a lift for those of less agile ability or laziness. The rise in the box does not detract from the view of those out of breath at the top. A short presentation is provided in a seating area for those athletes to warm down, and those from the lift to smile a lot, as the screen shows the story of construction. The talk was given by a non native speaker who was hard to decipher.
Walk out onto the upriver spar that has camera view ports built into the perspex coverings. Bring a stool if you are vertically challenged. Avoid the see through section in the centre of the bridge if you manage to get there beyond you fear of heights'. The is a mirrored ceiling that allows unusual poses at this point. Some will not be able to look up for looking down!!!!
At the South Tower, the roof has been opened out to reveal the intricate construction and has some statue figures depicting builders of the day and a foreman.
If Howard is on duty, he will ask you to spot the hammer.
Down again in the lift to join the public with a short walk to the Engine Room over plaques in memory of those involved in the history. Tickets checked and through the gift shop into the now defunct original machinery spaces. Fascinating to see how it all worked in the good old days of steam. No Eco here. It would have destroyed trade and affected the world we live in today.
Pictures and stories align the walls to the exit and the end of a brilliant tour.
Thanks Howard and all the others involved. A great day.

I think because I could have the time to do it without anyone else around and the staff were great and even said to my hubby that he could take as long as he wanted as normally they move people along but being so quiet he could take his time.

You also see the structure. All this you would miss if you took the lift. Once you arrive at the top, you have the walkway experience with some unique views up and downstream. Also, there is a glass bottom part of the walkway. Its only for a short section but fascinating to watch different behaviours to it. It does not cover the full width, leaving enough non glass to walk on, but wide enough for an immersive experience if you can manage it. A great birds eye view of the traffic and pedestrians directly below your feet. You then descend the other tower.

You are left to explore the bridge yourself using a one way system. There is a lift for those who require it but you get a good sense of the scale of towers by using the steps. There is plenty information about the bridge and towers and its history. We spent around an hour exploring the bridge, the crossing and glass floor!! Then an unexpected bonus of seeing the engine rooms that you access via the gift shop - easy to miss this but worthwhile as they are still obviously operational. Great, unique experience :)

The views from up here are superb, and there are little slide open ones fso your images aren't through glass.
If you are not keen on heights, then you can walk next to the glass floor, rather than over it......not telling you which I did. You can spend as long as you like up here.
You walk down the south tower, then follow the track to the engine room, some superb pieces of machinery here, and shiney clean too......some super sized spanners. There are some really good films and information down here too.

618a270a6fe3f9d3e4408697,UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Almost everyone whose heard of London has heard of Tower Bridge. It's appeared in numerous movies, perhaps the most recent was ""Spiderman: Far from Home"". It's an iconic landmark. Most tourists who visit London plan to visit it, walk across it and take photos. What most people don't realise however, is that the upper structure is a walkway that was built to allow pedestrians to cross even when the bridge was raised. This walkway is still open today, albeit for a fee, which also includes access to the old engine room and guides on hand to talk about the history of the bridge. When visiting, there are 2 ways to reach the top, by walking up 206 steps or by using the lift/elevator. The lift wasn't working on the north side on the day of my visit, which meant I climbed the stairs and I'm so glad I did as I got to see the original colour of the bridge, some great views out of the windows and saw lots of history including how the bridge opens and how a man once jumped the bridge in a red London bus. Once up the top a guide greets you and tells you interesting facts about the making of the tower and points to a photo of a man who fell from the tower during construction, then swam to the shore and climbed back to the top and continued working. Then comes the main event, the upper walkway. This is where Spiderman fought Mysterio in the movie. Right in the centre is a glass floor where people either jump up and down on it to prove they wont fall through, or cower at the sides. Through the floor you can see traffic passing over the bridge. At the sides of the walkway are windows which offer great views of the Thames and includes small sliding windows which open to allow you to take photos without reflections from the windows. Once across you can either go down the steps or use another lift. Once back at ground level you can visit the old engine room, see the old boilers, use the restrooms and visit the gift shop. Whilst it's not necessarily an attraction you'd keep coming back to, it is definitely something worth visiting, it's different from the usual tourist attractions but isn't expensive either.

On both high walk ways there is part glass floors what i didn't walk on as I had a slight case of vertigo the Guide who was by the glass floors pick up on this and asked if I needed any help unfortunately I didn't catch his name but thanks to him.

618a272b6fe3f9d3e44086cb,UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Hard to add anything to the previous review by the Walsh family, which was spot on.

You get to walk across the top of one of the World's iconic bridges, as well as seeing behind the scenes and it's inner structure and engine room.

The views of the Thames are good and walking across the glass walkway 137 feet above the river is certainly bracing. Don't worry, you can avoid the glassed walk of doom, if you'd rather, but the sense of elation and achievement my wife felt from completing it, having been initially inclined to give it a body swerve, is almost impossible to quantify.

When we went at the beginning of June, we were the only ones up there as well, apart from staff. It really is a great time to visit London at the moment.

I’ve always wanted to explore inside the tower and found the family ticket offer reasonable. There’s not actually a great deal inside but the views look west across the Thames were amazing and the high bridge glass cross walk was certainly a highlight for both us and the children. All can be explored within an hour or less - wasn’t too busy/ over crowded and all the staff from security to guides were very welcoming and friendly.

Then you return to the bottom, walk round the corner and go to the engine rooms, this is also great to look around. There is a gift shop before you leave so you can get a gift before you leave. I would recommend this experience for adults and children, the staircases are wonderful.

If you are in London, take a walk along the south side of the river for fabulous views of Tower Bridge and Tower of London and then walk across Tower Bridge, with or without going to the top, and explore Tower of London and the surrounding area. It will transport you to another time in history and help escape from the pandemic paranoia for a while.

The views are especially stunning at sunrise and sunset.

Got some great photos from the open windows and also loved the glass walkway. Lots of interesting information as well, regarding the history of the bridge and a short film to watch. The Engine Room is accessed after you come out of the tower – not much to see there, but added to the visit. I would definitely recommend a visit – even if it is just for the glass walkway and the views.

I wish, as I have a complete lack of engineering experience, that there was a guide who could talk about the fascinating Victorian engineering. This needs to be address as I also saw several other guest looking bewildering at the large engineering exhibits. Highly recommended.",Apr 2021
618a27396fe3f9d3e44086dc,UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Having been to London many many times, this was the first trip where we realised you can actually go up inside Tower Bridge. And at £10.50 per adult it’s not a rip off price either.
Lots of stairs to climb initially but this is broken up with facts about the bridge to stop and read. Once at the top the view was great. There are photo windows rather than a mass open expanse which is great if you’re not good with heights. The walkway includes a glass section where you can see below to the bridge and river beneath you. The ticket price also includes entry to the engine rooms where you can see how the bridge was operated initially.
Allow about an hour-90 minutes in total for your trip. It’s well worth the money!

The tour of the bridge is really informative about the history of the bridge itself, but also so many personal stories about the people that have worked on it and within it in the last 150 years. The old engine room is on display with brilliant interactive explanations of the workings. We paid about £10 per adult and spent a wonderful hour or so looking around, but we didn't dally or stop to rest. There are a number of stairs to climb but a lift is available. The glass floor looking down over the bridge was brilliant. Terrifying, but brilliant. Thanks to Mandy, I was finally able to cross it and look down! Highly recommended.

618a27566fe3f9d3e4408702,UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Tower Bridge was our 1st stop in the morning. It was part of the London Pass. Normal tickets are priced at £9.80. Many including myself had thought it was the London Bridge whereas London Bridge can be seen visibly ahead.

There were loads of information on the Tower Bridge itself. It was built in the 1800s during Queen Victoria’s reign as London Bridge had become too crowded. A competition for the bridge design was held & Sir Horace Jones had proposed for a bascule bridge. He eventually became the Tower Bridge’s architect which opened in 1894. It took 8 years to build with a construction cost of £1.124 million.

Tower Bridge is a combination of a bascule & suspension bridge. Ten men died during its making. It has 2 towers in Victorian Gothic style & a pair of walkways were built between them. The base of each tower holds machines that will lift the bridge upwards to let ships pass beneath it. Hydraulic pumps driven by steam were used til 1976 before switching to electric motors. The walkways were intended to be used when the bridge was raised. Unfortunately, it became a haven for prostitutes & robbers. Thus, it was closed from 1909 & reopened in 1982 as part of Tower Bridge’s Exhibition where photos & films were displayed to showcase its history. The walkways are now fitted with see through glass panels, 42 metres above the River Thames. Since then, Tower Bridge has been an icon, one of London’s most popular tourist attractions. In 2018, functional & atmospheric lights were also installed.

It’s interesting to know that most of the architects & engineers were English except for 1 man. He studied in England but came from the Gujarat region of India & worked until the bridge was completed. There was only 1 female staff working at Tower Bridge. She was Charlotte Olive Burch who worked as a maid in the 1st Bridgemaster’s household.

My friend & I stood on the glass panel & saw the busy traffic below. It was so surreal. The glass floor is made of 5 thick layers & can hold the weight of an elephant & 2 taxis. We also saw many of London’s panoramic skyline view of landmarks from a dedicated glass window which can be opened. It was very breezy from up above.

The original pumping engines, accumulators & boilers were on display in the Engine Rooms. We saw them all. Newly commissioned films were also shown to explain each role. We ended the tour by going into Tower Bridge’s Gift Shop where you are spoilt for choice for that perfect memento. It’s definitely a trip to remember.

You can actually find out when the bridge will be lifted up to let ships pass by checking Tower Bridge’s website. You will know which ship or vessel will pass, the date & time well in advance. So, it’ll be good to check beforehand so that you can time your visit & see the bridge being lifted upwards while you’re standing on the glass floor. I wished I had done so but I only knew about it after my visit. So, here’s a good tip for future visitors.

618a27566fe3f9d3e4408704,UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,Saw the bridge from the Sky Garden during this visit. Tower Bridge means London. It is one of the main things to see when visiting the city.,Oct 2020
618a27566fe3f9d3e4408705,UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"I’ve lived in London for over 25 years and for many years this iconic landmark figured in my daily commute. I’ve walked across it many times, photographed it often, and taken international visitors there. I’ve seen the bastules raised, and been under the bridge in a boat when the bascules had to be raised. But it was not until I received a newsletter from my local London council (Southwark) mentioning the fact that residents of Southwark can actually see inside the bridge and the engine rooms, climb up a tower and walk across one of the two walkways high above the bridge, for the princely sum of £1.00. The normal ticketing cost of this Tower Bridge experience is £10.60. The £1.00 ticket is a ‘Community Ticket’ available to residents of Southwark, Tower Hamlets and the City of London, and you have to show proof of your residency, of course.

Whilst you can just roll up to purchase tickets, it’s best to purchase them on-line in advance, for a specific time, as numbers are limited due to the pandemic. Social distancing measures are also firmly in place. The entrance is at the North Tower on the Tower of London side of the bridge. Once documents are checked you can proceed up the North Tower. There’s 206 steps to climb, but a lift is available for those needing mobility assistance. At the top of the tower you’ll get a short but informative history lesson on the construction and operation of the bridge, then you can proceed to one of the two enclosed walkways which span the bridge high above the roadway. It’s usually the West Walkway, which is up river and has the best views. The views of the River Thames and the various iconic London landmarks on both sides of the river were wonderful. There’s information boards to help you.

A curious addition is a stretch of glass floor on the walkway. You can walk around it the thought terrifies you, but it’s nothing like the glass floors in the likes of the CN Tower in Toronto and the Willis Tower in Chicago. You get views of the roadway and river below. It was just a shame a group of children were running amok on the glass floor, to the delight of their parents.

Once down the South Tower (another 200+ steps) a blue line in the pavement directs you to the former engine rooms, where a colourful collection of the old steam engines which raised the bascules can be viewed. These days the bascules are electrically operated, with the assistance of oil-driven engines. Surprisingly the bascules are raised at least twice a day. It is possible, with a bit of research, to organise your visit around the time the bascules are to be raised.

The bridge was built between 1886 and 1894, though apparently the bascules were not raised for the first time until 1903 - there weren't any ships large enough that needed the bascules to be raised, apparently!

The walkways used to be open all the time, so that people could use them to cross the bridge if the bascules were raised. But very few pedestrians did, because of the stairs - they chose just to wait for the bascules to be lowered. The walkways gained a bit of a reputation as a haunt of prostitutes and pickpockets, and were closed in 1910.

It’s a great experience if you can do it; you’ll need about 2 hours for the experience.

A pleasant experience to visit, A a bit of trek up the stairs of the North Tower but the view when you get to the top is well worth the effort.

Plenty of interesting facts and after descending the south Tower do visit the workings detailing how the bridge operates.

Well worth the stair climb.

The elevated walkways are a accessed via a stairway, there are 206 steps up so be warned and due to current covid regulations you must wear a mask at all times whilst indoors.... there is a lift available for those that can't manage the steps.
Once you're on the walkway and taken in the view along the Thames you come to the glass floor where you can look down to the road deck and the Thames flowing beneath your feet, bit of a leap of faith stepping on to it if you have no head for heights but well worth it... hers's a tip, if you're with someone who is a little nervous of stepping on it and you finally persuade them to, don't give them a little nudge.

Bridge is not long, prolly about a 20 min walk. Very windy so grab a coat, and its very busy with cars and tourist. At times the bridge will open up for ships to pass, there are gates and guards that patrol the bridge when that happens, very safe.

On the corners of the bridge are people with stands selling caramelized peanuts for 2 pounds. They were hot & delicious. We walked the bridge everyday, my favorite times were in the early morning and at night on our way back from touring.

There is a walkway near the bridge along the river, where you can take some amazing shots in the daytime with the bridge in the background. No people hassling you for anything here unlike the other tourist spots.

This was definitely one of my highlights visiting London.

This is partially true...only there are only a limited number of things you can see...a lot of the exhibitions are closed. Considering it still costs £25 each to enter i found this hard to swallow. Tje building and grounds are still magnificent. But you can only visit the white tower and the crown jewels.
The crown jewels are worth it..without the crowd you can go round and round the cabinets and get an amazingly good view. The White Tower is also interesting. But sadly yourein and out in about an hour. So....wonderful place.. but presently overpriced

It is both a suspension bridge and a bascule bridge, i.e. it opens to allow ships and tall vessels through - there is a website that tells you the times, and this is fun to watch.

I was walking along the river on a Sunday morning which was eerily quiet, apart from the odd runner, so had the opportunity to enjoy the bridge from both the London Bridge side and from Rotherhithe. The tide was out - the Thames is tidal at this point and the mudlarkers were out looking for items of interest in the mud.

We gazed at them through the glass floor of the viewing platforms as 2 tugs guided the ship through, enjoying their excitement. Then we dashed down the stairs in time to see the bridge raised again for one of the tugs to go back down river.Plenty of photo opportunities and lots of information about construction and running of the bridge over its history.

The work, the colors, its location, the effect of sunset and sunrise, the romantic aura around it- everything is splendid.

We started our London experiences from here and ended at the same location. I am completely awe-struck by this bridge. Not just the history, it has a lot more that attracts you. I loved spending hours sitting on the benches near the bridge or side walk or clicking pictures.

I left a piece of my heart here ❤️ and I’ll come back again.

There was plenty of info about how the bridge was developed and built. There was a clear but slightly uninspiring video talking through the process at 2 points in the upper walkways. Lots of photo displays and great views across the river and the Tower of London. The glass floors are fun, mainly because it was entertaining to see lots of grown ups rolling around on them pretending to be scared they might fall through. People also jumping cheerfully on the glass, posing in the air. The engine room was really good, and I especially liked the stories of the people who worked there - some for 40 years, and the joy and pride they took running the amazing hydraulics system to raise the bridge.
Good mix of history and entertainment

Have fun lying on the glass walkway over the road beneath and taking a picture in the mirror overhead. Points of information are found along the way, along with a suggested route to follow. This event is self-guided. There is a gift shop, and toilets. There are views, too, such as of the Monument tower, HMS Belfast, and the Thames. Fascinating and interesting architecture. Fun!

618a27d96fe3f9d3e44087cc,UK,Tower Bridge,3.0,"I have never really been all that interested in the Tower Bridge, but it has always been a curiosity. It's a structure that doesn't make sense at first glance. Even the name is a red herring; it comes from the adjacent Tower of London, not the two towers that give it its iconic shape. And what's inside those two towers anyway? That's what I was curious about. I happened to be staying at a hotel located at one end of the bridge, and so I decided to go check it out, literally, because it was right there.

So what's inside the towers? Not terribly much. The bridge was built for a practical purpose -- to connect the banks of the Thames while also allowing tall vessels to sail through. It still does both these things but now they charge admission to subsidize it, a smart idea.

You walk a third of the way across the bridge outside (from the Tower of London side) to the ticket booth. You then take a 20-person elevator up the first tower. There is a short film (you can skip) and go out onto the parallel walkways that connect the two towers above. You can go through one walkway and then around to the other in as many circular laps as you like. The walkways are enclosed so you are not exposed to weather. The view is good but obstructed; the iron scaffolding gets in the way. It's also not quite as tall as you might think. A short section of each walkway has a glass floor so you can see the water and traffic below your feet. You exit down the stairs of the second tower (there is another film) passing by fun facts and statistics on the wall as you go. You then walk outside to the other end of the bridge and go through the gift shop to the 3-room engine gallery where a set of hefty drawbridge mechanisms are on display.

Tower Bridge is a historic, legitimate, perfectly fine cultural attraction. It's just not terribly exciting. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but if you're already at the Tower of London and you're curious, it's and easy thing to go do -- because it's there.

We went at night, so the city was lit up; it was beautiful. There is also part of the floor that is glass, so you can see the road and the river underneath you. We also went just down the road a bit to see the Engine Room and learn more about the history of the bridge and the people who worked it every day. It was fascinating and well worth the extra time.

I've inserted a picture of me at the top of Arthur's Seat to accurately depict the wind. Safe to say, as soon as the picture was taken, I planted myself firmly back in a cubby hole in the rocks! Me and my partner love hiking, so we went equipped with a backpack (drinks, plasters, coats etc) and walking boots. However, many did not. I'd HIGHLY recommend walking boots at the very least as it is quite rocky and slippy towards the top. I found that had I not been wearing my walking boots, I wouldn't have been able to plant my feet quite so firmly and probably had a good chance of slipping. The uphill walk is so worth it when you reach the top and get the best view of such a beautiful city. I'd give yourself a good 2 hours to complete the walk. Enjoy!

None of us are into our fitness and it was definitely hard going to get to the top. I would recommend sticking to the course coming down, do not take short cuts! I didn’t do this and I slid my way down… not a pretty sight, however not the only one!

618a281c6fe3f9d3e4408839,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"What a fantastic experience. My wife and I loved this. Once you reach the top the views are incredible. Tips:

- allow about 2 hours as a minimum
- there are no lights so make sure you return to the ground before sunset
- wear comfortable trainers that have good grip!
- take your time walking as some parts are slippy
- it's easy to get into the zone looking down when hiking upwards but make sure you stop every 15 mins or so to catch your breath and also look at the views
- it's very windy at the top so wear something warm....even though you may be sweating when you get there!

You will be having a picturesque view on top and also during the trail itself. There are a lot of trail to choose from so its better to choose 2 so that you can experience two trails with different views.

You won’t regret that. I’m young but quite unfit (stamina wise) and this was hard work!! Really stunning views on the way up and once you get to the top. It is super windy up there! It also feels quite dangerous nearer the top to be honest. One minute you are following a path and then as you reach the summit you’re suddenly clambering about on the rocks. You do have to be careful, there are some sheer drops and hardly any safety features. You just need to use common sense. On our way back down we did recommend an elderly couple not to continue up as they were already struggling less than 1/4 of the way up. I also slipped and fell on the way back down as well as seeing other people do the same, so go steady!

Husband was amazed at how he managed, so if he can, apart from the seriously infirm, you can. It looks massive from Edinburgh, but its quite the illusion, as its not as bad as it seems.
However, to get a photo from the trig point at the top, its a quick rocky climb, which is where the decent boots come in.

My second favourite thing was the view and lack of seats!

There are many hundreds of combinations of routes to get to the top and back down. Therefore there are many levels of difficulty. I went a short and direct route up from Ulster Crescent (see photo) after a walk from the beach. I parted ways with the less enthusiastic wife and daughter just past the lock (yellow circle on photo) allowing them to walk a flat bypass around the mountain where I met them on the other side. The way down I left to gravity and my feet.

The views on the top were amazing. I think our 1 star friends are people expect things that are far away to be close or simply don't appreciate that there isn't a city in the world with a unspoilt volcano in the middle of it that allows you to see 90% of it.

This year however we decided it would be walked. as others have put it is a climb and the path maybe a little slippy especially at the top if wet but we were blessed by a good day.

This time we had a window and the weather was perfect. Set off up the gentle path climbing up behind Dynamic Earth and things didn’t look too taxing. Then rounded the corner to see the full task ahead of us…much higher/steeper than anticipated however it wasn’t actually that bad with several stops en route to catch our breath. You just had to watch your step as the ground is rather uneven. The arrival at the top markers rewards you with the most stunning views of the city and surrounding water.

It's tough going in places and a bit of a scramble over rocks at the top but the views of Edinburgh are fantastic. Trainers should be fine for climbing but good walking boots make things easier. We picked a day with good weather and had lunch on the Royal Mile once we'd finished. The car park just round the corner from The Palace of Holyrood is £1/hour and had plenty of spaces when we arrived at 10am (Tuesday). It was however VERY busy when we got back down.,Aug 2021

Mind you the other carpark close to Holyrood Palace is free too at weekends only. And the second easy route is from the lake through the trees.
Extremely slippery on a wet misty day. I lost my balance several time and slipped and fell once.
Believe me it is not as easy as some reviews state here when the ground is wet.
A que even on the most dismal day for a picture at the summit.
Thing with this walk is the weather changes so quickly, pack a waterproof and a woolley hat, you won't regret it. Oh and something to eat to give you energy halfway!

618a28556fe3f9d3e4408897,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Similarly to Calton Hill, we were told about this by a family member and suggested it would be a great chance to experience something outside and get in some more great views of the area.

I'm not afraid to say that I struggled a little on the way up with a lot of uneven terrain and crumbly steps but persevered because I really wanted to check out the views at the top. I'm not the fittest of people and when google described it was being "" slightly strenuous"" I was surprised that I found it as hard as I did but I'm proud of myself for doing it. I wasn't expecting to see so many little kids doing the walk up but I guess they are pretty fearless compared to me! At the very top there is a white pillar which had unfortunately had graffiti on it which is such a shame as the surrounding area is full of nature. I was surprised to see quite a lot of broken glass on the way too which is a harsh reminder of how horrible some humans can be.

Without a doubt the views were great at the top, and it was good to be able to say I'd done it but was definitely pleased when I was back on even ground again! The walk down was a bit easier than the way up but would definitely recommend trainers or good walking shoes as everything is quite uneven and saw a few people take a tumble at some points. On the way back down it had started to rain so was pleased that we went up when it was dry even though it was a bit more windy that I'd have liked but the rain didn't seem to put off many people and it was becoming fairly busy.

If you like walking, and you're okay with uneven terrain I would definitely recommend coming up to Arthur's Seat as it offers the best views of the city. I wouldn't have liked to have done this on my own, so i was very grateful to have my boyfriend there to help me up along the way!

We set off early, did struggle a little bit to find Scottish Parliament as a starting point but once we did we following the main path and following the sign for The Summit. It was quite a steep walk all the way, and rocky/dusty underfoot so wear appropriate footwear.

Climb to the summit using this route was approx 30-40mins and very worth it for the 360° views at the top. Amazing! Just beware there’s a lot of flies at the top to share either experience.

Descent back to the bottom was easy and calm. Depending on your fitness allow 60-120 minutes for the journey.

Worth stopping at the Holyrood Park Education Centre (behind the palace) before you begin the walk to use the facilities there as no toilets in the park/climb itself.

618a28796fe3f9d3e44088cc,UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"It’s about 40minutes up and 30 down, if it’s sunny out make sure to have sunscreen - we got burnt to a crisp walking up and back down!

Super busy at the top and lots of people taking photos but a fantastic view",May 2021
618a28796fe3f9d3e44088cd,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"I would recommend 2 to 2.5 hrs for this activity. The route starts just near the Scottish Parliament and continues upward from there. There are many pebbly areas so you will need shoes with a decent grip. I don't really hike but if I can do it, most people can. The route is not suitable for anyone with a mobility issue. It is windy at the top and the views are stunning. Definitely recommended.",Jun 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088ce,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Love walking Arthur's Seat rain, hail or snow. Great wee walk with cracking views. Anyone can do this walk and many various ways to the top",May 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088cf,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,In the Godothin the Tribe got such a routing they had to go to Wales but don’t let this stop you climbing Arthur’s Seat as it was along time ago.,Jun 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088d0,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Two routes to get up there - takes approx. 45mins. I didn't go to the top as I am scared of heights however managed 80% so not too bad. Remember to take your camera for the stunning views!,Jun 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088d1,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Climbing Arthur's Seat was on my bucket list. Just a fabulous few hours and amazing views. Weather was incredible. Great day.,Jun 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088d2,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"A great uphill walk. It is a decent incline, but the fantastic views at the top are well worth the wait. It is great to see a city in the UK , which has plenty of countryside. Highly recommend.",Jun 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088d3,UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"I came to Edinburgh to do this hill and I wasn't disappointed
I didnt quite make it to the top but I did get a fairway up there. Better shoe would have helped but that was my own fault. The path is very step and its gravel underfoot. I did my self slip a couple of times on the way down but the view was worth it.",Jun 2021
618a287a6fe3f9d3e44088d4,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Absolutely loved climbing Arthur’s seat and watching the sun set on a clear summer’s eve. The colours were phenomenal as were the 360 views! Even if you don’t get all the way to the top, there are plenty of viewpoints that can be enjoyed along the way.

The hike itself is fairly easy - some basic fitness is required - but ultimately can be done at whatever pace you choose. For an average person it takes about 45 mins to an hour from Old Town, so fo factor that in if you are going for sunset.

There are various different paths you can take, some are gradual and slower, others faster and steeper. Signage could be better as to which path is which but you can more or less tell from the ground. The hike can be done in trainers/flat shoes but hiking boots would be more sturdy. The ground is quite loose, at least in summer.

I hiked alone as a woman and felt totally safe the entire time, there were people on the trail and at the top. Whilst I wouldn’t say it was busy, it was by no means secluded.

618a287b6fe3f9d3e44088d5,UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,It is quite hard going at times due to the big stones and lots of gravel so can be quite slippy in the wrong shoes. Excellent views from the top of the surrounding area. Well worth a visit,Jun 2021
618a287f6fe3f9d3e44088d6,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,It is worth the difficult climb to the top! The experience is simply breathtaking! But beware the wind at the top - it will nearly knock you over.,Jun 2021

Highly recommend to climb up and discover yourself!",Jun 2021

618a28806fe3f9d3e44088d9,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If you're relatively fit, the walk up isn't bad (wear sturdy shoes), and you're rewarded with seriously beautiful views of the city and surrounding areas! Go when the gorse is in full bloom, and you'll see a carpet of yellow covering half of the mountain. The southern route (main path - the radical road is currently closed) up the mountain seems a bit steeper and more slippery, so if want to walk as a circuit, I'd recommend walking up the southern trail and down the northern trail.",Jun 2021
618a28806fe3f9d3e44088da,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"This is an excellent site, Holyrood Park is fantastic and the views are amazing if you brave the ascent.",May 2021
618a28806fe3f9d3e44088db,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"We walked up from Dunsapie Loch & down the 'stairs' to exit near Pollock Halls. It was quite misty at first, but the sun soon shone through. We met the litter picker at the very top- although didn't see much litter at all. Stunning views.So many paths to try another time",May 2021
618a28806fe3f9d3e44088dc,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,I was totally unprepared for a little hike! But couldn't resist having a go having had Arthur's Seat pointed out by our tour guide on one of the bus tours. It wasn't ideal in flip flops! And some parts were a little steep and you do have to watch your step (especially in unsuitable footwear!!) but it was definitely worth it for the fantastic views and fresh air at the top! It is amazing to come to such a busy city and literally turn a corner and have such a beautiful place to walk with such a natural view of the city. Just amazing.,May 2021
618a28806fe3f9d3e44088dd,UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,Lovely views from the top but quite a hard hike for me with some narrow and slightly treacherous sections. Need good footwear and to go in good weather. The path was gravelly with boulders as steps to climb up to the next section and required a reasonable level of fitness as some of the steps were quite high. On the way down we walked down the grassy bank at the back down to the paved pathway which were easier to manage. The park is really lovely to walk in with lovely views over the city and out to the coastline.,May 2021
618a28806fe3f9d3e44088de,UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,2nd time scaling the hill. There always is plenty of persons here which is good. Some areas are more rocky than most so I wouldn't recommend anything that hasn't got a good grip (especially not white designer shoes 😉),May 2021
618a28816fe3f9d3e44088df,UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"Would be great for a sunny day but I don’t believe it is necessary in wet conditions. The rocks are pretty slippery and you won’t be missing out if you choose not to go. That being said, it’s good for an early morning start and some quick exercise before you punish yourself with whiskey and haggis for the rest of the day.",May 2021
618a28856fe3f9d3e44088e0,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,I came to Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago from Glasgow on a wee day trip now we're allowed out! I had never climbed Arthur's seat before so wanted to give it a go - it was no way near as difficult as I thought it would be and the views were stunning - definitely recommend!,May 2021
618a28866fe3f9d3e44088e1,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"It took about 40mins to get up. It was really nice because we walked there from the city centre, which isn’t common for nice walking places.
The view was perfect. And there are other peaks if you would like to sit alone without other people. We went on a afternoon Saturday and it wasn’t very busy. Definitely recommend",May 2021
618a28866fe3f9d3e44088e2,UK,Arthur's Seat,1.0,"The hike on muddy trails on windy day was not fun. We did not find this place too exciting. Maybe, if you have too much time, you can hike.",May 2021

618a28866fe3f9d3e44088e6,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Beautiful park gives way to gorse and eventually scrub. Incredible views from the summit followed by a careful descent on well-marked paths.,May 2021
618a28866fe3f9d3e44088e7,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,This was great - not too busy and beautiful views all around. Took a picnic and blanket and enjoyed the sunshine!,May 2021
618a28876fe3f9d3e44088e8,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Decided to review things to do in Edinburgh. I've been about 30 times in my life but normally just visited Princes Street and the bars.
However I decided that I was going to do something different.
Arthurs seat is excellent to get a view of the city and the surrounding area, an absolute gem.",May 2021
618a28876fe3f9d3e44088e9,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Great hike for unprecedented views of the city. Trail is in decent shape and heavily travels the day I made the climb. Moderate exercise if you are not in the best of shape give your self 35 to 45 min to the top,Apr 2021

618a288c6fe3f9d3e44088ef,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"We walked up there casually which took about an hour, then spent about an hour up there, and walked down after the sunset. It was windy and cold but looked amazing.

Was a great walk up Arthur's Seat and we were rewarded with a fantastic view, if you have a few hours to kill in Edinburgh I highly recommend doing this.",Sep 2020
618a288c6fe3f9d3e44088f0,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Regardless of the seasons Arthur Seat is just stunning. It has 3 lochs and is quite hilly but you can drive to the top. The views from the road at the top are stunning and it is a must do if you are a visitor to Edinburgh.,Nov 2020

The golden hues on the salisbury crags are stunning. There is an old ruin site shortly after you begin the hike that looks over Holyrood palace and the lake - the Firth of Forth sits in the distance. Take your time, but the hour or two you spend here will be worth it. Bring a light jacket even if it's a hot day - its quite windy at the top...and wear tennis shoes.",Mar 2020

618a289f6fe3f9d3e4408909,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We climbed to the summit of Arthur's seat on a beautiful day last week and opted for the more difficult route. There is an easier route with a more gentle slope but there's no getting around the steep and rocky climb right near the top. It's definitely worth it for the amazing views though.,Oct 2020
618a289f6fe3f9d3e440890a,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Well worth the visit. This challenging climb is worth it for the views at the top. Under foot can be slippery so take your time. There are many routes to the summit.,Sep 2020

618a28a56fe3f9d3e4408913,UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"An excellent hill hike within a city. There are multiple paths/routes up. On this, my first, visit I parked for a couple of hours in the car park adjacent the palace (opposite parliament). There is a signposted path which takes you most directly up to the summit, with stone steps most of the way ( the 'motorway' route). I preferred a slightly more circuitous route that maintained views so took a slightly less trodden anti-clockwise route. This requires a small loss of height midway but makes up for that in variety. The paths can be precipitous and if wet the rock is very slippy, particularly on the summit so appropriate footware is advised. Also, as an exposed summit the temperature and wind may be very different to the base, so dress accordingly. A moderate walk around the circuit was done in under 2 hours. You can choose to rock scramble if that's to your liking

It’s not that. It is actually a lot more hardcore then we expected, with proper giant steps up, slopey slippy crags and uneven paths that are pretty close to the edge. The bit at the summit is definitely a bit treacherous and probably won’t want to be tried on a rainy day.
But, the views were epic and the sense of pride at the end of it made the beer that followed particularly sweet.

If you go up from Holywood Palace, it's a gentle incline which becomes steeper, I reccommend good trainers/walking boots. I wouldn't go during the rain as might be slippery, the surface was uneven in places. I have a good fitness level and took us 40mins with me being scared of heights. On the way down, take the grassy path down its steeper but its a big wide path and all level and you come out near dunsapie loch and gradually downhill from there back to the start.

618a28ab6fe3f9d3e440891e,UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"By how long it takes to get to the top... it’s a very difficult and steep ascent. If your general fitness is good then this is a great little hike to do basically in the centre of Edinburgh but if not, be warned it really is a challenging walk. Once at the top I think I could have been happier taking on one of the smaller slopes around as the views are still pretty cracking from there. However, due to the proximity to the centre of Edinburgh, it’s a good bit of hard outdoor walking you wouldn’t find in many other cities around the world so I rate it a bit higher for that.",Sep 2020

The views over Edinburgh are beautiful.

Probably not a good idea to walk it on a Saturday afternoon during the pandemic.

Very crowded with people walking past each other on a single track route and less than 1m apart. Instead of waiting at a passing place.

Shame people dropped masks all over the hill and were blasting music out their phones at the top.

I would choose to go up early in the morning next time.

As the highest point in Edinburgh it gives a great vantage point of the whole city. Many paths to choose from with differing difficulty levels, some more well-worn and some more off-the-beaten-path. Some areas are rockier but good leg muscles on steep pathways will suffice rather than actual rock climbing. If you follow the car path (currently closed to vehicles) there are two lochs with wildlife residing there. A busy place with avid walkers, runners and cyclists, and also picnickers when the weather is good. Windy at the peak, and rocks can get slippery with morning dew or rain.

It would've been easy enough to find our way even alone, as all the paths were clearly marked and everyone was going the same way.

BUT it was SO worth the effort - the wind, the view, the feeling of satisfaction all made it totally worthwhile.
It is a bit if a scramble at the top and it is certainly a tough walk, but if you can make it you will be rewarded.

Some are very steep and high and would take much longer than a hour. We decided not to go as high as we wanted as we had a booking at he hard rock for a certain time.

Enjoyable walk to the top with some fabulous views along the way and at the top.

Well worth the effort and would advise anybody not to miss the stunning views and a good cardiovascular workout as well.

Even if you are not the fittest take your time with a few strategic stops it will be well worth the effort.

We took the right which is a steeper and quicker but manageable climb to the summit. The views from the top are great. A 360* of Edinburgh and over to Fife. The climb is a bit rocky so good trainers or walking shoes are advised. We saw some with open toed sandals - wouldn’t fancy that!
We started about 1100hrs and at that time, the number of people was okay. On our decline, the numbers climbing had increased significantly. It took us about 1 1/2 hours with a wee stop at the summit. Not too time consuming so give it a go, you’ll not regret it,

We had done a lot of walking the days previously so hopped in an Uber to get there as we were staying an additional hours walk away, but we did walk home via the Royal Mile. There is a carpark at the bottom of the hill next to Holyrood if you want to drive.

Need to be relatively fit to climb it but nothing that you need to prepare for. Level in places to catch your breath. The past section is steep but worth it! Not pram or wheelchair friendly. No hard paths as such, more compacted rubble and rough stone steps.

Dress appropriately! Saw very unhappy ladies in converse, wedges or sandals and their husbands carrying their handbags! One gentleman was wearing a blazer and leather dress shoes?! Definitely running trainers or walking boots territory, with a backpack to keep your hands free.

The very peak is quite narrow. Go at a quiet time or get your elbows ready to fend off selfish people hogging the trig point. Some people gave up queuing as parents were letting their kids climb all over it and it's too narrow to have more than 2 people on it...

Views are spectacular! Take binoculars. You can see almost all of the main features of Edinburgh and out to sea.

Overall worth a visit.

It was quite busy in the walk, with people walking up and down the same route, I got about 210meters high and decided I could not go any higher as it was very windy and I was thinking about the route back down which I really did not fancy.
I did think they should have a route up there and a route backdown, as When everyone is trying to get up or down and it’s windy and there are steep drops with nothing to protect you I did find this quite troubling at times. I do also think they should have people placed at certain parts of the route just to make sure everyone is safe and no one is doing anything they should not be doing.
You have families with small children going up there which is something I could never do, but these people are probably used to this sort of terrain, dogs being walked up and down, there is not a man made pathway, some of the rocks are loose, which made me feel unsafe.
The views of course are stunning, which is one good reason to climb there but I will not be doing it again!

Yes, the ascent is difficult for those of us who are partial to the odd pie or two and yes I did slip and injure my thumb on the way up but it was well worth the effort. Once you get to the top and stand on (or next-to) the white obelisk like structure, you have a breath-taking, 360 degree, bird's-eye view, of Edinburgh as far as the eye can see.

We decided to take a quick foray up Arthur's Seat after visiting the Palace of HolyRood.

We only had about an hour or so, so we hiked up to one of the lower points rather than going all the way to the top. Because we were there in early May it was a little chilly and muddy, which hindered our ascent some.

But the views were by far worth it. We saw lots of people out hiking and it was enjoyable without being too difficult.

It was hard in places because the sun was low and path was sometimes uneven but that’s because it’s a natural mountain.

It was definitely worth it though for the views.

And there is NO seat at the top. Although a few rocks which you can perch on for photo opportunities.

There are a few routes up, I walked from the Scottish parliament along a slow but long incline which gets steeper towards top, the way down from the north side is a set of old stone stairs, in even and some are quiet the step but would be easier at a slow pace.

Honestly the service provided by all members staff was top notch. Our tour guide was Jim and he was great, the way he kept us interested whilst sharing his knowledge of the club and adding a bit of humour along the way showed how much he must love his job. He also let my 2 sons sit at the desk in the conference room whilst the video of Pep was played to make it look like they were sitting there with him live, which was class! We've had a great day and everyone up here just seems more happy and friendly than people back home. We'd definitely come back.

Roger and Keith were fantastic as tour guides and I could really feel that they were really passionate and loved the club deeply. They went out their way to make sure everyone was enjoying the tour and had their chance to take nice pictures. I missed the beginning of the tour because I wasn't familiar with the tram system in Manchester but Roger offered to take me through the beginning part for the exhibition again even though my tour ended! It's my first time on a tour and they've set the bar so high!

Food was excellent and service great too. The players heading in through the tunnel seemed a bit underwhelming as only one seemed to acknowledge the customers!!

As for the football genuinely no atmosphere at all!! Biggest cheer was Man U going down to Leicester.

But its a 5 for brilliant hospitality (though come on including Spirits won't bankrupt you).

We was so impressed with the tour and honestly cannot praise Linda enough, she even got the birthday children a little treat at the end of the tour (a big bar of chocolate!)

You lean the history of Man City, learn what goes on during match day and what the future plans are for the club. You have access to where the players arrive, walk down the same steps the players walk down to the dressing room, access both away and home dressing rooms and walk through the tunnel to pitch side. You get to sit in Peps seat and learn the history of the stadium. You also visit the Tunnel Club and learn what happens there and visit the press room. Would highly recommend this tour.

We took out 6 year old son who was so excited when we arrived and we also had our 1 year old twins in the double pram.

Martin and Sam our tour guides went above and beyond for us. With having the pram we had to go in the lifts and round different ways at some points but Martin was fantastic and sorted it out whist Sam took the others.

They were both very friendly and made the tour fun.

If you are debating about going if you need to take a pram, don’t worry at all it was great. All the staff were great all very friendly and polite everyone who you passed said hello. A very enjoyable afternoon out

Firstly, the stadium itself is amazing, the facilities, the shear effort put into it is incredible. Secondly, the tour is extremely immersive with 360 degrees movies, press conferences alongside Pep Guardiola (obviously a virtual reality treat).

Callum and Ray, the tour guides were both great at the jobs and quite funny.

Definitely recommend the tour if you're in the city. It also comes with a 10% discount for the City Store.

City even included two free tickets(family stand,behind the goal) food voucher,program,goody bag & home kit,not our usual Saturday afternoon.
Great game 5-0 winners,we got a little bit wet,typical Manchester weather,we came prepared.
Half time,we used the food vouchers provided,massive ques at the kiosks,hotdogs,fries,drink & chocolate £10 meal deal,go up before the whistle for a place in the que,be prepared to wait,or take your own..

They completely made the visit memorable. Great knowledge, passion and genuine love for Man City coupled with a real sense of fun. Seeing Ray run out of the tunnel and wave at the crowd like a player made me giggle.
The reason for the visit was for my son’s 11th birthday, which I mentioned simply in passing to Ray as we chatted, so to receive a scarf and bar of chocolate from the tour team at the end was an amazing gesture.

Brilliant experience irrespective of who you may support and for adults and kids alike.

Here's what we got for the VIP package at the Etihad stadium Manchester, UK: We got one (I'll repeat that) ONE free drink, a Coldplay Lanyard, a Coldplay badge and......that's it! The food in the VIP lounge you had to pay for and the actual concert seats were right at the back of the stadium. Oh I forgot we did get a cushion on our seat. Other people who were on the same row of seats (but on the other side of a 'rope') didn't get a cushion but paid just a 1/3 of the price we did! It's put me off for life buying VIP packages for concerts. At our next Coldplay concert, we bought just basic standing tickets (right in the middle of the stadium) and it was the best concert of our lives! This was for many reasons including not feeling completely ripped off like last time. Have seen reviews of VIP packages at other stadiums that Coldplay played at, & by far they were ten times better - e.g free food, lots of free drinks, great seats. I do not blame the band but the Stadium organisation. Do NOT buy a VIP concert ticket at Etihad stadium, Manchester.

They even had the trophies out to take pictures with. What really made the day though was the staff - they were all so friendly and helpful. It looked liked each waiter was assigned to 2/3 tables to bring drinks over and clear the table etc. The girl we had was called Shay and she was incredible. Every time we needed a drink she just magically appeared to take our orders. It didn't take long for her to learn our orders off by heart! At one point me and my friend did end up going to the bar ourselves because we'd changed our minds about not getting a drink and Shay met us there and offered to carry them back to the table for us. She was just a lovely girl - I can't speak highly enough of her. From my experiences, all of the staff have helped to make the day better for the guests. Would highly recommend!

The tour is overall a good experience. Had I been a football fan I would have loved it even more. To relive the memories. Walk the the corridors. See the stadium.

A thumbs up to Ray and Roger for their warmth and humour. They were amazing hosts and made us feel really special. They did everything to make sure each of 12 people on the tour is comfortable and looked after.

If they could include a momento and bottle of water in the package, it would make the tour even more exciting. I think they cam manage that much in £27.

618a29ac6fe3f9d3e4408ab9,UK,Etihad Stadium,1.0,"As something of a veteran football fan, I have attended Everton matches at Maine Road many times, and loved it. Not only for matches against City, but also various cup semi-finals we've been involved in. It was always a favourite 'away'. A traditional old stadium, steeped in history. Always a fantastic atmosphere. This, on the other hand, left me cold. A soulless lump of concrete and metal.
Maybe i'm just getting old. I found myself longing for a fat woman to produce a bell. Mind you, most modern day football fans wouldn't even understand that reference, so maybe its just me.
In addition to this, we left to get a pint 10 minutes before half time, and by the time we got served it was 5 minutes into the second half. 30 minutes? I thought new stadia would put an end to this kind of thing? About 5 staff to serve several thousand thirsty Evertonians?

A friend and I traveled from the US to see the Spice Girls concert (sans Posh). We had an amazing time and danced in the rain all night!

The pitch was covered so it made walking (and dancing) really easy. We were 10 feet away from the Spice Girls while they were performing. It was a night to remember.

I was also impressed at how well the crowd was managed. Getting in out was pretty efficient. Only downside was everyone trying to catch the trains back to the city. But thats to be expected with so many people.

618a29b86fe3f9d3e4408aca,UK,Etihad Stadium,2.0,"Went to see the spice girls at the stadium with my 8 year old daughter (7 at the time) getting through the stadium & finding our seats were a breeze staff were friendly & helpful enough.
Then the actual concert started, during the concert the stair wells were permanently covered with people. Now I'm not talking about people getting up & going for drinks I'm talking people couldn't be bothered to stay at their seats, stood or not. So they decided to stand in the stair wells instead. Where myself and my daughter were sat the ushers/security were a few steps up from us, so they could clearly see it all but decided to do nothing about it.
Luckily myself & my daughter had the last two seats of our row so I let her have the aisle seat so she had a clear view for the spice girls & the screen.
This shortly ended, during the show as a delightful idiotic young lady kept standing in front of my daughter (not at her seat in the stair well) because of this she couldn't see. So eventually I asked her politely if she could stand aside as my daughter couldn't see. Which at first she was happy to move, unfortunately the move didn't last too long. Again she stood right Infront of my daughter, so again I asked politely if she could stand aside from the stair well. This time her response was different, her abundance of attitude came out & she decided to ignore my request & began dancing and waving her arms around like an immiture idiot.
As you would expect my patience were extinct at this point, as we'd paid to be where we were however I'm pretty sure the stadium do not sell tickets for the stair wells!
Then believe it or not this idiotic child actually became physical & told me she would love to smack me, now another occasion when I weren't with my daughter I would of happily let this girl attempt to smack me (she wouldn't of got anywhere near) but as I had my daughter with me I had to keep pushing this girls arm off me.
No thanks to any usher, this vile creature carried on. Then my daughter got upset & wanted to leave because of said tool!
Thanks to the lovely group of women that were sat next to us, they dealt with the idiot, whilst I tried to calm my daughter down & take her home.
We were lucky that the said idiot began this towards the end of the show so we didn't really miss much when we had to leave because of her.
How is it that anyone is supposed to want bring. Their children to this stadium for concerts when you clearly cannot control the crows once in the facility?
I will never attempt to go anywhere near your establishment again & I will mention it to all other parents that consider it also.

Money is clearly the only thing on the agenda when attending a concert here, once your in they clearly don't care of the experience.

The attitude of Football fans remains as tribal as ever though.How come we get a blind ref every week.? etc.They also mostly know how to score a goal and there are 40,000 master tacticians who should be earning a good living managing a team of millionaires !

Unfortunately, our courier messed us and our stuff did not arrive for the exhibition (no fault of the stadium whatsoever). Despite this, the experience of being at the Etihad stadium was very enjoyable. The staff here are an absolute credit- so lovely, helpful and funny. They did their absolute best to help us with the courier mix up and kept us in high spirits and should be commended for their positive and helpful attitudes!

The toilets here are also super nice- fancy Jo Malone handsoap.

The champagne and wine are very generously served and the starters which were cold were fine but when we got to the main course the plates were hotter tan the food. To give them their dues they did replace both meals. My husbands was ok but mine was still lute warm. They wanted to replace mine again but as the match was about to start I ate some of my meal. It is an expensive treat spoilt by warm food.

It was a very wet morning but even the rain couldn’t dampen our enthusiasm. We saw 2 short films about the club which were very interesting and we got to sit in the heated seats that belong to the Tunnel Club members - a big bonus on such a damp day! At pitch level it looks much smaller than it is on TV and there was a great buzz around the ground ahead of the early kick off that day. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour despite not being able to enter the dressing rooms ( due to 12.30 k.o) and Keith & Helen were brilliant guides. Highly recommend.

Got to the stadium and went straight to the away end where there was a confusion to which gate to go in K or L, said K on the ticket but had to enter L. Finally got inside to a small bar with a poor choice of food but drinks was not overpriced. The steward was more than helpful to guide us to the seats which had plenty of room. The view from the away area was good but for some reason the ground did not impress me which I thought would after hearing thing about the Etihad. For some reason City fans do not fill this stadium and they sit watching the game like they are in a doctor’s surgery. A club like that should be sold out every home game along with drowning out the away fans with song. I can say now I’ve been to the Etihad Stadium but don’t think I will rush back. I think in truth City fans will agree with this review but will stay silent as it was at the game. I am a Aston Villa fan and this is not a review to be nasty in any way.

Yes its even rumoured that they might move ""Wimbledon"" to the ""Etihad"" stadium as parking is so bad in London, what a boost that would be for Manchester, bring it on as this is the city of Tennis.

Ops and with the heaters on pitch didn’t get a few. The stadium tour was amazing apart from that. I am life long city fan and was amazing seeing the tour and things that I seen. Would love to go to a game in it one day.

The security man on tour was amazing. And really helpful with me telling me different things about city and the stadium.

I done the academy part of tour. And we got taken into one building shown the press conference room out onto a pitch. Then a drive around. It would have been nice for some photo ops of the Yaya or Kompany sign that is up. The guy taking tour said he would say when could take photos or not. He didn’t say anything though our tour until I took a photo of building and he said do not take photos here. I don’t think I would do the academy tour part again as not worth the extra £10.

It would also be nice if you get a ticket or something to say you were on tour. I have done a few stadiums in uk and you get either a certificate to say you visited stadium in the day or have a colourful ticket to keep. I normally make frames up of photo of stadium I take inside and put ticket in along with it.

Over all I am still on cloud 9 after seeing everything next time down will be a game

On the plus side Football Focus was being presented from the home dressing room so we literally rubbed shoulders with Dan Walker, Phil Neville and Alex Scott.
Fancy technology was used to bring things to life, such as the entry of the home team. Hospitality areas were an eye opener - how the other half live! The media areas were also interesting - you get a really good idea of the organisation that goes into match day.
The best thing about the entertaining tour was the excellence of our guides David and Julie. Here were two fans, passionate about the clubs history, a font of knowledge and only too willing to share their experiences.

A nine seater golf-type buggy took us to our entry point as my g/daughter is suffering a knee injury. Inside the stadium I found the staff equally professional, pleasant and helpful. Seating was good (we were behind the goal post).

My criticism centres around the catering. I ordered five portions of chips. On receiving the first two they were cold. Pointed this out to the server who politely took them back and returned them to the hotplate (where they were immediately picked up by the server of the next queue and given to the next customer!). However, I did receive five portions of hot chips at a cost of 3 pounds per portion, (but cost only 1.50 when teamed up with an overpriced burger or hotdog. There were no trays or boxes to carry them so had to do two trips. Both the catering size tomato ketchup dispensers were empty and there was no mayonnaise or vinegar on offer.

Great not to be relying on ‘media devices’, but to hear stories from people who are entertaining and obvious fans themselves.

Shout out to Manchester City guides @Kassim and @kristina, made me love City with their warm and passionate hospitality... made me feel like am part of the city family....

I definitely recommend the visit/Tour 100% and will obviously visit whenever am back in Manchester...

The tour includes the players entrance, the gym rooms, the Home and Visitors dressing rooms, the tunnel and the team dug outs at the side of the pitch.

Pros:
-90 minute tour.
-My guide was Chris (supported by George). They are both humorous, informative and passionate about their Club. Also, good interaction with the visitors - whichever team they support. Multi-language media player also supplied for additional content.
-Tour starts in trophy room (Floor 1 of City Store) then across to the Etihad Stadium for The Colin Bell Stand containing the The Tunnel Club, away & home changing rooms, media interviews zone, press room, players tunnel (walk out to a recording of crowd noise!), pitch-side view, dugout and (briefly) an elevated view from the Stand.

Cons:
-Not the cheapest tour.

The knowledge and passion for the club they all showed really shown through. I would even say any fan of football of would enjoy the tour.
For me learning about the development and the Man City way was brilliant and Both my kids (8/15) left with lots to ponder.

The shop afterwards was great too. Only negative was nowhere to have lunch on-site - perhaps because it’s the summer? Was hoping to eat at the ground too but wasn’t possible. Just a suggestion for the Stadium Management to consider. Quite a few of our group may well have stopped for a bite to eat or a drink.

You can get the 216 bus from piccadilly. Outside wetherspoons.
Or jump the tram. On event days the tram gets packed. If your trying to get on at piccadilly train station you often can't get on the tram as it's so packed. I normally walk down to piccadilly gardens or st Peter's sq. You can now use your debit card touch and go for the tram. Meaning you dont have to que for a ticket. Just touch your card against the machine on the platform before boarding and then the same when u get off.
Coming away from the stadium it's often quicker to walk into the city centre than que for tram or bus.

The etihad was easy to drive too, there was plenty of parking close to the ground and not overly expensive.

We got food inside the ground, this is always overpriced but adequate.

Our seats were high up, practically in the Gods! The sound quality was not loud enough for the first few songs, but improved somewhat towards the end. The stage set up and screens was the biggest I’ve seen!

I think I still prefer arenas and more intimate venues than these large football stadiums for concerts.

I have never seen so many support staff: by every door, by every gate, by every staircase - all smiling and ready to help.
The seats in the £95 section were comfortable and padded with reasonable knee room, and dry as the canopy roof extended over the seating if not the pitch or even the stage so the moshers and the band were soaking wet.
My only quibble (great word, quibble) is the distance from the orange disabled car park and where our disabled friendly seating was, I'm not a great walker and use sticks so it was a bit of a pain (literally) to walk three quarters of the exterior of the stadium twice.
On a safety note, we were pleased to see how quickly the stadium can be emptied, no doubt even more quickly in case of an emergency.
Still not keen on stadia concerts but Etihad is still the best open air venue so far.

Today was a rainy Thursday afternoon and out of season. We were impressed with the outer stadium and were directed round the stadium and shown where to park using my blue badge. We were a bit disappointed with the Citystore being refurbished and closed, however there were two concessions around the back which were open. The staff in here were extremely helpful and friendly. We were unable to find a cafe or anywhere to get a drink until we spotted a cafe open sign at the nearby England squash courts/ sports centre. Once in, there was no one around and reception staff left me standing there whilst they chatted amongst themselves. When I asked if the cafe was open, I was told firmly it was closed and to try a vending machine. This was out of order.
Bit niggly that there didn't seem to be somewhere to get a warm drink despite there being plenty of people walking about and taking photos etc. I feel slightly less inclined to pay £25 each for the stadium tour...sorry Man City!

The Etihad may be known for being the home of Manchester City but what a great gig venue! I loved the zone out front with the ( very expensive but typical venue priced) food and drinks, and staff were very friendly if you needed help finding anything.
Beginning the stadium was fine. I half expected them to do security checks in the fan zone area though rather than not u til you get inside. It was unclear where to go once you got in...we just had to keep asking stewards, who again were very friendly.
The sound was great and it's obvious all the hard work that goes into getting the place ready and taking it all down after everyone goes. They did a lot to ensure it wasn't pure chaos at the trams too, making sure it was orderly.
It's a great place for a concert and I'd be happy to come here again for another great concert!

The Etihad is a fantastic venue for this type of event, and if you want to enjoy the sunset, choose high seats on the South East side - we were in block 307. But don't choose seats 218 & 219 - these did seem to be a bit precarious, at the very top of a steep set of concrete steps - one false move ... The organisation at the venue is second to none - fantastic, friendly security staff who will help you every step of the way. You aren't allowed to take your own food or drink into the venue, but the food & drink outlets inside will refill your empty bottle with water. Alternatively, an unopened 500ml bottle of water is allowed. Back to the food & drink outlets - they are ridiculously expensive! The toilet facilities are good, expect queues at peak times. In the God's seats we were cold to begin, you do feel a draught, and it was a cold & rainy day in June. But it does warm up once the gig gets going - would recommend bringing a fleece just in case! Transport to & from the stadium is very good, but it did get rammed after the gig, maybe because there were other events going on in Manchester. The organisation before and after was excellent, plenty of staff to help facilitate and manage the crowds, let them help you, they really are lovely!!

Why the is it acceptable to stand up and obstruct other customers view at a concert. Last night yet again I had to watch 2 mature men nearly coming to blows due to one of the wives having no consideration while the steward turned blind one. Surely if you want to dance then there is plenty of room on the pitch. Do these selfish individuals not think that some punters have chosen a seat on issues such as injury,age,medical condition.I must stress this did not directly involve myself but I am seeing such incidents at converts on a regular basis. Come on Etihad and other such venues sort your policy out so we can avoid such hassle at an otherwise excellent venue.Top venue,excellent facilities.

The main issue was the restricted view from our seats - South Stand, Block 213, seats 325 and 326. The view was blocked by a very tall speaker.

Luckily, they sale ponchos for inclement weather. I was too excited so i didnt mind!! The crowd got a bit rowdy during the show and the security team properly handled the situation before it got completely out of hand!! I cant wait to visit again and actually see a game!!

Back then Maine Road was our ground, which we also saw the remnants of the next day, by the way, but now time had come to enjoy the amazing Etihad as well as the club's Football Academy. First out was Graham to guide us through the inside of the Etihad rooms and ground. He took us through to the pitch, which this actual day still was covered with plates after the Spice Girls' concert the evening before. Passing though numerous rooms, among others the post match press room, we were allowed to sit in Pep's chair and have him virtually interacting with us. This left us all very impressed indeed. Graham was more than willing to answer our questions, also mine about the old times. Afterwards we were taken on a buggy ride with Ian to the Football Academy. He too is a most polite, professional, forthcoming and humourous guide. We had a very interesting tour, led by genuinely giving and kind employees. You can be very proud of them, City!

40 minute (minimum) queues for a sardine can on rails (aka a tram) both ways. There were additional buses on the way back, but the queue again was miles long.
Then once at the venue cheerless security and unhelpful staff.
Drinks were a rip off and decanted into plastic glasses (pint of wine anyone). Taking in bottles was forbidden apparently, yet you could see many coke bottles and lager ones. When you're expected to pay £25 for a cheap plastic bottle of wine you should at least be allowed the luxury of having it in the bottle and not as a 'drink me all now' option.

This did put a dampener on an otherwise excellent night, but things like this would stop me from going again.

Security is paramount. As is generally the case, the ladies toilets were always busy and queuing estential. To be fair they did have lots of Portaloos as well. The Spice Girls gave a really good show, with fireworks too. At the end of the show it was very easy to exit the Stadium with lots of staff directing you. No problems. There was somebody who needed medical attention and the staff were able to locate the person by holding their high-vis jacket up in the air on a stick, thereby making the place to be sought easy to be foind.

While it was raining on the day we had seats in block 106 which were undercover and provided a good view of the stage.

Facilities including toilets and bars for food and drink were plentiful with low queues(although nowhere seemed to stock any sweets or chocolates - only crisps!).

After the concert was a bit chaotic exiting the stadium and knowing which direction we needed to be in but I suppose this is to be expected for a large venue.

A good venue for a concert although if standing there is no protection from the elements.

If seated, you are sheltered from the elements but those standing on pitch area got soaked in the rain. Egress inside the stadium well managed but roads were at a standstill.

Staff were pointing us in each and every direction with no clear point for us to safely get a taxi. We may have walked 2 miles up and down being sent around in a wild goose chase. Not from around the area so not really any clue where we were going. Spoke to alot or families and groups in the exact same postion as us.

On attempting to regain entry through the barrier where we had been led out from at Door K, we were rudely instructed to re-join the back of queue again. After nearly two hours I had one young daughter in tears as we had missed seeing Jess Glyn and my adult pregnant daughter feeling faint by the length of time spent queuing. I was appalled at your staff’s lack of empathy or awareness of procedures to follow when your system breaks down and I was disgusted with the manor in which I was marched away from Door K.

The tour is well presented and our tour guides (Cameron and Judy) were helpful and informative, ready to answer any questions as well as giving the standard talks. If you are a football fan, you’ll like this tour even if you don’t support Man City because it’s as much about what a typical modern stadium provides for its players as about Man City specifically. You get to see the home and away changing rooms, go through the players’ tunnel into the dug out area, and see a variety of other aspects of the stadium as well. The opening part of the tour includes a well made 360 degree video presentation, and at different points during the tour you get to view 360 degree pictures of the area you are standing in. There is also a very clever interactive spot in the press room where you can sit at the interview table and be photographed alongside a VR version of Pep Guardiola. I am not a football fan myself, but I enjoyed the tour, so I’d guess that if you are a fan you’d like it venue more! I would recommend turning up the full 15 min in advance because you then get a chance to look around the small museum in the waiting area.

The tour lasted more than an hour and Martin and Dominic accommodated to our itinerary timings (my group was catching their flight back to France after the visit).

Martin was full of little stories and you could feel his passion for football. He was an amazing entertainer, could answer the many questions asked that morning and made an effort speaking a bit of French to my group. I do not really follow football and the tour made me want to learn more about this sport.

Our tour guides were fantastic - Linda was a diehard City fan and was terrific.Ray was an old funny Mancunian. It set the game up magically. City have thought about an overall family experience and they have music and interviews before and after the game to entertain the crowds. High drama as the coach with the players arrive and are taken through the 'tunnel club.'

The stewards appeared not to notice at all, in fact not looking at the crowds at all.
I couldn’t believe this had all got past the security checks.
It left me feeling quite sick and terribly sad.
I did ring the events number at the stadium the next day and spoke to a lovely lady who was very concerned about what I’d told her. I’m sure she tried to get to the bottom of it.

Despite my apprehension, Mike, our tour guide, made us non City fans feel at ease and said everyone was welcome at the stadium (even after giving me a yellow card for being a Liverpool fan!).

We had the full tour which lasted over 1.5 hours and was nearly access all areas. Everything was covered from what goes on behind the scenes to match day and all the preparation that goes into that.

My only complaint, there was no trophy room tour, but I suppose you can’t fit a 30 person tour in a broom cupboard...!

In all seriousness it was a great way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday!

Knowledgable, funny and always willing to answer any questions that came forward and was particularly good with the kids in the tour. He even treated a man united fan that was on the tour with dignity and respect, with the odd jovial dig here and there which was all in good humour. The tour took in most of the stadium and we also managed to get a brief glimpse of the CFA which is truly impressive. If I had one note of constructive criticism, I would have liked to have seen some trophies on the tour -Now we actually have them! I wasn’t expecting to be lined up to take a picture holding a trophy, but at least a room or display where they are on show for fans to see close up would have been the cherry on top. But all in all. A very enjoyable tour of the club I love. Keep up the good work!

I usually attend championship league nights,bringing my two young daughter's.
We normally start our evening by heading for the main entrance,watching those lucky enough being able to attend the match & being of VIP status,the we wait for the players coach to arrive,seeing which team will be playing on that evening,great pre match entertainment all around the ground,especially in city square.
Then we head in,searches all cleared,time for some food,usually a hot dog & fries,into our seats(family stand) we await our team.
Great atmosphere,even better with goals aplenty 7-0.C'mon City..

Everything went well, and the off-site lunch was excellent. The bus to the ground was held up in traffic, but no more than might have been expected; not ideal, but we knew that was likely The only problem arose when we found our seats were way up in the Gods. I believe MCFC should have made it much clearer when booking, that we'd be in the 26th row of the third (i.e. top) tier. When you pay £300 to watch a football match, the seats are the most important factor, surely?",Feb 2019

All in all a very good tour which both me and my son thoroughly enjoyed!

Our trip was topped off with a 3-1 win the following evening against Watford and my son cannot wait to get across again for his next match!

The tour began at 12:30 and Jeff our tour guide, who was very informative, took us around telling us various facts about the stadium while we were shown the tunnel club, changing rooms, dugout area and media rooms.
There are plenty of opportunities for photos so bring a camera!
The tour lasts around a hour and a half and is ideal for city fans.

Ahead of the brilliant planning and story of the stadium's erection lies an astethitic home to the Manchester City Football Club and its supporters. With the knowledge and assistance of the club's tour guides, you may be able to experience what it feels like to stand within the glass tunnels from a player's perspective as well as the physical and mental training that goes in minutes prior to kick off.

The tour gives all football fans an understanding of what ""home advantage"" really means and the techniques used in all the dressing rooms, on the pitch and off the pitch to place visiting teams in discomfort.

We were guided around all the areas of the stadium by an excellent guide called Martin. There were about 20 guests from various parts of the world including USA, Portugal, Hong Kong and France. The City fans were in the minority. Martin helped us get on with each other and made it a social occasion. We covered all the interesting places including home and away changing rooms, media interview rooms, treatments rooms, exclusive restaurants, seating areas as well as the home and away manager, support staff and players seats on the touch line. In each place we were encouraged to ask questions, take as many photos as we liked and try to get a feel of what it would be like for the players. It even include running out of the tunnel to a recorded sound of the crowd. As a Crystal Palace supporter I mentioned, as often as I could, that they were currently to only Premier League team to win there this season. It was all taken in good heart. His knowledge and the freedom of the areas we visited made it a very enjoyable visit. The atmosphere and some 'secrets' were were told throughout the tour so it would make it very worthwhile visiting even if you didn't like football. Thanks to Martin an Manchester City we had a great time.

618a2a766fe3f9d3e4408bf7,UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"I attended the tour today and really enjoyed having an insight into Man City.

Martin engaged with the small group and I warmed to him. He clearly has a real passion for the club. I was lucky as there were only 11 people in the group which meant it felt very personal. Martin went out of his way to find out where people were from and regularly made links back to the information he had gained about us. He was very obliging in taking photos for people and seemed to really care about making the experience a memorable one. It felt like I was receiving Martin's version of the tour for the first time - what I mean by that, is that it didn't feel like he had said those things, or told those stories before - which takes a great skill especially if he delivers 3 tours a day. Martin also made sure that each and every one of us felt part of the tour - picking us out as individuals as we went along too.

I knew that dressing rooms were off limits but I left feeling like I hadn’t learned anything about the club, stadium or really seen anything memorable.

You meet at the club shop before making your way through reception into the stadium, brief stop in tunnel club (fancy dining/hospitality area). From here you are led out into hospitality seating (1st tier on halfway). Then led to dugouts, photo opportunity to sit in Peps seat. Then led to press room and that’s all. Tour took approx 1 hour (including walk to reception and security checking bags etc on entry to stadium).

I’ve done a number of tours dotted around the country and even a few abroad and left this feeling very underwhelmed. No club history, no trophy room, no hospitality suites, no visit to upper tiers of stands. If your going to a game anyway give the match day tour a miss.

When we arrived at the stadium , i was overwhelmed at the efforts but in by manchester city. It was like one big holiday resort. From live music, games, astro matches, face painting. We stood on the blue carpet waiting on the players arrival and it was there the magic happened.

At the end of the tour, we went to use the 10% discount in the Man City store,just as we went to pay for the MANY things my brother bought(superfan), We bumped into Graham who had ran to give Cal Some City programmes (which he collects) and a page of printed autographs from the team. It warmed my heart so much and made my brothers day.

There was a spacious area to sit and wait ahead of the tour starting with free drinks available, toilets and access to the museum. It was incredible to see how all of the staff are so passionate about the club - very contagious. All staff are incredibly helpful and talk to you. The chap in the press-room was incredible and really immersed you into things.
The food and drink selection was fantastic and meeting the legends was just amazing.
I will never forget this day, it totally exceeded my expectations (and I think the bank managers when they see how much I spent in the shop). It was an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone. I would love to do more tours in the future.

The tour couldn't take in everything on my visit owing to covid but just to get to walk around the pitch was so atmospheric, recalling the great names of English football that had graced this stadium. Well worth a visit for all football fans!",May 2021
618a2b426fe3f9d3e4408c46,UK,Anfield Stadium,3.0,"As a life-long LFC supporter I had dreamt of visiting the Anfield stadium for years as I don’t live in Liverpool myself.

As an experience, it’s good to see the actual pitch from the stands and pitch-side. The tour guides were very good although I would have liked to have heard a little more about the history of the club. We actually got more info from the guide at the back of the group chatting to us personally.

On the plus side there was a lot to see and we were at the stadium for a few hours. They give you a device to take round which makes it look as though there is a match being played with spectators - a clever touch given the circumstances. It was nice to see the actual home and away dressing rooms and many areas in which you normally wouldn’t see. The pitch-side experience was good, just not enough time spent there. Seems as though too much time spent talking about Klopp so by the time you get to the pitch, it it quite rushed.

As I have a disability, I am exempt from wearing masks so it was nice not to be asked to wear one. I was given a sticker to wear which is a nice touch as we have had tours elsewhere that don’t do this. However, I personally feel that there were too many people on the tour, especially in areas such as the changing rooms. Perhaps they should have split the group when touring smaller areas. Being at the back the whole time, I also couldn’t see what was going on, so by the time I did have access, the group was leaving. Being lead like Cattle does come to mind. Apparently they are allowed 30 people (even though we couldn’t have that many at our wedding)! But this feels like too many given the circumstances.

There is a lot to see if you include the museum, including seeing the actual trophies won which is a positive. All staff were lovely and you are there for a long time, I just think the tour and numbers allowed needs re-thinking. It would be nice to hear more stories from the tour guides who were local and must have a few stories to tell. Another bonus is that photography is encouraged as usually it wouldn’t be allowed.

The Anfield Stadium tour is a real must for every supporter of football, in fact I was the only LFC fan on my tour. We have been on the tour previously before the new stand was built and the new tour was totally superb. The new tour takes you behind the scenes of Englands most successful football club. You get to sit in both the Press room and the changing room and even touch the famous sign. There's lots of freedom on the tour and your not rushed around the stadium you'll get plenty of photo opportunities and a visit to the LFC restaurant makes for a wonderful end to the day, the food is really really good and very keenly priced, its that popular you have to book. If you book the joint Beatles/Anfeild tour and the restaurant I think they do a deal so enquire...!!!

We spent over 4 hours here and could easily spent longer. Unfortunately during these strange times the cafe/ restaurant was closed. But still an amazing day seeing things you would not see on a match day..

We enjoyed it just as much.
The stadium has a very good one way system and plenty of hand gel station, where was also plenty of staff who were fully knowledgable with any questions we asked.
Some parts are closed, but that didn’t change the experience.
We brought our daughter the Bronze photo package, which included one photo taken with the trophy, we ended up upgrading to the Gold package which included all photos taken.
You are able to take photos with your own camera/phone also.
We spent just over two hours there, and I felt it was money well spent, in fact, I think we have become Liverpool fans also!

You get a smart screen guide that describes the tour and you can keep the headphones at the end of the tour but there are guides to help whilst you walk around and follow the route, overlooking the pitch from level 6 and then down to pitch side to sit in the dug out.

Loads of photo opportunities including the champions league trophy and PL trophy.

Included in the price was entrance to the museum to see the trophies.

Both of us really enjoyed the tour and spent some time in the massive team store. We also had lunch at the stadium restaurant. All in all a very enjoyable day. This was the slickest stadium tour I have done but was the first football stadium so not sure how it compares to other big football clubs.

Making my way to the fabled stadium was nerve-wrecking, with the butterflies in my stomach going in hyper-drive. As my guide told me, any first-timer to Anfield, their eyes will be start to water. AND IT IS TRUE!! My eyes were watering as I walked towards the iconic structure that has seen many legends passed through its gates. Looking at the world famous Shankly Gates was a memory that I will never forget.

Making my way into the stands, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rising at each step that I took towards my allocated seat. Settling into my seat and belting out the famous ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" at the start of the game was simply breath-taking (the singing sure took its toll together with the bustery autumn winds from the coast).

The stadium gives you a feel of history and what to expect for the future. It is definitely a good mix of the new and old. The closeness between the seats made the atmosphere magical and its a must visit for all Liverpool FC fans.

Everything about the day was fine. If I have one criticism it would be the leg room. The Centenary Stand is not that old that you could say people have grown since it was built! We are both 6' 3'' and you simply cannot get anyone past you when you're stood up without them making contact in some way.

Must mention the last terrible review of Anfield - Georgia2903 - Saints fan trying to be clever/ funny and ending up making a fool of herself. Clocked the pictures posted on TA; tattoos, dirty fingernails, Full English, squirty cream in your drinks, cheap holiday in Turkey. Scummers indeed.

The thing i took away from my few hours at the stadium was the friendliness of all the staff - from security to store staff. Even with all the crowds they all had a smile on their faces and are very much ambassadors for the club as much as the players on the pitch. The museum tour is going through a redesign but was very interesting the quote from Bill Shankly about Tommy Smith ""he wasn't born..he was quarried"" will stay with me. Couldn't fault my experience. Not a speck of litter or dirt and in a football club female toilets - free female hygiene products which i was well impressed with.

Whilst the venue was clean and well organised - and easy to get served at the the bar ( Card only be the way ) NO CASH at bar allowed ! Place was freezing cold. I asked steward about this - who told me there was nothing they could do as it was in his words down to 'air ducts' in building. What ...I go to loads of venues to watch pop gigs , football matches ...never heard this excuse before .Also whilst there was plenty of screens there - you could hardly hear any commentary. Toilet was probably louder than anywhere here . So consequently little atmosphere. My Italian friend after hearing all the 'Ballyhoo' around LFC was a little bit disappointed.

I re call the very old Anfield as a small boy as i climbed the hundred or so steps making my way to the boys pen situated in the top corner of The Kop as we call it. Nowadays I am a season ticket holder and sit next to my son in a very prestigious seat looking down from the new Main Stand overlooking The Kop. Since the mid 1950's when Gerry Marsden got to the top of the 'hit parade' with the anthem from Rogers and Hammerstein Camelot we are treated just prior to the start of the game with a rendering of this charismatic song. You Will Never Walk alone rings out and tears can be seen in even mature folks eyes. This is am amazing sight and sound and sets the scene for yet another memorable occasion which will remain in memory indefinately. May this long continue ( ynwa).

Overall the experience was fun; I get the feeling Liverpool FC is really the heart of this great city. Most football fans are sentimental but Liverpool take it to a new level. Impressive stadium.

My only gripes was that it was self guided - it is a faff using the audio guide and I often found I had to forward or rewind it get the right area. You do miss something not having a real guide.

Also, through my own fault, I completely forgot the Museum portion of the tour. I don't think it would have been too much for staff at the exit to remind visitors about the museum as they hand in their audio guides for those more forgetful people.

We stood in line for over 40 mins before getting into the building to queue to get to the desk and check in and then queue to get your audio tour. The tour itself is self guided with a small screen and headphones that tell you about the different parts of the stadium. When we visited last time it was a week day and we got a guide to take us around which I think is much better, from the website it says these are still avail eat certain times. You get to see the pitch and changing rooms as well as the whole stadium from the top of the seating area. There is also a museum that gives you history of the team. It is a must see for any Liverpool fan but I would seriously consider the timing of your visit.

Then onto the museum with all the history and trophies.. Plenty of them. Just brilliant..,and finally, a drink in the Boot Room. Carlsberg for me of course. My lad loved everything about it and my missus enjoyed it as well, our official picture taker. Getting there an back was no problem.. Train to Liverpool, breakfast in town, a trip to the Maritime museum on the Albert Dock, then the no. 26 bus takes you right outside the stadium.. Runs regularly every 10 minutes. All in all.. A very good day..

618a2c1b6fe3f9d3e4408cf5,UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Oh boy! This is special.

The tour was excellent - lead by someone who has a real passion for the club and the museum was very good, not simply hagiography. It was special to be in the changing room and to touch the Anfield side on the way out to the pitch (not allowed on it but do walk round it!)

However what was really special was that I'd been given a ticket to the game. I'd been before, admittedly in the away end, and you didn't get the feeling that the fans mattered that much; now: what a difference.

The first thing was the overall ground, it has really been developed over the past 10 years. It still rises from the terraced housing but it feels as if it belongs. The club has invested in the local community and there is a wonderful sense of belonging.

The ground is now set in a plaza (before it felt cramped). There's a band playing before kick off, the super store is doing good business and there's a really relaxed atmosphere. I've got a ticket to the main stand which entitles me to be in the 'Dug Out' pre match area. (One area - once you are in the this area, I was not allowed back out).

Riding on the escalator up to the third level there's a wonderful view out to the mouth of the Mersey and across to the Wirral.

The 'Dug Out' is brilliant. Again, relaxed and easy going. Bars at either end but the kicker are the food stands, eat the world... all covered in the price of the ticket. I had tandori chicken burger - very good.

Then out into the stand. Stunning, wonderful - building atmosphere which is released at kick off as everyone sings You'll Never Walk Alone

You'd have guessed - I'm a fan: I can't compare this to other Premiership grounds (last game was Spennymoor Town v. Northwich Victoria) but I was so impressed. I think the tour though will appeal to non-supporters too, as it does cover the social history and impact of the club on the local community.

First, the best bits- Seeing the pitch in all its splendour, the dressing rooms (not replicas- the real ones) and the stands helping envision past and present glory does make the trip worthwhile. I’d probably do it again just for the experience.
The day I visited may have been an aberration but the tour itself was very poorly organised with large crowds herded like cattle from one stage to another. The bloke handing the audio guides had to ask me if I understood English- which is okay, I get asked that often and I don’t mind it but it was quite humiliating for me when the white gentleman next to me was greeted with- Ah! You are definitely English! I almost felt less welcome in what I considered my football home.
This was just one person and I am convinced it does not represent the culture of this club which I am proud to continue to be a fan of, but the club would do well to stay true to its core values and not try to merely rake in the moolah which is bound to follow the club’s recent and what I hope will be continued success.

The audio guide was really well done too - I'd say it was the easiest Audio-guide I've used, lots of opportunities to learn more or just dip in and out as you please. The view from the top of the new stand is fantastic, both inside the stadium and looking out over Goodison. Definitely recommend this tour. I'd also suggest you book as people without tickets were being turned away when we were there as they'd sold out.

Not really having any interest in football I enjoyed every single minute of our visit. Being deaf I was delighted when I was given a tablet with the tour in sign language and subtitles. The views over the surrounding city and the river from the top levels were stunning.The stewards were all so kind and interesting and patient with a 9 year olds questions. Never thought I would be excited to sit on the Kop. Wonderful photo opportunities throughout the tour. We ended up in the Boot Room Cafe, we food and service were excellent. Whole stadium was spotless throughout especially the loos. Would recommend this tour 100%

Great to be back at Anfield though, seats in the main stand, looking down on the Kop, perfect. Season ticket priced seat would be £47 and at the moment, with the football being played, worth every penny.

Good camaraderie around our seats, my friend has built a good rapport with those sat around him, like on the Kop when you used to stand in the same place.

Parking is at a premium with residents parking in most areas or private arrangements charging £7-£10 from what I could see. My friend knew a place to park for free and we went in The Saddle pub first, £2.80 for a Guinness, a lot of shouting between a group of fans but I think they were friends! I couldn't tell you which pub to go in, none of them really stand out.

The facilities in the new stand are excellent and a real eye opener if you've visited Palace and Burnley this season.

Great atmosphere and luckily for me we scored 5 against Everton as I was in the Park End the last time we scored 5 against them.

A great night out.

618a2c776fe3f9d3e4408d40,UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"We booked an Anfield tour for the celebration of our son's 17th birthday - he's mad on Liverpool FC. His dad is Liverpool born and bred and although we live in Yorkshire he is loyal to his Liverpool roots. We arrived in terrible wet, stormy weather but were immediately given a warm and cheery welcome by the staff at the tour reception. Lots of jokes and friendly banter - there's a real genuine 'family' feel amongst the staff. We were a bit early for our tour time and they helpfully gave us our visitor wrist bands so we could visit the museum whilst we were waiting - this was really useful. The tour itself was so well organised and interesting - even to a football fan's wife. We had been on a tour here 10 years ago which was good but the tour has evolved and become even better. The tour guides Gordon and Mike were superb - so funny and lots of personal anecdotes - you could tell their genuine love and enthusiasm for the club and thorough historical knowledge. There were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos in key areas and the background stories were fascinating and funny. We all had a great time and left with happy memories. It really made our son's birthday special. Thank you to the Anfield Tour Staff - especially Gordon and Mike who made it special.

We expected it not to be possible but we were quickly moved to our new slot with a smile. The first thing that strikes you is the enthusiasm and friendliness of all the staff. Our lead tour guide was Gordon and he was an absolute diamond. From start to finish he kept us entertained with his encyclopaedic knowledge of all aspects of Anfield and the club and his passionate and humorous delivery. Being from Liverpool myself I already knew a lot of it but the rest of the family are native Leeds but they also loved the whole experience especially my son who is also diehard Liverpool despite having a home city team hopefully about to come up. We went to the main stand, home and away dressing rooms, players restaurant and the pitch level finishing at the lower levels of the kop. As I mentioned it was the enthusiasm of our guide Gordon that really made it special, so a massive thumbs up to him. If you come on weekends it's audio tour only so you will lose out on the personal touch, though it would still be a great day.
This was our second tour, the first one was ten years ago. We enjoyed the first, but this one was even better.
On a side note it's a real shame it's so hard to get match tickets so Gordon if you've got a couple of spares that would be great !

The stadium is breathtaking, there is an outside park with football pitches for children, live bands playing, food stalls, pop-up bars. There's view points to see the team coach come in. It's an American style atmosphere right here in the UK.

I was brought along by friends as part of a business meeting (I support neither team) and I was not only blown away by what the stadium offers customers but what the stadium offers in terms of a show. Liverpool played some astonishing football and for once in many many years I can agree with the guys who took me who are relentlessly adamant that they're going to win the cup this year.

Thanks for such a wonderful time!

618a2c886fe3f9d3e4408d53,UK,Anfield Stadium,3.0,"We took our 8-year old son on the LFC Stadium Tour in November 2019. We’re not Liverpool fans, but our son is currently football mad so we took him on a couple of stadium tours over the course of a weekend break.

I must say we were slightly disappointed with the Anfield tour. We counted about 50 people on the same tour, which was far too many for one group. One part of the tour involved showing the view across Liverpool from the top of the main stand, where apparently you can see to Snowdonia in one direction and the Isle of Man in the other. However, being at the back of the large group, we couldn’t see anything. On trying to go and have a look at the view as the group moved on, we were told to move along and keep up with the rest of the group.

Too much time was spent with the tour guide talking about how many times Liverpool had won the Champions League, describing every final in detail as we walked the corridors. This meant that the latter part of the tour, which was the bit we had wanted to see (i.e. the dressing rooms, tunnel and pitch side etc.) was very rushed. In fact, in the press conference room, many people were still queuing up to have their photo taken in Jurgen Klopp’s seat when the tour guides told us all to move on.

Having been on a tour of Old Trafford on the same weekend (we’re not Man Utd fans either), I was surprised at some of the comments by the tour guide about how much Liverpool like to intimidate their opponents and make them feel very unwelcome. The tour guide at Man Utd was actually quite complimentary about Liverpool as a team - the same couldn’t be said about the Liverpool staff regarding Man Utd or in fact any away team!

On the plus side, the views from the top of the main stand were great and the augmented reality viewing of a pre-match rendition of YNWA using the audio guide was very impressive. We also used the LFC City Explorer bus to get to and from Anfield and the lady who was our guide on there was very friendly and knowledgeable not just about football but about the city as a whole.

We spent way longer in there than we expected to and I think even non-LFC fans would be interested in the story it tells about the club's history and through that about the city as well. The other real positive was how helpful the staff were when I was setting up the visit to the stadium. I had a gift voucher for an LFC that I couldn't attend and the staff let me spend the voucher on the LFC Story Museum visit instead with a nice photo for each of us (posing with a virtual LFC star of our choice and a replica European Cup).

Even as a non fan it was amazing. The tour itself was great hitting all the key spots and giving good info on the audio guide. The thing however that elevated the tour to amazing was the team of guides around the stadium. They were clearly very passionate about their club and wanted you to love the place as much as they did. Great humour was evident as well.

Love it and would recommend it to anyone Liverpool fan or not.

618a2cba6fe3f9d3e4408d7d,UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"We attended for my wife's godson's 18th birthday treat as he is an avid Liverpool follower. Myself I am a Gillingham fan. We had pre-booked the tour which as it turned out was a sensible choice as the place was packed. We were able to park within the stadium which as Everton, across the park were at home, was very useful.
What to say about the tour. It was brilliant. For the first part walking up the staircases to the top of the Main Stand there is an option to use the lift. The tour had an interactive audio which is very informative. The views ,historical fact boards, video introduction, trophy rooms, press & tv room, dressing rooms and team dining area along to the walk along the pitch side, the opportunity to sit on the management and subs bench and the Kop is something else. A special mention to the host of guides who demonstrate so much pride in their club and were so helpful. From here we visited the club shop which was remarkably busy with both fans and tourists. After that we went into the museum which shows Liverpool through the decades as well as containing a room dedicated to Steven Gerrard. It is only when we went to leave that we realised we had been there four hours.

Perfect for any football fan (who don't currently hold any 'Reds'related grudges).,Aug 2019
618a2cbf6fe3f9d3e4408d7f,UK,Anfield Stadium,3.0,"Six years ago we visited with our girls who were then 7 and 10. It was bloody brilliant and the guide was hilarious. We genuinely couldn’t wait to come back.
Scroll forward to today and what a disappointment...
Audio guides only in half term - a horrible little detail we hadn’t noticed in the small print - and a tour which took so long many people missed out on the actual museum where the trophies are!
Our tour time was moved the day before- due to filming on site - and we were given an 8.30 or 3.30 option. We went for 3.30 but luckily arrived at 1 to both eat in the Boot Room (I wouldn’t bother) and look in the museum- and it’s a good job we did. The audio guide takes two hours - especially when you’re in a huge crowd trying to see everything - and by the time we came out there was ten minutes to closing time.
Why have you ruined what used to be amazing???? The small, personalised tour was excellent... this was dull and the facade of being part of a “Liverpool Family” slipped a little; it was more a feeling of being a tiny part of a huge commercial beast.
I know the reviews are overwhelming positive and yes, if you’re a fan you’re not going to stop supporting them because of it, and no, I don’t think anyone will really care about my opinions, but if your kids get bored watching flat, facts- only documentaries, then a half-term tour is definitely not the one to choose - which does seem slightly ironic!

Magnificent stadium & the tour guides are very knowledgeable.

618a2cbf6fe3f9d3e4408d81,UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Have been a few times both for match days and to do the stadium tour a few times.
Match days: the atmosphere is 2nd to none. Absolutely electric. Very easy to navigate. Easy entrance. Refreshments easy to access (despite Carlsberg being on draft which is a shame). Toilets are clean for a football ground. The stewards do a great job. Not being from Liverpool myself it is nice to see that every single stereotype about Scouse people is incorrect. They are very friendly and charming human beings who present themselves very well and are just there to have fun and to express their passion for this wonderful football club.

Anifled tour: very interesting tour. There is an audio guide but usually are taken around by a guide who is very approachable and funny. Obviously is going to be a biased view of the club by the guide as they are a Liverpool fan but this is done in a humorous way and they accommodate this to rival fans who visit so you can have a bit of banter with them. Have been with family and with service users (I am a support worker) and when I have been on business the guides are very helpful in making this accessible to the unique needs of those I am supporting and made this a personalised experience.

All I have left to say is: You'll Never Walk Alone. ALLEZ ALLEZ ALLEZ! Let's talk about 6!

We had Kenny as our tour guide and he was so much fun! His upbeat personality really made him stand out as our tour guide, compared to the other stadiums we went to on during our trip in England & the UK. we also toured Stamford Bridge, and Camp Nou.

I decided to make the trip from London up to Liverpool for a few days, specifically to see a match, in addition to seeing the city. The atmosphere is unlike any other, singing YNWA gave me goosebumps. A few notes;getting tickets proved to not be easy, so if you read online that Premier League tickets aren't easy to get, they are not lying, especially if you are an international. I ended up buying a hospitality package through the club, it was well worth it in my opinion. Plenty of pre match things to do around the stadium, and you can enjoy a pint down on the concourse, american fans beware though, beer can not go into the stands. If you are able to get to a match here, it is a must do.

However, the club lets itself down with a few well over-priced items, which are basically normal things that you can buy anywhere with the club logo on.
A cigarette lighter with the crest on it.. £2.50???
A bag of sweets, like cola bottles, or wine gums... £2.50... really Liverpool??? There's nothing special about bog standard sweets...and don't get me started on the 'Liverpool FC bottles of water!!!'.

About the Stadium tour. It was very organized and very informative. We were able to visit the field and seat on the players seats (Ferraris car heated seats). From beginning to end, impeccable. My 2 teens boys had a blast. I am sure we made some memories.

As it was first time in Liverpool we wasn't sure where to get the bus but after asking a couple of people we found it. It was ok as we staying at the docks. The bus driver and tour guide was very friendly and gave us plenty of information about Liverpool and the history of Liverpool and Everton. I loved every minute of our journey to Anfield. When we finally got off our tour guide told us the times when the bus comes back. My heart was in my mouth when I went through the gates. We explored outside the ground first where all the benches are of the important people of liverpool fc . Great information about these people that have made Liverpool fc great. Then we visited the memorial of Hillsborough. It was a lovely memto of the fallen 96. We next had a look at the shop where you could anything from strips to keyrings and fridge magnets. We decided to see if we could go on the tour a bit earlier than our 12 oclock slot. The people at the desk was very friendly and we got in. Handed our earphones and small handheld tablet. There was plenty of guides around if you had a problem but you were allowed to go at your own pace. The small handheld tablet gave you plenty of info as you walked around. Well worth the money. Also when you get back to the dock's you can use your ticket for the rest of the day on the yellow bus. We paid £20 each to visit Anfield and £8 for the bus. Well worth the money

Having traveled to the UK for a holiday from the US, we couldn't pass up the chance to go to the match. We booked a package through Dublin-based Marathon Sports Tour (highly recommend), and spent two night in a waterfront hotel and received two tickets to the match. We sat (actually stood for most of the match) in the Kop end of the stadium and loved every moment of it, surrounded by the most enthusiastic supporters we've ever experienced in sports. Truly an experience to add to your list.

The entire game day experience was amazing. Ample vendors and live entertainment outside the venue prior to entering providing a raucous and fun-filled couplenof hours. The food was better than the fare you'd see at stadiums in the US in our opinion.

The staff at the stadium were easily recognized and happily provided needed answers and directions to our seat.

If you ever have the chance to visit Anfield, on a game day or not, we highly recommend doing so. A win in the match probably helped a ton, too!

Audio self guide but also lots of staff at various points throughout the tour who provide additional commentary and information. The staff were all friendly, witty and helpful. The view from the new stand is amazing and it was a gorgeous autumn morning which really added to the experience. You find out about the history of the club, their influential managers, all their successes and their great players. You see the changing rooms, press areas, trophies, dug out and the famous “ Kop”. The museum is very interesting too and Stephen Gerrard has donated a lot of his personal mementoes - medals, shirts, photos, England caps etc. Would thoroughly recommend this tour.

We were given our lunch times, then went upstairs to the museum while we waited for our tour time. We had our photos taken with the Champions League Trophy (at a charge) and then made our way outside. We joined other people who were booked on our tour and after each of us being given our interactive headset set off into the arena. After watching a film we set off right to the top of the building to see the arena from above. While listening to the interactive tape by David Morrissey. We gradually made our way back down to ground level after visiting the players changing rooms, press room, trophy room, ect finishing off the tour with a sit in the dugout and then sat on the kop.
We only just had enough time to hand our headsets back and disappear back upstairs to meet Phil Neal and Steve McMahon for lunch.
Out of everything this was the only disappointing part of the day, the talk, and photos with these 2 gents was very enjoyable the food however was not. For the price we paid the food was pretty poor (unedible) and we had to pay for all drinks which were very expensive bar 1 small glass on arrival at the dining room -we chose coke but you could have had wine or beer, and the photo's this time were included in the price. We chose that particular day as there were 2 ex plyers to meet, there are different players on different dates for you to chose from when booking your experience.

My dad first went to Anfield in 1940 and it's changed a bit since then :). When we were booking in I asked the girl on reception (Morgan ?)would it ok for my dad to wait in the reception area until the tour starts as he's 85 and not the best on his legs. Not only did she arrange seating for him but she also arrange a wheelchair for him, fantastic service. If you're a Liverpool fan or a general football fan the tour is great and gives you the history and insight into this great football club and is done in a very visitor friendly informative way. But my outstanding feeling on finishing the tour was the pride in the staff and their outstanding customer service were nothing is too much bother and nothing is a problem. They represent themselves the football club and the city of Liverpool in the best possible way. Outstanding !

The museum has a small cafe that is very cheap and a great place to grab a coke and a sandwich if your wanting something quick and easy with small children. Alternatively there's a bright large basement restaurant that has a quieter atmosphere, the food they serve up is very good quality and well priced. The museum additionally has regular exhibitions in another basement area that charge a small fee for entry but the displays here are well worth the money. Entry to the normal museum is free.

Being located in Glasgow, the Museum focuses extensively on Scottish Identity both with some of the exhibits and the paintings but other exhibits include Rain Forests, Egypt and Natural History.

It didn’t arrive so we had to go and ask someone else. When we wanted to leave we had to go find someone to get the bill.

The Egyptian room is really interesting. I gather they have 84 pieces on long term loan from the British museum which really adds to the interest here. There is a lot to see. We spent 2 hours and would have spent longer if we could have had a rest at the cafe. Unfortunately the cafe and the bookshop were still closed during our visit.

We enjoyed the art exhibits, particularly the section on the ""Glasgow Boys"" and learned a lot about art in this period (1880 to 1920-40s), in UK and around the world.

We loved the Salvador Dali room displaying the painting of Christ. It now has a room of its own and the positioning is stunning. The natural world and prehistoric sections are really interesting too, as is the section covering weapons and conflict was well done. For a medium sized museum there is a lot here for every one, adults and children alike and provides a good foundation for further study of a wide range of topics.

Good information boards around the place.

Will be better once the cafe and bookshop are open. Will inspire people to spend longer there.

However free entry ( donations welcome), and effective anti covid processes in place.

Davis Cup glory. Just over 10 mins from the city centre, this masterpiece of architecture is definitely worth a visit. Its chandelier-decked entrance hall housing a beautiful organ is worth the entrance fee alone which with astonishment is FREE.
As for the exhibits, they range from world -renown artists like Dali, the Dutch, Italian and French masters, Lowry and the Impressionists to Ancient Egyptian artefacts to furniture through the Ages, stuffed animals ( Roger the Elephant is magnificent) and even a Spitfire !!!! Look out for Elvis as he is the building as well !!! An excellent place to visit for quick looksee or a day's in depth culture. In Covid times, pre booking is essential. Thoroughly recommended.

Impressive works of great artists of those famous , Rembrandt, Monet and van Gogh. The museum houses Christ of Saint John of the Cross by Salvador Dalí. The museum has 22 galleries, housing a range of exhibits, including Renaissance art and artifacts from ancient Egypt.The museum also contains a large gift of the decorative arts from Anne Hull Grundy, an art collector and philanthropist, covering the history of European jewellery in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Brilliant exhibitions of Rennie Mackintosh, his wife and her sister, plus the Glasgow boys and the colourists, really interesting. The spitfire is great to see. The only disappointment was the large exhibition of stuffed animals, really sad to see so many beautiful animals displayed in this way, really not necessary in this day and age, would be better to have videos of life animals with information about them, encouraging sustainability and protecting preserving animals and wildlife rather than this outdated anachronistic display of such beautiful dead creatures, a real shame.

First, you need to book a lot in advance and slots fill up quickly. Then you have to find your way in through poor signage and a road that says No Entry. It is not signposted from the way of the Subway station that now the entry is around the back. But once you figure it out you will encounter all number of unfriendly Jobsworths feeling important on high-vis tabards who do nothing but direct a few people and cars around the background and of the building. I wish I could have that job!

At the entrance I was told by one lady I could use the lift. Then at the lift entrance I was shooed out by a Jobsworth till I explained I wanted the lift. Then a conversation ensued that involved me being treated like I was 9 years old in answer to my questions. It went like this:
NO Maps
NO Shop (""nothing to do with us, it's outsourced"")
NO Café (people congregate for 4 1/2 hours)
NO turning back from one-way system
NO Seats
NO Mingling

Which really = NO Fun

Add to that the fact I have a health problem which means I need to sit down frequently and we decided to leave.

I also got the feeling if it took 7 Jobsworths doing nothing at the entrances, I didn't want to encounter anymore of them as they were all so rude.

So we crossed the street to a fantastic Italian cafe where we had refreshments, sat down and mingled and then just pottered around this interesting area where noone was wearing a tabard.

As a note, other museums and historic houses are making it work in these difficult times. Visitor experience should be better considered particularly for those with disabilities.

Despite spending four years in Glasgow, there were a number of places both in Glasgow and close by that I had never visited and I wanted to put that right during this trip. It was raining on my first day in Glasgow (some things don’t change) and we decided it was a good opportunity to visit one of those, Kelvingrove Art Gallery. Completed in 1901, the typical Glasgow red sandstone building is architecturally stunning, both inside and out. My friend is fairly knowledgeable about art and she was able to educate me about some of the wonderful paintings on display, such as Rembrandt's ‘A Man in Armour’ and what has become known as the Jewel of the Kelvingrove Crown ‘Christ of St John of the Cross’ by Salvador Dali.

There are lifts and disabed toilets on each floor and well signposted. As you pass into each section there is plenty of fascinating displays to look at along with written information about each area.

On the first floor they have set out seats for visitors to listen to the 1pm Organ resital. This can be heard throughout the whole of the museum. You can also enjoy a drink and food on this floor too.

It would be helpful if they catered better for people such as myself who have a dairy allergy. Time and time again they mix a dairy allergy with a gluten intolerance. Believe me they are not the same.

If you are wheelchair dependent you have adequate space to sit in the cafe as well as move in and around the museum.

Free to enter, though they ask for a voluntary contribution. A good place to visit with lots to learn and see.

Due to a fire alarm and impressive rapid evacuation we were able to quiz the man in charge about the lack of signage.

Daughter 14 and son 9 also seemed to find things that interested them.
Could spend the best part of a day there if you wanted to see everything but a couple hours was good for us. Would definitely return to see what we missed. Nice gift shops. Cafe looked ok but we never used it.

My wife and I went along specifically to listen to the organ recital which is a regular event there (The organist famously played some David Bowie stuff some years ago as a tribute to him). You can check on the 'What's on in Glasgow' website or on the Museum's website to find out when the recitals are on.
We were fortunate to turn up when there was also a brass band concert in the main hall, an unexpected bonus. The band and the organist provided an enjoyable afternoon of music. You are advised to show up at least 30 minutes before the show if you want to be sure of a seat.
The Art Gallery and Museum is so much more interesting since fairly recent improvements.
You can enjoy lunch in the restaurant on site.
Kelvingrove Park is to the rear of the Museum and Glasgow University is not far away (10-15 minute walk). Enter the Uni's main building and you will discover the impressive cloisters. You can also visit the Hunterian Museum in the same location.
The Museums are not too far from the city centre and they are free, but ....... please leave a donation.

.1 Revolving doors - great if you’re a young kid or an immature adult, I would avoid going in doing a handstand

2. Wide stairs - These are great for skateboarding down or riding a BMX should BMX be all caps? Don’t go down in a shopping trolley, that’s madness

3. Organ - sadly they don’t do requests. You can ask them for roll out the barrel, who knows.

4. Cracking marble floor - you can use it to recreate the scene from Harry Potter or to a dance along to MICHAEL Jackson’s black or white.

5. Elvis Statue - thank you very much

618a2d866fe3f9d3e4408e96,UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,3.0,"While I think the Galleries/Museum is world-class in terms of its unique collections, in my opinion it’s at best third-class in terms of providing helpful signs for visitors.

When you arrive at the imposing front, the only way into the building appears to be two sets of steep steps. There is no sign indicating that there is in fact a lift for accessible entry-I only found it by accident when paying my respects at a nearby military memorial. (The lift itself is only reached by a long walk to the left of the building and then doubling back on oneself!)

Once inside the building, there are plans showing the layout of collections & galleries (both on large boards and as handouts), but for some unaccountable reasons, only the room layout and contents for the Ground Floor are shown in bold clear lettering-the other floors appear only in very faint letters, which are very hard to read –what’s the point of having plans if they are so useless?
Please consult with various groups of people with less than 20/20 vision and get some better ones designed.

On this occasion, I had come to the Museum especially to see a temporary display. There was not one sign to show where this was situated. I was not impressed.

Spotting a man wearing a badge and clearly on duty, I went over and asked him where to find it. We were in the Main Hall, and he at first pointed me one way and provided explicit directions. Then he stopped himself and said “or is it the other way”. He then went over to speak to another guide. After both did much pointing, he came back and showed me the correct direction (the opposite way!). He apologised and remarked that even after several years working in the museum, he still found it confusing. (If he dings the layout confusing, what chance have visitors!)

Kelvingrove Management- please get more signs up to help visitors –and please also make then readable! And please start with signs to the lift to help those with accessibility challenges/those with prams.

On certain days you can also sign up for a tour around the organ but, be aware, it is limited to only 4 at a time so sign up at the Information desk as soon as you arrive. You can sit in free seats in the main hall and watch the organist on two video screens showing keyboard and foot movements. And then you can explore the remainder of the museum.

Being my first trip to Glasgow, obviously I turn to trip advisor for advice, and there it was, staring out at me from the screen in the top position of things to do.
It doesn't matter what your interests are, you will find something to delight you at this incredible homage to architecture, art, culture, and history. Kelvingrove Art Gallery has it all, so make sure you set aside at least a couple of hours to take it all in. The building itself is simply beautiful, from whichever way you approach it the facade draws your eye, beckoning you into its doors. Once inside you are treated to a maze of displays, all carefully brought together to please and delight the tourist. While I was there it wasn't only my eyes being treated to intricate artwork and visual perfection, my ears were in for a treat too. At 1pm, as I sat gazing upon the birds of prey, the melodic tones of organ music danced through the air. Making my way to the main hall, the acoustics vibrated through my body as a lone player sat at the magnificent organ to entertain the audience. I could have spent all day in this amazing place there was so much to see. This is a definite recommend from me for all ages, you simply can't go to Glasgow without visiting...

With free access, this museum is situated on two levels with lots of displays on various topics. From ancient bones, paintings, animals and much more, all have good descriptive details which will take you lots of time if everything is to be read.
The only downside and this applies not just to this museum but the area in general, is the parking. It can very difficult to find a space nearby, with lots of residents only parking and of the spaces that are available they are often very popular. If you are prepared to drive about for 10 or 15 minutes you will usually get something, but note most require payment at the meter. Of course several buses do pass the area and the Underground subway is about a 15 min walk away.

We wanted to see Dali's St John of the Cross painting - and were really pleased to do that, but there was so much else to see. I really enjoyed the Linda McCartney retrospective exhibition: it was beautifully set out, in different ""rooms"", and gave a rather lovely insight into her life with Paul and their children, as well as documenting life in the musical world of the 60s and 70s. We didn't find the larger cafe until too late in our visit, but had a nice light lunch in the smaller cafe in the central hall. An added bonus of our visit was to hear the organ being played - a Friday special I believe. This really is somewhere worth visiting - and worth visitng more than once actually.

618a2dbf6fe3f9d3e4408ef2,UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Kelvingrove. Plenty to see, do and learn. The building is split into 2 “wings”-the museum wing and the art gallery wing, which is mirrored over the different floors. For us the museum side was extremely interesting, and where we spent most of our time. So many different topics covered and so much to learn about. But even knowing very little about art, the gallery side was also very interesting, and we enjoyed seeing the paintings especially those by the big names such as Salvadore Dali, Matisse and Rembrandt.
We spent nearly a whole day at the kelvingrove, and still ended up skipping the last section, so would recommend giving yourself the whole day to visit and see everything at a decent pace.
Enjoyed our lunch at the cafe, which was very reasonably priced and much needed after a mornings wandering around the museum.
Spent quite a bit on the parking on site, and needed to top it up part way through the day, however with the entry being free it balanced it out a bit.

The museum is free but they do ask for a recommended £5 donation for entrance.
As you pass into the main hall the spitfire hanging from the ceiling dominates the room.
Below the plane in the hall is a very varied collection of stuffed animals , most dating back to the 19th century. Dotted amongst these are others items sue a sculptures, art, weapons etc.
The other rooms are similar and although the exhibits are good they don't really always flow well together. For example there are Jacobian dress and weapons next to 19th century sewing machines ?!
Star of the show for me is the Dali Crucifixion which is more impressive when you see the video about its purchase back in the 1960s.

We had a couple of hours to spare before heading to another venue

This museum is a gem of a place with diverse displays of artefacts and art

We started off in the cafe downstairs, having coffee and scones, a very nice start before our leisurely walk around the museum
After consulting the floor plan, which was given to us on our way in by a very help gentleman, we selected to have a look at the Glasgow boys art first, this did not disappoint.
We then worked our way through each area in turn. There were displays that did not seem to have any explanation on them, which was a tad confusing as to why they were there with no description

There was a gentleman performing Tai chi in the main hall, so good to see him and hear music in a museum

I especially enjoyed the Charles Rennie Macintosh exhibits, an ara I am especially interested in

On our way out we listened to the beautiful organ recital, very fitting in such a beautiful place

When we arrived in Glasgow it had closed, but we spent a while wandering around its beautiful pink stone exterior. It is a lovely building, surrounded by green space, a garden and a view to the University of Glasgow. The next day we walked to the gallery, open this time, and had a good browse around the Linda McCartney photography exhibition. Wow - this was a lovely exhibition and we were captivated by the huge collection of her family, travel and celebrity photos. The show was extremely well displayed, with great information and affection for her work.

Sadly we didn't have enough time in Glasgow to look further at other parts of the gallery, but I could see there was much more to explore. We did stop by the shop though - beautifully set out. Next time we are in Glasgow (oh I hope there is a next time!), we will certainly come back.

As for the exhibits, there is something for everyone. And I mean, everyone. Whether you're interested in 19th century local painters, the origins of the universe, mummification or native residents of the Americas... Not to mention the large section of taxidermy that will make your stomach turn and your skin crawl. The whole collection lacks cohesion and feels outdated and confusing, like I'd imagine a museum of the early 1900s.
Still, you can spend a couple of hours here and then explore the park just outside.

618a2e366fe3f9d3e4408fa8,UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,3.0,"I was disappointed in the Kelvingrove when I'd heard such good things. The collections seem to lack cohesion, as if they were thrown together and justified later rather than thoughtfully gathered. And there is a complete lack of self-awareness regarding Scotland's participation in colonialism. It features snippets and pieces of indigenous artifacts from all over the world without context, without cultural attribution, and without proper explanation of the items featured, if there was ANY explanation at all. Not all exhibits are properly marked, some 'hands-on, interactive' displays were missing. Several of the touchscreen displays were out of order. In general, there was a shallowness that might work for those who only ever go to a museum once in a blue moon but for those actually wanting to learn something or be inspired, it's wanting. There are a few gems in the painted works but not enough to make the trip worth it for them alone, save the Dali work.

That said: the pieces on display by Macdonald are better than her husband's, Mackintosh and I wish they had more work of both. The Dali, the crown jewel, the reason I came, and the reason I stayed, Christ the Redeemer, is stunning and always worth the time to see it. However, it deserves a better space. It's tucked in a tiny closet of a room, which is more quiet and reverent, grant you, but jammed with people so one can't get a good square look at the one true masterpiece in the gallery. It had a better space at St. Mungo's.

618a2e366fe3f9d3e4408fac,UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"Located about 10 minutes away by foot from Kelvinhall subway station, this museum has so many galleries that you can spend countless hours exploring it.

One of my favourite rooms is the one on Mackintosh and the Glasgow Style. You can check out the furniture and reconstructed rooms (including a tea room) that were designed by famed Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

Don't forget to see Salvador Dali's Christ of St John of the Cross - the painting is tucked in a little room dedicated solely to it. The painting leaves many in awe, and the more you read about the history of its making and acquisition (the museum's purchase of the painting in 1952 was rather controversial), the more fascinating the painting becomes.

There are organ recitals almost every afternoon, and it's a good excuse to catch a break.

If you're feeling hungry, you can check out eateries in the nearby Finniestone area (e.g. Ox and Finch restaurant).

All in all, a trip to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum makes for a tremendously inspiring day.

However, we would ask the National Trust to please keep the sweet shop as it is. Another second hand National Trust bookshop would be entirely inappropriate there.

The back to backs were built around shared courtyards but were deemed to be unsatisfactory and a public health act was passed in 1875 meaning that no more were built. The last example of an intact back to back development is Court 15 at Inge Street/Hurst Street which has been preserved by the National Trust. I visited in October 2020 during a brief Covid relaxation period and had the chance to take some photos of Court 15. It is a fascinating part of Birmingham’s past and worth exploring whilst in the city.

My many visits to the ""Hipp"" as a child gave me my love of theatre which I still have to this day.

Fascinating insight to how life was for the poorest in society. In 1875, the Government sought to outlaw them due to their awful unsanitary conditions, but didn’t enforce the demolition and councils and land owners were free to ignore the law, even to the point of building more.

618a2e626fe3f9d3e4408ff6,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"This is a real worthwhile visit in Central Birmingham, Our guide Carl really made history come to life as he walked us through and up and down (quite a few narrow, twisty staircases but they do offer a ground floors only tour for those less agile) four properties from 1840, 1870, 1930 and a tailor shop (looked like it did the day after it was closed). Fascinating to see products and articles that you had seen in your grandparents' houses. Also you get a view of toilets through the ages !! A real reminder of how much we take for granted - fetching 20 buckets of water from a nearby well, anyone ? . Booking is essential and visit is by guided tour only but if you get Carl guiding you, you will have a very enjoyable visit. There is a small exhibition, souvenir shop and best of all, an old-fashioned sweet shop

618a2e676fe3f9d3e4408ff8,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"A really insightful and thought provoking afternoon at this little gem in Birmingham. Not your usual NT stately home with all the grandeur but a stark chilling experience to see how the poor working class residents of Birmingham lived from the late 1800s up until the 1960s. The visit consists of a private tour (so you have to prebook) delivered by a NT volunteer. I am sure they are all brilliant but if you can insist on Wesley. He is so knowledgeable (he was a previous resident as a child) so he speaks with such passion about life and hardship in this community. He also adds a real spark of humour in his tour so you are smiling and frowning in equal measure.

A great day out for all ages. Just beware there are a couple of steep steps and low ceilings. Well done NT for taking this on and preserving the history

Our guide was well informed and gave a very humourous guided tour
During the 90 minute tour there are lots of narrow doorways and steep stairs, both up and down, to negotiate so you do need to be able bodied
You are introduced to the ever changing history of the properties and its occupants with fascinating description of their lives and businesses
There are lots of objects to see and handle to help you get a fuller picture of life in the back to back housing of the times
There is a small museum to view and a visit to the sweet shop on the corner is an absolute must
Please make sure to book so as not to be dissapointed when you are turned away, as all tours are fully booked, if you turn up on spec!

Access for taller or less mobile visitors is a bit of a challenge - steep stairways and low ceilings, but traversing two hundred years of progress and regression is fascinating and rewarding.

This National Trust property is vividly rendered and is the perfect remedy for 2020 Tory Britain.

Considering my folks first house in the 1960s was a back to back in Small Heath, this brings back real memories. The outside toilet with a pull chain,imagine in winter, the front bay window and door, just the small feel of it.
the tin bath, and the yard in front used to be called ""the entry"".
industrial workers had it tough in the victorian times, and it was not till 1970s that the back to backs started to vanish as they were regarded slum standard. I think they are rather cosy, but give me a modern house with a garden anyday. Still worth a visit, you will feel very lucky to be living now not then.

How the workers used to live during a time of massive urban growth? And why most of those dwellings were demolished? You’ll get to know the answers in this quite interesting visit IN-site.

We were guided by David Harris who was simply wonderful. He really set the scene of what life was like over the 150 years period that these houses spanned. He used lots of old Brummie phrases which made my wife and I smile as we both have parents and grandparents from Birmingham. He was able to keep all of the group interested in what he was saying and kept our daughters engaged throughout. It is amazing what the National trust have done to preserve and refurbish these houses and it
really is worth a visit whatever your history in the area or not as these houses were similar to others all over the UK that were inhabited from the start of the 19th century all the way through to the 1970s. Also make sure you take in the old fashioned sweetshop for some long forgotten memories from your own childhood.

details. Bravo to the National Trust for saving this site to educate us about the less glamorous side of urban life. How lovely to be in a huge city and have something do other than tramp around shops. The Lemon Sherbets bought from the super cute, traditional sweet shop after the tour were the best I’ve ever had.

His personal connection to the Back to Backs, made it one of the best tours I’ve been on. Definitely not your usual National Trust, but this is a true gem in the heart of Birmingham, which shows you just how far we’ve come as a nation. In some ways for the better, but the loss of community we now have is a real shame when you learn how your neighbour would dry your washing for you if it rained on your washing day. Just amazing.

The National Trust has presented each of the houses in a different period, and Jeff described the living conditions of real families who are known to have lived in the houses. The final part of the tour was a visit to the tailor’s shop, which was the last of the shops there to close, in 2000. It seems amazing, in a city the size of Birmingham that once had so many such houses, that this small court is the last surviving. A really worthwhile tour, highly recommend.

Do go on the guided tours of the Back to Backs - they are interesting and worthwhile.

I had booked to stay nine nights arriving on a Saturday in September(I had stayed previously in both numbers 52 and 54) to find that my booking could not be honoured because of an electrical fault. The NT had not messaged me to advise me of this so preventing me from cancelling my trip. They did refund my payment for booking and also three nights in a hotel but their lack of information and provision of alternative accommodation for the remaining six nights cost me an unexpected £500 extra. To say nothing of my disappointing a friend who had expected to share a pleasant week.What I had expected to be a relaxing week and two days turned into an expensive nightmare. Very poor customer service. I have, as a result, determined never to give another penny to the NT.

There is a fascinating history starting around 1840 and working to the 2000’s that is well presented in a true time travel experience. Coupled with knowledgeable tour guides to explain the stories and point out key exhibits, the time flew by.

Our guide was Jeff Williams and he was fantastic - clearly knew a lot and loved his subject. The place is unlike a lot of National Trust properties in that you are encouraged to touch almost everything including trying out the chairs and the beds and the stories of the people who lived in the houses is brought to life beautifully.
You can only visit if you book a tour and I can understand why as without the guide (ask for Jeff, with a J) it would’ve been a lesser experience. Having said that, the small exhibition, with the recorded stories of the people of the day, is also worth visiting at the beginning or the end.

618a2eb46fe3f9d3e4409077,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Having lived in Birmingham all my life surprisingly only just visited this historic site. Guess it's true not knowing what is on your own doorstep sometimes! This is a place well worth visiting if you like history and how people used to live....it really gives you an insight in how things used to be. On arrival we were greeted by our tour guide Ann who lived herself in back to back houses....some of her stories were very enlightening. She made the tour really interesting and answered any questions we had with real enthusiasm and a bit of humour! The tour itself lasts approx an hour and a half but it goes so quickly as you seem to travel through time! The houses are small and there are a lot of steep spiral stairs to climb up and down.....but sufficient handles/bannisters to hold onto so no problem if you take it slowly. However probably not suitable for people with severe mobility problems. I loved every part of this experience and would happily visit again as would probably learn something new that I missed this time round! Booking is essential as otherwise you may be disappointed. Would highly recommend a visit .

Hard to believe people had to live like that plenty of facts and interesting things to look at. If you are interested in Victorian Birmingham this tour is for you. you can also book a room and stay there but there is a six months waiting list.,Oct 2019
618a2eba6fe3f9d3e440907b,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"As members of the National Trust this has been on our list to visit for a while ... and it completely exceeded expectations. It does need to be booked in advance, but it is definitely worth a bit of planning for, and is situated in an interesting part of Birmingham (Very near the Electric Cinema which I recommend!)

The site says the tour involves stairs with tight corners, so as long as you are able then it’s a fascinating insight into history that you can almost relate to. As our tour guide acknowledged, a lot of National Trust properties are stately homes representative of aristocracy. So it’s nice to almost see history from below and how regular people lived from the industrial revolution onwards. It’s also very hands on with rooms laid out with items from the period that really bring it to life.

Our tour guide - Kay - was fantastic. Just brilliant. Warm, funny, enthusiastic, knowledgable and someone who really bought history to life. The tour lasted 2 hours and I honestly thought it had been only an hour or so. You just got so absorbed you don’t notice time flying by.

A totally different NT experience from the norm, but absolutely brilliant.

Jeff’s grandparents had lived in a similar property so he was able to put a personal spin on the visit. Amazing that this property is still standing but I’m so pleased it is. The tailor’s shop at the end was fantastic, all the brown paper patterns were hung from the walls and the sewing machines were still on the bench. Lots of narrow steep stairs but nobody rushed us and once in each room we were able to sit down and listen to the stories of the people who had lived there. Brilliant!!!

There were quite a few steep staircases to contend with which some less mobile people might struggle to use but you are pre-warned about that when booking and there are some chairs in most rooms where you could sit if you needed too.

I am always thankful for the comforts of my 2019 home but even more so after this visit.
Approaching the site on foot, we felt that there were not enough ""brown"" signs to point us in the right direction. Outside the attraction, it was unusual to see a National Trust sign in not the traditional colours

618a2ed36fe3f9d3e44090a7,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Visiting the Back to Backs was something I'd been wanting to do for a long time, both for reasons of a great interest in the history of my native city and also because my mother had spent her early childhood living in a Back to Back just a few miles away in Aston.

The experience, while very emotional for me, was absolutely fascinating from a historical point of view, as we were given a riveting insight into almost two hundred years of life in Birmingham, viewed through the perpective of the lives of families who actually lived in the Back to Backs, and, later, the businesses who traded there including, right up to the turn of the 21st century, the renowned Birmingham tailor George Saunders.

I can't speak highly enough of our tour guide, who was expert, passionate about her subject, delighted to answer questions and elaborate on any topics, and could find just the right balance of humour in sometimes grim topics.

My wife and I, both 63, had huge fun with the collection of household objects and implements you can pick up and examine - they brought back so many memories of our childhoods.

The hour and a half flew by, and we'll definitely be paying another visit soon.

I'd unreservedly recommend the Back to Backs to anyone, but particularly if you are interested in the history of the Midlands and North between the early 19th and late 20th centuries..

None of your stately homes, 4 poster beds, manicured laws or servants quarters here. These are as they were going back almost 200 years. We were expertly escorted by one of the very knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides and as we trooped up and down stairs we all became totally immersed in the history and, more to the point, the lives of the individual people who lived in the different rooms. Like many 'working class' dwellings, they were immaculate and loved by those who lived in them but they were tiny, cramped and had no hint of comfort at all. And to top them off, China town is right next door so we had to sacrifice our much anticipated National Trust soup in exchange for some of Birmingham's best Dim. What a grand day out.Sum

618a2ed96fe3f9d3e44090b2,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"We visited with our 6 and 3 year old daughters, and were a little worried beforehand about whether the guided tour would be over the heads and boring for our little ones.

We needn’t have worried as the guide was absolutely fantastic and made sure to make the information presented relevant to them while still giving details to the adults. Despite the tour lasting nearly 2 hours they were interested throughout, and afterwards were able to recall what they had found out. The guide got each member of the party to act out different aspects of the families’ lives and really made it come to life.

We also visited the exhibition upstairs from the gift shop, where the children got to dress up and our course the sweet shop (which was their bribe for being sensible during the tour)

I found the tour fascinating and really enjoyed myself. I can’t believe after living within an hour of this attraction that it has taken us so long to visit!

Booking was easy - emailed when we were free and got a confirmation by telephone (voicemail, because I missed it!). Signed in on the day to get our tickets and pay/show our membership cards and then got some sweets from the shop next door before our tour. The sweet shop was great, big selection of old favourites sold by the quart.

We met our tour guide, Des, outside the shop. He was wonderful - friendly and chatty - full of facts. He really tailored the tour to our group and where our questions led.

You are taken through several of the houses, with stories in each room and clambering up and down steep steps. You're allowed to touch a lot of the objects in the rooms and sit on chairs and beds which really gives it a homely and relaxed feel. You can also hear the movement and mumbles from other tours, which adds to the atmosphere, as that's how it would have been in the past! People telling from Windows down to the court below.

This was a highlight of our weekend in the city, with a really great insight into the highs and lows of life for ordinary people in the past.

These are the people who made Birmingham one of the most important industrial centres of the world.
Our tour leader, Di, was excellent. A local woman with local knowledge, she was very engaging. You are allowed to handle objects, which is unusual for a NT property.
Wear sturdy footwear as there are many steep spiral staircases to climb. Don’t forget that tours need to be booked in advance. Our tour took about 1 hour 45 minutes.

618a2ef26fe3f9d3e44090d7,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Back to Backs is a wonderfully nostalgic and spell-binding trip down memory lane, taking you on a journey to experience how people lived in this part of Birmingham in days gone by.
Our National Trust tour guide Tony Skelton, himself a Brummie, was a font of knowledge, providing not only an in-depth insight into how tough life must have been for the inhabitants of the time, but doing so with true passion, warmth and no little humour.
Through Tony, who expertly brought this quite humbling history lesson to life, we relived the days of no electricity, no running water, candlelight, cramped bedrooms, cesspits and, luxury of luxuries, outdoor privies!
One warning - if you have mobility issues you will want to avoid the stairs, which are winding, narrow and steep.
All in all then a marvellous tour - there is also a little museum above the Trust shop and a cute little corner sweet shop. It’s an absolute must-do should you visit Birmingham. Well done the NT for all the hard work carried out to restore this last surviving court of back to backs. Inspirational.

618a2ef26fe3f9d3e44090d8,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"We visited the Back to Backs when the National Trust first opened them (in 2004?!) Back then they were finding their feet and there was fine-tuning to do but it was still very interesting. So, fast forward to August 2019…our friend was over from Norway for her holiday and expressed a wish to visit this historical attraction.

I contacted them by email barely five days ahead of our planned visit at 11am (the advice is to allow at least that long) but had our confirmation back very quickly. We joined the 10:45 Sunday tour with Anne as our guide. We were a decent sized group of around ten people, which made it cozy in some rooms!

To break the ice Anne went around the group: we each gave our name and where we were from. We were also warned again that the tour would include climbing and descending eight sets of narrow and steep stairs. They are not exaggerating about this. If you are well-built, tall or are at all unsteady on your feet, you need to think carefully about taking the full tour. One gentleman in our group was well over 6ft tall and had to be VERY careful of low ceilings and beams!

Anne made the tour very interesting, engaging and entertaining. She delivered her knowledge almost unerringly and with obvious enthusiasm. She worked various members of our group into the tour, matching us with key family members from the history of the property. This helped us relate to the people and their history, but also added to the fun...as did various questions asked of us to challenge our knowledge or powers of deduction. This was not a dry room by room lecture. Anne brought it all very much to life.

The time seemed to go by all too quickly. That said, I never even bothered to check for the time. The tour took at least 1½hrs but didn’t seem that long. Everyone was fully engaged, learning something new and interesting as we travelled from the 1830s up to 2001 when the last occupant vacated the property. Very enjoyable and a reminder of how lucky we are to hold on to such a vulnerable slice of our history and heritage...and how lucky many of us we are to grow up and live as we now do.

So, compared with our first visit has much changed? Not really, but I think the main difference may be a combination of the available knowledge & artifacts being greater and how it’s delivered is much improved. I highly recommend this experience. My friend from Norway loved it.

There are a few public car parks not far away (although we both used public transport on this occasion) and plenty to see nearby since you are close to the city centre, which also means ample eateries to choose from, including all the Chinese Quarter and theatre area have to offer locally. As part of a full day out, this attraction is well worth inclusion.

In a small group, we were escorted around the courtyard and through a series of back-to-back houses, up and down narrow, steep staircases. Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly, and never patronising. We were never hurried, but our guide led us from room to room at a comfortable pace. The tour was very interesting and time seemed to pass very quickly -- when we finished the tour we were amazed to discover that we'd spent the whole afternoon in the 'back-to-backs'! I'd recommend this tour for teens and adults rather than families with young children. Warning: the stairs are very steep and narrow!

Enjoyed leaning about the history of the buildings and of how Birmingham grew and the stroke of luck an how the buildings were saved.

We can't recommend this tour enough. Jeff our guide was very informative. Many of our group had memories of some of the things on display so it was very interactive. The steep stairs are fine as there are handrails and grab handles. We were allowed to pick things up, sit on the beds etc. Very evocative to consider what life was like for the families who lives here, and so good to see the NT preserving buildings other than stately homes.",Jul 2019

We were not disappointed. The tour guide Wayne was informative, knowledgable and great fun. He brought the whole history of the place back to life and it was quite sobering at times to fully accept how people in the ""back to backs"" lived and survived.
A great experience, which like so many before me throughly recommend.

Geff/Geoff but deffo with a G was an amazing guide who talked with ease and kept us thoroughly entertained. He was also observant and noticed if someone took a special interest in anything. He also came across as compassionate about the past occupants of the houses through the years. Was great to be able to touch and sit on the exhibits in the first three back to backs as this added another dimension to the past. Enjoyed clambering up and down the twisting narrow stairs. A room that hadn't been renovated clearly showed how much work had gone into these homes.
My absolute highlight though was the Go-Kart! Geff even encouraged me to have a go on it! Wow!!! It was awesome zooming round that brick courtyard! Thanks.
Everyone at this property was amazingly friendly and knowledgeable - they are a hugh asset to the National Trust.

If you are at all interested in social history this is the place to visit. It is hard to imagine that these houses were very nearly pulled down, the history of Birmingham that would have been lost is unimaginable.

One word of warning though - you are taken up some very difficult staircases so if you have trouble with stairs maybe not for you, although there are bannisters and handles to hold onto.

Once again, just brilliant and thank you Geoff!!

You have to contact them to book a guided tour as you aren’t able to walk about on your own.

We were initially wondering what it would be like as a guided tour, but we needn’t have worried - our tour guide Eric was fabulous. He had lived in a back to back himself and was very knowledgable.

It was so interesting to get a glimps into how life used to be in Birmingham. We sometimes take life and the things we have for granted but this makes you realise that life nowadays isn’t so bad.

There were interesting stories that we were told and we were able to pick things up to look at and touch the walls etc.. unusual for a National Trust place.

The staff were friendly and let us store our backpacks so we didn’t have to wear them whilst going around.

There were lots of steep stairs to go up and down, so that may be worth bearing in mind.

The tour lasted around an hour and a half to two hours - but it didn’t seem that long. There was so much to look at and so much insight given by Eric, that the tour didn’t seem as long as it was.

But don’t let it put you off - it’s well worth the visit. (We just wish we had visited the sweet shop on the corner beforehand as it was closed when our tour finished)

Went with my parents (late 70s but very fit) and 22 year old daughter, (stairs are steep so you need to by agile), and all of us loved it. Incredibly fascinating to see how people lived, their possessions and occupations and so, so glad these houses are being preserved for future generations. My parents had so many stories and memories they could relate....hence the thanks for patience from the guide! I’m sure our tour was twice as long as it should be!

The visit has to be by guided tour, for safety reasons, but this means you get to hear the stories of the families who lived in the back-to-backs through the years. The guide was full of fascinating stories and snippets of information which brought the whole place to life!
You have to be fairly able-bodied to manage the narrow, steep staircases, but the nearly two hour tour is absolutely fascinating! The guide engaged with the whole group and there was plenty to interest all ages. We were free to ask questions as we went round.
I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in social history. But remember to book!!

Catch an authentic glimpse into the how working class people lived in different periods of the 19th century. Take a tour, and be sure you also visit the exhibition to find out more about the statistics and social history of the period, as well as more background to this last remaining courtyard of back-to-back houses in Birmingham.

We were privileged to be allowed to make a short film here (to help bring a book set in Victorian Birmingham to life) and this was the perfect period location.

618a2f0b6fe3f9d3e4409101,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"These back to back houses were originally built for artisans employed in making watch parts. Unlike the notion of back to backs as slum dwellings this was definitely not the case originally! They were constructed when this part of Birmingham still bordered fields - hard to believe this todayThe houses ae VERY small with very steep staircases, some of which have ropes to hang onto as you climb up. The rooms are compact to say the least, and beds were commonly shared by children (separated by sex though). There were shared washing and toilet facilities out in a yard. As time went by, and more people came to the city for work, the houses were divided up further and because sub standard. The last business to occupy this particular set of back to backs was a tailor who made clothing for the Household Cavalry among other items. He left in the 1970s I think. The National Trust owns them now; what you see is a small fragment of a once large number.
You are taken around in a group, limited by numbers because of the small spaces. The guides are very knowledgeable and interesting. The rooms are furnished in 19th century style so you get an idea of how people lived in those times.

People with mobility issues will find these back to back hard if not impossible to access because of the very narrow, steep stairs.

It was an interesting experience, and the guide was very knowledgeable. We were shown through 3 of the back-to-backs, each for a different period. The people the guide talked about where real families, which made in all the more interesting.

I'm quite glad we are NT members, as entrance is quite expensive otherwise!

In short the well informed guides take you around 3 back to back houses that are decked out with furnishings from three different periods of time. I found it really atmospheric and it was easy to feel you were being taken back in time. My only criticism would be that the group was too large and it wasn't possible to look around the room comfortably without getting in someone's way. We were told that one of the guides was unwell so I think they amalgamated the tours. Our guide said that she wasn't able to go into so much detail so I hope we weren't short changed too much.

In total I was there for over two hours as after the tour you can visit the small exhibition upstairs. Cameras aren't allowed inside but ok for outside in the courtyard.

618a2f246fe3f9d3e4409128,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"My sister in law and I were entranced with the tour on Saturday morning around the back to back houses! It brought home to us what it was really like to be one of the poorest people who lived in the city - like many of my ancestors!
The tour guide was full of stories from his own personal family's memories as well as the stories of the people who once lived in these particular back to backs.
A must for all people whose grandparents and great grandparents used to live in this kind of housing whether in Birmingham, London, Manchester, Leeds or any of the other cities of the UK.
I recommend it to everyone - even those lucky enough to come from posher beginnings as it's always good to see how the other half lived.
Thank you for making our weekend in Birmingham very special!

618a2f246fe3f9d3e4409129,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"We had a brilliant visit to this fascinating National Trust property. There were six of us, aged 11-72 and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Our guide, Dave, was knowledgable and entertaining - and had grown up in a Back to Back himself, so interspersed his brilliant commentary with some personal anecdotes. It was history at its best: bringing the past to life through the stories of real people and places.

Our tour lasted about 90 minutes but it flew past. A practical tip is to wear sensible footwear as the many little staircases are narrow and twisty. But my best tip is to go if you can - it is well worth booking a trip.

Each room a different journey! Go there and you’ll have a great time!",Jun 2019
618a2f246fe3f9d3e440912b,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Visited the Back to Backs whilst staying overnight in Birmingham. I had pre-booked by email a few days earlier and received a nice confirmation call back. We are members.of the National Trust. It is necessary to pre-book due to the enclosed nature of the houses.

The Back to Backs are perhaps one of the best hidden of the National Trust properties; no long drive into a country estate here - but a small corner of a development in the shadow of the Hippodrome theatre.

We arrived very early for our slot and were warmly welcomed in the reception/gift shop and had a look around the upstairs exhibition. We'd just come from the Birmingham Museum which features a good section on local history and provides a decent general introduction to life in Birmingham around the life of the Back to Backs. The information held in the exhibition and on the tour is a lot more specific and personal.

To kill a bit more time we visited the sweet shop on the corner which features a lot of old type sweets, albeit at today's prices. The lady in the shop was very pleasant.

The tour was very detailed and very well structured. The tour is done in groups of around 10 people due to the cramped surroundings and steep staircases. For those with mobility issues it would be worth contacting the NT to organise a visit.

The tour lasts around 2 hours and takes you through 3 houses set up at 3 different points in time based on people who were known to live in the block. This provides a personal insight into these people but also gives us an insight into the social history of Birmingham in particular but also gave me some useful context to my own genealogy based research.

The tour appealed a lot to those from Birmingham especially but we also found it very interesting. Our children are quite young but were kept well engaged by Clive who proved to be an excellent and knowledgeable guide.

We were impressed with our Tour Guide, Jeff’s vivid portrayal of how the poor in the Back to Backs lived in such squalid & deprived conditions during th the 1800 to 1960’s. Jeff skilfully brought their struggle for survival alive, captivating his group with his raw account.
This amazing Tour is a good example of how the poor lived during that time.

I’m a history student (22) so loved learning some local history, whilst my grandparents loved reminiscing about their own childhoods and their experiences of housing similar to the back to backs. Our tour guide was brilliant and the group we went round with were all really engaged. I felt the tour was adjusted based on the interest and involvement of the group which was really great. I’d also recommend going and grabbing some sweets from the sweet shop at the end!

My grandma entered a raffle while we were there. She had completely forgotten about this, but received a letter a few weeks later saying an admin error has meant she wasn’t entered, and that she would be placed in the next one. We have huge respect for this level of honesty and integrity and this is exactly the sort of place which deserves traction.

This venue is very popular for a reason. One of which is the engaging qualities of our guide. He was local and was not just an 'import' with an oxbridge accent. This was a great addition to the engagement of the presentation. The subject matter that was dealt with on the tour was an eye opener to us all. Totally absorbing and a trip that left us wanting more. The tour took just over an hour and half although our enthusiasm meant that we overran by 10 minutes.

The tour took almost two hours and our guide Pat, pitched it just right so that the information captured the imagination not only of the adults but of the children too who ranged from 16 - 6 years old. The houses had been restored to how they were in 1830, 1870, 1930 and a shop in 1970 (if I've remembered correctly) not to mention a working old fashioned sweet shop which is where the tour starts. Detail is key and the tour gives details of specific families and how they lived both adults and children. It is a tour with great educational benefit and my children came away having learnt a lot and realising that they were very lucky not having to work but actually being able to go to school and for having an indoor toilet but most of all, toilet roll!

The exhibits were fabulous and the tour guide knowledgeable. However her delivery was a little tedious, and without humour. She was sticking to the script with no flexibility. When anyone tried to share a reminiscence they were dismissed or ignored due to time constraints but she used up so much time telling us about her experiences, aside from the script. This made you feel as though you had to be mute observer rather than being absorbed in the experience. As an ex teacher and current course provider, can I just say in order to engage your group you could have given all the information and still be flexible enough to allow your group to go down memory lane instead of making people listen endlessly to your memories. I was so disappointed not by site itself but by tour guide. Sorry about that but it ruined our afternoon

618a2f376fe3f9d3e4409148,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Very enjoyable and informative (thanks to our local expert guide Dan) and well paced. Its remarkable that the buildings survived at all, and the 3 time capsules based upon actual families who lived there add an extra dimension to the surroundings. The statistics on child mortality were particularly affecting. It’s great to see the National Trust covering the wider spectrum of historic buildings rather than just the more common stately homes.

The stairs from floor to floor are very narrow and steep and certainly won’t suit everybody, but the tour is certainly worthwhile if you can manage them. The only anachronism was the 1950s wireless downstairs in the 1930s version, but being able to handle most of the artefacts makes the whole experience different from most other NT properties.

Everything seemed to be measured just right - eg time in each room, the actual duration of the tour etc. In particular THE PITCH of the Tour-Guide was excellent - neither too simplistic nor to over-complicated, rendering it accessible to virtually all 'audiences'.
Our Tour-Guide never lost site of 'the Human Story' behind these houses. This again kept our interest.
The Back to Backs are a gem. Seeing how ordinary people lived not too far back in our History makes you reflect on the world we live in today. Also, there are so few places to visit that capture the History of The Ordinary Person. I thought the visit was wonderful. In short, an Extraordinary Story of our Ordinary Living in our recent History!

Our guide Geoff, was very knowledgable on all aspects of the living conditions and history of court 51 and delivered that knowledge with humour as and when required.

The tour lasts about 2 hours and provides a huge insight into the people living there. It is amazing as you look back how people managed to live like that.

It is a guide led tour which must be booked in advance. Definitely needed the guide to give you the history, the background and who used to live in the properties - fascinating. Tour lasted about 1 and 1/2 hrs. There is a lot of steep steps/stairs to go up and down and space was tight at times, so you do need to be mobile enough to be able do the whole tour. However, it appears for those less able you can go into the ground floors of the properties with the guide, still getting the history etc and upper floors are shown on a tablet. There is usually just a handful people on each tour, so nice and small. The tour starts in the courtyard and then entering the first house it depicts the 1840's and onwards and this time changes as you proceed. Shows how people lived back in the day.Well worth the visit.

There is an old fashioned sweet shop for your to make purchases and the gift shop.

You do have to book in advance though (think a weeks notice is recommended). The tours of the houses are conducted by necessity in small groups, and takes about 1.5 hours. The guides are very entertaining and knowledgeable, and the time flies by. The houses built around 1802 are displayed as they were in several different eras of their existence. Starting in 1840’s, late Victorian, 1930’s then a 1970’s tailors ship to finish. Highly recommended for those interested in social history.

I bought these tickets to take my Mum for her birthday, as Mum is always telling us about what used to happen (regarding keeping house etc) when Mum was growing up. Mum (and the rest of our group) thoroughly enjoyed ""stepping back in time"" like this and Mum was even able to regale our guide with a few of her stories from back in the period.

I loved how receptive Jean was to this information... she could have told my Mum to be quiet, but she didn't-in fact she welcomed the information, advising that it gives them more information to use in their tours.

A wonderful day out and definitely somewhere that people should visit if you want to get an idea how the working class lived through the ages of 1805 - 1966.

618a2f676fe3f9d3e4409191,UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,4.0,"The Birmingham Back to Backs are the last remaining example of this form of housing which were built to house the fast growing populations of the industrial cities of the UK in the 19th century. This block has been rescued from ruin by the National Trust and you can visit 3 houses, representing living conditions in the 1840s, the 1870s and the 1920s - you then see a tailors shop and workroom from the 1970s. The houses are small and the NT runs regular tours of no more than 8 people (more would not fit in the rooms!). The tours involve steep narrow staircases, although I believe ground floor only tours are available. These tours are in high demand so you need to book probably some weeks in advance of your visit. You are not likely to be able to get a ""walk in.""
When you arrive you are greeted in a reception area and given the tickets for the pre-booked tour. There is a small shop, toilets and an exhibition about the property. There is also an operating sweet shop (selling traditional sweets). You are then admitted to the courtyard onto which the properties to be visited face. The properties facing the street are the shops, reception area and holiday lets and these are separated from the properties you visit by a single brick wall. The guide we had was very informative about living conditions and the families who lived in these properties. The tour was scheduled to last between 1 hour 15 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes, but ours was getting on for 1 hour 45 minutes - so allow 2 hours for the visit. It was a very good visit.

I have never been so disappointed in my life. We queued to get into the tunnel where a FRIENDLY witch told me not to be scared and commented on the clothes I was wearing. We then went up to the jail where we queued for 15 minutes. There was a nun who walked up and down and two other masked figures. Then we went through the hanging cell where they have a CD playing a girl screaming and someone standing there. We then went outside where there were 4 guys with chainsaws, again this wasn’t scary as we were behind about 30 people so we were well aware of what was coming. This then lead to the “circus” which was a tent.. I thought to myself “yes finally something scary”… it was a fully lit conference tent with one clown standing there. Honestly, I’m not even joking you.
Then it was over.
Like £13 and I came across maybe 10 different characters in total.
Will never be back and will make sure others don’t go. Complete waste of money.

I got more scares on Barry's ghost train!!

I have been to several of these over the years including florida, Blackpool and Derry/ London Derry but this was just pathetic!
Characters standing around with Halloween masks, very little in the way of scares!

No atmosphere not even that dark.

This is advertised as an 1 hour experience took us 10 mins to go through, there's was 4 of us so this cost £51.

Tickets are not checked as you go in as we just walk in with no one stopping us to ask! This is not a good thing during covid!

I have email them regarding this as well as contacting via social media with no response from them so I will now be forwarded my complaint onto the ASA and trading standards as we as a group feel this was miss sold to us.

Overall, the buildings themselves were fascinating to look at - hence the 3 star review. Due to Covid restrictions there are only self-guided tours available. The problem is that there are interactive audiovisual displays in various cells where the beginning of sentences cut out frequently. Having looked at other recent reviews this has been commented on before but nobody has bothered to fix it. The Block C experience culminates in a ‘SHOW’ which I imagine leads to the description and video projection of ‘the drop’ on the execution room. The sign outside says to wait until the show finishes. We waited… and waited.. and waited. The people who arrived there before us had already been waiting for 15 minutes in excess of our long wait. I called reception from my mobile to alert them that people were waiting (as there aren’t any staff to be seen inside) to be told ‘Oh it mustn’t be working - don’t bother waiting as nobody will be coming down to you!’ We all left in disgust planning to ask for at least a partial refund. The staff, having obviously got wind of disgruntled visitors were nowhere to be seen! Shocking customer service - they clearly know that the audio visual displays aren’t working correctly if at all and can’t be arsed to fix them or warn people when they arrive that they won’t get the experience they are about to fork out for.

The tour is self guided but there are information points at all points and interest including a couple of excellent holograms.
The only section which didn't have this information was the execution room, I think one was automatically suppose to come on but perhaps the sensors were faulty.
All in all though it was a really informative and enjoyable tour. We took about 80 minutes to get around but they could be longer/shorter depending on how many of the information points you access and spend time on.
Kilmainham Gaol though is still the best gaol tour in Ireland.

Self-guided tour of the prison, very well presented with interactive ‘guides’ as you progress through the cell block.

Quite an extraordinary place to visit, the walk through the Condemned Cell and Execution Cell has remained with me still (you can avoid this part if needed).

The videos in many of the areas were short, fun and factual, some a little ghostly but all of them were top quality in delivery. The staff were really friendly, starting with Matthew, who give us a warm welcome and guided us to opening video. The changes are phenomenal and well worth the return visit. I wish I’d left the car behind and enjoyed a pint in the new bar. We enjoyed a sumptuous roast dinner and the staff were attentive and friendly, thank you Wayne and Aoife for great service.

It may have been a good idea to allow individuals to peer into one of the other wings without having to enter (lots of other experiences do this) to see how it has naturally declined over time.

I personally was not a fan of the mannequins they had in many of the cells - it felt really false and detracted away from the experience. Felt a bit Madame Tussaudy.

On my journey there, I walked through the Lower Shankill area which was an eye opening experience in itself.

The prison opened in 1846 and closed in 1996. It is apparently modelled on HMP Pentonville and one can only assume it to have been a grim experience as an inmate.

Seventeen prisoners were executed at the gaol over the years and the former grave of one of them can be viewed.

From the early Seventies, the prison population expanded greatly due to the ‘Troubles’,

Famous prisoners included Eamon De Valera, Rev Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness.

I paid the concessional rate of £10 including £1 booking fee online in advance of my visit.

The logistics of this don’t work as we ended up queuing for ages waiting for other people to finish watching videos - I also don’t go out to visitor attractions to watch videos, I can do that at home.

We really missed having a guide as it made for a far more interactive and informative experience.

The tour was self-guided with videos instead of live guides due to COVID. You had to pre-book a time slot but we arrived 45 minutes early and were surprised that we were allowed to go straight in. Crowding in some of the smaller rooms and cells was an issue, as people are not prepared to pay any attention to social distancing rules. We really enjoyed it, but at times had to skip on past some rooms due to the large number of people inside, with more people packing in, paying no attention to the number already inside. Perhaps they could consider limiting the number of people and staggering entry times further. We visited on a Tuesday and would have loved to try Cuffs Bar but unfortunately it was closed.

A group of about 10 of us were told go in to watch an introduction video first before the self guided tour, and didn’t know if we were to stay in there or come out when it finished. As a result of being put in a group, we all then started the tour together which was a disaster because there is 2 tiny rooms (holding cells) with TVs showing 4 different videos about the history of the jail in each room. And then before myself and my friend had finished watching these videos, the next group were out from watching the introduction video coming into the tiny room. The most informative part of the jail was a carton like video about the history of the troubles in the north, but this again was shown in a small cell that was full. There is no warning sign on a moving bookcase that closed on top of me while I was watching a video in the last part of the jail.
There is no member of staff throughout the jail, or outside the jail in the yard. The map is vital, as signage is limited outside. We were at the jail about 3 o clock and The toilets were not cleaned that day, maybe longer, and the sanitary bins were overflowing. The lack of cleaning is not acceptable at any time but definitely not during Covid and when it is 28’C.

618a2fa06fe3f9d3e44091e1,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"This was a fantastic addition to the must see places to go in Belfast. Although this attraction has been there for a while they sensibly used their time in lockdown to revamp it and make it even better. Each room you visit now has sensors instead of having to use annoying headphones. There are also lots of well written information boards to read. These are very interesting and not stuffy at all. Lots to read and see so you need at least two hours to do it all justice. The jailer hologram is fantastic. The only thing I did not like was the video about the Troubles. This is in the main gaol part of the visit and is done in cartoon format which I don't think is appropriate at all, especially some of the rather flippant comments. I found that rather shocking. Everything else was superbly done and well thought out. Many thanks for a very interesting and informative visit. Will recommend!

I visited in June 2021 so as COVID restrictions were lifting. I booked my ticket in advance online easily enough the day before. Post-lockdown the tour is now self-directed with a ton of videos to watch instead of a tour guide. For me, it just wasn’t that interesting as I had thought it might be.

The information wasn’t delivered in a particularly interactive way and it was hard to imagine what the prison might’ve been like when it was in action. Hopefully they can bring back the guided tours in the future.

If you would still like to visit, do set aside 60-90 minutes. Though personally I would skip it if you haven’t yet fine Belfast’s other main sites first. There are toilets and a small café inside.

618a2fa06fe3f9d3e44091e3,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,3.0,"Average visit. No tour guide, as all done with videos to watch, which where quite informative.
Only a very small section of the building open to see, just the ""circle"" and the lowest floor on one of the smaller C wing.
Most interesting section was the condemned prisonier cell, with a surprise twist.
No access to upper floors to appreciate the scale, nor the the special areas of D wing.
Also very little reference to modern day regime, such as education, employment, etc.
Having visited Shepton Mallet prison experience, this wasn't nearly as good.

In conclusion, driving thro the security gate into the car park was one of best bits, but shouldn't have been!

Luckily for us they allowed us to change to the day previous. Thanks. The tour itself is self guided which is fine. The route you take is well designed and easy to follow. From the video introduction right the way through the gaol to the courtyards of each ""wing"". Some interesting artefacts on show and you do get to enter some cells and experience what it would be like to be an inmate. What we found most disturbing , but at the same time a necessary part of the ""story"",,,, was the condemned mans cell. This included the final steps into the execution chamber. I won't spoil the visit by relating this part , suffice to say we did nearly jump out of our skins. It also has a nice wee cafe & the obligatory gift shop. at the end of the tour.

It is slightly overbearing as perhaps any gaol tour would be. There is a chunk to read about before the tour starts proper in the initial room then you follow the arrows to each screen where there is more information to learn (i visited during COVID 19 so maybe when normality returns there will be real people giving the tour). The hangmans noose remains there just to put it in perspective. Enjoy the tour.,Oct 2020

Unfortunately this means that you cannot ask any questions or really get a feel for life inside the prison.
I have done the tour previously and the best bit was the element of surprise from the condemned mans cell but this has now been lost by the non emotive monotone video before going into the room. It’s a shame that they couldn’t have a more interactive version of a tour somehow or even got ex prisoners to feature in the videos maybe?!?

618a2fa76fe3f9d3e44091f3,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,4.0,"This is one of those attractions, a bit like The Troubles Tour, that you really should do when you're in Belfast. It might be a bit darker than something like the Titanic Experience but it's every bit as important in the city's history.

When we went Covid restrictions were in place and the tour was done virtually. You moved from place to place following arrows on the floor and listened to audio or watched videos that explained the history of the place.

At the end of the day it was a prison so the history isn't going to involve to many laugh out load moments but it done respectfully and tastefully. Walking through the execution room and looking at the noose was a bit unnerving. I won't ruin it for you but it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up when you realise how close the condemned person was to where they met their end.

The virtual tour took about 45 minutes. I don't know if to would take the same amount of time under normal circumstances.

It's a bit of a walk out of the centre. We were staying centrally and Google maps estimated a 30 minute walk. I don't mind a good stroll but it was pouring down so we got an Uber which took about 10 minutes and cost £7.00. It was still raining when we came out so we got one back as well.

If you're looking for something interesting to do that doesn't take all day then I would definitely recommend this.

Everything seemed rushed and after the first video we were constantly playing catch up. I didn't get a lot of information and everyone was quite loud so even the videos we did catch, we couldn't here.

The tour covered how the Gaol was designed and built through to the history of many of the inmates throughout the time it was open.
The visit would be good for all ages to enjoy although I feel a little harder for people with mobility problems as visiting such areas as the tunnel through to the courts might be a little challenging.

The COVID tour is basically a series of TV screens and speakers that guide you through the jail. It is a very good tour, actually. It is easy to follow and is very informative. There are also information panels outside cells etc with some extra information.

It also has quite a few things related to the troubles such as a video showing it though the years in the prison and some more artifacts. The execution room was very interesting, giving lots of details on certain prisoners who have an extensive crime history. There is also a small museum showing people who have escaped and things made inside the prison. Not much after the execution room but there are a couple of military vehicles outside from the 70's during the troubles, including s military truck for carrying soldiers and a transport helicopter that some family members even recognize from the 70's.

While the self directed tour is of a high quality with lots of exhibits and information videos, it doesn't provide the same informational quality of a guided tour.",Jul 2020
618a2fd66fe3f9d3e4409222,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"This is definitely worth a visit if in the area it really shows a good video on the tour into the troubles.
There is that weird feeling when in there at times as 17 people were executed in the jail.

618a2fdb6fe3f9d3e4409226,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"Excellent opportunity to visit this famous gaol, heavily involved during the uprisings. Due to Covid this has now been set up so you can easily walk around with self distancing and TV monitors set up at strategic points giving information for you, as against a personal guide. There are display areas when you first go in, giving time period details and pictures of who served time in the gaol, or possibly hung. Moving through you enter C Wing where you can see the landings where prisoners were kept. There is also the noose area for those unfortunate to have been hung. You can go down and see the tunnel where prisoners were held coming too and from the Court, which was directly opposite the prison, but now shut down. Up to 400 prisoners could be held there at times in awful conditions. The guided tour takes you outside to the wall where the unmarked graves of prisoners is located and then back to the entrance where there is a small cafe serving excellent coffee and snacks. There is also a small gift shop with mainly books relating to Belfast history. Well worth a visit and anybody who used to watch the uprisings on the TV will have heard of this famous Crumlin Prison. You can then continue your trail to the Shanklin Road and Falls Road.

618a2fdc6fe3f9d3e4409229,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,1.0,"Crumlin Road Gaol was closed due to Coronavirus at the time of my pre-purchased ticket. A long story short... Crumlin Road Gaol refused to provide a refund even though they were not open. If I had been unable to show up at Crumlin Road Gaol on the date and time of my booking, I would have forfeited my purchase cost. Yet, Crumlin Road Gaol wants to ignore their obligation to provide the contracted service, refuse a refund, and instead want to re-book my visit. I am an international traveler and have no idea when I might be able to visit Northern Ireland and/or Crumlin Road Gaol. I think it worth noting that all other attractions I had pre-booked in Ireland and Northern Ireland, with similar date/time constraints or were non-refundable, DID provide refunds upon request.

We learnt so much and found the tour very interesting. The only issue we felt was the size of the tour, 45 + people, was just too large. Georgia coped very well but once we were outside we couldn’t hear a word she said so totally missed the last 10 mins or so. This was obviously not her fault but we all felt that perhaps tour numbers should be capped. Admission prices were very reasonable and facilities were good.

The tour was very interesting (a bit cold in winter so wrap up). They could improve the tour a little by including a few extras ...like perhaps an enactment of a new committal in the reception area. However, the tour still very interesting.

We followed this up with 2 courses in Cuffs. We were really impressed with the standard of food offered. The prices were good for comparable food quality and presentation. We have returned several times to the restaurant and haven't been disappointed. One minor complaint (nit-picking) - during the last visit it was very windy and the 2 doors caused a through draught ...perhaps could close one door during high winds.
Would happily recommend tour and restaurant.

There was no sensationalism but the facts spoke for them self. This should be made a compulsory visit to all senior school students as a lesson in not repeating the horrors of the past.

We went back to the gaol for a bowl of stew and a pint of Guinness then took a tour of the gaol delivered by Margaret who was very knowledgeable of the working of the gaol of the years. I would highly recommend this tour to others but make sure you dress accordingly for the weather as a great portion of the tour is outside walking through the Shankill and Falls.

Coming from the republic, I was weary after seeing some comments about tour guides having a biased point of view but this was absolutely not the case.
I left the tour with a lot of new info about the gaol and Grace was even very knowledgeable about the courthouse which is not included in the tour.
Grace revealed the execution room (I won’t spoilt it) in a way that left the whole group gasping. Both the inside and courtyard of the gaol were full of stories and interesting facts. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family .

They now offer a guided tour of The Troubles and host weddings. On my tour we came upon a group of young, costumed people in the halls who were participating in some sort of silly wrestling match. The ridiculous mannequins in place of past guards and prisoners introduce an inadvertent note of levity to the Victorian horrors endured by past prisoners, in that it starts to resemble a low rent wax figure museum, but the sad, condemned prisoner cell with its ominous, secret hanging room resolves that. Past prisoners included political figures from The Troubles, ordinary thieves, women and children. During the Famine people committed crimes in order to obtain the meagre meals being offered and avoid starvation. I think they need to remove the mannequins as the stories being offered by the excellent tour guides and the desolate cells and tunnels are enough to evoke the period. It was one of the stops on the Hop On Hop Off bus tour I took.

618a304d6fe3f9d3e4409299,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"Brilliant tour of Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast, this morning. Last time I was here it was closed and being readied for tourism.

The Gaol has a long and violent history.

Opening in 1845 it has housed murderers, suffragettes, loyalist and republican prisoners- women and children. It has witnessed births, deaths and marriages, floggings and escapes.

It was a depot for transportation to Australia.

There were hangings. The last in 1961. The death penalty was only officially written out of law in Northern Ireland when the Good Friday Peace Agreement became part of Legislation in 1998

There were hunger strikes.

It is built in the Pentonville style, that is meant to rehabilitate, like our very own Beechworth or Freemantle.

What happened in reality was a very different thing. Overcrowding, dirty protests, blanket protests, hunger strikes, tension between Republican and Loyalist prisoners. The tinder box atmosphere that the Guards worked in- or contributed to through their own violence and bias made for a brutal place.

There was a tunnel built under the road that meant prisoners were led from the Court House to the Gaol. It was only 5 1/2 feet under the road. It needed to be reinforced with cement to prevent it being blown open for escape attempts.

It is a foreboding

It was a brilliant tour.

If you are in Belfast don’t miss it. It is quite possibly the
best Gaol tour I’ve been on- and I’ve been on a lot!

The tour guide Claire, was extraordinary.

This is one that you should definately do!! Harry (our guide) was really friendly, very knowledgable and we also learnt how a lot of words have ended up in our language.

The prison itself is quite eerie and if you knew what was in store for you if caught committing a crime, you'd certainly think twice before doing it. Hard to believe it was still functioning during the 90s before closing in 1996.

She explained at great length the history of the gaol and we were able to visit the tunnel linking the gaol with the Court House opposite.

618a30706fe3f9d3e44092bd,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"This is a very chilling but well worthwhile tour. Our tour guide, Grace, was knowledgeable and entertaining. You get to go into the cells on the prison wings, the underground tunnel to the courthouse and the gallows room - its incredibly atmospheric and all the more unsettling as it was still a functioning prison until relatively recently. Ian Paisley, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness all spent time there.

Its on the hop on/off bus routes and very close to the iconic wall murals and the (sadly still there) peace walls dividing the nationalist and republican areas.

Definitely worth a visit - mid week is quieter than the weekends

The guided tour was excellent (can't remember the guide's name - lady in her 20s with long red hair) and it was interesting to see the jail , one of its wings and the cells. The atmosphere in the execution room complete with noose, lever and (glass covered) trapdoor was really haunting and when we realised it was the anniversary of one of the executions that just turned it up another notch!
We had a reasonably priced cuppa in the cafe as well which had a good selection of items.

Our guide Claire was a gem, 90 minutes of fascinating, humorous and serious insights from her into the gaol's grim and gripping past. Not for the faint hearted at times, you get a visit into the condemned cell and gallows chamber, but worth every penny of the admission fee. Thank you Claire and thank you Crumlin!",Jan 2020

618a30876fe3f9d3e44092d7,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,4.0,The guide started off nervously and spoke a little too fast but as the tour progressed she got better and funnier and was full of quirky stories. Like they have on HMS Caroline the daily sounds of clinking keys and doors slamming of an old Victorian prison and voices of prisoners and the calls of the warders would add a lot more to the ambience of this truly fantastic addition to the NI tourist portfolio. Very busy on a Saturday. Great to see so many inbound tourists at this time of the year and a few locals as well. The hangman’s noose is very scarey.,Jan 2020

Claire, our guide, was very informative and interesting, bringing to life the horrors of life in the gaol. We found the more recent history particularly interesting.

618a30876fe3f9d3e44092dc,UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"This formidable prison, originally built to house around 300 or so men, women, and children as young as 7 in the mid-1800’s, held as many as 1600 prisoners on any day in the 1970s and 1980s during “The Troubles”, as they call it here. Tours run every half hour, and it’s the only way you get to see inside. Our guide was excellent, and I was struck by her acknowledgement that some people on the tour may have had friends or relatives held here, awaiting trial, serving a sentence, or simply detained indefinitely on suspicion of being involved in the conflict on the side of the Loyalists or the Republicans. We were taken to the prisoner reception area, into the tunnel that connected the prison with the now-derelict courthouse across the street, through one wing of the prison, and finally outside to the exercise yard. Life here was brutal and often short, especially in the early days. More prisoners died from disease, punishment that amounted to torture, and suicide, than died on the gallows hidden inside. Only one man successfully escaped this fortress, and while in the lam he petitioned for his case to be reviewed and it was. He was cleared of any wrongdoing and often visits the prison with his children and grandchildren.

Well the place is great , full of interesting things,our guide however wasn't the best , his opening gambit of ""what are you doing today"" was odd ? Visiting here we replied, then he said I've been here for 7 Christmas's I won't be here for the 8th, sort of had us feeling a bit of a nuisance , preventing him from doing the job he really wanted instead of having to take us two around! ..
He continued in his humourless monotone asking if we had any questions then telling us he would tell us that information later ? Very bizarre .
That being said the place itself is a must , get tickets off TripAdvisor the day before you go and you'll save about £4 each it was £16.50 for both of us .

He seemed to enjoy the side so called republican prisoners played in the jail. To give glorification to who he called a lifetime friend ""bik mcfarlane"" who was a mass murderer sentenced to life in 1976 for 5 murders was rubbing salt in the wounds, I think the tours should be done by someone who is totally impartial, in Francis case this is not true.",Dec 2019

We booked our tickets for the tour the day before online and just showed the electronic ticket on our phones to the ticket office at the entrance so no need to worry about printing off tickets.

We travelled by car and found it very easy to find following our satnav directions. At the front of the prison hidden behind the wall is a fairly largish car park accessed via some local side roads off the Crumlin Road. Our guide was excellent giving us the full history of the jail naming some of its famous inmates with some from what I’d consider fairly recent times (1960’s & 70’s) with names I can remember hearing on the news some even making it to the more recent Northern Ireland Assembly following the peace agreement. We were even shown the tunnel under the Crumlin Road which linked the prison to the courthouse opposite which had to be strengthened to cater for the heavier vehicles on the Crumlin Road above and to protect it against any bomb blasts.

The guide was Charlotte who clearly knows the history and very articulate , her tour had humour when it was justified and was a pleasure to hear . Be prepared to see some grim explanation about how it was and I suggest you take some time if in Belfast to visit it’s a must see ,

The tour takes about an hour and involves a bit of a walk and some stairs , this may be a small problem if you are unsteady on your feet and may need to kiss the tunnel

Great experience thank you Crumlin Gaol especially Charlotte our guide

Started with a lovely cup of tea in the onsite cafe. The cafe served teas/coffees and snacks, all at a fair price.

The main tour was conducted by Grace, and she was a font of absolute knowledge concerning all aspects of the jail, from beginning to end.

The highlight for myself was the condemned man cell, and the little surprise that awaited the condemned.

I decided to take my partner this year.
£25.00 for 2.
Well even though our time was 8.30pm we weren't going in until 9.15pm.
We were rushed through like a herd of animals....
Too many people for the staff to try & scare! Not one scare or fright.
Waste of money.

Lasting around 75 minutes, we were led through various areas of the jail which used to serve the population until the 1990s. Built in the 1850s, this imposing building with 4 wings at one point housed up to 1500 prisoners (it was designed to hold 500) and was the execution site for 17 men who were laid to rest in the grounds in unmarked graves (2 have since been exhumed!) The execution chamber was harrowing but the whole tour, including the visit to the underground link tunnel to the Courthouse was definitely worth the visit. Busy so book in advance!!

Being able to walk through the tunnel in the footsteps of thousands of prisoners was a pretty unique experience, knowing that the buses and cars on the Crumlin Road were only 1.5m above!
We heard a good explanation of the how the political prisoners became segregated and it was interesting to hear the background of some of the stories of incidents in the gaol that hit the headlines during the Troubles.
Gary was informative and amusing and coped well with the barrage of questions he received from our group! Well done.

The tour proceeded with Claire proving to be a very entertaining, informative and professional guide, yes some of the tour deals with executions, but the matter of fact way it is delivered is very appropriate. Super tour, the gaol is a short bus run from Belfast city centre.

The is a car park nearby or you can walk there but if you don’t wish to walk, then for a small fee you can catch a road train that goes to and from the museum from near to York Minster.
Covering quite a large area with two big exhibition halls there is a mass of historic locomotives, carriages and wagons to see as well as models and other rail related objects. There are experience style events and other activities within the exhibition and lots of attractions to satisfy both the young and the very old too. So it is about both adventure and nostalgia.
There is also an outdoor area for families to take a break ,there is a playground and space for picnics plus little trips on a miniature railway can also be taken.

Too many cabs and carriage interiors under lit. The worst was the original Rocket explantion boards which were unreadable in the gloom.

I was with someone who was slightly visually impaired and had to give up at 15:30 in the fading autumn light.

LEDs are cheap to run, cool and can be purchased with colour safe non-UV output.

Given it is science museum, one could pass through the whole exhibition and learn very little about the develpment, history and importance of railways. Good technology museums are more than just places full of old stuff.

618a31706fe3f9d3e4409383,UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"We’ve visited the NRM many, many times over the years and today was the first post-covid. What a shame!

Governed by the Science Museum, this place needs some serious investment. Very helpful guys on the information desk in the Great Hall, who agreed with me on the following points:

1. Lots closed. No turntable moving, model railway not running, lots of the engines you used to be able to step into, you now can’t. Assume it’s to prevent gatherings of people. However, we went to Beamish earlier in the week and most was open, including the small houses, so it seems a bit odd…..

2. Saying ‘check the website for what’s on’ is pretty poor. Get some signage up explaining why stuff is closed, so it properly informs.

3. Both cafes are awful. Has the catering been contracted out? Staffed by incredibly young people who aren’t fully trained. Pretentious offerings and massively over priced. Really disappointing to wait 15 mins for a sandwich and another 10 for a coffee to be made.

Just felt a bit ‘meh’ this time when it’s been so brilliant before. Suggest the Science Museum turns it’s gaze north.

If you’re able, go a bit further up the A1 and try the Locomotion museum at Shildon. Brilliant museum.

Anyone who runs anything to do with the public knows that if you feed and water them properly for a decent price they’ll forgive the other, slightly disappointing elements of the trip.

I know it’s a museum and not a restaurant, but for the prices they are punting out for food and drink, you’d at least expect a smile

But the museum was great 😊🙌

618a31766fe3f9d3e440938d,UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"It is a little over thirty years since I last visited the National Railway Museum in York.

Needless to say there had been many changes to the exhibits in that time, for me one of the most interesting was the addition of one of the driving units from a Japanese Shikansen train.
Seeing a Battle of Britain class steam loco in cutaway along the right hand side of the engine was a unique way of looking at a steam loco, very very interesting.

Unfortunately part of the museum was closed off at the time I visited the notice saying that the hall was being used for storage. Hey ho hopefully on my next visit this part of the museum will be open.
It was a fairly quiet visit save for one school party split into various groups, it seemed that every time I went to take a picture of a particular loco or item then was a yellow baseball cap being worn by the children right in the centre of my picture, thus I didn't take that many pictures of the exhibits as perhaps I could have done. Talking of photography, I do wish also that once people have taken 'their' photo they move out of the way so that others like me can get 'our' photos.

I think I'll go back in mid-winter for my next visit (haa haa)

It is well worth the visit, I spent only two hours there but would have spent longer had it not been for catching my return train south. This guarantees that I will have to make a return visit to York.

My thanks to all the very knowedgeable volunteers and salaried staff at the museum

Exhibits are very well displayed and there is sufficient space to be comfortable with distancing and move around without being rushed. We spent three hours and could have stayed longer as the amount of memorabilia etc on display is far more than could be taken in on one visit. Good range of souvenirs to suit all pockets and with donation entry perhaps visitors will feel more inclined to buy a memento. Not impressed with non-returnable charge for lockers and some mention of need to have a £2 and a £1 coin to use this facility in advance would have been helpful.

There's an expensive museum car park, or a much cheaper one a few minutes walk away. The museum itself has several massive display areas that are crammed full of well kept exhibits. It's not possible to go on board most of the trains but there are good viewing areas and lots of information available to read etc. There's also a small model railway exhibit with running trains etc. There's a small (but very good) play area for children albeit most of what's in the museum will also appeal to them! There are some cafe areas and a shop which we didn't have time to use, and toilets which are fine. I hadn't realised how extensive and good this would be so didn't allocate enough time to visiting, but would highly recommend a visit if you are in the area. It's free to get in so repeat visits are straightforward, but I'd recommend at least a few hours!

This is a very good day out, even with the current Covid restrictions. There are so many things to see and everything is carefully laid out and easy to access. There are things for all ages and interests. Some of the engines have cutaways and you can walk through/under others to see how they work. If I had one minor complaint, it would be the need for an app or something you could use to find exhibits as there is so much to see. When walking from the car park, the very last turn before the entrance could do with an extra sign. There were several others and ourselves trying to find where the entrance was. This is not a problem if you approach from the city, just from the carpark. Also very close to the city centre, so it is a short walk, or ride on the noddy train, to get into the shops and other sights.

We paid £10 to park, however I didn't mind as the museum is free entry and the cost goes towards the upkeep of the museum along with any other donations they receive.

There is a section on the more modern trains, including changes in British Rail's service from London to Edinburgh, comparing journey speed, uniforms, wages etc from the 1950s to the 1980s. However my favourite part was looking at the old royal train carriages, as well as seeing what you would get in first class compared to third class.

It just seemed like some locomotives and rolling stock chucked in random places around the site, Due to Covid the majority of trains you could previously go in were blocked off, no mention of this on the website though. So you are essentially looking at a number of random trains with some vague, brief information boards accompanying them.

There is so much to see, it was great to see & have photos with favourite engines such as Mallard, Duchess Of Hamilton & Evening Star once again, but this time I saw other engines I don't think I saw last time, namely Lode Star (a GWR engine) the LMS 2-6-4t tank engine & the GWR diesel rail car which was great too.

Another favourite engine of mine was the SECR (South Eastern & Chatham Railway) D Class No 737 built at Ashford Works, Kent in 1901.

This is a magnificent engine, I liked it so much, I decided to buy the exclusive Dapol OO gauge model in the main shop later on.

I enjoyed my ride on the Mallard simulator again too & the lady on duty that day, was very helpful & friendly, as were all the staff/volunteers we met during our visit.

I enjoyed seeing the Flying Scotsman exhibition too & the Station Hall was very impressive, we had a very nice lunch there, then had a good look around there, again so much to see, you have to spend a whole day at the museum, 1 or 2 hours just wo'nt do.

The small shop in the Great Hall was unfortunately closed, volunteer/staff shortage probably, shame, but I was able to buy plenty of souvenirs in the main shop near the exit, again very helpful & friendly staff in there too.

A very nice day out, all in all.

The only disappointing thing in my personal opinion, was the awful 'streamlined' casing currently defacing 'Duchess of Hamilton.' I know it is prototypical, but both Stanier & Ivatt disapproved, and the casing was removed from the Duchess in 1947.

Cafe good value, scones and clotted cream very good. All food we saw looked good value, better to give money to the cafe inside than a chain cafe on high street.

Engines and railway carriages worth looking, royal coaches a time warp in history, Victoria coaches show the feminine touch. Japanese train makes you realise how big they were. 1930’s engines show how dominant Britain were in engineering in the 20’s and 30’s

618a31a96fe3f9d3e44093e0,UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"We had a good time overall today at the NRM. Our first visit for a few years. Grateful to be able to borrow a wheelchair for our daughter who is currently on crutches, but frustrated to find that several of the ramps were closed which meant that we had to go back against the flow a few times.

We enjoyed the trip on the miniature railway but it was sad to see the area outside looked quite unloved and scruffy today. It's also a shame that the bigger train ride wasn't running.

The biggest disappointment was the children's play area which used to be a must for our children. The 'improvements' to this area mean that it is entirely unsuitable for younger children. The two spider web climbing frames are clearly aimed towards school age children leaving nothing for preschool or toddlers to play on. There was also nothing that would be accessible for children with additional needs. This seems like a missed opportunity to install a play area that is more inclusive and imaginative for a wider range of children to enjoy.

We were sad to see the state of the Station Hall roof which is evidently leaking in many places. It seems like this should be a priority for investment in terms of safeguarding the Collection rather than investment in yet another 'Wonderlab' experience.

It is also a shame that the workshop area is now closed to the public as this was a great way to observe railway preservation in progress. We will be back as the NRM is a great place to visit for all things train related but please don't lose the 'living' aspects of this great attraction.

618a31ae6fe3f9d3e44093e2,UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"Big spacious areas with fantastic trains. Highlight was seeing the bullet train and the Mallard (fastest steam engine).

I enjoyed the history of railway nationalisation and privatisation, but sad that the section wasn’t that large.

Nice section showing the different trains and royal train carriages. I preferred seeing the section next to it, showing the evolution of passenger train services.

The restaurant in this section was a nice experience. Further down the platform are large tables and saw families who had brought down their own packed lunches.

There was a train cut in half showing how the steam engine worked, but felt without a tour guide, you didn’t get a lot of the understanding of how exactly it worked.

There was a paid virtual experience for the Mallard. It’s worth £3 a ticket, but I wouldn’t say it was as thrilling as I expected. A short 5 minute video with the virtual machine shaking and jolting.

The shop wasn’t exciting as I hoped for. And I didn’t buy anything in the end.

It was a solid experience. 2-3 hours would be enough for most people.

I am always impressed by the condition of the locos, rolling stock and items on display.

However, I do feel the museum could be a lot more interactive and hands on with exhibits.

It could also do with reintroducing certain things, such as the train rides out in the south yard, this area appears to have become a bit abandoned.

It was disappointing that the workshops and viewing platform were closed, as this a significant part of the museum! The shop in the great hall, which offers different products than the main shop, was closed for a good few hours in the afternoon.

The arrangement of the exhibits was also nonsensical and random. Grouping trains in some sort of order to show how trains and the railways have evolved would make more sense.

As a railway employee, I did find the new railway heroes exhibition a nice touch.

Overall an okay visit and good for a couple of hours, but is missing the wow factor to be “THE” official railway museum

We saw all the logos on the trains and how varied each one was and the trains from other countries like Japan. It also gave us an insight into how the railways helped in World War 2 with ambulance trains etc . Our boys in particular came away with a better understanding and enjoyed themselves, our 19 year old daughter joined in but wasnt as enthusiastic about it , our only regret is that the interactive things werent operating unless we paid extra for them, but we will do it again on our next visit if we are lucky enough to come again.

The exhibits showed the progress of the railways through time and were in excellent condition and easily viewed.
We cannot praise the staff enough; they were so friendly and helpful especially with accessibility.

I know nothing about trains, but really enjoyed wandering around some impressive specimens from Stephenson's Rocket, Queen Victoria's carriage and the Mallard to the BR Intercity 125 of my childhood and the more modern Japanese bullet train and the Eurostar.

On previous visits we were allowed to climb aboard some of the carriages, but this is obviously not currently allowed due to Covid.

There is parking nearby. We'd arrived using the Park and Ride and it was a 10-15 walk from the historic centre of York. We also noticed a little road train from near the minster to take people here.

Only disappointment was that activities such as the miniature railway and mallard experience are not part of the online booking process so I wasn’t even aware that they were available until we got there at which point they were of course all sold out. This should have been clearer on the website/booking process. Also due to covid you can’t get on any of the trains. Mainly went for my son so he was a bit disappointed. We’re not from the area so a bit of a missed opportunity because we’re not going to travel 5 hours just to see the railway museum.,Aug 2021

618a31ce6fe3f9d3e4409415,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"I’m not a railway buff of any description but could not fail to be impressed by the sheer scale of this museum. As if one large hangar containing passenger trains from the Victorian and Edwardian eras complete with baggage trucks, platform ticket machines and weighing scales not to mention Queen Mary’s regal carriages, were not enough there is then the Great Hall. This is nothing less than a history of resins from two replicas of Stephenson’s. Rocket to Mallard, Eurostar and even a Japanese bullet train. Many engines are situated around a giant turntable. Exhibitions such as a history of British rail, a first floor art gallery, maps and posters, cafes, some recreating those on station platforms and a bookshop too.

The trains look much more striking when you are at ground rather than platform level.
All undercover a great all year attraction however the heat on a summers day seemed to be amplified by the train sheds.
It’s a good idea to book a time slot online. This is a free attraction but discretionary donations are encouraged. However you may wish to use the cafes and gift shop and show your appreciation that way.
All those working on site and on the Road train were helpful whilst carrying out their tasks in a professional manner.
If you are a real fan of the railways this is a must. Your visit length will be decided by your interest not by any restrictions put on by the venue.
If you wish to enhance your visit catch the Road Train near the Cathedral.
At time of writing this was £3 per person.

There are numerous interactive exhibits temporarily closed due to covid. It is a large and engaging museum and I had a delicious cream tea on the ‘Brief Encounter’ platform. The royal trains, the Bullet train and the Mallard are but a few of the sights. There is a flat rate of £10 to park your car and a car park token to be purchased inside. Free tickets to book online. This is the cheapest car park in York and closes around 6pm. So we benefit and so does the museum. If you finish early at the museum, you can leave your car and pop into the centre. There are plenty of hand sanitisers as you walk around the museum. I also noticed several staff members cleaning the handrails through out our visit. Parts of site were closed and interact parts too, however this is due to covid and did not detract from our visit. I hope to return to see their new exhibition opening shortly, the Trans-Siberia railway. It is a lovely day out for those that have an interest in trains and even those that do not!

Took our 4 and 7 year olds who were really excited to go on some trains, but literally none of the trains were accessible. All you could do was look at them, which for young children isn't very exciting. Mine were bored after we'd looked at the first few as there was nothing to interact with. There is the miniature train outside but that was already fully booked and the Mallard experience, also fully booked. The Learning Zone plus the viewing gallery to see the trains outside was also closed. We lasted about an hour before we gave up.

618a31db6fe3f9d3e4409430,UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"The current pre-booking of entry times is understandable but if visitors are allowed to enter up to 4pm they should be allowed at least 2 hours to enjoy the exhibits etc, ideally longer. So they could either stay open until 6pm or stop 'selling' tickets earlier in the day. The car park is convenient but £10 for a few hours is a lot, but at least it funds the museum. Visitors are now encouraged to donate when booking online although there are plenty of other ways to donate when you get there. If buying the kids guide there are 10% off vouchers to use in the cafe and shop so worth buying this before you visit these other outlets. Some exhibits had covid restrictions still so could not enter them, even with a mask on. Seems strange when we can enter actual trains with masks on at this time. Best tips are to allow at least 3 hours to visit fully and if you get a morning slot, leave your car in the car park and get the land train into the city centre to explore other places in York. At weekends special afternoon teas etc are available in one of the exhibits.

There are LOTS of trains to see, spread across two massive halls, plus another large room with smaller exhibits. I thought my 4 and 6 year old might have been a little bored, but there was plenty for them to see and do. They especially liked seeing the underside of a train, and the miniature railway, as well as being able to look into lots of different carriages. It was a shame that some exhibits were closed, but I totally understand that they have to abide by covid restrictions.
The guidebooks were well worth getting. The one for older kids was brill for my 6 year old (though older kids could definitely get a lot of mileage out if it), and the sticker book was great for my 4 year old.

Looking inside the royal carriages
Understanding the importance of the railways in terms of goods transportation -the milk and fish carriages were a first for me!
The exhibition on the Eurostar with the tunnel surrounding it as this gave you a real impression of how it travels under the channel and the sheer size of the uncle circumference.

618a31f46fe3f9d3e4409458,UK,National Railway Museum,1.0,"Really disappointed in my return visit to the museum. Yes I know it's free entry but what a disappointment. Compared to my last visit many years ago the quality has dropped right off. There were too few engines on display. Yes I know the current restrictions are a pain but nevertheless there was far too much space that could have been better utilised. As regards the food and drink. What a rip off. Prices far too high and very limited selection. the tea in the carriage hall was served in proper cups but was like warm at best and as for shutting at 3:00 when the museum was open for another 2 hours. What a missed opportunity. The tea room carriage was closed as well again another missed opportunity. Overall very poor.

618a31f46fe3f9d3e4409459,UK,National Railway Museum,2.0,"We travelled from Norfolk for our second visit to the museum. Our last visit was 10 years ago. The museum itself is fantastic. The locomotives and rolling stock are all fantastic and well displayed, however, this trip was a total letdown due to the lack of staff in the museum and most bits closed.

First, we qued for some time to get coffee and cake for our party of 5, the poor woman was rushed off her feet and was struggling all on her own. We paid and walked to the table only to find no butter for our scones, napkins, spoons, knives, and plates. It took some time to eventually speak to someone and get these items. We were told there was a conference on that is why service was slow!! I don't understand why we have to ask for everything?

We travelled to the Great Hall and walked through the locomotives and headed for the North Shed, but found that closed due to lack of staff! So we walked to try out the Mallard Experience only to be told that it was fully booked for today! No notice to say this. We went to the cafe next door and watched for 45 minutes, nobody came to use the simulator and the woman sat doing nothing!! We could have easily had our 5-minute experience with time to spare!

The shop in the Grand Hall was closed so we could not look at the model railway stuff for sale!! Altogether a very long disappointing trip!

Some of the exhibits were closed due to C19. Really enjoyed it all. Snacks in the cafe were stupidly expensive - £3 for a flap jack - take your own snacks and lunch. Nice coffee though.,Jun 2021
618a31f96fe3f9d3e440945b,UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"I love this place, and was aware that the Flying Scotsman was out and about. Fine

However to discover the main exhibit hall with the 1 Million plus items was closed due to Covid 19 restricts, was a HUGE blow. No signs in the hall, nothing on the web site.

Shame on the management for not warning people of the closure

10/10 or opening.

PS
I hear the building of an education centre may cause future closures ...

618a31f96fe3f9d3e440945d,UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"Been before...felt this time was such a disappointment! Exhibits are fantastic...but covid regs make them no fun for kids.
Unable to access coaches or cabs....kids got bored quickly.
Good points...quick entry with online booking ticket. Very friendly entrance staff. Cafe and gift shop seemed very good.
Bad points. Mallard experience...no one at it..kids wanted a go....host unable to let them on as it was booked all day! Really ?
Same with miniature train....couldn't just go on with no one in the queue...need to book tickets !
Some exhibits need to be put in more accessible positions.....felt some were just there to fill a space.
Outside area very bare...weeding and tidy up needed...and perhaps put some exhibits outside ?
I was disappointed....but know they have big plans....plus the covid regs...I will give this another chance.

618a31fa6fe3f9d3e440945f,UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"This shouldn’t be free! I guess they must get enough from donations but with the size of the place and the number of exhibits I think it should have an entrance fee.

We went as a family with young kids and it was excellent. We only had an hour and were late in the day so couldn’t get the train ride etc but it didn’t impact on the enjoyment.

Kids had a great time as did the adults.

Loved the Bullet train! And the ww2 history

The museum was jam packed with old trains and information to digest, it was so interesting to look at them all, pre covid you could even look inside the trains unfortunately we was unable to do this but you could still get a pretty good view of everything from the windows. We had a quick stop at the cafe for some coffee and cake whilst we digested what we saw the service and food was amazing .

It was also nice to see the old station signs dotted around the walls of the museum as well as old posters for rowntrees products. I still cant believe this attraction is completely free! Spent a good 3 hours here, would’ve been even more if the other areas were open.

The need to book in advance and Covid distancing in place is very good. It’s a shame you cannot venture inside some carriages like before Covid, but completely understand why. We also did the Mallard experience, not exactly what we expected, but a fun addition to the visit, and it was fully booked on the day we were there, I recommend booking that in advance too. We checked online about the dining car in front of the great hall (forgotten it’s name) and website said it was closed, but it clearly wasn’t as we passed - had we known we would definitely have had afternoon tea here.",May 2021
618a31fa6fe3f9d3e4409462,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"Covid restrictions and the need to book ahead ensured that there were no queues or crowds, allowing access to most of the exhibits, especially the locomotives themselves. It's always a thrill to see them at ground-level and imagine the drama and power of these machines when fully fired up. Although I hate being old, I am grateful for the memories, as a child, of watching these mighty steam trains working in the marshalling yards of East London",Jun 2021

On the plus side at least it was free except for lunch which was very expensive and poor quality - if you do go my advice would be to take your own food. Wouldn’t recommend especially in the current situation and very much doubt if we’ll be returning.",May 2021

618a32006fe3f9d3e4409468,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"My husband and I visited the railway museum on 17 June. Due to Covid you have to book your tickets prior to your visit to control the numbers in the museum. We got tickets for 10.15 am but we’re allowed to enter at 10.00 am as they allow you in up to 30 minutes before the time on your ticket.
It was very well organised and quick by just getting your ticket scanned. Although it’s free to visit they do ask for donations either when you book or do have areas dotted around where you can donate.
The museum is set over 2 main areas (a small 3rd area was closed due to staffing on the day we arrived). They have a great selection of different trains to view and it’s easy to get around and see them all up close and keep a safe distance from other visitors.
You can’t go inside some of the trains due to Covid but you can still see enough.
It was a very informative visit with lots to see.

My only gripe was with the tiny children’s play area that could have more to engage the littlest ones. Something like an area like a ‘go kart track’ for them to push themselves around - on trains obviously. Given the space they have, this could be easily achieved.",Jun 2021
618a32006fe3f9d3e440946b,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,There was no cost but due to COVID you had to book a time entry slot. We arrived on time and friendly staff greeted us and let us enter. Museum is very interesting and nicely laid out. Was interesting seeing the evolvement of trains. There are a couple of coffee shops and a gift shop. Toilets were very clean and there were quite a few. Not sure about where to park as we walked there from our hotel. There was also a kiddies play area. Well worth a visit.,May 2021

On arrival we parked our car (£10 all day) to be greeted by a very friendly and enthusiastic car park attender who pointed us in the direction of the entrance (a few minutes’ walk). I found the whole museum very interesting from the Royal Carriages to the historic rocket and the modern Bullet train. The highlight of the day was viewing a cross section of a steam train and hearing a great explanation from a guide as to how it all works. The museum is free but we did leave a donation. This is definitely one if not the best museum I have visited and I would recommend anyone visiting York to book a slot and come along you will not be disappointed.

We parked at the Leeman Road car park (£10 for the day) which was just a bit too far for him to walk, and I noticed that there is a car park near the entrance, which probably costs a bit more but would have been worth it. The museum is free to enter, and during the pandemic, they request that you book tickets online, where you can choose a time slot, but I will point out that you can only enter 30 minutes earlier than your time slot, which is fair enough. The museum itself is very interesting, and I particularly liked the ground-level exhibition which made me feel that I had stepped back in time and was waiting on a platform for a train. We had a bite to eat in the cafe, and I chose an egg and cress sandwich priced at £4.25 and there was plenty of seating area outside. The museum does ask for a donation, and we were more than happy to contribute. Well worth a visit.

Regrettably the pre booking of food with collection from the food station in the main concourse is a good idea but in practice fails to deliver There is no clear signage advertising as to where the food should be collected and having queued at the food station was met with a blank look from one of the staff members who were overseeing the tills. There were two staff members actually providing service to customers by way of food and beverages with two further staff hugging the tills Bad organisation and service only redeemed by tasty food but avoid the coffee which is abysmal
No doubt the justification for bad service will be the knock on effects of the pandemic which excuse is insulting

Asked to prebook tickets which the system allowed us to do, turned up at the entrance, lights all on, displays all on, door locked. Called three times to get through to the customer line only to be told museum is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, yet system allows you to book. All advertising outside and on booking section says they’re open, yet you have to go elsewhere on web to discover the ‘opening hours’ very misleading and another couple was there with us outside with the same problem.

Clearly NRM are just as good at managing this as they did with Flying Scotsman, paid too much, overspent heavily on the restoration and was years late when finally finished. Perhaps they should try brewery management and oraganising a get together instead!

Love the side rooms with odds and ends of railway paraphenallia that they don't seem to know what to do with.

Would be lovely to see some active restoration on site behind glass. Seeing the machining skills alongside the restored artefacts would doubtless prove inspirational for future engineers.

More opportunity to ride on miniature versions would be welcomed by the younger generations for whom exhibits can be a little static.

Understandably but disappointingly no access was permitted inside train carriages and a number of exhibitions were closed. My son was particularly disappointed that the viewing platform was shut. We had prebooked tickets for the Mallard simulator which was a bit of fun. Again the female member of staff was very welcoming and friendly.

It has several eateries and coffee stops and in an ice cream van.
The museum covers not only the history of the the British train history but features trains from across the world: the Japanese Bullett and a cross section of the channel tunnel.

Covid 19 restrictions: Oct 2020 Currently you have to reserve an arrival time which you can do online. The museum was not bust and felt very safe to attend. The large steam train and the miniature railway are both not running at the moment as is the closing of the model railway. Social distancing is not possible for these exhibits. Where trains in the main hall are close together warning signs are posted that social distancing may not be possible (ie you could meet someone coming the other way). Plenty of hand sanitising stations made the visit feel very safe. A mask must be warn at all times.

The museum is free but the museum asks for a £5 donation. With so much to see and do £5 is a very small donation for such a wonderful living museum.

The world-famous National Railway Museum in York was unveiled to the public in September 1975, opened by the Duke of Edinburgh who was late for the ceremony due to a train catching fire! In fact the Duke of Edinburgh, along with many others, was initially not in favour of the museum being located in York, preferring a more southern location. There was a somewhat backward opinion amongst some in those days, that nobody would travel to visit a museum outside of London!

There had been a very small “collection” of locomotives in existence in London. “Agenoria”, the oldest locomotive in the world, its sister machine, “Stourbridge Lion”, Stephenson’s “Rocket” and “Puffing Billy” had originally been purchased as part of a fledgling collection by the Patent Office Museum in London, which was later known as the Science Museum.

The National Railway Museum that opened in 1975 wasn’t the first railway museum in York, with the original opening in Queen Street in 1925, a facility that lasted for nearly 50 years. Formerly a repair shop located adjacent to the Motive Power Department, when it first opened it wasn’t accessible to the general public, preferring to invite visitors associated with the railway industry only. By the start of 1928 the general public were finally deemed worthy to visit the museum themselves and enjoy such exhibits as the first wooden ticket machine!

Alongside the Queen Street museum, a small collection of items were on display in the old station, finally relocating to Queen Street in 1966. This joined what was known as the department of “British Transport Historical Records”, established in 1955 to facilitate railway related research and an exhibition of royal coaches.

Prior to the railway Nationalisation of 1948, individual railway companies had their own collections of various sizes. Nationalisation saw the beginning of the process of centralisation, although York wasn’t an initial choice of location. There was the Transport Museum in Glasgow, the Great Western Railway museum in Swindon and what was seen as the “main” repository, the Museum of British Transport, belonging to the Transport Commission in sunny Clapham, in London (where else?) Clapham held the Mallard, fresh from restoration and which drew a few hundred thousand visitors every year.

As the infamous Doctor Beeching wielded his axe, devastating large swaths of Britain’s railway infrastructure, it was also recommended in his report that British Rail, as the Nationalised organisation was called, disposed of all its museums. They were an unwanted expense and should play no part in the future of Britain’s railway structure and organisation.

The 1968 Transport Act decreed that a National Railway Museum would be established in York, as a remote extension of the National Museum of Science and Industry, which itself was located in South Kensington. Some, including the aforementioned Duke of Edinburgh, were aghast at the thought of a national museum being located outside of their beloved capital city. Surely no such project could ever be a success?

The museum in Clapham would close, with its artefacts relocating to York, which would also absorb the entirety of the Queen Street collection. The Transport Act also stated that the new museum would have the undisputed first call on any items deemed redundant from British Rail, at no charge. That was handy!

The National Railway Museum sits on the site of the old York North Engine Shed, originally built by the North Eastern Railway in 1878 and extensively renovated 80 years later in 1958. Later known as the North Motive Power Depot, it boasted four engine turntables, the largest of which having a diameter of over 70 feet and which can still be seen in the museum’s Great Hall today. The centrepiece of which is currently the Inter City 125 engine, 253 001.

Admission to the new museum was (and remains to this day) free, which is always a great incentive! Within 8 weeks of opening the museum had welcomed over half a million visitors, rising to 2 million in the first full year of operations. The popularity of this, the first national museum outside of the countries capital city, stunned many officials in London, who struggled to hide their blushes. No doubt the suitably humbled Duke of Edinburgh hid his blushes on a long carriage ride around the grounds of Sandringham. Who knows?

Today the museum owns over 100 locomotives and more than 300 other items of rolling stock. There is also an incredibly vast collection of other railway-related items of interest. The museum has retained its popularity, with about three quarters of a million visitors each year. In 2015, to mark the museum’s 40th anniversary, Virgin Trains East Coast Locomotive Number 43238 was renamed “National Railway Museum 40 Years 1975–2015”, on the platform at York station. This had previously been called “National Railway Museum – The First Ten Years 1975–1985”. The museum won the European Museum of the Year award in 2001.

When I went you had to book online before hand and pick a time to go. They wanted to control the number of people and at the time I went totally understandable. My only comment is that perhaps some more seating should be available outside for those visitors who are less mobile whilst they wait to enter.

As I was one of the first in I was able to walk around freely and unrushed and able to look at what the museum has to offer. It has changed since I last went and now has some more modern trains as well as some much older ones as well.

Even at rest and with the fires out, the sheer size of a main line locomotive is a thing to behold; they are visceral things that create an emotional response in many cases.

Even with some of the exhibits closed because of the pandemic, and the need to wear a mask, there is so much to see. Mallard, Evening Star, Rocket, Duchess of Hamilton, literally dozens more; all represent British history in a time before this country became impoverished and diminished. There's a range of exhibits from overseas also, to remind us that railways may have been invented in the UK, but marvels were created in many places around the world.

It is huge, with really interesting examples of the history of railway engines and carriages. I loved them all, especially the yellow ""Rocket"". At the moment you cannot go into the trains, because of COVID which is a shame, but was still enough to take up around 3 hours taking photos. I also was able to buy a very interesting book of metro rail systems maps of world cities in the gift shop which I like very much. Hopefully for future holidays when the virus has been defeated!",Sep 2020

Still an interesting walk round the exhibits, most interesting for us were the royal trains. The museum, as expected, has quite a few restrictions due to Covid, so was quite limited in what you could do. Felt safe walking around a 1 way route to see the trains and exhibits. You need to book a slot on-line so just just turn up. Cafe on site and gift shop, neither of which we used.
A must for train fans!

However, it felt rather staid and static and was quite a long 'signposted' walk back and forth between them. There were no outside attractions or activities available nor the land train to the Minster... However, we were glad to attend and donate, helping them to come through these difficult times. I bought an interesting and challenging 1,000 piece jigsaw for Christmas, showing the History of Trains. A useful reminder of a happy morning spent with these old iron work horses.

The gift shop has a good range of pretty decent quality books, souvenirs, toys etc.. I was disappointed, however, with the lack of information to accompany the displays. It would’ve been good to have had some archive video material of the trains, the drivers, the postal workers and even the royals. It wasn’t always clear what we were looking at. Imperial War Museum does a very good job of this, though they don’t have free admission. Admittedly the Covid restrictions might be to blame ... after an hour and a half, the face mask becomes a bit hard to tolerate, so don’t expect to stay very long here!

Brilliant that museums like this are still going due to donations. The parking is a bit steep £10 for the day but they have to make money for the museum so seeing as we didn't pay for tickets we didn't think that was bad plus you can go into City centre etc and leave the car there.",Sep 2020

But in one of the areas there seems to be a lot of signs missing, so although we could be impressed with the locomotives we did not know what we was looking at. We think this might have been down to them closing some parts between trains because they are to narrow to social distance, but would have been nice if they moved the signs.",Aug 2020

It’s such a pain to wear a mask around the whole massive gaff the whole time when you can go to a pub and carry on with gay abandon without one. Not their fault I note and more a Boris bumbling.

The exhibits were interesting with a number of steam engines, a hst loco, the mallard and a few other modern day classics in the collection. Bit of a shame though that a lot of stuff was sealed off still for the sake of nutty children who don’t know their class 87s from a 4 triple sub for fear of super spreading.

The cafe was also pretty poor, but I didn't really mind paying the inflated prices if it helps maintain the museum.

The approach on foot to the museum is through a grotty tunnel smelling of wee with broken glass not a very pleasant start.

We decided to try to get something to eat first so went to cafe in the great hall, 2 sandwiches and 2 cans of coke nearby £15 No Way!! we put it back and decided not to eat.
Shame reasonably priced food would sell well, when I questioned price I was told well the museum is free, not the point.
Inside is an interesting collection but the great hall I didn't feel was that great it's missing something and felt a little worn out and dated.
The rocket is an example as it's kind of stuffed in a side room surrounded by white walls that really to show it to it's full glory, wasted opportunity could be a really fantastic display with a bit more thought and input.

The other cafe in the main hall was open but the hygiene standards flew in the face of all the advice. The table tops were crumb covered and bins overflowing.

The queue of only a few people took ages to be served and the prices would make Betty herself blush. Thank goodness it was half price.

The interpretation needs updating. There are some stunning locos in there but several have non-existant or hard to locate labelling. The significance of the pieces isn't always clear.

Again, I fail to see why a one way visit of the Shinkansen wasn't available. If I can survive 2,5 hrs in a train from London to get here, I can survive 2mins in a display train.

The history of railways in Britain, which was pretty well displayed, ends in the 1990s. Twenty years have passed in the meantime.

If you're visiting York and love machines, then you absolutely must go, but maybe adjust your expectations.

618a32746fe3f9d3e4409522,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"If you love trains, this is a must visit place in York. The museum was very close to the York train station and was easy to locate. We drove down to York from Leeds and we found a convenient car park right next to the train station. The weather was pretty cold and we chose to visit this place after a nice warm lunch.

There is no entry fee for visiting this place. There is however a voluntary donation box at the entrance (atleast 10 boxes) and volunteers were all over there asking for donation. I did pay a donation as I love trains and I thought it’s fair to pay for maintaining this place.

Wow... we went starting to the hall where the old trains were parked. Huge... huge... just awesome. Unbelievable to see the huge machines that you normally see in movies.

We spent a good two hours visiting the different exhibits. We missed the virtual train experience by just couple of minutes. So if you are visiting this place towards evening then please do cover the virtual experience first before you start enjoying the exhibits.

618a327a6fe3f9d3e440952f,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"The National collection of railway items is vast and far too big to do justice to on a single visit. There is a walkway from the station, but it is not well signposted. The museum has some lockers if you want a quick visit while waiting for a train and don't want to cart your bag around, but these are not well signposted at the entrance.
Big ticket items are the main attraction. The present temporary exhibit on WW1 ambulance trains is well handled, but I notice the positions of some of the photos and explanations may be difficult to read for both the young and old.
The various carriages from the royal trains over time are well displayed, but could have explanation cars on both sides rather than just one side as at present. Also, the surrounding exhibits lack logic to support the overall theme of this 'hall'.
Japanese bullet train is looking tired, and there is no reference to recent upgrades in rolling stock across the world.
A section on railways for the future, including the HS2 controversy might help make this a forward thinking rather than backward looking attraction. Also, nothing on Beeching and the cuts to railways and their recent dramatic growth in passenger numbers.
Railways are part of the future as well as the past and this collection needs to make that clear.

What an amazing Collection of trains through the ages you could spend hours in there and still not cover everything.
Lots of the trains you could view the interior some you could stand on the foot plate - every child’s dream!
The were a couple of cafes serving drinks and snacks. The toilets were clean. There was a shop selling memorabilia. Signing from the station maybe there but we missed any and had to ask a couple of times and seemed to walk round in circles. Better signing would certainly help especially from York Station.

Some of the exhibits you can actually enter but most are cordoned off. I would have liked to have access to at least one footplate but I never found one. Thousands of artefacts As well as the locomotives themselves. The display locomotives are immaculate and when you visit the repair shops you see how much work goes into restoring them.

There is a tonne of history and beautifully preserved trains for people to walk around and check out. The exhibit is so massive that they actually have 3 massive buildings to house it all.

entrance is free and you get a guide leaflet free. But they ask you for a £5 donation i feel this is an attempt to guilt trip people into paying £5 before they have even seen the museum. there are plenty donation boxes dotted allover the place. and they have all got plenty money in them so obviusly the museum isnt in that much need of the money or it would empty the boxes more often.
The cafe in the great hall is realy over priced i mean £2.70 for a 500ml bottle of coke it's daylight robbery. maybe theyre trying to recreate the great train robbery! My advice is dont let them guilt trip you in to paying £5 donation before you have been in. go around and decide if you would like to make a donation when you are leaving. i gave them some loose change and spent some money in the gift shop.
also disabled parking is free of leeman street but i dont think this gives them the right to charge £10 per car to the ablebodied public. had this been the only carpark available i would have drove off. might i suggest you lower this to £5. as when you go round there are many atractions that you have to pay for steam train rides, miniture railway etc.

They run a road train to/from the museum to near the York Minster, price £3. This trip I found the library, an amazing place to sit and relax (away from the kids running around on the main floor) and read a railway magazine or check out some of the books. There's a few dozen for any taste. I wrote down some titles and found them at Waterstones in London and I figure most would be available somewhere on the Internet.

618a32996fe3f9d3e440955f,UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"I'd been here back in the 70's and remember well the great hall and turntable with the locomotives arranged around. Today it looks just the same but with new engines, better information and a smart cafe area with light snacks and a range of drinks.

The museum is free - with an option to donate if you feel inclined.

Highlights are some of the oldest rolling stock in the world and, if course, uniquely, the Royal carriages. The one used by Edward is my firm favourite; the one used by Elizabeth looks disappointingly spartan.

We spent a good two hours here and, had we had more time, would have spent longer looking at the range of memorabilia and artifacts from a now increasingly distant time.

Thoroughly recommended - even if the thought of steam, diesel and electric doesn't immediately turn you on.

This is a ‘must visit’ if you are in York. The staff are really helpful and very knowledgeable. The displays range from models through Stephenson’s Rocket, a vast array of steam locomotives, carriages, Royal Trains, diesels and electrics. There is even the Japanese Bullet Train. The Mallard is there as well as a simulator so that you can go for a ride on it. Probably the museum with the most impressive display items.
The road train will take you to the museum from York Minster if you don’t want to walk. A small charge for this but it runs every 30 minutes.

The audio tour supports the exhibits well without taking over, you can listen to whichever section you wish, it doesn't dictate your timings as it introduces each item/area without being the main source of information. The staff in the museum itself are knowledgeable, approachable and proactively interact with guests without intruding. The amount of information is astonishing and is displayed in a interesting and varied way (without being gimmicky). The cafe being part way round the attraction rather than at the end works really well and we had some lovely sandwiches and coffee. I would strongly recommend this attraction to anyone interested in history.

Not too crowded but too many not masked or half masked. That was disappointing. Since it wasn’t crowded, we distanced from them. Audio tour was very good. Let us move at our own pace. We didn’t spend much time in the portion of the tour that was the Churchill museum.

One observation: it would have helped us understand the Blitz more to have included a section about the the damage to London and how ordinary citizens survived the Blitz. This exhibit needs context to help younger guests appreciate why being underground was necessary AND how typist lived outside the bunker and still managed to show up for work.

Very interesting to see the conditions that the staff lived in and the displays about Churchill's life and achievements were great.

However, i did have an issue with a couple of things. Firstly, there were far too many people being allowed in. For a place like this you need time and space to be able to see and read everything properly. Sadly many times i felt like i was being forced to move on because i became aware of other people very close behind me. Especially in the churchill exhibition; too many people wandering in too many different directions made it difficult to get to all the exhibits and again i felt rushed.

Maybe a one-way system guiding people round would work much better.

Secondly, the cafe is very small for the size of the museum. I think i was expecting more from the menu as well. Hardly any choice and to be honest i'm not sure this can still be blamed on covid.

Those issues aside it is still definately worth a visit and i would recommend.

One tip our family has for our traveling friends out there: Take a good 3 Hours to see everything.
We went at 4:00pm and regretted not going earlier. It is a very detailed museum and it closes at 6:00pm on the DOT! The employees basically chase you out the door at 6:00!
We thought it quite odd but that's how it is at the Churchill War Rooms.
I wish we would have known how detailed it was and we would have reserved an earlier time slot.

That said it wasn't busy at our scheduled entry time of 10.00am, so we probably wouldn't have had any issues without the booking.
The route through the War Rooms was still affected by Covid measures, so things were a bit out of sequence, but the use of the hand held audio guide made it easy to get the most out of the visit.
The War Rooms provided a fascinating glimpse into such an important part of our National and World history, the people who played a part in it and the environment in which they worked and lived. It was great to see and hear the video accounts of the War Rooms' staff, including the civilians and clerical staff who played an important role in the war effort. Their reflections provided an insight into their lives and their interactions with some of the more prominent figures, including Churchill himself, bringing added reality to these characters and the challenges they faced.
In addition to the War Rooms there is a significant section focused on Churchill from his early and family life, military career, political highs and lows, through to his death and the national reaction to it.
There is a lot to take in throughout both the War Rooms and the Churchill museum, so our visit extended over a couple of hours, by which time it was getting busier, and included a stop off in the cafe and souvenir shop.
Excellent throughout and would highly recommend to others.

The audio guide (no extra charge) was good.

Although the tour itself was excellent, it was made even better by one of the Guides, whose name I believe was Elias. He was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic and you could tell he just loved to tell people everything he knew (which I won’t spoil here). It was incredibly heartwarming to see someone with such a strong enthusiasm for his field. Really made the entire experience :).

Also a special mention to Peter who explained in great detail the intricacies of the Enigma Machine and who was equally friendly and enthusiastic. Thank You ☺️!

618a32c96fe3f9d3e44095aa,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,I absolutely love the Churchill War Rooms. It's great to be able to access such an important part of history. They recommend 2 hours but we were in there 3! Loads to see and read about. I would caution against taking young children though (as I did the first time I went). They will find it difficult (as there's a lot of reading to do). And in turn the adults will find that frustrating as you will want to take the time to do the reading. Definitely worth a visit.,Aug 2021

This was another place on my ‘post COVID’ list.

The staff were very welcoming and informative and I thoroughly recommend getting the audio guide. Each section gives a great level of detail at every interval.

The war rooms really give you a detailed idea of how London persevered through the war and how essential the underground bunker became during hard times.

The gift shop at the end was full of trinkets, books and memorabilia.

The walkthrough is an informative tour of the makeshift work areas and dormitories of staff with much of the original fixtures and furniture of the time leaving little to the imagination as to what the conditions were like there. The tour includes an audio handset which I found to be very informative and easy to use. The museum has many exhibits including Churchill's letters, books, medals, and more including some items of his clothing he was well known for. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit.

The whole thing is set out really well, and even though we went on a Sunday, it was still nice and quiet and you could take your time looking round. At the start you are provided with a little speaker that you type the corresponding number in with the room you are currently in, hold it up to you ear and listen to the facts and information about what you are looking at.

All the rooms are behind doors or glass windows so you can’t actually get right up close but can still see everything.

After the war rooms there is the Churchill Museum - this is the bit I found less interesting as it talks about everything from Churchill being born and his life even before the war. However, there are some good interactive things that you can do such as quizzes and watching videos.

Overall if you are interested in History it is definitely worth a visit. It recommends spending 2 hours to fully experience everything however we left around 1 hour 30 minutes as we felt we had seen it all and had enough.

618a32d06fe3f9d3e44095b6,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"I pre-booked our tickets online and used the e-ticket on my phone for entry which was straight forward,
Included in the entry is an audio guide which is set up in your language of preference which I think is a great addition, especially for tourists.
The one way system was easy to follow, however I would note that the order of the artefacts isn’t in numerical order. Ie you may jump from 8 to 13 on the audio list. I suspect the introduction of the one way system has led to this being out of sync.
The audio guide really brings the rooms to life and every now and again you can hear the sound of whistling in the corridors so you feel as though you are back in time working underground.
The bathroom facilities were clean and available through the route. There is also a cafe and gift shop which I found surprisingly budget friendly. Some items are expensive but there were a few pocket money friendly items available to purchase as a souvenir.
The whole experience took us around two hours, it is a lot of walking and standing but there’s a few opportunities to take a seat, so make the most of those on your way round.
I think £25 is quite expensive for the price, I was expecting to pay £17 or so, having said that you may find getting an annual membership more cost effective as that would be unlimited entry as well as entry to IWM, IWM Duxford and HMS Belfast (I have a review from a few years ago of my trip to HMS Belfast when I had an annual pass).
This trip is suitable for over 12 as I think young children would find the walking long and the audio guide may not keep them engaged, however this is certainly a family friendly museum. I would recommend this for a day out to friends and family.

So pleased that they have preserved such an important place in our countries history.
While there we stopped off at their cafe for a lunch break which had a limited selection but the quality was good.
Good to see the place that features in many second world war films and where so many decisions that influenced the war were taken and many of Churchill's famous speeches were drafted.

We had booked for the 3 of us to visit the War Rooms on Thursday 15th July, or so we thought. Stupidly we had booked for the following Thursday, as the lady at the reception pointed out when we arrived. No worries she said, I’ll just phone to see if we can make an exception and let you in. Back came the answer of NO. Tell them they can go online and book again for later in the day ( another £68.75 ) or they can drive back from Norwich again next Thursday. What a lovely example of jobsworth money grabbing and a great advert to tourists from everywhere. Yes we messed up but it was an easy situation to rectify and common sense could have prevailed.

618a32dd6fe3f9d3e44095c7,UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,"We have just returned from a 3 day trip to London. The highlight was a booking made to visit the War Rooms on our last day (Friday 11th June). My girlfriend has visited 3 times previously but for me it was a first. I was really looking forward to it especially after her enthusiasm, and whilst my visit wasn't ruined I did feel it was rather spoilt. The premise of the museum is a faithful recreation of Churchills war rooms, as they were, during and at the end of the war. Why then does someone see merit in placing an art exhibition in many of the rooms - mostly in the middle of the viewing glass, thereby obscuring the view especially for photographs. Most pictures were placed on huge wooden easels and one had to peer around then to see into the room - thank goodness it was not busy.
Whilst the curator may feel the importance of displaying art is justified, you must remember what the public are paying for - that is to see the rooms not an art exhibition. There are a number of areas in the museum where art could be displayed and monitored by staff if security is an issue. I feel the whole art display was an oversight on the museums part and it tempered my enjoyment. If I wanted to see pictures there are hundreds of places I could have gone to in London. I enjoyed my visit but feel cheated on the whole experience of the 'war rooms'

However, yesterday ( an October Sunday) I was wandering past - no queue at all. In I went, and had the map room for the glamour boys, Churchill's phone room to the US, and the various other incredible exhibits to myself.

If you live in London, and are in any way interested in Churchill or the second world war, now really is your chance. Either the tourists will return (this is the version I hope for, because all should have access to this), or these exhibition spaces will start to shut down due to lack of funding.

618a33016fe3f9d3e44095ff,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Tucked away underneath the Treasury Building, with its entrance beside the Clive Steps is one of the most fascinating museums in London.

I had not visited the War Rooms for many years, so thought I would take the opportunity to revisit. The Cabinet War Rooms themselves are fascinating but, since my last visit, it has been extended with an extensive exhibition on the life and achievements of Sir Winston Churchill, worthwhile visiting in its own right, with so much to see.

The underground complex of the Cabinet War Rooms was the hidden nerve centre for Churchill and his Cabinet during the Second World War.

Construction began in 1938, including substantial strengthening above against the possibility of being hit in a bombing raid, and the War Rooms came into use in August 1939 before Britain declared war on Germany, being vacated only in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan.

The War Rooms were a self-contained complex of working, operational, dining and sleeping accommodation, and were left as they were when the door was locked in 1945. With the aid of descriptive texts, photographs and figures from the period, you can close your eyes and imagine that you were here during the Second World War. I particularly love the signs which have an informal charm to them, necessitated by circumstances at the time.

Having been opened to the public as a unique piece of our history in 1984, there was the further major expansion in 2005 to include the extensive museum on Sir Winston Churchill with a wide range of things to see including his Nobel Prize, his paintings, uniforms and other personal effects and of course one of his characteristic Havana cigars, plus there is also the original oak door for No 10 Downing Street which was replaced with something more able to withstand a mortar or bomb attack in 1991.

For anyone interested in history, this must be on their 'to do' list.

We had the 1.30 slot and as we walked through, we came across a large backlog of visitors in the room of photos, just before the museum rooms. The backlog of people was because one of the guides spoke at lenghth, not giving any thought to more and more people piling into the room, not being able to move forward. At the end, when he said ""I might have gone on a bit' there were up to 30 people in a room approx 12 x 16ft, giving zero opportunity to social distance. Two other members of staff were standing in a corner chatting to each other, oblivious to what was going on. Please train your staff to set a good example?.

The Churchill experience is enlightening for all levels even if you know quite a lot about the subject and it's presented in a very accessible manner. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours.

Word of warning if you use Google maps to get here is that the verbal directions will take you to a part of the treasury which is next door. This can be somewhat embarrassing. There is only on e toilet also which will mean you need to circulate the entire exhibit if you find you need the facilities mid exhibit.

The museum is essentially in two parts: the first is a tour through the bunker rooms which were used during the war, and the second part, a detailed history of Churchill's life and times. Both parts are interesting in their own respects. As far as the life of Churchill goes, there isn't much I can say that can't be read online, but the war rooms themselves ought to be experienced.

My knowledge of Churchill was limited to his role in WWII, which was my main motivation for visiting this museum, but I was very happy to discover a retrospective of his life that lead to his role as Prime Minister, as well as his post-war life. The ability to experience the War Rooms nearly as they would have been during the war was really very cool! However, be prepared to get caught up in the central room containing the Churchill Museum as there is so much to see. I ran out of time and barely had enough time to purchase my obligatory magnet in the gift shop!",Feb 2020
618a331c6fe3f9d3e440962c,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"One of the coolest things I did while in London. This is a first trip must do.

A few tips for visiting:

1-Buy your ticket online in advance. The lines for buying in person is a very long wait in comparison. You'll have a particular time slot on your ticket--don't get there earlier than it says because they won't let you in line until then.
2-The lines to get in are outdoors so dress warm if it's cold out.

Once we were let in we were led through to get our free audio guides and begin the self guided tour.
The war rooms were found in the 1980's, almost exactly as they were left after the war. I felt transported through history and had chills many times while visiting these historic rooms. It is pretty amazing to see everything in close to it's original state. In addition to the rooms there is a very informative Churchill museum to visit in the space. I learned so much while here and felt like it was one of the most memorable stops I visited during my first trip to London. Don't miss it if you love history.

Even with priority you are staggered but you have a separate line that they take you in before the rest.

The museum was very informative, entry includes audio guides that provide more information than the signs on the display.

A very educational and interesting museum.

You learn a lot from the museum and it is late it in a best, yet unorthodox manner which strengthens the message. You get an audio guide for the tour which is robust and helpful. The exhibits have loads of cool memorabilia from both Churchill's life, like sits, cigars, medals, etc., And from the war such as propaganda posters from Germany and military weapons. I spent 4.5 hours and was still rushed at the end, though I suspect the average person will not read every plack like I did. Highly recommend.

618a33226fe3f9d3e4409637,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"I've wanted to visit this museum the last few times I was in London, but never had the time.
I think it's a little expensive for entry (£23) and would not have like to pay for someone not interested in this kind of ""living History"" place. but if you are at all interested in the last WW this is a must for you.
Churchill is of course best known for his association with leading the Allies for most of the WW (I presume the ""Yank"" had a lot to do with it when they joined in). But a good section of this exhibition shares Winston's life. I never knew that he was an officer in the services and that he spent a few years in Southern Africa. and that he first came to popularity by escaping as a POW.
A couple of his personal pistols are on show, one being his favorite a Colt 1911. There is plenty of his other personal property, like his awards, medals and honers.
The rooms are kept in a condition that truly gives you the impression they have not changed since the war (They have modified access ways etc . to accommodate the walk through, but this does not take from the experience. It is fascinating to see all the maps (Map Room) that were used in the war and in planning the eventual victory, with more than a few failures along the way.
I found it fascinating that one permanent duty officer was task with planning and managing the expected German Invasion (that never came) Paranoia at its very peak....
It is very easy to imagine people never seeing the light of day as they were busy in the war effort. One little anecdote was that they had ""Sun ray Lamps"" set up down there to give some level of skin colour (and the story of over doing it LOL).
I was in there for at least 2 hours maybe a little more. You get a personal guide machine in your language of choice.
I had a medium weight coat on me due to the day outside and would have liked to use a storage locker - but they don't have such facility (possible due to security issues??). The temperature was good below - but i had to take off my coat or I would have melted. But then in March - you could have rain one second and sun the next (which i did LOL) so plan as much as you can.
In all the experience was top-notch. you got a good feel (i think) for what it was like for the war in the war rooms. the basic conditions they had (no luxury by any means there.).
I've been there now so don't need to do it again, but it was well worth the trip - as long as you are interested in this type of thing (for the entry fee).

We arrived five minutes before it opened at 9:30 am and walked right in. The tour of the facilities was very interesting; the audio guide entries were just the right length of time that I didn't feel like we were blocking the small hallways and we moved along at a good pace. We probably would have finished in the suggested two hours, but we stumbled upon the exhibit about Churchill's life and spent a full 90 minutes there. A little confusingly laid out (probably because of the room's dimensions), the narrative was fascinating. The curators even mention some of the controversies (Ghandi/India, Palestine/Israel), albeit in a very general way.

Well worth a visit if you want to see what life during the Blitz was like for those running the war effort. The rooms are exactly as they were including the map room, with the walls lined with charts and maps.

This was just down the street and mid day on a Monday in March we were able to get right in. There were quite a few people doing the self guided audio tour, but we did have our chance to view each area without feeling cramped.

They do have a special audio tour meant for kids that some may enjoy. Unfortunately our kids just didn't get into it as I would hope. There were many rooms to view, each with a great description. For adults or older children you could easily spend over an hour waking through. With our young children we were able to quickly view each area as we walked by and were done in less than 30 minutes.

I arrived in the late morning. There was no line but they 100% let too many people in for a location with such small rooms/ corridors. It was very difficult to find a place to stop, read the placards, or pay attention to your (free) audio guide without being in someone's way. As noted in other reviews, you can also constantly hear people's audio guides talking which is distracting and loud. The museum part was the most crowded so I did not finish walking through - simply too difficult to get near the exhibits.

When I left, there was a line to get in so it seems best to go in the morning.

Also keep in mind I was there in February - lowest of the low season - so I really don't want to imagine the crowds in the summer!

618a332f6fe3f9d3e440964b,UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,"This museum is near Westminster Station, at the corner of King Charles St and Horse Guards Rd. If you look back to the east along King Charles, it’s the little black entrance to the right.

Once inside, you’re actually visiting two museums. The first is a large exhibition dedicated to the life and career of Winston Churchill. This is fairly comprehensive, with details about the many stages of his career and how it all fit into global context. To be frank, this section was not laid out in the most efficient manner. There were numerous bottlenecks where people clumped together, which made it difficult at times to progress through the displays.

The next museum is the portion containing the actual War Rooms. This is the underground bunker where people lived and planned out the course of World War II. You follow a set path through the maze of rooms, listening to an audio guide along the way, and learn about life in the bunker and the operation of the war effort. While fascinating, the corridors here tended to be narrow, and the way at times was very congested with other guests. Also, it was difficult to linger over rooms that you really wanted to study, for there was always someone behind you waiting their turn.

Despite the crowds, this is still a great museum and worth the visit. You could easily spend three or four hours here.

You need to book a slot to suit you well in advance as understandably very popular with tourist but glad to say this did not detract too much from the experience as there is plenty of space and not too many visitors are let in at a time.
The main thing to be aware of is that there is a large exhibition on Winston Churchill's life and times before you get to the Cabinet War Rooms which are really the whole point of going. Interesting as it is there is a danger of spending too0much time her.
You get t the war rooms via pasages etc almost untouched by time some with original signage which adds to the authenticity of the experience. You see all aspects of what became the nerve centre of the British war effort from communications room, complete with banks of old fashioned telephones and realistic-looking figures of military personnel, secretaries etc, rest rooms, Churchill's bedroom.
There is also a good bookshop.

Overall, the weak points were the head sets - people walked around with theirs on full-blast, meaning all you could hear were people's headsets at different stages of the commentary. It ended up being very irritating, and I did wish that the headsets included earphones so only the person with the headset could hear them.

The museum was interesting but as others have said, the layout didn't seem to follow any logical order (why not chronological?), and it was a bit of an information-overload.

The main event was the war rooms, they were fascinating, but far too many people. When we got to the map room, we were constantly finding ourselves in people's way, or being annoyed by blaring headsets (as mentioned above). We thought it might be a bit quieter due to coronavirus, but alas no.

However it was fascinating to see the war rooms and I'm glad I've finally managed to go. I learnt a lot about Churchill and what a divisive figure he actually was.

The audio handset worked very well and informative .The displays are very good and give a good insight into what life was like underground. There is a Churchill room at the back with a lot of information about his life and what was happening during his time. If like reading all the fine detail then 2 hours will not be long enough.

The underground bunker—offices and sleeping quarters—where Churchill and his staff worked and often lived during the Blitz is preserved as a museum, with an adjoining museum about Churchill himself. This is a marvelous and moving place. In the ""map room,"" you can see the map-covered walls with formations of pins and yarn showing the various fronts, just as they were when the room was last used. Also various meeting rooms and sleeping quarters, including Churchill's room, with a narrow bed and the desk from which he delivered his nightly BBC radio addresses to his beleaguered and valiant fellow-Londoners. Memorable and wonderful.

There were so many exhibits in the war rooms and the Churchill museum that it seemed impossible to take it all in in one visit.

The rooms are set up authentically and quickly transports visitors back to the time of WWII. The audio guide is very thorough, perhaps a bit too thorough. Some of the hallways and rooms could get quite congested depending on how long the audio was for that particular area.

The museum section of Churchill's life was a quite overwhelming and too much stimulation for us. There are so many different areas and lots of interactive things and the way it was organized (not chronologically) was confusing. The room was very crowded with people and just felt chaotic.

I wish the Churchill museum would have been a separate ticket from the war rooms. It would allow people to choose or do both but have enough time for your brain to recover from all of the information.

On our way round we then had more members of staff saying the same thing and hurrying people along. For £23 per person it’s not exactly cheap and being treated like your on a school trip wasn’t welcome! Also, some corridors in the exhibition are quite narrow so having members of staff rushing past you often wasn’t helpful either. I must note though that once we had left the blessed ‘map room’ (so glad we saw it, wouldn’t have slept otherwise!) and reached the gift shop, the sudden hurrying along stopped, even though it was closing in 5 mins. I can only think this is simply because people were spending money!

618a335c6fe3f9d3e440968e,UK,Churchill War Rooms,3.0,"This is an amazing exhibition & well worth the visit, but I found several staff members rude & unpleasant in their approach.
DON'T TAKE A RUCKSACK WITH YOU you will be asked to carry by hand it due to the narrowness of the corridors and concerns that wearing it on your back will damage things. I asked about a locker, got told bluntly they didn't have any, carry it. I recently sustained a injury to my right hand, so I was struggling to carry the rucksack by hand.
What was apparent in the war rooms is that some corridors were narrow, while some areas were open room sized. In the timeline area of Churchill's life & career, which is maybe the most open part of the museum I slipped my bag onto my back, only for a member of staff to stand in front of me and prevent me moving anywhere until I took the bag off my back. No please or thank you from him, so my son & I decided to leave that exhibit and see the rest of the museum.

Of all of the IWM museums in London, this is probably the best, but if they don't want rucksacks to be carried then they should make that clear in pre visit literature and provide lockers!! Plus some customer service training for some of the staff would be very useful.

618a335c6fe3f9d3e440968f,UK,Churchill War Rooms,2.0,"This is clearly used as a cash-cow for the IWM / Government. At £23 per adult it is astoundingly overpriced. It is probably worth about £15 at the most. The queue was slow moving, and inside there were far too many people - to the point that it was practically impossible to actually see inside any of the rooms, or see any exhibits in the exhibition area as there were always about two rows of people in front of you. One room we couldn’t even go into as they were preparing for some private dinner event - great when you’ve paid fully price and they still treat you like a second class citizen. Equally, a female staff member was pushing her way back and forth through the corridors disrupting visitors even further whilst she was clearly doing some sort of ‘sales job’ to a prospective client who wanted to hire the venue. My partner went into the woman’s loos and there was blood all over the floor that look like it had been there ages not being cleared up. Overall, for nearly £50 for two of us, and about a 40 minute visit of not actually being able to see anything due to crowds, events and busy-body staff member, this was an absolute rip off. I suspect they don’t care though, as people will still come just to ‘tick it off’ the tourist list.

The war was not pretty, and Winston Churchill had an unglamorous job.

So having these rooms show tourists how spare and tight quarters makes the effort to fight the fascists worth every stress.

It's sad to think that we don't seem to learn enough about history to avoid bringing people towards conflict. These rooms bring Churchill and his colleagues to us. To make us ruminate about whether we could ever live in such tight quarters, and rationed meals, with little creature comforts.

Telecommunications and steel, concrete thick enough to protect the decision-makers of the days of yore.

Brought a ticket on the door , £24 per adult (Feb 2020 prices) and went straight in .
Remember ! You can buy tickets cheaper on line but there is a Timed entrance procedure and when it is busy without a time in your ticket you will be given a time , So you might have to wait !
You will be given a audio guide , Use it like a phone and when you see the corresponding number on the exhibit press that number on the audio guide.
There are corridors and as you proceed to the left and right of you , You will see the rooms that the staff worked ,slept , made decisions , ate and looked at data in the map room ..
Saw Lady Churchill`s bedroom as well as Winstons ,Also the other Generals and advisors rooms, Not so handsome as the PM ! Some rooms have wax models inside as thou they are working there today ! Look out also as you will see the staff desks and behind them was their beds ! Some of the maps are the originals and you will see graphs on how bombing raids have done .
Half way round there is a special dedicated museum to Winston , All about him ,The war , His life & death ..Excellent artifacts from Winston clothing to his own personal items ..There are a couple of short films on Winston war duties and how he tried to solve the Middle East ..
As you go round you find the space is at a premium , I was told on D-Day itself there were 500 staff members all scurrying around , And a lot of them smoked ! And as the air vent only let air out it must of been very difficult conditions to work in ?
There are interactions especially in Winston museum , you will hear from some of the staff that are alive today ..
The cafe was a nice break , It gets hot down there as well , Toilets are near the Gift shop ..

Fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the man who outthought the Nazis and steered us successfully through WW2. I hadn’t fully appreciated that Churchill was something of a lone voice during the 1930s, warning against the rise of Nazi Germany at a time when the country had no appetite for another world war and when he himself wasn’t trusted after making a number of bad decisions opposing home rule for India and supporting Edward VIII’s decision to abdicate. It’s all there in this fabulous exhibition.",Feb 2020

Amazing how they were able to preserve this place to give us a sense of how Churchill and the others lived during the war. He literally walked the same halls where we were....and one can almost experience the fear they all felt when the bombings were ongoing. Such greatness and perseverance in a time like that.

We were lucky that it wasn't too busy so were able to get to everything easily to read and listen. Have nothing negative to report and would strongly recommend it.

Talk-along was well paced and rooms fascinating - my Grandad was an ARP warden in the war, and to see the consolidated London bombing reports that Churchill read on a daily basis brought it to life. Churchill exhibition was interesting, but a little dis-organised, and the free-form presentation did not work for me. But overall - definitely worth a visit for a one-off piece of history.",Jan 2020

618a33846fe3f9d3e44096b4,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"This museum is directly below the Treasury and where Churchill spent quite a bit of time during WWII. This is half museum, half historical landmark, in that you see the war rooms using an audio guide, but there is an extensive Churchill museum halfway through the tour. The whole thing took me about 2 hours, but I'm not one to linger for a long time at a museum. Worth it if you're interested in history, WWII, or Churchill.",Feb 2020
618a33846fe3f9d3e44096b5,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Very interesting experience. The place is incredibly well kept.

Would recommend for those interested in who Churchill was and his all around legacy",Mar 2019
618a33846fe3f9d3e44096b6,UK,Churchill War Rooms,3.0,"I visited here with my partner last week. We queued up outside for about 15 minutes before getting in, which wasn't too bad a wait considering it was a Sunday. After entry it was quite sloppy to pay for our tickets, there was no clear line and people were cutting in front of others to get in quicker!

After waiting 10 minutes to be served by a gentleman, who was doing something else on the computer, we were given our audioguides and entered the first room. I found the first few rooms were way too crowded, it was difficult to get a good view into the meeting room without others pushing through and knocking us out the way! Maybe having more staff throughout would help with this and to keep things moving.

The museum was interesting, I enjoyed the interactive section which seemed a good way to keep children entertained. Some of Churchill's possessions were fascinating to see, especially the letters, which was one of the highlights of the experience along with a collection of his outfits. I do feel that the museum was worded in a way that was very biased and only pointed out the good things Churchhill did, although I understand this it would have been better to have a more rounded story.

The rooms themselves were amazing to see and very well explained on the audioguides, however I do wish there would have been more rooms to see as we seemed to have spent 3/4 of our time in the museum which wasn't why we visited.

Overall, a very good and important piece of history but expensive for what it was.

They do have an elevator in the back to get downstairs for prams and wheelchairs. Once downstairs you can get your ticket from the counter. We booked our online so it was quite easy and fast. We had an audio guide for the facility. The guide was very informative and it was easy to skip things when it got too long-winded. But for the most part, it gave enough information so you learn something without getting bored.
The tour started with walking around the ground and led to the museum. The museum itself had quite a lot of things to see. A few of them interactive. You can spend as much or little time as you wanted which was nice. I really enjoyed walking around the unchanged bunker areas underground.

618a339d6fe3f9d3e44096d5,UK,Churchill War Rooms,2.0,"We were so disappointed by our experience here. Admission prices set our expectations high, but this museum did not deliver. Audioguides were included, which is good, but mine stopped working after the first few listening points. There were no members of staff visible who might have been able to help.
The tour has a decent beginning, but the audioguide clips I heard were too long for the natural pace of the visit. Top tip for CWR: put a lot of the ""shared memories"" as supplemental listening points.
It quickly turned bizarre, as you are introduced to the WW2 setting, then jump to the establishment of the CWR, then the room which is dedicated to Winston Churchill, then back to WW2 setting. The Churchill museum room isn't in chronological order, and there is a lot of duplication across all the signs and placards. I liked the instillation where you could listen to recordings of his iconic speeches, but it got quite jarring as several speeches were played by different guests simultaneously.
Our return to the war rooms was also married by auditory clashing of (I think?) BBC newsreel with the intended audioguide clip. We then got minimal view of the actual map room and Churchill's bedroom, as there were two tour groups inside those rooms. I've had better experiences where places have organised ""live tour times"" and ""audioguide times"" so that ALl visitors can enjoy their visit. I consider this museum to be completely over-rated.

They even found sugar cubes in a draw dsting back to this time. Ehere someone had hidden them hor later and forgotten them to be rediscovered years later. A unique part of Briyidh history.

Very thought provoking at times when you realise the cramped conditions and the amount of people and the work that actually took place there. It is not all about Churchill.
The only downside for me was the audio part of the tour. They give you portable audio sets, like mobile phones, because of this you have to put up with the tinny noise from other peoples sets, headphones would have been better. However I prefer to read my way around an exhibition/museum, and there were very few reading descriptions.
If you are thinking of going and you are also thinking of seeing HMS Belfast, then join the IWM ... you will save over £20 per couple... and you can also go to Duxford for free.

I waited too long to buy timed entry tickets, so I bought a membership which I don't regret as it gave us flexibility. We were able to enter as soon as it opened and didn't find it unbearably crowded.

The Cabinet War Rooms are fascinating and we could have spent many more hours taking in all there was to see in the Churchill Museum portion. Our daughter used a wheelchair during our visit and even though the War Room corridors are not large, she found access to be more than acceptable (and in fact said that out of all the museums we visited, it was the easiest place to get around). The staff were helpful and even offered our son (who was pushing his sister) earphones for his audioguide.

The Churchill museum is wonderfully curated and leaves no stone unturned on his life IMO.

It’s a fascinating first hand experience of perhaps the most pivotal point in British history. If you have a fascination with history, and particularly this period you will I’m sure enjoy it. If you don’t it’s still a good experience if you are curious about the period and certainly as a signpost for younger generations to have an appreciation for.

The tour is via audio guide, which whilst was comprehensive, personally I always favour a personal guide. However, I think it’s probably impractical in a place that seems to be busy.

It is not as far down as I thought they would be and I am surprised they were never bombed considering their location. You get a good idea of what it must have been like for the men and women who worked down there. The exhibits were well done and there was a gentleman who was giving a bit of a tour and explaining some of the rooms and what was conducted down there that also helped bring the space to life. I am glad I got there and would recommend it to anyone visiting London to check out.

After years of seeing dramatizations and movies centered on this site it was interesting to be in the actual space. I found on the whole the museum well organized and does a great job of explaining what life was like in this bunker during the War. The only thing holding me back from giving it a five rather than a four rating was the Churchill Museum. While it contained some interesting information about Churchill it struck me as less well structured than the tour of the working rooms and did not enhance the visit. People seemed to be on top of each other and there was no logical way through it without the desire to back track. That said I would visit again if the opportunity presented itself.

We had allocated a few hours to see this attraction, but found that we didn't want to go! There was much more to see. Our 10 year old received a child's audioguide which kept her very occupied. In fact, she was disappointed in all audio guides after this one, so it really hit the spot for her. The war rooms themselves were done out very authentically. The cafe was good and the gift shop had a lot of choices for souvenirs. Overall, I would allocate the day for this attraction, rather than the morningonly, as we did.

This is a fascinating piece of history, and if you've ever seen the film Finest Hour parts of it will look spookily familiar. It also contains a museum dedicated to Churchill himself, which is interesting in its own right and contains lots of Churchill memorabilia, like his hat, his bow tie, and of course one of the famous cigars. Also, bizarrely, one of his tailor-made one-piece sleep suits. Churchill invented the onesie - who knew?
The staff are really friendly and helpful. We were still in the museum part and a young man came in to tell us that as there was only about 40 minutes until closing we really ought to go and see the war rooms section while we still had time.

My only quibble really is the price: £23 per person?! Compare that with the entrance fee for the very similar Western Approaches in Liverpool: £13.50.

Tickets were sold out online, so we showed up first thing in morning to get in line for day of tickets. Customer service folks here could use some Disney training and the admission price is too expensive. You get an audio tour and are funneled down narrow halls thru the bunker rooms which I can only imagine are crowded beyond belief later in the day. The rooms and stories are interesting, but you have to peer around everyone standing at the same spots trying to listen to the audio tour. You then arrive in a large room that is essentially a museum of Winston Churchill’s life filled with lots of informative exhibits and artifacts - but you end up wandering around learning about his life but none of it is in chronological order. I read about his childhood after I learned about his exploits during WWII. Overall, we were underimpressed.

The line to enter the museum was a little lengthy (I visited on a afternoon Friday late in December), but the line moved fast so I didn't wait too long to get in. Tickets were a little on the pricey side, but they do provide a student discount and you get a free audio guide with your ticket. In all a very fun and informative activity for a day in London.

618a33e16fe3f9d3e4409735,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Amazing museum--learned a lot about how a war on the scale of WII was won. The overall museum can be broken down into 2 parts: the war rooms and the Churchill museums. The war rooms focus on exhibiting how Churchill and his staff worked during WWII, and many of the rooms are incredibly well displayed and preserved. Walking through the same halls as Churchill's WWII staff and imagining what kind of conversations took place here less than 100 years ago sent chills straight down my spine! The Churchill museum itself focuses much more on exploring Churchill's legacy before and after WWII. I learned a ton about the British hero and I don't think you can get closer to his life & legacy than you can here. Brilliant museum, would come again!

It was worth it. With the members pass we could skip the 90 min queue!!! And walked straight in. I felt like a celebrity.

The museum itself was very informative and I loved the way everything was kept as it was

The film the darkest hour really helped me to imagine the hustle and bustle of days gone by.

Had a very nice coffee in the cafe too

I’d go back before the membership runs out and the talking guide stick were brilliant and included. Even better. ✌🏻

618a33e16fe3f9d3e4409738,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"I had several friends tell me that this was a ""must do"" experience if you travel to London, but I was wary of visiting some dusty underground bunker. They were correct, and I was wrong. The War Rooms are masterfully put together, and the impact of all the artifacts and details were all the more engaging because they were not sitting in a display case completely removed from the place and event where they were utilized during World War Two, but were in the actual location where they played a role in deciding the fate of human history. I also appreciated that they had a separate history that wasn't just about Prime Minister Churchill during the war years, but that covered his entire life. It was all completely engaging, and it changed the way I viewed the man, the moments of history he was involved in, and it left me wanting to know even more. I was with my teenage son, and my parents who are in their 70s. Everyone had a superb time. If you are traveling with someone who has mobility issues, know that the museum is very accessible, and that the staff are exceptionally helpful.

618a33e26fe3f9d3e4409739,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"We did not purchased advance tickets and don’t really see the need for it. Those with advance tickets still had to queue in a line for entry. Granted that line does move faster but the line we were in without tickets wasn’t long.

An audio guide is included in the price of admission and it has all the info you need. The Churchill museum is also included as part of this ticket and it is accessible during the middle of your tour threw the underground rooms.

The rooms themselves appear very well put together and are full of actual artifacts from WWII.

There isn’t much to read here as much of the info comes from the audio guide. I do wish there were more than a few voices of actual residents/workers however I do understand we may have lost most of those people at this point.

The museum portion wasn’t my favorite as the layout left a little to be desired and the flow was confusing. People were constantly backtracking and trying to figure out what section should be next.

The actual rooms though are the highlight and plenty of reason to make this a must visit.

We both made good choices for our own tastes and enjoyment. If you have seen the movie Darkest Hours then you have seen some of the war rooms. This is what piqued my curiosity and led to my visit.

618a33ef6fe3f9d3e440974d,UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Very interesting historic site with the added bonus of an extensive Museum on the life of Winston Churchill. At an hour and a half, we definitely set aside too little time here. I had assumed we would have tour of his WWII underground headquarters, and the Churchill Museum was great, but added an unplanned time factor. If you are of the type that likes to read everything, then you need a minimum of three hours. If, like us, you only have an hour and a half, then skip the Churchill Museum section and devote your time to the wonderful WWII exhibits and environment, which is all there to see, and marvel at how these dedicated souls saved Britain in WWII in this warren of underground passages with all the necessities (bed, chamber pot, etc) still there along with all the maps and planning material used just like it was yesterday. Wonderful!
