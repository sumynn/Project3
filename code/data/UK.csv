UK,Tower of London,4.0,The beefeater tour with Gary was truly excellent. He managed to make everyone laugh but also teach interesting facts about this incredible place. The Crown Jewels and Tower of London building itself were the most interesting areas and unfortunately the Royal Mint building was closed for an unknown reason hence the dropping a mark.,Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This took me right back to childhood and visiting here with my dad. I would recommend getting there early if you want to see the jewels as by lunchtime the queue was massive whereas a few hours earlier we were able to walk right in.
Give yourself a few hours to visit everything as the place is seeped in history with lots to see and it would be a shame to miss anything.
Some of the places to visit involve stairs and narrow spiral staircases so this is something to bear in mind if you don't like that kind of thing but you can walk all the way around the site if you walk up the walls.
We also had lunch in one of the on site cafes and that was lovely good service and great food
Definitely one of the highlight of our trip to London.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Make sure you get a tour with a Beefeater they are very knowledgeable and know the history that touring the grounds on your own you would miss.
Beautiful grounds so old with the modern city in the background.
I would say 2 hours is enough time.
A cafe on site.
Visit the crown jewels.
I would recommend and return!",Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We booked online and got our dates muddled and turned up a day early it was sorted easily with no fuss.
We joined Gary for the Beefeater tour and he was fantastic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and funny. The queues on the day were non existent and getting around every area of interest was easy and hassle free.
We saw all the main exhibits, the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Bloody Tower and time to get photographs with the Ravens.
Well worth the money.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We went on a Tuesday around 13:30, and it was so quiet! We went on the tour with our Beefeater, Clive. Clive was great, spoke clearly and loudly so all the group could hear, was full of interesting facts, and involved the crowd.
The whole experience was good fun for all ages, although I would say there are obviously a lot of stairs, so to be mindful of that.
Would definitely recommend.",Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Beefeaters very knowledgable . Cut short due to rain but plenty to see in the towers, church. Will visit again. This was our 3rd visit",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,2.0,"Nearly £50 for one adult and one child. Admittedly, we went during the bank holiday, so our time was mostly spent in queues. The buildings are iconic, but once you get inside, the exhibits are of a poor quality and little effort to make history come alive. My advice would be to walk around the outside, and visit the Leeds Armouries, which is free to enter.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,We've visited the Tower of London a couple of times before and always have a great day. There is so much to see and the information is very well put together. A great day for adults and children alike,Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the tower. We were lucky enough to be on the tour with Yeoman Warder Kelly AKA Beefy 409 who was absolutely brilliant! He was very informative and extremely funny, he had me in stitches a few times. He said he was actually quite new, but I would have thought he had been there for years, certainly a great addition to the team.

We got there quite early, so were fortunate enough to be able to see everything whilst it was still quite quiet. It's an amazing feeling stepping back in time and learning all the incredible history that the tower holds. Plus my personal highlight, getting to see the Ravens up close and personal; beautiful birds!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,Used our london passes and went straight in. We arrived just as the yeoman tour was about to start. Our guide was Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts. He was excellent and very informative and also very funny. I live this place,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This was a fantastic day out on its own!

Tip: Start immediately at the Crown Jewels as the queues get massive later.

The place is huge and there is so much to see, read and take in.

My husband and I arrived with our 6yr old in the October half term and used our Go City passes for entry which saved us a significant amount of money.

The famous sights including the Ravens, the Bloody Tower and Crown Jewels were fantastic and we were amazed that people actually lived on site!

Highly recommended trip!

UK,Tower of London,3.0,£29.90 entrance ticket price. Really not worth the money. All rather dull. Queued for ages to see the Crown Jewels.,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,1.0,"We were very much looking forward to our visit as a fun and educational family day out. We were very disappointed in our visit due to the number of people there. We felt that, even taking Covid out of the equation, there were far too many people. We had not expected this, given that we had booked tickets online in advance. The website says that 'You can safely explore the history of this famous fortress, palace and prison' and all the attractions that were included in the ticket price. However, it was impossible to visit even close to everything, and certainly not safely, due to the volume of people - every tower / building etc had a queue. For the Crown Jewels in particular it was ridiculous. There was no way to social distance, no one controlling the numbers of people in any of the buildings. It ruined our experience. Given that we are still in a pandemic, the number of people was unacceptable. We arrived at 12 midday and had expected to stay until the closing time of 4.30pm. We left around 3pm as we found the crowds of people too stressful and overwhelming. We undertook a 45 minute Yeoman of the Guard tour at the start of our visit and whilst this was both informative and fun, it was again spoilt by the amount of people - it was difficult to hear the commentary. It would have been far more enjoyable and Covid friendly to have split the group into 2 or 3. There were plenty of Beefeaters around, so I think this would have been a manageable solution to improve people's experience. Also advertised for half term was 'Ghost Raiders' - a half term Halloween activity for the children - there was no mention or sign of this while we were there. I could not recommend that anyone visit this attraction during the school holidays. Such a pity when it could have been an amazing experience. I understand that venues are trying to recoup lost earnings, but it seems to me that the attitude of 'Historic Royal Palaces' stinks of greed and arrogance, having no consideration of their visitors' enjoyment or safety.

UK,Tower of London,2.0,"We visited the Tower with 2 children during half term. I expected it to be busier than usual but was extremely disappointed to find it so crowded. We had booked online for 1 pm but went in early - cursory check. We had paid for an audio guide but such a long queue to get into shop, we didn't wait. It felt chaotic and disorganised - get as many people in as possible. We saw battlements and the white tower, unfortunately not the Crown jewels (queue went beyond the white tower). In time of Covid, I did not expect this. Signs saying to wear masks inside buildings but they were by far and away exception. Only one member of staff on battlements who did not appear to be controlling flow of people into tower. By far the worst experience I have had in a public situation since beginning of Covid guidelines. Value for money would have been good if we had been able to see more. However it turned out to be an expensive afternoon.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Tower of London- I would suggest going as early as possible- we went when it opened and noticed it got busier as the day went on.I got and audio tour for my child and it made it so much more interesting - (ended up telling me facts) and engaging. As you don’t have to do it in a set order it was so pleasurable. Every member of staff we interacted , met were polite and had a smile.
We spoke three members of staff asking them questions each one of them had fantastic knowledge of the Tower of London. The cafe on site had a lovely selection of food for all. Highly recommend going to explore the Tower of London. It is definitely a day out .",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,3.0,"Nice, very busy during half term there was quite a que.
There is some confusion over the towers and would be good to hire out an audio for the tour which didn't come to mind when we booked. Need more than just a couple hours here as it could take most of your day seeing the history behind Tower of London. Great day out.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"An excellent family day out, so much history, would reccomend the audibility package to really make the day worthwhile if understanding of the historical events of the Tower is a priority. We had a 7, 10 and 13 years old and they all had a great time. Would suggest to book out the full day to really maximise the tru historical significance of such a landmark destination.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,It was great visiting the Tower of London generally but sadly a bit too busy (being a school holiday) to see everything. But we will definitely be visiting again,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Great visit and interesting facts. Will be back for another visit. Too much to see in one day.
Well worth a visit and very interesting facts.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"There is so much history here, from the 11th century to today. Yeoman Warders are amazing - what a GREAT JOB! Their tour is excellent and included with admission - be sure to take the tour.

I became a member of Historic Royal Palaces to have more flexibility to go in whenever we wished during a recent trip to London. Membership is WORTH IT. Be sure to book directly.

Go in, enjoy watching the ravens (they truly take their jobs seriously and provide plenty of entertainment for their visitors), go see the Crown Jewels (WOW!) when there is no line, take plenty of time in the White Tower. The cafe is adequate should you need to grab tea/coffee/cake/light snack while you are there.

Wear comfortable shoes...old cobblestones are not forgiving should your choice of footwear err on the side of fashion vs. comfort and function. Enjoy this wonderful place!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It was a last minute decision to visit the Tower of London before returning home from a weekend away. Booking online was easy and the tickets emailed to us straight away.

There’s a lot to do inside and it’s really informative, it was lovely to see the queens guards doing their marching outside the Crown Jewels area.

I’m glad we went but it is probably something I would only do once in my lifetime. But all in all it was a good day out

UK,Tower of London,5.0,Me and my family loved it! @Beefy409 aka Scott Kelly was amazing he was a great storyteller and we got a photo with him! When we go back we would love to have him as our beefeater tour guide so I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to go!,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,Well worth getting there early to miss the queues into the popular Crown Jewels exhibition and White Tower (although they were around 45 mins at peak time compared to 2 hours in pre Covid times). We paid £29.90 per adult and £14.90 for our 8 yr old and it was certainly worth the money as we were there for over 5 hours. The Yeoman/Beefeater tour was both amusing and informative (thank you to Barney) and would say that the White Tower is not to be missed for great exhibits and interactive games for children.,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Really interesting and informative tour of the Tower of London. The Beefeater, Scott Kelly, was so entertaining, funny and knowledgeable and I highly recommend this attraction for adults and children alike (especially if you like gruesome tales)",Oct 2021

As it was half term, long queues for everything, as you would expect (particularly the Crown Jewels exhibit which was almost an hour queue!)",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Legendary place. Had a fun few hours exploring. Even though it was half term, they are at about a third normal for fall, sad for them, but it meant by arriving at 9am we didn’t have to queue for a thing. Hope it picks up again when the world starts to get out more.",Oct 2021

UK,Tower of London,4.0,Had a lovely day out at The Tower of London with the family. Very easy to book the tickets online and not much of a queue to get in.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Very good time! The yeoman tour (I am so sorry, I cannot recall his name but it's the Scotsman #409 Yeoman guard) was absolutely incredible! A great storyteller and his ""we'll beheading this way"" joke slew me. Well done sir. Then we went through the white tower and I really enjoyed this historical tour. The fusiliers museum was surprisingly small, that being said it was enjoyable. The biggest let down was the Crown Jewels. The crowd control was dismal and the exhibits were quick to see. Felt like a bit of a let down in all truth. The white tower and prince's tower were far better in my opinion. But, and I can't believe I'm writing this, the best part was the cafe! Their cake selection is second to none, exceptional victoria sponge. If it weren't £30 to enter each time I'd be there for cake daily!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,Great visit here with teen and a 10 year old. We all loved it and spent quite a few hours exploring and admiring the jewels. Don’t bother with the cafe - lukewarm and expensive! Didn’t detract from the rest of the exhibits thankfully. Well worth reading the walls some fascinating yet terrifying insights to the history of the tower there. We took the hop on hop off bus out to the tower which took forever but was enjoyable as well as giving the feet a rest!,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Make sure you take the tour with the Yeoman- hilarious, educational and informative! The Crown Jewels are simply incredible and well laid out so you get a chance to get up nice and close and have a really good look at them.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Good experience but really wish we had stuck with the tour guide to appreciate the explanation and history.
Was great to see everything, ravens, crown jewels and the other important bits of history but I do feel like we may have missed something due to everyone raving how good it is, we just found it ok. I've marked it ""very good"" as I do appreciate the important history of the place and glad we did it. Entry price is fairly standard for attractions in London but don't mind paying since it needs a fair amount for the upkeep and staff.

Starting off with a tour by Yoemen Warder Andy M was a great bonus. I'd normally find these things drab but he made the 45 mins entertaining (think dad jokes and slightly un-PC, which we loved) and very informative. He finished off telling us both about the guards outside of the Crown Jewels and then about how he became a Warder...by the end we were all brimming with the British Pride that oozed from him.
After that a wander round the buildings and exhibits, plus a drink in the Armouries cafe (clean and spacious).

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Feels odd doing a review for the Tower of London. You just simply must see it.
We had a great morning out here. £29.90 each is a bit pricy, but we got two for one by printing off a voucher from National Rail, showed our train ticket at the box office and hey presto, half price.
(You're welcome! :)

We started off as many do with a yeoman (beefeater) tour that were running every 30 mind. The tour was free and starts just by the entrance. We had the honour of being led around by Yeoman Paul who is a real entertainer full of knowledge and a great sense of humour.
He said we made his day by asking his name for a review. Nope, you made ours, mate.
The tour is a fantastic way to start off the visit as its only 45 minutes to an hour and really sets you up to explore the rest of this beautiful historic masterpiece yourself.
We finished the experience with a well earned trip to the Spoons opposite so really did experience the best of British that day. ;)

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Me and my Mum visited the Tower of London on our most recent staycation in London. We were not disappointed. We’d booked in advance online and we got a souvenir book included in our ticket price.

We were expecting it to not last the majority of the day, but oh my goodness you definitely get your moneys worth. We arrived for the morning session at 11am and we didn’t leave the Tower of London until around 5pm. We stopped for some lunch in the restaurant which was lovely.

Take your time to look around all of the places within the tower grounds. The beefeaters know so much and are very knowledgeable so if you have any questions, do ask them!

The most interesting find for me was the fact that Anne Boleyn is buried inside one of the chapels. The chapel is right in front of the place where she was beheaded!!

You will learn so much - and remember it’s a whole day trip - not a quick excursion - so make sure you leave plenty of time to do it - and enjoy it!

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The tower and its artifacts are fascinating when you think of the history involved. However I found it to be a glorification of the monarchy, which I expected, and also war, which I didn't.
Looking at the tower's prisoners' graffiti while they were awaiting their fate was harrowing - despite knowing they'd been abandoned to their death, they still prayed to their gods. Blind faith, I suppose.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This is experience is absolutely invaluable and an absolute must for London, and England itself as a whole. The attractions and exhibitions are pristine, exceptional and teeming with information and history displayed in such an informative but still engaging way. We first visited in February 2017, and recently visited in October 2021. Still, visiting 4 years later, we felt as if we’d learned so many new things again and had the most incredible, special experience. Beefeater #409, Sergeant Scott Kelly, was just absolutely incredible, so animated with a passion for the country and its history that you couldn’t help but share in and feel to the extent he did, and such a warm and hilarious nature within his tour that you couldn’t help but be engaged and hang onto his every word. He made us laugh, he made us squirm in disgust, he made us come together as strangers to participate and marvel at history and he made us want to delve into our history as a nation further and further. There is so much to see and so many incredible elements to be enraptured by, I would suggest taking the whole day for this incredible heritage site. This is not the first and nor will it be the last time I visit and enjoy with the upmost passion this incredible place and it’s wonderfully put together displays and immersive experiences, as well as the incredible people who keep it running and are walking embodiments of tradition and historical importance.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We knew the Tower of London was one of the top attractions here in London, however, the history and the crown jewels just blew us away. The most important thing is to get the beefeater to give you a tour. Every hour on the hour there is one available just inside the main gate you will see a small crowd gathering around him. They are the most entertaining and funny lot . Facemasks were requested to be worn inside the buildings but not outside. The Crown jewel area was the most crowded but everybody kept trying to adhere to the social distancing. The jewels are very real - there are coronation crowns etc decorated with the most amazing precious stones among which are the largest diamond and the second largest diamond in the world. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Everywhere else you can take pictures. The Armory in the White tower is incredible should not be skipped. When you’re done with the tower of London, take some time to walk along the wharf to admire the Tower Bridge that’s very nearby.

The Crown Jewels are still awesome and we were so lucky not to have to queue although i think the pre booking has improved the visit experience as it was far better without crowds of people and shuffling around. The Beefeater tour was entertaining and a must as they really do give you an insight into its history. Loved the interactive part of the White Tower where we tried our hand at dressing the king and shooting a cannon. Views across the Thames were of course amazing. It was certainly well worth the admission price. It gives Goosebumps to think you are treading in the same place as past king and queens - and very poignant moments in the chapel thinking of those executed. A must for everyone.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"We were a family of 4 adults and managed to get a 2 for 1 deal which I thought made the admission costs just about worth it. We started off with a Yoeman’s Tour which I thought was very good, it wasn’t too short or too long and gave me a good sense of foundational knowledge to look around afterwards. I was very surprised at how beautiful I found the jewels however I did feel like the wording of how we “occupied” some of the jewels was a little too generous.
Unfortunately we hadn’t realised that the winter closing times had come into effect since we planned the trip and ended up with only 3 hours to view the place. Which meant we missed a few areas and rushed around some of the exhibits, so do allow plenty of time to look around. In our research we read that the closing time listed was the closing time for the buildings but you would have half an hour to look around after that. This is wrong, we were all ushered out a little before closing time and they wouldn’t even allow my family members outside to wait for me until I could leave the building and were politely threatened with security which left us all feeling a little sour with the place after a pleasant afternoon.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We visited the Tower of London after doing a walking tour of the City of London in the morning. The tower itself is incredible when you think of its age, the history and the different uses it has had over the years.
We met a fantastic yeoman there who told us some incredible stories about the tower and his own experiences. The crown jewels are obviously a big attraction but we got a good amount of time to look at them although understandably the distance you can get to them and photography of them is of high security which is a shame but understandable.
Apparently there is an audio guide as well although we didn't bother with it as we were happy just wandering around.
All in all a fantastic way to spend the day. There's also a nice little souvenir shop outside and a few places to get something to eat and drink as well.
Tip: Make your way down to the bottom of the hill in front of the tower where the boat cruises/uber boats are as you get a fantastic shot of Tower Bridge as well.

On arrival, entry into the tower was quick and with the right number of staff to keep queuing down to a minimum. We did not make use of the tour guides and decided to make our own way around the tower but from what we heard of the guides, their knowledge was to a very good standard and they attracted large crowds. The facilities inside the grounds were good. The tower cafe was reasonably priced for London, but the selection of foods available could have been improved with more vegetarian options . The toilet facilities were clean and of a good standard. We spent 5 hours at the tower which on the day was plenty of time, however we went at the end of the summer school holidays so it was not particularly busy so more time may be needed at other times.

We visited on 31st August which turned out a perfect day as there were no queues anywhere, we walked straight into the jewel house.

We did the battlements walk where you get some great views of Tower Bridge

Our tour with the Dave the Beefeater was informative and very funny, a quick witted man, it seemed that most people were British therefore mother tongue English which I think Dave enjoyed as he knows we all get his wit!

Beefeater Dave did have to deal with a police helicopter literally overhead (dealing with ridiculous people blocking tower bridge on their protest..but don’t think about the total disruption of normal people we saw 5buses stuck on London Bridge for at least two hours again due to so called protesters ..sorry went off track there!) which meant he had to raise his voice a lot..he did really well.

I have seen some comments about ticket problems..we had none..we printed them off went to the entrance and entered half an hour before our allotted time.

We had a fab day and enjoyed our history which we all know but this visit makes it real and loved seeing the Crown Jewels.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,This is a must see! Great value for money and loads to see. Recommend that you get the audio tour as its brilliant. You need a few hours for this place but so worth it!! Guides are fabulous too.,Jul 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I have just returned from a day out at the tower and have never felt so compelled to write a review! I was with my two children, the youngest of whom has special needs, and my mum (who had an injured foot) I had chosen to come post covid as I knew it was slightly less busy and my son would cope better - however I really needn't have worried, as soon as we entered I got chatting to a Yeoman Warder, he showed me his sunflower wristband and told me about his family members similar to my son, made such a fuss of both of my kids and I felt so welcome straight away! This theme continued with all the staff, my con often touched people's legs, and got the rear end of another warder, I was mortified as usual, but he and another warder laughed it off and made us all laugh too, again making a fuss of both of my kids, as my elder child can often get a bit left out when her brother takes priority, this wasn't the case at the tower! When in the main, white tower the staff again went above and beyond, due to the steps we were all on foot and my son was tired, and lying on the floor, obviously although I try not to react to onlookers it makes you feel stressed, but the staff were able to approach us in such a relaxed manner, I didn't feel stressed or like we were a problem, only supported! One staff member magically got through to my son who has very limited communication and convinced him to walk to the dragon, once on that floor another staff member found his way to us and took both of my kids under his wing, showing them all the interactive games and helping them work them all in a fashion where they could both be involved! We were then offered the staff exit stairs so that it would be quieter, however we wanted to see the dungeon, so this guy held the crowd for a minute so that we could go down an otherwise very busy staircase a little more calmly! Throughout the day Yeoman Warders we had spoken to came over to chat and check we were okay, always including the kids, they also advised the best places for my mum to join in or sit out as she had injured her foot. I became a little overwhelmed with emotion near the end of the day when chatting to one warder because I have never quite experienced a whole venue that is so inclusive of autism and special needs, I would reccomend this venue to any and all families, I really felt like we might miss out not being able to have a guided tour (as my son wouldn't tolerate that) but I feel that we, and all visitors really, totally got the star treatment! I can't wait to come back, possibly on a girl's evening with my daughter and mum again to see the ceremony of the keys. We all had the BEST day!

The one way system was also great as it prevented it being over busy
A lot to see we spent over 2.5 hours there and there was certainly more ww could have done
The jewel tower is good to do early and beat the crowds ans the tours

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Visited on 23/08/21, absolutely loved our yeoman warden guide John - amazing and entertaining story teller and also made an effort to acknowledge the bad things going on in the world and made some really touching tributes. Hearing what ranks you would need to reach in the forces etc to be in his position made me feel in awe and quite privileged to be in his presence also. He really made the trip for me! I love visiting the Tower of London and the history of it all is incredible, the whole place is kept immaculately clean, it wasn’t too crowded, queue for Crown Jewels went quicker than anticipated and the staff in all the shops were super helpful and polite (shout out to a couple of staff in the tower shop and a lady in the Raven shop who spent quite some time helping me try to track down a beafeater teddy (tip - if you want one and you see one - buy it!!!! we couldn’t get one in the end despite best efforts as were all sold out)

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Visited Sunday 10am on 29th August 21, had to pre book tickets which were easy to do. Easy to gain entry and pass security checks. Various hand sanitizer stations around the whole site. If you love history then well worth the visit, traitors gate, the torture tower, prison tower, the main tower with Henry 8ths armour and other kings and queens equipment. The crown jules is worth seeing and you go on an escalator which keeps people moving. Be warned lots of steep steps around the towers etc so if you struggle with steps maybe just visit and do the ground stuff. Guards on duty same as Windsor castle, ravens roam free around the grounds who are used to people. Plenty of staff around to ask questions too and gain knowledge from. Per visit it takes 2-3hrs to complete. As usual gift shops around. If you live old British history with kings including Charles 1,2 Henry 3, 8 then worth the visit.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Went on a Friday during school holidays but wasn’t too busy, loads of people but not so many you couldn’t walk through the various rooms and areas to see the exhibits. Listened to one of the yeoman give a history of the Tower, he was really entertaining and knowledgeable and could happily have listened to him all day. I personally wanted to see where Anne Boleyn died and was buried, but there is so much more to see and learn.
As with every tourist attraction in London this was a very expensive day out. Food and drink was fairly mundane in the cafe but absolutely astronomical prices (£7.99 for a very basic sandwich) so I’d recommend you bring your own packed lunch.
For the history and experience I’d recommend this to anyone who is able to climb hundreds of steps and doesn’t mind some degree of crowds.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Went mid week to try and minimise crowds. Good day out BUT be aware of the advertising saying ""Visit now to avoid crowds"". It was PACKED.

Social distancing was utterly impossible and mask wearing was minimal.

Beerfeater Dave led our tour. It was shortened from 60 minutes to 45 but very interesting and entertaining. Not all areas were available to visit and the queue to see the crown jewels was very, very long in the earlier part of the day. We visited towards the end of the day when the queue was much shorter.

Walked through the White Tower, along all (available) battlements, other buildings and grounds but could not cover it all. Planning to return to compete our visit.

I felt that the to the staff this was not just a job but a passion and they wanted to be there, this was evident to how they served the guests with humour and a smile. The only things that could made quicker was the queue to the Crown Jewels and the restaurant only took cards cash not allowed, not made clear until you are at the till with trays full of food.

I would like to thank all the staff for making everyone welcome please keep it up you are appreciated by us guests.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Really enjoyed it, but found awkward jokes aimed to Americans throughout the Beefeater explanation and not sure if he was following a script or was his own improvisation: I am not American, but quite strange to hear that in a tourist area with visitors from all over.

We're from the north, and spending a day in London on our way to Legoland, so had to choose from the many activities the capital offers, but we chose well. Enjoyed the visit, and my son loved it. You can get very close to the crown jewels in their glass cabinets (unlike, for example, the Mona Lisa in Paris).

I really enjoyed the beefeater tour and would recommend it. I think ours was called Mark, he was entertaining and funny, but also full of stories from history. The one criticism I had was that it was pretty gory, and there were young children in the audience.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"You go to the Tower primarily to see the Crown Jewels. They are beautifully presented and it is amazing how close you can get to them. They are well-lit, which makes the jewels sparkle. We visited on a Sunday morning in August 21, so there weren't many international tourists so we walked straight in and spent a long time looking at the jewels without crowds; looking at the queuing system in place I think it must get quite busy.
The rest of the grounds are good too- I was surprised at how much you get to look around.
Many of the Warders are very friendly and helpful but I think some of them are a bit 'clever' and full of themselves. One of them scoffed at my daughter's request for directions as it appeared obvious, but when he realised he was in the wrong because of the Tower's Covid restrictions in place, he 'wound his neck in', to use a military expression.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We visited for the ceremony of the keys where the tower is locked up for the night. This is after the tower is closed to the public and is a guided visit with in our case about 20 people.
It was a fascinating experience which made me realise that royal ceremonies cary on whether any one is watching or not, in this ones case for each day for over 700 years.
It was made special by the yeoman warden (acting as a guide) who was both informative and humorous.
One thing to note is that the paths are cobbled so not the easiest to walk on.
If afterwards you want to get a taxi you need to arrange a car to pick you up afterwards.
There is a taxi rank opposite the entrance but no taxis and trying to flag a taxi down at that time of night is nigh on impossible.

This was fantastic advice as we walked straight in. An hour later queues were very long and continued to get longer. The day was very interesting. We were there for about 2.5hrs. I would say allow more time if your children were older and would allow you to read more! (My kids were 4.5 and 7). It was raining the day we visited.

Information boards about certain events/people all over. It can take a while to get round so make sure you give yourself plenty of time.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I have lived in London almost 10 years and have always had Tower of London on my doorstep so never got around to do it and I’m SO glad I finally have.

We started our tour with the Yeoman Warder who was incredible. He made the door so engaging through his theatrics and incredibly projected voice.

The tour started by the entrance gate and ended in the central court by the White Tower and took roughly 45 mins. I definitely recommend tagging along, it doesn’t cost extra and you learn quite a lot more.

I also recommend queuing for the Crown Jewels as soon as you can as they can get quite long so best get them out of the way earlier rather than later.

There is SO much to see around the Tower and loads of interesting rooms to read about. Our entire visit took around 3.5 hours but you can easily spend more or less than that.

So much history and interesting stories in one location so I would thoroughly recommend a visit for residents and tourists alike

The Beefeater Tour was informative, engaging and very entertaining; the Crown Jewels were outstanding and great to see how they sparkle; walking in the footstep of royalty in the White Tower was amazing. The museum was very interesting to see the journey of the regiment over time and how equipment and uniforms have evolved and not least the ramparts that defended our city. This may have been my first visit but it certainly won’t be my last as there is still much to see.
We also took the opportunity to upgrade our entry tickets to an annual pass, giving us access to other Royal palaces in London and Ireland such a great idea

The Yeoman Warders certainly make the experience of visiting the Tower extra special, met Simon (didn’t get his number) who was delightful and gave my friend and I some excellent advice in terms of avoiding the queues where possible.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"The Beefeater Tour was an excellent experience. Our guide, Scott Kelly AKA Beefy 409, was animated, informative and engaging. Jewels, ravens and historical footsteps in which to walk. An amazing visit today.",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Fantastic day out at tower of london. The yeoman warders tour is incredible, packed full of historical info and funny stories. Funny little live sketch broke out whilst ordering a coffee between two people in full costume, hilarious. Plus the place itself, the buildings the artifacts ,.just incredible. There was a long queue to see the crown jewels but dont be put off it moved very quickly and they are certainly worth the wait to see. Overall highly recommend this as a day out for all ages and now I want to be a raven master !!!!!!",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We were here on the 9th August 2021.
Not crowded, probably a Covid19 aftermath.....
Beefeaters are fantastic, knowledge is unsurpassed and very friendly.
The ravens are inquisitive and massive haha
The whole site is spotless
2 cafes from what I could see, although £6 for a hot dog?
Visit the church of St Peter Ad Vincula.....its where Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard are buried.
The tower is a fascinating place, packed with historic events , ghostly tales and of course the Crown Jewels.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"We visited on a Monday in August and was pleasantly surprised that it was not busy at all.
The free guided tour was worth it, along with the white tower and seeing the crown jewels.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Had an excellent day with the kids at the tower made even more special by an amazing talk and tour by #beefy409
Would recommend everyone visiting currently as is so quiet and you can explore and ask questions",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The whole experience was well organised, which really helped as in our party there was an age range from 5 years old to 80! Very little queuing to get in, gave me hope as the 80 year old has mobility issues and the 5 year old has patience issues...
Once in the grounds, there are always staff to help, either guide you or to ask for information.
There is a travellator system to move you around the crown jewels displays and then there is a good amount of space when witnessing the other spectacular displays. Plus, we were very impressed with the 'White Tower' armour displays. The availability of a cafe, meant that the older person in our group could opt in and out, in comfort, from our adventures.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Crown jewels...fantastic and dazzling.
Visited with husband and teenage daughter. No queues so went straight in. Everything very interesting and well set out. Lots of stairs so not particularly suited to wheelchsir users who woukd miss slot.
Crown jewel collection was breathtaking, and we admire the queen for the strenght she must have to wesr the crown snd hold all the objects of power...they look so heavy.
All in all, a very interesting visit, beefeaters all friendly and knowledgeable .
We thoroughly enjoyed the visit althought teenage daughter thought it was boring",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,A nice tour but at the end of the day we were all done. Best done first and allow time. No issues with tour and Beefeaters do a good talk.,Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Was a fantastic experience that we really enjoyed with plenty to see with lots of very interesting items on display. Was very good be able to get within 2ft of the Crown Jewels used by past and present Monarchs. There’s lots of different area’s so being fairly fit is really a necessity with lots of stairs to climb but well worth it. The only thing I found a little sneaky is when you exit onto the riverside you can only go one way so you have to walk through the gift shop so if you want to visit tower bridge after you have to walk all the way round which is quite a trek straight after walking around the tower for a couple of hours. This could be made much easier if they didn’t want you going through the gift shop and not block the other way off. (Very Sneaky) I wouldn’t suggest it for young children as you could see them getting tired and bored.

The Beefeaters story telling the Crown Jewels and the mystery of the Star of India diamond, just brilliant",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,The tour by the Yeoman was entertaining both for kids and adults. Exploring different towers and especially the White Tower with the armoury for men and horses was fascinating.

UK,Tower of London,3.0,"While I've enjoyed the grounds of the castle and some of the exhibitions, the majority is military-centered and aimed at children more than adults. I would welcome more diverse exhibitions, touching on issues such as women's lives, more information about royal jewels and where they come from (were stolen from...). The tickets are quite expensive, upgrading to membership seems to be a beter option as it give you access to more than one place.",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Such a lovely day out! Educational and entertaining, we really enjoyed our visit. So much trouble had been taken to ensure it was Covid-friendly. Beautiful surrounds - very atmospheric and grand. So much space, so even when it was busy we felt we had lots of room. Friendly and attentive staff. Kicking myself it took a pandemic to visit. Funny how we don't support UK tourism until going abroad is not an option. My husband and I got as much out of it as our children did. Learnt a few new historical facts!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We only had a few hours, would highly recommend to anyone. If you visit? Make sure you go on a beefeater tour - ours was Barry Stringer, he was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about what he does and added humour along the tour. Also a mention to Louisa, who also had passion for what she does and the knowledge she has is brilliant. The only downside to this visit? Was the queues for a coffee, it needs better organisation, I felt sorry for the guy serving us under extreme pressure and people stood there tutting because they had to wait. Other than that? Great day out for all",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We had a great day out. Spent 2+ hours wandering. We did visit the Crown Jewels first thing and I’m

UK,Tower of London,3.0,I was expecting to see more of the torcher devices that were used. However it was excellent to see the Crown Jewels up close.,Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Wonderful to see so much history and this is the time to go because there was no queuing - instant access to the Crown Jewels - and plenty of room to see all aspects of the Tower. One word of warning: don't book tickets through Headout: I booked 4 and had a confirmatory email but only 3 tickets were sent. On requesting the 4th I got an email saying that although it was their mistake there were no more tickets available for that slot and they would be issuing a refund. Not much use when you have a student and 2 kids expecting a day out. I got a 4th through the booking office at the Tower and Headout did issue a refund but it all caused a lot of unnecessary stress and Headout's apologies were scant. Just book through the Tower's booking office and have a great day out!

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Great day out for any age, and a must see ,but need to be mobile and fairly fit to see it all. See the Jewels early - the queue becomes immense. Good restaurant [big portions] at the Armouries. Silly idea to have only one ice cream stall on a very hot , very busy day, with only one poor overloaded lad to run it. Lots of little bits to keep kids interested, like the graffitti. The torture display was declared 'very disappointing' and ' is that all?' by 10 and 8 year olds.",Aug 2021

It was amazing to see and learn all about the tower and to hear about some of the stories that have come out of there. Our guide was incredible (didn’t catch his name, sorry!) but he was brilliant and absolutely made our trip.

Front start to finish was so interesting and funny also the tour guide beefy the Scots guy kept us so entertained with his knowledge and humour",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"The Yeoman or Beefeater was brilliant! Scot Kelly. So informative and funny. Just the right length and kept everyone glued to him. Superb he was. We thought there was too much emphasis on weaponry. Stirling Castle is local to us and in many ways similar to the Tower of London in that many parts of it have been added, removed and changed over the centuries. Would have been good to have characters in dress and acting the part of Henry VIII etc. At Stirling Castle they have lots Royals and a nanny such as Mary Queen of Scots. King James and MQOS Nanny in dress and talking as they did then and acting the part while you asked them questions. This is brilliant. The Royal Rooms have been restored and are fabulous. Yes Stirling Castle was part of the War Machine, but people also lived there. What about the living quarters or prison rooms of captives? We saw lots armour etc but nothing related to the actual living there of people. The Crown Jewels are an awesome sight to behold. Great place to visit but as I said a little less emphasis on the war machine and a little more of how people actually lived there.

What an awesome tour, very humerus, factual, including the gorey bits 😁, and involved the children whom were present in the crowd. Excellent knowledge of the Tower, big beaming smile, and very interesting to listen to. Would highly recommend getting him for a tour. Simply the best
The Tower was an absolute joy to behold. As I grew up not far from there, on the Old Kent Road, it brought back many happy memories of my childhood and I remember always having loved the spectacular Ravens, beautiful as always. Scott was the cherry 🍒 on top of the cake.
Keep up the good work.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Great day out, the beef eaters really make this experience work, not bad when you consider that this is their home. Easy arrival, (pre booking was required and timed entry) but worked very well. The talk with the beef eaters is a must and Colin who did ours (his first in 15 months )was brilliant, he bought the history alive and gave our visit content. The chapel is very moving and of course the Crown Jewels. Food options were good and lots of areas to sit and enjoy a picnic, watch your food one of the ravens had a packet of crisps off somebody before they could react. Shop had the usual tack as well as some well thought out lines to buy. Can get busy and a couple of areas have a challenging access route, hardly surprising when you take in to what the site is.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It was pouring with rain when I visited but I wasn't going to miss my chance. After buying a £30 ticket I went through the main entrance to be greeted by a catapult and some beefeater guards in their black and red outfits. I went into what was once the bedroom of King Edward the First and heard some of the history of the English kings who lived here in the past on a TV screen. You also see the throne room of King Henry the Third, of course the bedroom and throne room are recreations of the originals. There are statues of animals as the kings of the past kept exotic animals here as well. You can find where people were kept imprisoned and even tortured, with some torture devices still lying around. You'll find weapons like a crossbow and and items such as coins and pots from the Middle ages. You'll also get to see the Crown jewels, however you can't take photos of them. Go inside and you'll see crowns and sceptres, huge wine jugs and golden items costing who knows how much. The queen's crown itself rests separately from the rest with a huge diamond in the middle. In the centre of the complex you'll find the White tower, inside are suits of armour worn by different kings and the weapons they used, along with some games for the kids. Sadly there were no ravens when I was there because of the rain but they are an iconic part of the experience as well.

While we were there they had cries acting out scenes , really entertained the children. Facilities were very clean and organised. We'll definitely be back!",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The tower is certainly worth a visit if you are in London, its a beautifully preserved castle with a wonderful setting by the river and tower bridge. We got there earlier than our pre booked time but they let us in anyway, it was quiet on a weekday morning even in the school holidays so didn't feel uncomfortable covid wise. We looked around independently which took about 2 hours or so including a stop for a drink break. It's quite expensive for what it is though and i felt it missed the mark in some respects. When i think of the tower i imagine Anne Boleyn, the princes in the tower, Catherine Howard and the many other unfortunate souls who were imprisoned or died here, instead we were treated to a load of armour clad dummies on plastic horses in the grand white tower which seemed meaningless and out of place. The most gregarious of the crown jewels are rather oddly viewed from a moving walkway, and it was actually Queen Victoria's pretty and understated little crown-ette in a cabinet all on it's own which I liked the most. All in all it's well worth a visit even if it's a bit costly.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,This visit was pre-pandemic. We arrived there right when it opened without any tickets. Thankfully the line to get in and to buy tickets were moving so we jumped in line and was able to tour it quickly before hopping on an afternoon flight. I had watched a few history shows on King Henry so visiting this place really made those stories a lot more vivid. There are lots of signs to learn about this place but it would take a longer time to visit through. I was able to visit this place in about 2 hours and understand most of what I saw from the history documentaries. I recommend visiting this historic tower.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We visited as a family today and thought this was a fantastic attraction. We were lucky enough to catch a guided tour by one of the Yeomen Warders, which was absolutely brilliant. He was so knowledgeable, and all the history is just fascinating.

There was a bit of a queue to see the Crown Jewels but it soon went down. This was something I’d always wanted to see and it didn’t disappoint.

We easily spent a good three hours there with a 1 year old and 9 year old.

I’d say this is probably one of the best attractions in London and the best historical landmark we’ve ever visited. I’d say this is an absolute must if you visit London.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It’s fantastic. Amazing. Steeped in history. History doesn’t come any more concentrated than this. Superb value for money. Take advantage of the on-the-hour beefeater free tours - not because they’re necessarily brilliant talks, but because the beefeaters are living legends and demand the greatest respect. Every stone has a story; every corner a myth. Ravens. Walls within walls. Jewels that command their own price - you think, stones, NO, dazzling - bewitching, well worth viewing. Even the view from the toilets is legendary. You’re absorbed in Anne Boleyn’s execution site BUT turn around - there are few better views: the Tower of London and Tower bridge, breathtaking, magnificent. An absolute must-see when in London.

Very informative and interesting, the best part was the yeoman tour lasting around half an hour but well worth doing as Yeoman Mat made it funny and interesting , even for our teenage son . The knowledge he had was amazing .
Can’t recommend this place enough for all ages .🤩",Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,We caught the guided tour which was definitely worth doing as the guides give a good insight into the history and happenings of the tower. The Crown Jewels are a must and quite unbelievable to think they are worn by royalty and then popped back into the tower. A good afternoon out. Some nice shops to stock up on souvenirs. Ravens are massive and quite tame. Allow 3 hours.,Jul 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London. Visited at 12 midday, last week of July and I expected it to be very busy but it wasn't perhaps due to the pandemic and minimum tourists so it made the visit more pleasant. So glad the yeoman warder tour was back on,big shout out to 'Shady' who was informative and fun bringing all its history to life. Would recommend hiring an audio guide for adults & older kids as you walk through each section of the tower for £5 each. Spent around 3 hours here, well worth it.",Jul 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We went on the last Beefeater tour of the day with Yeomen Scott Kelly #Beefy409 on 29th July 2021.

What an amazing time we had...
Yeomen Scott Kelly entertained the crowds with lots of information about the Tower's history by getting all the crowd involved in cheering and shouting when needed, he even checked that the children amongst the group were happy to hear all about the blood & gore. The enthusiasm he had throughout the tour while giving you the information made you want to continue the tour and were able to gain more knowledge as it's done in a fun way.
At the end of the tour there was the opportunity to ask questions and take photos, you can see by his smile that it's a genuine smile and that he really loves his job!
We had such as amazing time and could not recommend this tour enough.

Despite some iffy weather our yeoman guide (Basher) was highly engaging, bringing history life for all ages.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"It’s the Tower of London, so it’s something with a unique history that’s got to be seen at some point if you’re British. The history speaks for itself and would be worth 5 stars so this is more about the way it’s displayed and managed.

It was an ok and pretty good experience, however I would have preferred more displays about the people who used the tower (to imprison and be imprisoned) and less about the wider context of war and weapons. For example I couldn’t find anything about Mary Queen of Scots despite her being a prisoner there.

The beefeaters and ravens were very friendly/engaging and helped to make it a more interactive experience.

Given I’d paid £30 for one adult and one child it was irritating to be constantly plagued by shops and machines selling trinkets. It was also annoying that we were not allowed to exit to tower bridge and so I had to walk the (really) long the way round with a small child, it seems this was just to get us to walk through another gift shop again!

But now is the time to go, with no international tourists and no queues!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant now the whole Tower is open; there is so much to see, It never disappoints. One welcome return are the Yeoman Warder guided tours which are a must. I had the privilege of joining hashtag Beefy 409 Scott Kelly's guided tour. He is a natural orator and really brought the history of the Tower to life. There was plenty of blood and gore, which thrilled the children present... but it was lovely to hear the story of Lady Jane Grey and get a sense of the pity of the place. We were all given homework to research Jane. I suspect there will be a fair amount of google searching going on as Scott brought a real sense of empathy to her story.

All credit to the rest of the Yeoman Wardens working at the Tower today who were nothing but kind, considerate and helpful. A fantastic day out.

You do need comfy footwear as it is all cobbled and can be a little hard walking, make sure you have plenty of time to visit the Tower as there is so so much to see.
Would certainly visit again and again.

When you enter the site you will see a board for the next time. Definitely worth the money. We spent 3 hours at the site. Cafe on site or you could bring a picnic and have after you leave over looking the Thames. Lots of walking and stairs if you do have little ones or have mobility issues. If you are visiting the Tower not much close by in terms of other attractions apart from the Sky Garden which I highly recommend. You will need to book a slot for this too.,Jun 2021

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Even as a londoner, it's a very interesting place to visit. To really get the true value of visiting the Tower of London, you should make sure to join the beefeater tour (free with standard tickets) that take place frequently. Understanding the real history behind so much of the Tower of London makes a huge difference to your experience. Our tour guide (the self proclaimed chubby William Shatner) was fantastically funny, inclusive and open to provide even more history than what is just part of the tour. The same goes in the crown jewels area, do spend time asking some of the helpers as they are happy to share interesting aspects that you might not be aware of just from walking around and reading the notes on the walls.

Our guide said he hadn't taken a tour for 17 months due to Covid but you wouldn't know it as he knew how to entertain a crowd and was clearly very knowledgeable.
It's a wonderful time to go now - just after covid regulations have been lifted it's not too busy but everything was open. We didn't even have to queue to see the Crown Jewels which are worth the visit just on their own.",Jul 2021

If you want blood, sweat, shock horror and gore and I mean gore then he is your Yeoman to give you it all.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Overall I was very pleased with my visit to the tower. The staff were very friendly and the sights were beautiful. Lines weren't long and the food actually respectfully prices. The only thing I did find was sometimes the one way systems are too long, we got roped into one at the very start of the entrance and it didn't let us back out until halfway around the castle! Similarly, there are two gift shops in the actual tower but you cannot enter them unless you do the whole tour so I'd recommend just skipping those gift shops and going to the one on the pier just outside of the exit. There was a lot of interesting history but I would definitely avoid going on weekends so you actually have more time and space to read the signs.

We did feel more could be done to bring the tower to life, lots of huge rooms that are almost empty. This place has so much history, yet what’s on show and portrayed barely scratches the surface.

The staff weren’t particularly helpful, the team on the gate weren’t friendly and the guy serving ice creams by the white tower was a miserable so and so. He made it clear he hated his job.

The ravens were almost close enough to touch and the little talk at the green where Jane and Anne met their ends reduced me to tears.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Really enjoyed this day out. As English Heritage members it was nice to link the Tower with other local attractions.
The area is a lot bigger than I imagined and I would say to allow more than 2 hours for your visit.
Some areas would not be pushchair or wheelchair friendly as you can imagine...these buildings won't have lifts as I'm not sure they were invented in 1500s.
Cafe very expensive as you cam imagine. Not only because its London but also because its an attraction in London. I paid £15 for 2 coffees and 2 cakes. I mean the cakes were lovely! Staff in cafe very friendly.
Only thing that put a dampner on it for me was getting a scolding in the crown jewels exhibit. I didnt see any signs saying no photographs and as I was taking a picture of the queen's jewels I heard a booming voice behind me trying to get my attention and finally yelling at me 'no'.
I was embarrassed and actually had a moment when I left the building. I went round to check if there were signs and there was 1 small sign amongst other information saying no photographs.
I was stood in a que watching the guards so didn't see this sign. There was someone on the door letting us in in dribs and drabs so maybe they could mention something in future.
Had a really good day though and hope to revisit...where my camera would stay firmly in my.pocket, when I next visit her majesty's precious stones.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"As a London local it was 25 years since I last visited the Tower so the ticket price came as a bit of a shock! However COVID days suggested that this might be a good time and I was not disappointed.

As to the Tower itself, our trip speaks for itself: we arrived before 10.00 am and left at closing time. There was so much to see and it was all well exhibited and explained. The audio tour (an extra £4) was also well worth having. I imagine that the Crown Jewels is normally full to the brim with tourists whereas we were able to take our time and take several rides on the travelator.

The staff are friendly and helpful and clearly value working for such a national institution. If you fancy a trip to the Tower, now (July 2021) is an ideal time to go and avoid the tourist hordes. Be prepared to spend some time there in order to see all the various parts of the Tower (at least 4 hours I would have thought).

Unfortunately their online booking system was rubbish but the staff at the ticket office sorted things out. Make sure you get your Booking Reference number.

UK,Tower of London,1.0,"As a regular visitor to London, both personally and also leading school groups to the theatre and other venues, I have never been to what is, statistically, the most popular visitor attraction in the country. Having taught English for over 40 years, knowing English history was both enjoyable and obligatory; to teach Shakespeare without a sound understanding would have proved impossible.
So, now retired, I agreed to visit the Tower to see what I had been missing. What a massive disappointment it was. I started with an open-minded approach as we walked around the battlements and looked inside some of the smaller turret rooms, which contained clear information. However, the tour started to grate on me with the Line of Kings, all fully armoured on horseback; apart from the absurd historical inaccuracy, what does this say about our history? That we just like to go to war? Ridiculous. Shortly afterwards, we went to look at what is meant to be the outstanding highlight - the Crown Jewels. Yes, I can understand the moving conveyer belt process, but what struck me as more significant is that all the jewels, gold, cups and other finery only came into existence from the reign of Charles II in the 17th C onwards - and he himself did certainly amass quite a horde. In fact, it seemed to me that the Crown Jewels themselves were - and possibly remain - a political statement about the primacy of the monarchy after the Restoration. The collection of armoury, the symbols of historic warfare, also left me cold. Caged ravens too? Really? The rest of our exploration, including dungeons and the chapel, failed to impress by this point.
And the final insult, for me at least, was being obliged to exit through the Gift Shop and walk a long way around, 20 minutes, back to our hotel - which would have bee a brief 5 minutes stroll along the river bank, had we been allowed to do so.

Conclusion - militarism, royalist propaganda and money- making. The best experience of the Tower of London is from the river or from a higher building such as the Sky Garden.

The exhibit in the white tower of the horses was amazing as was everything else. Going to see the Crown Jewels was the highlight of the visit and I found it a emotional experience, seeing those beautiful jewels and learning about them was amazing.

A beefeater who lives within the Tower of London led our tour and made it an absolute blast. Everything he shared was fascinating and his fun sense of humor had everyone laughing throughout.

The Crown Jewels are kept in the Tower of London and I could hardly believe that I was standing in front of all of them at one point. Don't skip the tour -- it added so much value and knowledge to the whole experience.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,A really good afternoon. Interesting visit and plenty to see. It was quiet given covid entry numbers and that probably made a difference. No beefeater tour though. They have clearly struggled to fill some of the white tower rooms with stuff and it feels like they've found whatever they could to fill the space. The Torture at the Tower 'exhibition' was rubbish. Has an unusual 'village' feel to the grounds. Would defintiely recommend the visit.,Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"First visit here, was very surprised that so many buildings fit into such a compact space. It was also weird how this historic building was surrounded with some of London's modern buildings. Security and Covid-19 restrictions were spot on, with plenty of hand sanitation dotted around. At first I thought the entry fee was a bit steep, but the place is basqued in history and loads to see. Food was definitely expensive, so bear this in mind. Staff are great, including the Beefeaters who were great at answering questions. If you are interested in the Towers past, this is the place to go.",Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,This is definitely a highlight of London and must-see. There is so much history here and presented in a great way for families of all ages. The Yeoman are wonderful and give great information. Definitely go to the Crown Jewels first as queues do pick up later and the White Tower had a queue after we had been in as well. A couple of places were sadly closed but the majority was open and my family had an enjoyable time. Toilets were clean and the shop was full of nice trinkets.,Jun 2021

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We spent almost 5 hours here one Saturday and we enjoyed every second of it. It's a huge site packed with history lessons every few paces. It's brilliantly organised, absolutely fascinating and staffed by fantastic people who clearly love what they do. The Beefeaters are amazing, wonderful with kids and those young visitors all seem to love them. My favourite but was the Crown Jewels but there is so much more to enjoy. I don't like the fact that they still messAges there and clip their wings. I feel that this is such an old fashioned superstition and that we ought to have left it in the 20th Century. I feel that it is cruel and unnecessary and should be stopped. But that aside, this is a brilliant family friendly full day out worth every penny of the entrance fee.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Having watched a recent documentary on the Tower on the TV my son was very keen to visit and experience this for himself.

Upon entering we were directed to the knight school which was set out very well on the lawn just outside the main entrance, it was very well organised and social distancing was not a problem as we all had our own little boxes to sit it. After about 10 mis my son became bored (nothing to do with the event it just want his sort of thing) so we decided to head straight to the Crown Jewels and I am so glad we did. There was no queue and we just walked straight in. My son was amazed at the displayed and certainly lived up to his expectations.

The Beefeaters were lovely and more than happy to engage in conversation about where we had come from and pose for a socially distanced photo.

A lovely day out to learn about the history of the Tower and its contribution to the London landscape

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Firstly admission is by scanning of your ticket QR code, either on mobile device or printed sheets. There are ticket machines nearby, but don't join the queue without a ticket. You don't get to skip the line at the Tower of London, as everyone joins the same queue with pre-bought tickets. Once inside, if you have young children, you can currently take them to Knight School where they'll learn how to become a knight, albeit socially distanced. You'll then follow the route around and see all the different towers, and rooms, but if you want to see the crown jewels, I'd advise going straight to them if you arrive early, this will reduce your waiting time. There really is a lot to see and it will take a good 3-4 hours to see it all. There are at least three gift shops, an ice cream vendor and a resturant on site too, but prices aren't cheap. I'd at least bring a bottle of water and save yourself £3 for a tiny bottle of drink, Royal Palace members get it slightly cheaper. I had a very enjoyable visit and whilst I'll never need to do it again, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't been yet.

The place is steeped in History and you find out so much as you're walking around. It was a glorious day too and the =ir weren't massive amounts of people there. My only disappointment was that we did not have enough time to really look around! This is not the Tower of London's fault though. The tube trains on the central and district line were closed so we had to walk about 50 minutes from our hotel. We then had to be at another attraction at 2! I would definitely recommend checking TFL for any train disruptions as this place really does need a good couple of hours to absorb it all in.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I’m torn.

We visited at 9.30am in half term. Had a brilliant visit in spite of the rain.

We pretty much had the place to ourselves but that was the excellent and sad at the same time. The lack of tourists means that we could walk round the Crown Jewels and other exhibits over and over with no pushing or jostling but the place generally felt a bit sad.

Also, the Yeoman warders couldn’t give their usual tours and that was a big loss.

Hence, we went round pinching ourselves at how much space and time we had there but also with a tinge of sadness that it needs more people to visit.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"How do you describe the most famous attraction in London in your own words?

Well starting on a lighter note. There are fat, well fed, most healthy looking anti vegetarian ravens that eat better than most 3rd world country population. And their human beefeating counterparts and tower caretakers, The Royal Bodyguards.

Tower was also the first zoo in London before they moved all animals to Regents Park zoo. How did they transport the African lion, elephant and a polar bear to London in middle ages? Is another Tower secret.

Then we have the crown jewels and the famous or infamous cursed diamond Koh-i-Nûr that works only for women.

The gun and cannon salute is another deafening experience in this place surrounded by glass skyscrapers but you can only see that on special occasions.

And now the less glamorous part. Tower had a chilling horrifying reputation. The dreaded dark side of 'The Bloody Tower' is that just like any other castle/fort in the world, Tower was also used as a prison, torture and execution site for common, political prisoners including royals themselves. Many English kings, queens and princes were beheaded in Tower. King Henry alone executed 3 of his wives here.

Since countless people were killed and buried within these stone walls, unsurprisingly the tower is haunted by the ones who were apparently innocent but punished anyway.

And it wasn't just about the olden times, executions were taking place till WW2 with the help of firing squad. And this capital punishment used to be done in front of public where us tourists roam around now.

Hampton Court Palace has parking facilities. The Tower and Kensington Palace don't but are very near tube stations.

The Crown jewels in the Tower were a highlight, the Queen Victoria tour at KP and the Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace. Henry V111 fans will find much to see at HCP including the superb Great Hall, the Royal Apartments and kitchens.

KP has some spectacular jewellery, a suite of rooms showcasing where Queen Victoria was raised and the room where she was told aged 18 that she had become the Queen.

The Tower was interesting with lots of armour, the Crown Jewels as well as the very poignant spot where prominent Royals were executed. The Yeoman of the Guard were very knowledgeable and were happy to answer questions.

Buying the Historic Royal Palaces yearly pass for £55 was a good move and means that you can visit as often as you like in the year, usually, but is subject to the restrictions of Covid at the moment. 😑

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Tower of London is a popular tourist attraction situated on the bank of the River Thames. The Tower of London was a prison from which there was supposedly no escape. Throughout its history, the building has been a fortress, prison, palace, and has even served as a zoo. There is a well-exposed armory here, as well as an exhibition of weapons, coronation insignia and jewels. The Tower Fortress is still inhabited today. Its community is made up of Yeomen Warders and their families, the Resident Governor, officials, and a chaplain and a doctor. The symbol of the Tower are the ravens that live in the towers of the fortress. They are particularly protected and fed, and they also have their guardian among the guards. The reason is the legend that says that as long as the ravens live in the fortress, the British Empire will last. For history lovers, this is a real intellectual treat. For many exhibits, descriptions in several languages, A well-guided visitor's route allows you to get to know this place well. A must see in London.

There were no Yeoman tours available that day so we booked standard tickets and paid an extra £5 each for the audio guidebooks which were really interesting and informative and made the Tower visit easy to follow. I would recommend the audio guidebooks if you can’t book a real-life tour. We were able to see the Crown Jewels which was super impressive and well worth the visit, even just for that! We also saw the White Tour which is now a museum (I recommend doing that last), and the famous Ravens protecting the Tower. The only thing we could see was the prison, it was closed. I’m not sure if it was closed due to Covid-19 restrictions or just generally closed as it wasn’t clear but nevertheless there is a lovely space outside where you can sit on a bench and listen to the audio guidebook explaining about all of the infamous characters who were executed there! Just beside there you can see the beefeaters guarding the entrance to the Crown Jewels. A lovely visit and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something to do in London!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"My travelling buddy & I started our day by visiting the Tower of London as I wanted to see the Crown Jewels. We headed to the closest underground station which was Tower Hill & crossed the road to get to the Tower of London.

Since we had bought the London Pass, entry to The Tower of London which was £28.90 was free. All we had to do was show the London Pass app on our respective handphones to the gatekeeper & get it scanned & we were in!

We joined the Yeoman Tour as it is included in the price of an entry ticket. The tour lasts approximately 45 minutes to an hour & departs every 30 minutes. We were all led into the chapel of St Peter & Vincula to listen to a Yeoman who talked about the Tower’s stories. The Chapel is also the burial place of 3 Queens of England - Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard & Jane Grey. All were accused of adultery & treason.

After the tour, we were led out of the chapel. We caught the “Changing of the Guards” session. It was so surreal. The guards were smartly dressed of course!

We saw 2 of the Tower’s black ravens. They were on the ground & looked pretty much comfortable in the presence of humans. Currently, there are 7 ravens, in case 1 goes missing. Legend has it that if 6 ravens were to leave the court, the Tower will fall. The ravens are looked after by the Raven Master. Apparently, their wings have been clipped. There was also a huge canon on display for that instagram photo!

Our 2nd stop was to the Crown Jewels. The queue was long & we waited close to 45 minutes before going in. The wait was worth it as we got to see the magnificent Crown Jewels on display. In my opinion, the most beautiful tiara on display was Queen Victoria’s Emerald Tiara. The Imperial State Crown which Queen Elizabeth II wore during her coronation was also displayed. Photography & video recording were not allowed as expected.

There was a gift shop nearby & we dropped in as a 10% discount is given on all items to London Pass holders. Sadly, even with the discount, the items were quite expensive. Hence, we left empty-handed.

Next was our visit to the White Tower, an example of Norman architecture in the heart of the Tower of London & one of the most iconic symbols in Britain. The Chapel of St John is in the White Tower. Basically, you can see the Royal Armouries in the White Tower & a dragon armour sculpture too!

We also visited the Bloody Tower. It was where the 2 princes, Edward & Richard were kept before their disappearance. It was also thought that they were murdered there.

Overall, I think half a day is required to visit all the places in The Tower of London.

UK,Tower of London,2.0,"My friend and I Visited the Tower today, but it wasn’t really anything like we expected. It’s just a glorified musuem. I paid £25 a ticket, it was supposed to include The Crown Jewels, but the queue was ridiculously long, at least a 2 hour wait, we are in our 60’s and would never be able to queue that long. there should have been set times to queue for the jewels, There were no Yeomen guided tours, assumedly because if the pandemic, so all we saw were a few exhibits, a few information plaques and not much else.
We treated ourselves to a scone with cream and jam and a cappuchino each and it came to a whopping £14! And they even charge a fiver each for the audio guides!
I know they have lost millions due to lockdown, but these prices are just extortionate!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"What a great day out. We went on Sunday and weren’t disappointed. It was FAR quieter than you’d normally expect but this only enhanced our visit, as it gave us lots of time to see everything, even saw the Crown Jewels twice, and there were no crowds at all. We felt extremely safe going and would highly recommend it.

The staff were all extremely friendly & super knowledgeable. It was such he a nice experience to be able to chat to staff & ask lots of questions, which they answered with ease and gave us lots of other information, too. Thank you Luis (white tower) and Barry who chatted with us for a while and we’re so friendly with our children.

This was not to be as the tours have been suspended due to Covid safety restrictions. I abandoned the audio guide as although the facts were given, it was dry and boring for teenagers. There are Beefeaters dotted around the Towers who will answer any questions, but if you don't know the questions to ask.......

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Being a Londoner, we don’t often do activities like this as a family - we think of them as expensive, crowded and touristy. But given the Covid restrictions, we’ve been trying to see more of this marvellous city we live in as well as support these venues. And I’m so glad we did! The Covid safety precautions here are great - timed tickets make entry seamless and it was just so well managed and clean, and smooth and uncrowded - brilliant for seeing everything, especially the crown jewels! The standout bit was just how friendly the staff are - the beefeaters are amazing of course, so knowledgeable and helpful. But every member of staff stood out as being incredibly good at customer service.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"One of the strange upsides to visiting during these ‘Covid’ times is the lack of fellow visitors.
If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the Tower and all it’s history now is that time. We visited today, 11am on Saturday 24th October and enjoyed unrivalled access to many of the towers, grounds and of course the Crown Jewels. To visit these normally requires extended queuing, crowds and bustle with no time to enjoy. Today we could spend as long we wanted admiring royal treasures dating from centuries long past.
The ability to stop and chat with unhurried and friendly Yeoman Warders was well worth the effort, they’ve always got tales to tell!

It was well worth it the info was good and the different people talking meant it didn’t get boring. There were hardly any people there so we were free to wander and spend as long as we wanted on each place. There was so much more in there than we expected. The amoury was huge. The jewels were fascinating. We were lucky with the weather to only pouring down as we were leaving so we had good views whilst walking the walls and grabbing a coffee we had to shelter in alcoves in the walls as the indoor cafe had just shut.
The beefeaters were wandering about and happy to talk or advice on route and excipits.
We both felt really old due to the age of the soldiers lol.
We spent 5 hours in there.
The shop wasn’t to bad on prices either as many attractions charge crazy prices.

Well I love London quite a lot but when I stepped into this castle, I genuinely forgot I was somewhere that was constantly busy on the outside. There is a one way system around the tower and reminders for social distancing and sanitizing. Plenty of benches to sit on if you just want a rest, to take the castle in or watch the guards. Yeoman warders are everywhere and will fill you up with lots of information on the castle, their job and so much more. I loved this visit, I will definitely return at some point probably when COVID is a little more relaxed and other areas of the castle are open such as the prison area. The crown jewels were my favourite part, just beautiful.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Visited early October, wanting to take advantage of the lack of crowds, (and kids!) and it was a great success. The Beefeater Tours are not currently being run which was a shame but we did opt for the Audio Tour at £5 per head so we would get history and context to what we were seeing.
We have suffered some dreadful audio guides at attractions before so can confidently say this really was one of the best. The technology was very modern and easy to use, the audio very clear and informative and the visual guide on the smart screen of the device logical and easy to read, even in sunlight. The guide is actually several different tours to different areas of the palace, each perhaps 20 to 30 minutes so you can choose which you do and in which order. I would say do them all, especially when it was as quiet and comfortable to move about as it is now. Good value at £5.
We had no concerns re Covid the whole time and staff were in evidence throughout cleaning and wiping surfaces.
There were no queues and we saw everything really easily. It’s also important to say that the history, grounds, displays and building are amazing. The difficulty is trying to ‘get your head around’ the fact the tower has stood pretty much as it is for 1,000 years!

I would highly recommend engaging the service of a Blue Badge Guide. They are sorely in need of work and highly trained, brilliant people who bring these ancient places alive. Rather than staring at the Tower thinking its pretty and old, having a guide there allows you to realise it was the skyscraper of its day, made of stone that William the Conqueror had brought from Normandy to mark his arrival. We used Keith F Bates, but whomever you choose, it is truly worth it.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Trying to find affordable child friendly things to do in London isn’t easy but Tower Bridge with it’s glass floored walkway was both fun and great value. However, once you’ve climbed the stairs (lift available for wheelchairs & buggy’s only) it’s a very short experience. The glass floor section is only a few meters long, so everyone up there is huddled around this one section and once you’ve managed to find a space to take a pic of the traffic below, you head back down again. We’re we’re only on the bridge for 15mins! You can then visit the engine room but my kids weren’t at all interested in that part of the experience.

Anyway, there's a few steps to climb although they also have a lift.
All the staff were lovely and so welcoming, I would rate it as one of the best welcomes for a tourist attraction anywhere. They were happy to talk to you and ask how you were enjoying the visit. Everywhere was clean, the engineering inside awesome and the engine rooms was fascinating. I love Victorian engineering - the frills were added just because they could, now there is little pride in such things.
Two adults and a child ticket we felt was great value and we even got to use some spotless toilets in the bridge!
Highly recommend it - remember to take a photo of your feet on the glass floor and look up as there are mirrors...

The operators should be praised for installing special windows which can be opened purely to take photos. Otherwise you would be left with the possibility of reflections, which can spoil your image. At the time of my visit only the west side was open to the public, so you are more likely to get a spectacular sunset than sun rise. Elsewhere, there are enough signs (in English) to guide you around the main features of the construction and operation of the bridge. They lost a point from me for having a 30 minute wait for pre-booked admission (it was a busy day, school holiday and I got the final pre-booked slot of the day).

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Booking is essential as queues do build up. Arrive early and book an early slot if you can. Print each ticket issued as a swop is done for entrance to the engine rooms at the end of the high tour.
There is a lift for those of less agile ability or laziness. The rise in the box does not detract from the view of those out of breath at the top. A short presentation is provided in a seating area for those athletes to warm down, and those from the lift to smile a lot, as the screen shows the story of construction. The talk was given by a non native speaker who was hard to decipher.
Walk out onto the upriver spar that has camera view ports built into the perspex coverings. Bring a stool if you are vertically challenged. Avoid the see through section in the centre of the bridge if you manage to get there beyond you fear of heights'. The is a mirrored ceiling that allows unusual poses at this point. Some will not be able to look up for looking down!!!!
At the South Tower, the roof has been opened out to reveal the intricate construction and has some statue figures depicting builders of the day and a foreman.
If Howard is on duty, he will ask you to spot the hammer.
Down again in the lift to join the public with a short walk to the Engine Room over plaques in memory of those involved in the history. Tickets checked and through the gift shop into the now defunct original machinery spaces. Fascinating to see how it all worked in the good old days of steam. No Eco here. It would have destroyed trade and affected the world we live in today.
Pictures and stories align the walls to the exit and the end of a brilliant tour.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Best advice is to take the stairs! Sounds illogical when there is a lift. Although there are some 200 steps, the journey didn't seem like it as you can pause to read the information along the way that is available as well as some audio/visual showings. You also see the structure. All this you would miss if you took the lift. Once you arrive at the top, you have the walkway experience with some unique views up and downstream. Also, there is a glass bottom part of the walkway. Its only for a short section but fascinating to watch different behaviours to it. It does not cover the full width, leaving enough non glass to walk on, but wide enough for an immersive experience if you can manage it. A great birds eye view of the traffic and pedestrians directly below your feet. You then descend the other tower.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"An often overlooked tourist attraction, we wanted to experience the bridge from the top! Tickets were easy to book and access was fine, from the bridge itself. If there is a Queue you just need to look around at London's skyline to be distracted.

You are left to explore the bridge yourself using a one way system. There is a lift for those who require it but you get a good sense of the scale of towers by using the steps. There is plenty information about the bridge and towers and its history. We spent around an hour exploring the bridge, the crossing and glass floor!! Then an unexpected bonus of seeing the engine rooms that you access via the gift shop - easy to miss this but worthwhile as they are still obviously operational. Great, unique experience :)

The views from up here are superb, and there are little slide open ones fso your images aren't through glass.
If you are not keen on heights, then you can walk next to the glass floor, rather than over it......not telling you which I did. You can spend as long as you like up here.
You walk down the south tower, then follow the track to the engine room, some superb pieces of machinery here, and shiney clean too......some super sized spanners. There are some really good films and information down here too.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Almost everyone whose heard of London has heard of Tower Bridge. It's appeared in numerous movies, perhaps the most recent was ""Spiderman: Far from Home"". It's an iconic landmark. Most tourists who visit London plan to visit it, walk across it and take photos. What most people don't realise however, is that the upper structure is a walkway that was built to allow pedestrians to cross even when the bridge was raised. This walkway is still open today, albeit for a fee, which also includes access to the old engine room and guides on hand to talk about the history of the bridge. When visiting, there are 2 ways to reach the top, by walking up 206 steps or by using the lift/elevator. The lift wasn't working on the north side on the day of my visit, which meant I climbed the stairs and I'm so glad I did as I got to see the original colour of the bridge, some great views out of the windows and saw lots of history including how the bridge opens and how a man once jumped the bridge in a red London bus. Once up the top a guide greets you and tells you interesting facts about the making of the tower and points to a photo of a man who fell from the tower during construction, then swam to the shore and climbed back to the top and continued working. Then comes the main event, the upper walkway. This is where Spiderman fought Mysterio in the movie. Right in the centre is a glass floor where people either jump up and down on it to prove they wont fall through, or cower at the sides. Through the floor you can see traffic passing over the bridge. At the sides of the walkway are windows which offer great views of the Thames and includes small sliding windows which open to allow you to take photos without reflections from the windows. Once across you can either go down the steps or use another lift. Once back at ground level you can visit the old engine room, see the old boilers, use the restrooms and visit the gift shop. Whilst it's not necessarily an attraction you'd keep coming back to, it is definitely something worth visiting, it's different from the usual tourist attractions but isn't expensive either.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,Visited tower bridge today and done the experience for the first time it is worth noting that there is a lot of steps to get to the high walk ways but there is a lift available for the less able bodied visitors the guides are quite knowledgeable they where doing 2 different talks in both towers there is also 2 short films on the towers and another in the engine room where there is also guides on hand to answer any questions. On both high walk ways there is part glass floors what i didn't walk on as I had a slight case of vertigo the Guide who was by the glass floors pick up on this and asked if I needed any help unfortunately I didn't catch his name but thanks to him. Otherwise the views are amazing,Jun 2021

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Hard to add anything to the previous review by the Walsh family, which was spot on.

You get to walk across the top of one of the World's iconic bridges, as well as seeing behind the scenes and it's inner structure and engine room.

The views of the Thames are good and walking across the glass walkway 137 feet above the river is certainly bracing. Don't worry, you can avoid the glassed walk of doom, if you'd rather, but the sense of elation and achievement my wife felt from completing it, having been initially inclined to give it a body swerve, is almost impossible to quantify.

When we went at the beginning of June, we were the only ones up there as well, apart from staff. It really is a great time to visit London at the moment.

I’ve always wanted to explore inside the tower and found the family ticket offer reasonable. There’s not actually a great deal inside but the views look west across the Thames were amazing and the high bridge glass cross walk was certainly a highlight for both us and the children. All can be explored within an hour or less - wasn’t too busy/ over crowded and all the staff from security to guides were very welcoming and friendly.

Then you return to the bottom, walk round the corner and go to the engine rooms, this is also great to look around. There is a gift shop before you leave so you can get a gift before you leave. I would recommend this experience for adults and children, the staircases are wonderful.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"As the world starts to heal and people adjust to the evolving new normal, it’s great to see visitors returning to familiar London icons that make it such a special city.

If you are in London, take a walk along the south side of the river for fabulous views of Tower Bridge and Tower of London and then walk across Tower Bridge, with or without going to the top, and explore Tower of London and the surrounding area. It will transport you to another time in history and help escape from the pandemic paranoia for a while.

The views are especially stunning at sunrise and sunset.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Came here last week with my partner and our three youngest children (aged 17, 14 and 12). Tickets had to be purchased in advance on line and were for set times. Covid measures in place – social distancing, hand sanitiser, masks, one way system etc.
Got some great photos from the open windows and also loved the glass walkway. Lots of interesting information as well, regarding the history of the bridge and a short film to watch. The Engine Room is accessed after you come out of the tower – not much to see there, but added to the visit. I would definitely recommend a visit – even if it is just for the glass walkway and the views.

Shame there is a lot of the windows covered in blue fact film which blocks the view. The engine room and shop are a very short walk away. I wish, as I have a complete lack of engineering experience, that there was a guide who could talk about the fascinating Victorian engineering. This needs to be address as I also saw several other guest looking bewildering at the large engineering exhibits. Highly recommended.",Apr 2021
UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Having been to London many many times, this was the first trip where we realised you can actually go up inside Tower Bridge. And at £10.50 per adult it’s not a rip off price either.
Lots of stairs to climb initially but this is broken up with facts about the bridge to stop and read. Once at the top the view was great. There are photo windows rather than a mass open expanse which is great if you’re not good with heights. The walkway includes a glass section where you can see below to the bridge and river beneath you. The ticket price also includes entry to the engine rooms where you can see how the bridge was operated initially.
Allow about an hour-90 minutes in total for your trip. It’s well worth the money!

The tour of the bridge is really informative about the history of the bridge itself, but also so many personal stories about the people that have worked on it and within it in the last 150 years. The old engine room is on display with brilliant interactive explanations of the workings. We paid about £10 per adult and spent a wonderful hour or so looking around, but we didn't dally or stop to rest. There are a number of stairs to climb but a lift is available.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Tower Bridge was our 1st stop in the morning. It was part of the London Pass. Normal tickets are priced at £9.80. Many including myself had thought it was the London Bridge whereas London Bridge can be seen visibly ahead.

There were loads of information on the Tower Bridge itself. It was built in the 1800s during Queen Victoria’s reign as London Bridge had become too crowded. A competition for the bridge design was held & Sir Horace Jones had proposed for a bascule bridge. He eventually became the Tower Bridge’s architect which opened in 1894. It took 8 years to build with a construction cost of £1.124 million.

Tower Bridge is a combination of a bascule & suspension bridge. Ten men died during its making. It has 2 towers in Victorian Gothic style & a pair of walkways were built between them. The base of each tower holds machines that will lift the bridge upwards to let ships pass beneath it. Hydraulic pumps driven by steam were used til 1976 before switching to electric motors. The walkways were intended to be used when the bridge was raised. Unfortunately, it became a haven for prostitutes & robbers. Thus, it was closed from 1909 & reopened in 1982 as part of Tower Bridge’s Exhibition where photos & films were displayed to showcase its history. The walkways are now fitted with see through glass panels, 42 metres above the River Thames. Since then, Tower Bridge has been an icon, one of London’s most popular tourist attractions. In 2018, functional & atmospheric lights were also installed.

It’s interesting to know that most of the architects & engineers were English except for 1 man. He studied in England but came from the Gujarat region of India & worked until the bridge was completed. There was only 1 female staff working at Tower Bridge. She was Charlotte Olive Burch who worked as a maid in the 1st Bridgemaster’s household.

My friend & I stood on the glass panel & saw the busy traffic below. It was so surreal. The glass floor is made of 5 thick layers & can hold the weight of an elephant & 2 taxis. We also saw many of London’s panoramic skyline view of landmarks from a dedicated glass window which can be opened. It was very breezy from up above.

The original pumping engines, accumulators & boilers were on display in the Engine Rooms. We saw them all. Newly commissioned films were also shown to explain each role. We ended the tour by going into Tower Bridge’s Gift Shop where you are spoilt for choice for that perfect memento. It’s definitely a trip to remember.

You can actually find out when the bridge will be lifted up to let ships pass by checking Tower Bridge’s website. You will know which ship or vessel will pass, the date & time well in advance. So, it’ll be good to check beforehand so that you can time your visit & see the bridge being lifted upwards while you’re standing on the glass floor. I wished I had done so but I only knew about it after my visit. So, here’s a good tip for future visitors.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,Saw the bridge from the Sky Garden during this visit. Tower Bridge means London. It is one of the main things to see when visiting the city.,Oct 2020
UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"I’ve lived in London for over 25 years and for many years this iconic landmark figured in my daily commute. I’ve walked across it many times, photographed it often, and taken international visitors there. I’ve seen the bastules raised, and been under the bridge in a boat when the bascules had to be raised. But it was not until I received a newsletter from my local London council (Southwark) mentioning the fact that residents of Southwark can actually see inside the bridge and the engine rooms, climb up a tower and walk across one of the two walkways high above the bridge, for the princely sum of £1.00. The normal ticketing cost of this Tower Bridge experience is £10.60. The £1.00 ticket is a ‘Community Ticket’ available to residents of Southwark, Tower Hamlets and the City of London, and you have to show proof of your residency, of course.

Whilst you can just roll up to purchase tickets, it’s best to purchase them on-line in advance, for a specific time, as numbers are limited due to the pandemic. Social distancing measures are also firmly in place. The entrance is at the North Tower on the Tower of London side of the bridge. Once documents are checked you can proceed up the North Tower. There’s 206 steps to climb, but a lift is available for those needing mobility assistance. At the top of the tower you’ll get a short but informative history lesson on the construction and operation of the bridge, then you can proceed to one of the two enclosed walkways which span the bridge high above the roadway. It’s usually the West Walkway, which is up river and has the best views. The views of the River Thames and the various iconic London landmarks on both sides of the river were wonderful. There’s information boards to help you.

A curious addition is a stretch of glass floor on the walkway. You can walk around it the thought terrifies you, but it’s nothing like the glass floors in the likes of the CN Tower in Toronto and the Willis Tower in Chicago. You get views of the roadway and river below. It was just a shame a group of children were running amok on the glass floor, to the delight of their parents.

Once down the South Tower (another 200+ steps) a blue line in the pavement directs you to the former engine rooms, where a colourful collection of the old steam engines which raised the bascules can be viewed. These days the bascules are electrically operated, with the assistance of oil-driven engines. Surprisingly the bascules are raised at least twice a day. It is possible, with a bit of research, to organise your visit around the time the bascules are to be raised.

The bridge was built between 1886 and 1894, though apparently the bascules were not raised for the first time until 1903 - there weren't any ships large enough that needed the bascules to be raised, apparently!

The walkways used to be open all the time, so that people could use them to cross the bridge if the bascules were raised. But very few pedestrians did, because of the stairs - they chose just to wait for the bascules to be lowered. The walkways gained a bit of a reputation as a haunt of prostitutes and pickpockets, and were closed in 1910.

It’s a great experience if you can do it; you’ll need about 2 hours for the experience.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Tower Bridge
One of the must see things when you go to London, everything about it is spectacular, it's appearance, the engineering, the history behind it.
The elevated walkways are a accessed via a stairway, there are 206 steps up so be warned and due to current covid regulations you must wear a mask at all times whilst indoors.... there is a lift available for those that can't manage the steps.
Once you're on the walkway and taken in the view along the Thames you come to the glass floor where you can look down to the road deck and the Thames flowing beneath your feet, bit of a leap of faith stepping on to it if you have no head for heights but well worth it... hers's a tip, if you're with someone who is a little nervous of stepping on it and you finally persuade them to, don't give them a little nudge. I thought Mrs Davies was going to murder me much to the amusement of others in the area, so just don't (Sorry Mrs Davies)

Bridge is not long, prolly about a 20 min walk. Very windy so grab a coat, and its very busy with cars and tourist. At times the bridge will open up for ships to pass, there are gates and guards that patrol the bridge when that happens, very safe.

On the corners of the bridge are people with stands selling caramelized peanuts for 2 pounds. They were hot & delicious. We walked the bridge everyday, my favorite times were in the early morning and at night on our way back from touring.

There is a walkway near the bridge along the river, where you can take some amazing shots in the daytime with the bridge in the background. No people hassling you for anything here unlike the other tourist spots.

This was definitely one of my highlights visiting London.

The crown jewels are worth it..without the crowd you can go round and round the cabinets and get an amazingly good view. The White Tower is also interesting. But sadly yourein and out in about an hour. So....wonderful place.. but presently overpriced

It is both a suspension bridge and a bascule bridge, i.e. it opens to allow ships and tall vessels through - there is a website that tells you the times, and this is fun to watch.

I was walking along the river on a Sunday morning which was eerily quiet, apart from the odd runner, so had the opportunity to enjoy the bridge from both the London Bridge side and from Rotherhithe. The tide was out - the Thames is tidal at this point and the mudlarkers were out looking for items of interest in the mud.

Then we dashed down the stairs in time to see the bridge raised again for one of the tugs to go back down river.Plenty of photo opportunities and lots of information about construction and running of the bridge over its history. It is disappointing that the engine rooms no longer form part of the main tour.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Tower Bridge is one of the best landmark I love in London, The bridge itself looks very rigid and engineering. That's why I love it. ON the other hand, you can walk along the bridge to cross the River Thames. Of course, you can also walk to the top of tower. Then you can see both side of the River Thames. I strongly suggest to walk the tower at the night. You can see beautiful night view of London.
A must for every tourist in London, this iconic attraction never fails to disappoint and it certainly delivers when seen in person. It is worth walking across the bridge as it offers great views and the glass floor is incredible! It is conveniently located near Tower Hill and Tower Gateway stations so it is easily accessible.
There are a lot of information about the bridge when you walk up to tower. You can also see the bottom of the bridge because there is a transparent glass floor on top of the bridge. It's a nice experience for sure.

There was plenty of info about how the bridge was developed and built. There was a clear but slightly uninspiring video talking through the process at 2 points in the upper walkways. Lots of photo displays and great views across the river and the Tower of London. The glass floors are fun, mainly because it was entertaining to see lots of grown ups rolling around on them pretending to be scared they might fall through. People also jumping cheerfully on the glass, posing in the air. The engine room was really good, and I especially liked the stories of the people who worked there - some for 40 years, and the joy and pride they took running the amazing hydraulics system to raise the bridge.
Good mix of history and entertainment

Check for discounts. Combine to see the Tower monument for a reduced price. We chose that option. You can see the former engines that raised/lowered the bridge in bygone days. Have fun lying on the glass walkway over the road beneath and taking a picture in the mirror overhead. Points of information are found along the way, along with a suggested route to follow. This event is self-guided. There is a gift shop, and toilets. There are views, too, such as of the Monument tower, HMS Belfast, and the Thames. Fascinating and interesting architecture. Fun! Wear comfortable shoes. It was very windy when we went. Gusts prevented small children from moving forward.

UK,Tower Bridge,3.0,"I have never really been all that interested in the Tower Bridge, but it has always been a curiosity. It's a structure that doesn't make sense at first glance. Even the name is a red herring; it comes from the adjacent Tower of London, not the two towers that give it its iconic shape. And what's inside those two towers anyway? That's what I was curious about. I happened to be staying at a hotel located at one end of the bridge, and so I decided to go check it out, literally, because it was right there.

So what's inside the towers? Not terribly much. The bridge was built for a practical purpose -- to connect the banks of the Thames while also allowing tall vessels to sail through. It still does both these things but now they charge admission to subsidize it, a smart idea.

You walk a third of the way across the bridge outside (from the Tower of London side) to the ticket booth. You then take a 20-person elevator up the first tower. There is a short film (you can skip) and go out onto the parallel walkways that connect the two towers above. You can go through one walkway and then around to the other in as many circular laps as you like. The walkways are enclosed so you are not exposed to weather. The view is good but obstructed; the iron scaffolding gets in the way. It's also not quite as tall as you might think. A short section of each walkway has a glass floor so you can see the water and traffic below your feet. You exit down the stairs of the second tower (there is another film) passing by fun facts and statistics on the wall as you go. You then walk outside to the other end of the bridge and go through the gift shop to the 3-room engine gallery where a set of hefty drawbridge mechanisms are on display.

Tower Bridge is a historic, legitimate, perfectly fine cultural attraction. It's just not terribly exciting. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but if you're already at the Tower of London and you're curious, it's and easy thing to go do -- because it's there.

Each walkways provides views of either West or East. Information about other famous bridges and the history of Tower Bridge itself. These were well placed and I learned a lot about the bridge from these. Each walkway also has a glass floor allowing you to look down to the road below. These can get busy at times but are an experience to be had. On the middle floor of the South Tower are a few items from the Bridges past and the structure is clearly visible. The engine rooms immerse you into the story and showcase amazing Victorian engineering. It might not sound like much but overall, a fantastic place to visit while looking for something to do.

Stairs down 1/2 way then back to ground level by lift. Continue to walk over the bridge to the engine room.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"This is (I think) one of London's most beautiful bridges, and with our Travelcards, we were able to get two for one tickets to climb up the North Tower and walk across the upper level walkway. It is enclosed, so weather is not an issue, and there are small windows that open that allow you to get amazing pictures up and down the river. We went at night, so the city was lit up; it was beautiful. There is also part of the floor that is glass, so you can see the road and the river underneath you. We also went just down the road a bit to see the Engine Room and learn more about the history of the bridge and the people who worked it every day. It was fascinating and well worth the extra time. Walking back across the lower level of the bridge (street level) rounded out the visit nicely. This was a very cool stop.

You still must either print or collect the tickets, there isn't a e-ticket option it seems. We had a tour from a beefeater at the beginning who provided the history of the various buildings and towers and who recommended which areas were a must-see.

the surrounding area also has quite a lot to see and do and it was a nice walk along the Thames on both sides of the river.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Walking up to Arthur's Seat was a bit tiring to say the least, it starts off easy then gets steeper and steeper the higher you go. Near the top you are almost clambering to get up. Good views on the day I went, we were very lucky with the weather and there was no rain, although it was super windy (can literally get blown off your feet at the top). The path is very pebbly/rocky and so you need good trainers or walking boots. If it was even a little bit wet all the paths would be really muddy as it's literally stones laid on mud tracks.",Oct 2021

A must do when visiting Edinburgh!",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"The most amazing views in Edinburgh. Beware - it is extremely windy at the top. I'd highly recommend (as I did) carefully getting your pictures and then promptly finding a spot in the rocks to sit. I've inserted a picture of me at the top of Arthur's Seat to accurately depict the wind. Safe to say, as soon as the picture was taken, I planted myself firmly back in a cubby hole in the rocks! Me and my partner love hiking, so we went equipped with a backpack (drinks, plasters, coats etc) and walking boots. However, many did not. I'd HIGHLY recommend walking boots at the very least as it is quite rocky and slippy towards the top. I found that had I not been wearing my walking boots, I wouldn't have been able to plant my feet quite so firmly and probably had a good chance of slipping. The uphill walk is so worth it when you reach the top and get the best view of such a beautiful city. I'd give yourself a good 2 hours to complete the walk. Enjoy!

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"As a group we decided to walk up to Arthur’s seat, I must say we were under prepared in the sense that we didn’t have appropriate footwear, too many bags and a very negative attitude at times! However once we actually made it to the top, it was so worth it, you can’t beat the view and honestly the accomplishment of doing it is so great. None of us are into our fitness and it was definitely hard going to get to the top. I would recommend sticking to the course coming down, do not take short cuts! I didn’t do this and I slid my way down… not a pretty sight, however not the only one!

Dress for a climb… it’s worth it!

It took us an hour and a half, including lots of breaks, photos and tantrums. Allow plenty of time to walk in the light and see the views in the daylight!

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,A surprising steady uphill walk but not tricky. The views are great even before you reach the top.

Great view of all of Edinburgh.,Oct 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We loved this walk. It’s so special to find nature at the heart of a big city. We walked the circular route and then too a tricky climbing path up but this was really good fun.

- allow about 2 hours as a minimum
- there are no lights so make sure you return to the ground before sunset
- wear comfortable trainers that have good grip!
- take your time walking as some parts are slippy
- it's easy to get into the zone looking down when hiking upwards but make sure you stop every 15 mins or so to catch your breath and also look at the views
- it's very windy at the top so wear something warm....even though you may be sweating when you get there!

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Definitely the best place when you want to have a great view of Edinburgh. I would rate the trail as 2/10, no special equipment needed to climb but be sure to have jacket with you it would be breezy on top specially when you go in the morning which i do recommend to avoid crowds. You will be having a picturesque view on top and also during the trail itself. There are a lot of trail to choose from so its better to choose 2 so that you can experience two trails with different views.

There's a good viewpoint a few minutes from the top and after that the climb gets more difficult. So you've got the option to go to that point or go further.,Sep 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Absolutely worth climbing for the view. Go early (7-8AM) to avoid the crowds! Or in the summer a late evening when it’s still light. You won’t regret that. I’m young but quite unfit (stamina wise) and this was hard work!! Really stunning views on the way up and once you get to the top. It is super windy up there! It also feels quite dangerous nearer the top to be honest. One minute you are following a path and then as you reach the summit you’re suddenly clambering about on the rocks. You do have to be careful, there are some sheer drops and hardly any safety features. You just need to use common sense. On our way back down we did recommend an elderly couple not to continue up as they were already struggling less than 1/4 of the way up. I also slipped and fell on the way back down as well as seeing other people do the same, so go steady!

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If there is a rare sunny day in Scotland, lace up your boots and get up Arthur's seat. The view is astounding and cannot be matched in the city.

There is a path all the way to the summit and even in warm conditions the hike is achievable for even the most inexperienced hiker. The summit is flat and spacious enough for you to sit down and appreciate the vista without being in anyone's way.",Jul 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"This is definitely worthy of being a top rated attraction in Edinburgh as it can get a bit monotonous walking round the old town every day on a trip (it's nice, but not the crowd and path/roadworks in August 21).

Loads of people went for a walk here. The only concerns I had was since it's so well trodden, it can get a bit slippery. It would be handy if poles were installed for people to walk/hold onto for safety, especially at the top. People were climbing and stumbling up and down the peak.",Aug 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"The climb up is certainly doable but it gets quite rocky and uneven close to the summit, so good walking shoes or maybe trainers at a push are a must. Don't try and climb up it in flip flops! It also gets quite windy at the top. Once you are up there you can get some fabulous views of Edinburgh and the surrounding area. If you want similar views with a much easier climb, then try Calton Hill instead as it has a fully paved path and stairs to reach the top.",Sep 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,"If you want to tick the box, then the climb up to Arthurs Seat is one for you.
I would only do this on a dry day, as the path can become muddy, and the top is all stone, so any moisture would make this very slippery.

Be prepared to spend a couple of hours here, climbing up and back down again, but what spectacular views from the top. You’ll be higher than the Castle and have uninterrupted views to Leith in the north and the seaside town of Portobello.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"We walked up the trail which was very near the car park. Got there around 10:30 and the weather was really good, as a result the views on the walk up and at the top were spectacular. Reviews say it takes about an hour to get up and down. We didn’t rush it and some people were taking breaks as they trekked up, so I would say allow 40-45 minutes if you’re reasonably fit and don’t stop and an hour if you need to stop. If the weather is good trainers would do, but if not then walking shoes and definitely a bottle of water.",Sep 2021

We walked up from the east side, which went up Jacobs ladder, a set of wide stairs, but takes you a safe way up to the middle road. We walked to the Loch, then up a route from there. Husband was amazed at how he managed, so if he can, apart from the seriously infirm, you can. It looks massive from Edinburgh, but its quite the illusion, as its not as bad as it seems.
However, to get a photo from the trig point at the top, its a quick rocky climb, which is where the decent boots come in.
One of the very best views ever, just WOW.
Can be quite bust st the top.

Nevertheless, it is a wonderful experience - you will have plenty of company and it is a rocky scrabble towards the end- you have been warned. I was not the only one clutching on to the chain rail and sometimes resorting to all fours ! Wonderful views at the top ! I would have appreciated a bit more information at the top on the surrounding panorama! But, so pleased I did it - despite seemingly being the oldest person around !",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We hiked up to the summit which took us 30 minutes. It is quite rocky so I would recommend wearing good shoes.

A lovely place to pop the question if anyone else is considering it! :),Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,This is quite a steep climb in places and it is narrow at the top and slippery. It is worth it to see the views - but it was misty on the day we went so couldn't see a thing!

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"This was an amazing walk and a great experience. 100% worth it. When you reach the top the views are absolutely incredible and surreal. You can see the whole city and it’s absolutely amazing. However, I believe you need more preparation than people are made to think. As an experienced climber who has have climbed Pen-y-Ghent and other mountains and completed various hikes I would advise for people looking to go all the way to the top ,as shown in my pictures attached, to wear appropriate clothing and hiking boots or gripped shoes as it’s very steep and rocky. When you get to the summit, you have to scramble and use your hands to climb so I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone is elderly or who will find this difficult and struggle. Overall it’s a really great experience and such a great experience for anyone and everyone who visits.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"My favourite thing about Arthur's Seat is reading the 1 star reviews on Tripadvisor about people who complain there was no seat and no view! :'-)
My second favourite thing was the view and lack of seats!

There are many hundreds of combinations of routes to get to the top and back down. Therefore there are many levels of difficulty. I went a short and direct route up from Ulster Crescent (see photo) after a walk from the beach. I parted ways with the less enthusiastic wife and daughter just past the lock (yellow circle on photo) allowing them to walk a flat bypass around the mountain where I met them on the other side. The way down I left to gravity and my feet.

The views on the top were amazing. I think our 1 star friends are people expect things that are far away to be close or simply don't appreciate that there isn't a city in the world with a unspoilt volcano in the middle of it that allows you to see 90% of it.

Find the right route for you and enjoy this breathtaking, natural, unspoilt, FREE experience.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,This is a great day out especially if the weather is good. We parked at the base of the seat (had to pay) and the took a gentle walk towards the top. At some point you have to go “more vertical” and exert a bit more energy but it’s genuinely no more than moderate exercise and trainers are fine versus walking boots. The conditions were excellent when we went. At the top there are the most spectacular views (and a lot of flies!),Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,Be prepared to wear good shoes. I wore conserve and this was a mistake. We went the day after it was raining and it was very slippery. I saw two people fall over.

If you want great views without the risk book Edinburgh castle tickets.,Aug 2021

We picked a day with good weather and had lunch on the Royal Mile once we'd finished.

Mind you the other carpark close to Holyrood Palace is free too at weekends only. And the second easy route is from the lake through the trees.
Extremely slippery on a wet misty day. I lost my balance several time and slipped and fell once.
Believe me it is not as easy as some reviews state here when the ground is wet.
A que even on the most dismal day for a picture at the summit.
Thing with this walk is the weather changes so quickly, pack a waterproof and a woolley hat, you won't regret it. Oh and something to eat to give you energy halfway!

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Similarly to Calton Hill, we were told about this by a family member and suggested it would be a great chance to experience something outside and get in some more great views of the area.

I'm not afraid to say that I struggled a little on the way up with a lot of uneven terrain and crumbly steps but persevered because I really wanted to check out the views at the top. I'm not the fittest of people and when google described it was being "" slightly strenuous"" I was surprised that I found it as hard as I did but I'm proud of myself for doing it. I wasn't expecting to see so many little kids doing the walk up but I guess they are pretty fearless compared to me! At the very top there is a white pillar which had unfortunately had graffiti on it which is such a shame as the surrounding area is full of nature. I was surprised to see quite a lot of broken glass on the way too which is a harsh reminder of how horrible some humans can be.

Without a doubt the views were great at the top, and it was good to be able to say I'd done it but was definitely pleased when I was back on even ground again! The walk down was a bit easier than the way up but would definitely recommend trainers or good walking shoes as everything is quite uneven and saw a few people take a tumble at some points. On the way back down it had started to rain so was pleased that we went up when it was dry even though it was a bit more windy that I'd have liked but the rain didn't seem to put off many people and it was becoming fairly busy.

If you like walking, and you're okay with uneven terrain I would definitely recommend coming up to Arthur's Seat as it offers the best views of the city. I wouldn't have liked to have done this on my own, so i was very grateful to have my boyfriend there to help me up along the way!

We set off early, did struggle a little bit to find Scottish Parliament as a starting point but once we did we following the main path and following the sign for The Summit. It was quite a steep walk all the way, and rocky/dusty underfoot so wear appropriate footwear.

Climb to the summit using this route was approx 30-40mins and very worth it for the 360° views at the top. Amazing! Just beware there’s a lot of flies at the top to share either experience.

Descent back to the bottom was easy and calm. Depending on your fitness allow 60-120 minutes for the journey.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,The views from the top of Arthur’s Seat are stunning however this is not an easy walk whichever route you take. The summit section is both gravel and well worn granite so can be very slippery if you don’t have appropriate footwear. This is certainly not a walk for sandals or flip flops. There are some dangerous areas at the top so children need to be very careful.,Jun 2021

The view is really stunning and you can see the whole Edinburgh and it's surrounding area.",Jul 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"We climbed to the top of Arthur’s Seat on a a sunny day in July. We left quite early to try and beat the heat of the day - worth doing as you are obviously quite exposed. The walk from start to the very top took us about 30-45 minutes at a slow pace to best enjoy the views! Worth stopping at the Holyrood Park Education Centre (behind the palace) before you begin the walk to use the facilities there as no toilets in the park/climb itself. On Google the centre shows as closed, but the public toilets remain open during the day.
The view at the top is stunning and totally worth the effort of the climb!

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"It is quite a walk, but it is worth it! I had a wonderful view of the city and the coast. It was quite windy when I was there. There are foot paths that are quite safe.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"I came to Edinburgh to do this hill and I wasn't disappointed
I didnt quite make it to the top but I did get a fairway up there. Better shoe would have helped but that was my own fault. The path is very step and its gravel underfoot. I did my self slip a couple of times on the way down but the view was worth it.",Jun 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Absolutely loved climbing Arthur’s seat and watching the sun set on a clear summer’s eve. The colours were phenomenal as were the 360 views! Even if you don’t get all the way to the top, there are plenty of viewpoints that can be enjoyed along the way.

The hike itself is fairly easy - some basic fitness is required - but ultimately can be done at whatever pace you choose. For an average person it takes about 45 mins to an hour from Old Town, so fo factor that in if you are going for sunset.

There are various different paths you can take, some are gradual and slower, others faster and steeper. Signage could be better as to which path is which but you can more or less tell from the ground. The hike can be done in trainers/flat shoes but hiking boots would be more sturdy. The ground is quite loose, at least in summer.

I hiked alone as a woman and felt totally safe the entire time, there were people on the trail and at the top. Whilst I wouldn’t say it was busy, it was by no means secluded.

Go when the gorse is in full bloom, and you'll see a carpet of yellow covering half of the mountain.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,I was totally unprepared for a little hike! But couldn't resist having a go having had Arthur's Seat pointed out by our tour guide on one of the bus tours. It wasn't ideal in flip flops!

It is amazing to come to such a busy city and literally turn a corner and have such a beautiful place to walk with such a natural view of the city. Just amazing.,May 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,Lovely views from the top but quite a hard hike for me with some narrow and slightly treacherous sections. Need good footwear and to go in good weather. The path was gravelly with boulders as steps to climb up to the next section and required a reasonable level of fitness as some of the steps were quite high. On the way down we walked down the grassy bank at the back down to the paved pathway which were easier to manage. The park is really lovely to walk in with lovely views over the city and out to the coastline.,May 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"Would be great for a sunny day but I don’t believe it is necessary in wet conditions. The rocks are pretty slippery and you won’t be missing out if you choose not to go.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"An excellent hill hike within a city. There are multiple paths/routes up. On this, my first, visit I parked for a couple of hours in the car park adjacent the palace (opposite parliament). There is a signposted path which takes you most directly up to the summit, with stone steps most of the way ( the 'motorway' route). I preferred a slightly more circuitous route that maintained views so took a slightly less trodden anti-clockwise route. This requires a small loss of height midway but makes up for that in variety. The paths can be precipitous and if wet the rock is very slippy, particularly on the summit so appropriate footware is advised. Also, as an exposed summit the temperature and wind may be very different to the base, so dress accordingly. A moderate walk around the circuit was done in under 2 hours. You can choose to rock scramble if that's to your liking

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"My wife and I went up Arthur’s Seat expecting it to be a tourist friendly smooth walk up to a nice viewpoint.
It’s not that. It is actually a lot more hardcore then we expected, with proper giant steps up, slopey slippy crags and uneven paths that are pretty close to the edge. The bit at the summit is definitely a bit treacherous and probably won’t want to be tried on a rainy day.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"We visited Arthur’s Seat on a Sunday so it was fairly busy with lots of people climbing up and down. The walk itself is quite steep, and narrow and uneven in parts but the view is worth the effort. It was a very clear day so could see for miles over beautiful Edinburgh and beyond. We walked down the grassy option which was much quieter and avoided having to pass people climbing up",Sep 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Totally worth a visit. My parter and I make the walk with our two french bulldogs.

The views were breathtaking and you can see the whole of Edinburgh at the top!

On the way down there was a lake and there were wild otters in the lake - just awesome !

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Gorgeous views make it a must see for anyone visiting Edinburgh. I don't know why anyone would write a negative view about a volcano, like did you want it to form a better path for you to get your fat body up? The same people who would want them to build an escalator right to the top.",Aug 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,"I'm not good with heights but reviews said its fine regardless of fitness levels, however I found it quite daunting and challenging at times. I didn't really see the view as I stayed towards the middle when we but my partner said it was nice.

If you go up from Holywood Palace, it's a gentle incline which becomes steeper, I reccommend good trainers/walking boots. I wouldn't go during the rain as might be slippery, the surface was uneven in places. I have a good fitness level and took us 40mins with me being scared of heights. On the way down, take the grassy path down its steeper but its a big wide path and all level and you come out near dunsapie loch and gradually downhill from there back to the start. Take a sugary drink, some sweets and water!

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"By how long it takes to get to the top... it’s a very difficult and steep ascent. If your general fitness is good then this is a great little hike to do basically in the centre of Edinburgh but if not, be warned it really is a challenging walk. Once at the top I think I could have been happier taking on one of the smaller slopes around as the views are still pretty cracking from there. However, due to the proximity to the centre of Edinburgh, it’s a good bit of hard outdoor walking you wouldn’t find in many other cities around the world so I rate it a bit higher for that.",Sep 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Went this morning and me and the wife are not exactly fitness freaks, it was at best a challenging walk so dont be put off, we were at the top in about 30 mins.

At the top are unrivalled in the city",Sep 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Lovely walk with some fantastic views. Wear layers, take a picnic and avon skin so soft to get rid of those evil midges...then just enjoy. Depending on route you take it can vary from an ok walk to strenuous so do your research before you go. A good base is at the Scottish Parliament building area - lots of car parking and also information guides to help you decide the route plus other great walks you can do",Sep 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"The walk is quicker than advised online, only takes 30 minutes at a slow pace to get to the top.

The views over Edinburgh are beautiful.

Probably not a good idea to walk it on a Saturday afternoon during the pandemic.

Very crowded with people walking past each other on a single track route and less than 1m apart. Instead of waiting at a passing place.

Shame people dropped masks all over the hill and were blasting music out their phones at the top.

I would choose to go up early in the morning next time.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,You will be a lot higher than you think but you don't have to be a seasoned mountain climber to get up to the top. You DO need to have a stomach for heights and you need to be in fairly decent shape. Takes about one hour to get to the top and back down. We loved it.,Sep 2020

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Writing as a local who visits Arthur’s Seat time and time again for the magnificent views. As the highest point in Edinburgh it gives a great vantage point of the whole city. Many paths to choose from with differing difficulty levels, some more well-worn and some more off-the-beaten-path. Some areas are rockier but good leg muscles on steep pathways will suffice rather than actual rock climbing. If you follow the car path (currently closed to vehicles) there are two lochs with wildlife residing there. A busy place with avid walkers, runners and cyclists, and also picnickers when the weather is good. Windy at the peak, and rocks can get slippery with morning dew or rain.

It would've been easy enough to find our way even alone, as all the paths were clearly marked and everyone was going the same way.

(Mostly) everyone was socially distanced, and it wasn't too challenging - all non-experienced hikers were able to make it to the top, or close to it.

Incredibly scenic, and shocking that it's just down the road from Old Town and the main tourist area!

The initial walk just past the pond up to the Ruin seemed a bit steep in places, but by the time we reached the very top of Arthurs Seat, the first part paled into insignificance.
BUT it was SO worth the effort - the wind, the view, the feeling of satisfaction all made it totally worthwhile.
It is a bit if a scramble at the top and it is certainly a tough walk, but if you can make it you will be rewarded.

Some are very steep and high and would take much longer than a hour. We decided not to go as high as we wanted as we had a booking at he hard rock for a certain time. Very relaxing up there and great views. Great for your mental health. Lots of people and dogs which is great to see.

Not living in Edinburgh but did this walk many times as a child. Took the north facing climb but you can climb from the east too or really from any direction although these are the recognised paths. The North side where the small lake with the swans is heavily travelled, a little rutted in parts and occasionally quite uneven under foot so good footwear required, not climbing footwear just good footwear.... climb is steep in parts especially the last 50 .... takes about 20-25 mins from the base to summit..... great view from the top but again watch your footing.... views in every direction... worth taking a camera.... from high street to summit and back 1.5 hours

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"Pretty central location so easy to walk to a starting point. We walked from the car park area near Holyrood. A short distance into the walk, there is a fork in the path. The left, I believe is a longer but more gradual walk. We took the right which is a steeper and quicker but manageable climb to the summit. The views from the top are great. A 360* of Edinburgh and over to Fife. The climb is a bit rocky so good trainers or walking shoes are advised. We saw some with open toed sandals - wouldn’t fancy that!
We started about 1100hrs and at that time, the number of people was okay. On our decline, the numbers climbing had increased significantly. It took us about 1 1/2 hours with a wee stop at the summit. Not too time consuming so give it a go, you’ll not regret it,

We were lucky to have had a clear day when we could see over Edinburgh, the Lothians, Fife and well into the Southern Uplands. It is a view we will never forget and we may even go back there again on our next viit to Edinburgh. It is certainly a must do if staying in this iconic city.",Aug 2020

I had to carry the boys at various points on the way up as it is a tall order for a 3 year old to go all the way by himself. We made it to the top in an hour ... So it's not too long. We spend some time at the top and then came down to the ""right"" (when standing at the top looking at the football stadium). It is a very easy and quick walk down, but then quite a hike back to where we parked (Holyrood palace, Queens drive).

I highly recommend this activity. It is amazing

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"You can walk up the hill from the centre of town or surrounding suburbs if you are staying close enough. We had done a lot of walking the days previously so hopped in an Uber to get there as we were staying an additional hours walk away, but we did walk home via the Royal Mile. There is a carpark at the bottom of the hill next to Holyrood if you want to drive.

Need to be relatively fit to climb it but nothing that you need to prepare for. Level in places to catch your breath. The past section is steep but worth it! Not pram or wheelchair friendly. No hard paths as such, more compacted rubble and rough stone steps.

Dress appropriately! Saw very unhappy ladies in converse, wedges or sandals and their husbands carrying their handbags! One gentleman was wearing a blazer and leather dress shoes?! Definitely running trainers or walking boots territory, with a backpack to keep your hands free.

The very peak is quite narrow. Go at a quiet time or get your elbows ready to fend off selfish people hogging the trig point. Some people gave up queuing as parents were letting their kids climb all over it and it's too narrow to have more than 2 people on it...

Views are spectacular! Take binoculars. You can see almost all of the main features of Edinburgh and out to sea.

Overall worth a visit.

UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,"We went for the walk or climb Up to Arthur’s seat whilst walking around Edinburgh. It was quite busy in the walk, with people walking up and down the same route, I got about 210meters high and decided I could not go any higher as it was very windy and I was thinking about the route back down which I really did not fancy.
I did think they should have a route up there and a route backdown, as When everyone is trying to get up or down and it’s windy and there are steep drops with nothing to protect you I did find this quite troubling at times. I do also think they should have people placed at certain parts of the route just to make sure everyone is safe and no one is doing anything they should not be doing.
You have families with small children going up there which is something I could never do, but these people are probably used to this sort of terrain, dogs being walked up and down, there is not a man made pathway, some of the rocks are loose, which made me feel unsafe.
The views of course are stunning, which is one good reason to climb there but I will not be doing it again!

Yes, the ascent is difficult for those of us who are partial to the odd pie or two and yes I did slip and injure my thumb on the way up but it was well worth the effort. Once you get to the top and stand on (or next-to) the white obelisk like structure, you have a breath-taking, 360 degree, bird's-eye view, of Edinburgh as far as the eye can see. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how someone could say the view wasn't worth it.

We decided to take a quick foray up Arthur's Seat after visiting the Palace of HolyRood.

We only had about an hour or so, so we hiked up to one of the lower points rather than going all the way to the top. Because we were there in early May it was a little chilly and muddy, which hindered our ascent some.

But the views were by far worth it. We saw lots of people out hiking and it was enjoyable without being too difficult.

Do look out for the wind and the mud, depending on the time of year you visit!

It was very windy on the top.

It was hard in places because the sun was low and path was sometimes uneven but that’s because it’s a natural mountain.

It was definitely worth it though for the views.

And there is NO seat at the top. Although a few rocks which you can perch on for photo opportunities.

As long as you have good footwear, water and are relatively fit you should be able to make it to the top.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"A lovely walk up to the top of Arthur's seat. Took about 40 minutes to walk up, quite busy and slippy in places. Would certainly recommend good shoes! On the day we went it was so windy, I felt like I could have been blown over! Make sure you wrap up warm too, I had four layers of clothing, hat, scarf and gloves but still bitterly cold with the wind and shade. That said the views were stunning and well worth the trip.",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"I ventured to the top on a clear cold February day with good visibility; the clouds were high up and off in the distance. As a result, the 360 degree views were terrific. Many others did likewise. Since there had been considerable rain the previous few days, the trail was quite muddy in sections. And since my walk up was in the morning, the temperatures had not risen much and ice was on a few sections of the trail. Finally, it was windy. Very windy. So much so that standing and trying to hold a camera steady enough for a non-blurry photo was a challenge. So windy that the Edinburgh Castle closed for the day because of it.",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We love Arthur's seat and consider it a brilliant destination for a stroll on a sunny day. I have walked the seat many times and will definitely go back again!,Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,An excellent place to visit in Edinburgh. It is the highest peak from where you can see the entire city of Edinburgh. People who love tracking will love this place. The sunny day will be perfect to travel. If you want you carry some food with you and celebrate picnic and spend time with you family and friends.,Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"This was the first thing I did in Edinburgh and I quickly learned that was a bad idea. I'm not very fit and my lack of said fitness was on full display. It was windy which I could cope with and my footwear was extremely inappropriate but then the hail came. By the time I got to the top (which took me 30 minutes), I was soaked. The view was magnificent and it's a great picture opportunity. Unfortunately the wind was so strong no-one wanted to stay up there.

My advice, walking boots, wrap up warm and don't go in the winter!",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Quite the challenging climb in bad weather up never ending rough hewn steps into the side of the hill. The views over Edinburgh are stunning and I would say this is a must trip if in the area. It was only a 30 minute walk from the Castle. Well, it was 30 mins to the start of the climb!!",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Got up and down in an hour and quarter in feb. 4 seasons in one day. Nah only 2 but the sun did shine and it snowed,Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"One of my favorite parts of visiting Edinburgh! Beware when using Google maps, however, as we ended up being directed up a strenuous path but realized there was a much calmer one on the other side of the volcano. The path is very muddy and rocky so hiking shoes are recommended. It was very windy the day we went and winter hats, gloves, and a decent jacket were all needed. Lovely views but be prepared for intense wind at the top!",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"It is not a hard climb at all, but it can be a windy one. Like anywhere in Scotland if its not the height of summer make sure to pack a jacket, and a hat to keep the wind from stinging your ears. But the 360 degree view is worth it even if it ends up being a cold and windy day, and if not there are a couple of good spots to sit and relax while looking down on the city. A great spot to bring a picnic to eat on one of the many grassy knolls.",Jan 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If visiting Edinburgh, if you are fit (it’s a bit of a climb) then would definitely recommend. Take sturdy footwear and a picnic then sit and enjoy the view from the top - splendid. Takes about 40mins to an hr to get to the top. Take your time when you reach the summit and just enjoy the views",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"When I’m in Edinburgh I head up to Arthur’s Seat for the views and elevation. Today was a bit challenging as temperatures were in the high 30s Fahrenheit and it was very breezy.

Nevertheless there were a large group of hearty tourists and scots atop Arthur‘s seat.

There are several trails up. the normal tourist trail which comes in from the north east and a steeper trail from the southside which is essentially a staircase for most of the way.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"Ok this is an incredible journey .. but I have to admit tiring .. but I recommend it as a challenge especially when you reach the summit .. Also the views are breathtaking .. but the price is fatigue , getting the rain and wind to batter you and it snowed twice on us plus a spate of a hailstorm in one journey.. But in conclusion well worth it .. the weather and getting tired is nothing the view of Edinburgh is amazing . Highly recommended make sure you got the right gear .. hiking boots and a good coat - don’t forget a hat to cover you ears .. this was in February..",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"During our stay in Edinburgh we decided to climb to the top of Arthur's Seat. It was really hard work for me with my asthma, but by taking my time and using my walking poles, I finally made it to the top. The views from the top are amazing. It was so windy we could hardly stand upright but it was definitely worth the hard work to get there. We took some amazing photos and just before we got to the bottom, got caught in a snow shower. We both thoroughly enjoyed this climb and would definitely recommend it.",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"I met someone at Arthur seat. She was sitting by the cliff all by herself, she seemed so happy. She induced a part of her happiness in me some how. She blushed when I tried speaking to her .. she kept blushing while I asked her for a photo together.. don’t know why I did that. She told me she is from Australia and doing her UNI in UK. I am such a fool I did not even asked her name. Can some one help me find her..? It was back in August long weekend 2013.. around that. Attaching the picture we got clicked..!!",Aug 2019
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"We took a break from all the tourist tat to climb an extinct volcano. Its mostly an easy walk up just a little challenge at the peak but well worth the views of Edinburgh, the Forth bridges and surrounding Scotttish countryside.",Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Arthur's Seat is an extinct volcano which is the main peak of the group of hills in Edinburgh, Scotland, which form most of Holyrood Park, described by Robert Louis Stevenson as ""a hill for magnitude, a mountain in virtue of its bold design"" easily seen from the castle",Nov 2019

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Perfectly situated, easy access yet no easy climb, Arthur's Seat is a fantastic extra perk of Edinburgh. You could easily spend the day tramping the hills around the Seat. Or just make for the peak. Probably could be done in under 2 hours. But why rush? Plenty of time to take in the sites and make for a nearby pub afterwards. Every city should have an Arthur's Seat.",Aug 2019
UK,Arthur's Seat,1.0,"Just don't. The mess and crowds make this less than a nice day out. The seagulls do love the glut of food left by the hordes of celebrants.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We approached from the swimming pool end of the hill. It looks quite high and daunting at first but actually wasn’t that difficult to climb. At the top it was windy which added to the fun factor. Although we went in Feb the weather was fine and the sky was blue. A lovely walk - we are pretty fit so the walk can be done as a round trip in an hour easy. You can wear trainers or boots. Layer up as you get hot on the way up but it’s cold at the top :),Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Of the many fantastic things to 'see' in Edinburgh, this is top of the list. Simply just incredible. Challenging in places, but achievable for a novice walker with eh right footwear, a break in the weather and a bit of common sense.

It can be busy and its easy to see why, if you time your set off time correctly you can get fairly unrestricted access.",Dec 2019
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"A trip to Edinburgh wouldn't be complete without a trek up Arthur's Seat, at 250m it's not for the less able unfortunately but is worth the walk if you can.
I was lucky with the weather as day before it rained all day but with views across the city and countryside it was amazing.
There are a few routes up, I walked from the Scottish parliament along a slow but long incline which gets steeper towards top, the way down from the north side is a set of old stone stairs, in even and some are quiet the step but would be easier at a slow pace. Also parking is near the start of these.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"How lucky we are to have this extinct lump of volcanic rock close at the centre of our city.
Having lived in Edinburgh for many years I have dragged many a visitor to the summit and none have been disappointed. Whatever the weather the summit offers fantastic 360 degrees views of the city and the surrounding Edinburgh. Another fantastic thing is the number of routes to the top. Some of which are steeper than other.
A word of warning a good pair of shoes should be worn for the walk as the surface on the walk is uneven and can be muddy.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Couldn't visit Edinburgh without conquering Arthur's Seat. Windy on the way up and thought we might get blown over at the top but for the magnificent views of the city it was so worth it. Make sure you wear the right footwear as it gets slippey in places.,Feb 2020
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"A difficult hike up with some mud, wind and more wind. But the views from the top are 360° of Edinburgh and is beautiful. Caution: the top was so windy that I could barely stand up straight without fear of dropping my phone or the wind blowing me over the edge. I had to hold my beanie in places at times due to the wind.
Also for less crowds, head up before 10am. Would recommend to do whilst staying in Edinburgh. Wear some good shoes with grip!",Feb 2020

Honestly the service provided by all members staff was top notch. Our tour guide was Jim and he was great, the way he kept us interested whilst sharing his knowledge of the club and adding a bit of humour along the way showed how much he must love his job. He also let my 2 sons sit at the desk in the conference room whilst the video of Pep was played to make it look like they were sitting there with him live, which was class! We've had a great day and everyone up here just seems more happy and friendly than people back home. We'd definitely come back.

Roger and Keith were fantastic as tour guides and I could really feel that they were really passionate and loved the club deeply. They went out their way to make sure everyone was enjoying the tour and had their chance to take nice pictures. I missed the beginning of the tour because I wasn't familiar with the tram system in Manchester but Roger offered to take me through the beginning part for the exhibition again even though my tour ended! It's my first time on a tour and they've set the bar so high!

Food was excellent and service great too. The players heading in through the tunnel seemed a bit underwhelming as only one seemed to acknowledge the customers!!

As for the football genuinely no atmosphere at all!! Biggest cheer was Man U going down to Leicester.

But its a 5 for brilliant hospitality (though come on including Spirits won't bankrupt you).

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"The tour was amazing. Our guides Ian and Sam were highly entertaining. My son loved the opportunity of being able to walk through the players entrance to cheers and then through the tunnel. Tour was supposed to last 90 minutes but ended up being almost 2 hours. You lean the history of Man City, learn what goes on during match day and what the future plans are for the club. You have access to where the players arrive, walk down the same steps the players walk down to the dressing room, access both away and home dressing rooms and walk through the tunnel to pitch side. You get to sit in Peps seat and learn the history of the stadium. You also visit the Tunnel Club and learn what happens there and visit the press room. Would highly recommend this tour. Doesn’t matter if you are a Man City fan or just a football fan. Would love to expertly again - especially with the tour guides Ian and Sam.

We took out 6 year old son who was so excited when we arrived and we also had our 1 year old twins in the double pram.

Martin and Sam our tour guides went above and beyond for us. With having the pram we had to go in the lifts and round different ways at some points but Martin was fantastic and sorted it out whist Sam took the others.

They were both very friendly and made the tour fun.

If you are debating about going if you need to take a pram, don’t worry at all it was great. All the staff were great all very friendly and polite everyone who you passed said hello. A very enjoyable afternoon out

Secondly, the tour is extremely immersive with 360 degrees movies, press conferences alongside Pep Guardiola (obviously a virtual reality treat).

Callum and Ray, the tour guides were both great at the jobs and quite funny.

Definitely recommend the tour if you're in the city. It also comes with a 10% discount for the City Store.

City even included two free tickets(family stand,behind the goal) food voucher,program,goody bag & home kit,not our usual Saturday afternoon.
Great game 5-0 winners,we got a little bit wet,typical Manchester weather,we came prepared.

The reason for the visit was for my son’s 11th birthday, which I mentioned simply in passing to Ray as we chatted, so to receive a scarf and bar of chocolate from the tour team at the end was an amazing gesture.

UK,Etihad Stadium,2.0,"Coldplay Concert (actually was in 2016 but heard nothing has changed since in Etihad's VIP concert set up). Here's what we got for the VIP package at the Etihad stadium Manchester, UK: We got one (I'll repeat that) ONE free drink, a Coldplay Lanyard, a Coldplay badge and......that's it! The food in the VIP lounge you had to pay for and the actual concert seats were right at the back of the stadium. Oh I forgot we did get a cushion on our seat. Other people who were on the same row of seats (but on the other side of a 'rope') didn't get a cushion but paid just a 1/3 of the price we did! It's put me off for life buying VIP packages for concerts. At our next Coldplay concert, we bought just basic standing tickets (right in the middle of the stadium) and it was the best concert of our lives! This was for many reasons including not feeling completely ripped off like last time. Have seen reviews of VIP packages at other stadiums that Coldplay played at, & by far they were ten times better - e.g free food, lots of free drinks, great seats. I do not blame the band but the Stadium organisation. Do NOT buy a VIP concert ticket at Etihad stadium, Manchester.

They even had the trophies out to take pictures with. What really made the day though was the staff - they were all so friendly and helpful. It looked liked each waiter was assigned to 2/3 tables to bring drinks over and clear the table etc. The girl we had was called Shay and she was incredible. Every time we needed a drink she just magically appeared to take our orders. It didn't take long for her to learn our orders off by heart! At one point me and my friend did end up going to the bar ourselves because we'd changed our minds about not getting a drink and Shay met us there and offered to carry them back to the table for us. She was just a lovely girl - I can't speak highly enough of her. From my experiences, all of the staff have helped to make the day better for the guests. Would highly recommend!

UK,Etihad Stadium,4.0,"I am not a football fan but when I visited Manchester with my wife, this was one place that I had to visit. Have heard so much about it from my football loving friends. Have heard so much about the team and city.

We reached the stadium at around 3pm and booked the Stadium Tour for 4pm. It cost £27 per adult. The tour is an hour and a half long and takes you through the various parts of the stadium. Beginning with a small video with the history of the city and team and ending with a look inside the stadium. Our tour guides Ray and Roger took us through each and every story while we passed through the player entrance, green rooms, spa, gym, strategy room, lounge, stadium and the press room. We even met with the coach of ManU at the press conference ;P

The tour is overall a good experience. Had I been a football fan I would have loved it even more. To relive the memories. Walk the the corridors. See the stadium.

A thumbs up to Ray and Roger for their warmth and humour. They were amazing hosts and made us feel really special. They did everything to make sure each of 12 people on the tour is comfortable and looked after.

If they could include a momento and bottle of water in the package, it would make the tour even more exciting. I think they cam manage that much in £27.

UK,Etihad Stadium,1.0,"As something of a veteran football fan, I have attended Everton matches at Maine Road many times, and loved it. Not only for matches against City, but also various cup semi-finals we've been involved in. It was always a favourite 'away'. A traditional old stadium, steeped in history. Always a fantastic atmosphere. This, on the other hand, left me cold. A soulless lump of concrete and metal.
Maybe i'm just getting old. I found myself longing for a fat woman to produce a bell. Mind you, most modern day football fans wouldn't even understand that reference, so maybe its just me.
In addition to this, we left to get a pint 10 minutes before half time, and by the time we got served it was 5 minutes into the second half. 30 minutes? I thought new stadia would put an end to this kind of thing? About 5 staff to serve several thousand thirsty Evertonians?

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"I had never been to a stadium of this size. I was blown away at the sheer magnitude. It was breath taking.

A friend and I traveled from the US to see the Spice Girls concert (sans Posh). We had an amazing time and danced in the rain all night!

The pitch was covered so it made walking (and dancing) really easy. We were 10 feet away from the Spice Girls while they were performing. It was a night to remember.

I was also impressed at how well the crowd was managed. Getting in out was pretty efficient. Only downside was everyone trying to catch the trains back to the city. But thats to be expected with so many people.

Would have been nice to catch a Man City game here. Perhaps next time!

UK,Etihad Stadium,2.0,"Went to see the spice girls at the stadium with my 8 year old daughter (7 at the time) getting through the stadium & finding our seats were a breeze staff were friendly & helpful enough.
Then the actual concert started, during the concert the stair wells were permanently covered with people. Now I'm not talking about people getting up & going for drinks I'm talking people couldn't be bothered to stay at their seats, stood or not. So they decided to stand in the stair wells instead. Where myself and my daughter were sat the ushers/security were a few steps up from us, so they could clearly see it all but decided to do nothing about it.
Luckily myself & my daughter had the last two seats of our row so I let her have the aisle seat so she had a clear view for the spice girls & the screen.
This shortly ended, during the show as a delightful idiotic young lady kept standing in front of my daughter (not at her seat in the stair well) because of this she couldn't see. So eventually I asked her politely if she could stand aside as my daughter couldn't see. Which at first she was happy to move, unfortunately the move didn't last too long. Again she stood right Infront of my daughter, so again I asked politely if she could stand aside from the stair well. This time her response was different, her abundance of attitude came out & she decided to ignore my request & began dancing and waving her arms around like an immiture idiot.
As you would expect my patience were extinct at this point, as we'd paid to be where we were however I'm pretty sure the stadium do not sell tickets for the stair wells!
Then believe it or not this idiotic child actually became physical & told me she would love to smack me, now another occasion when I weren't with my daughter I would of happily let this girl attempt to smack me (she wouldn't of got anywhere near) but as I had my daughter with me I had to keep pushing this girls arm off me.
No thanks to any usher, this vile creature carried on. Then my daughter got upset & wanted to leave because of said tool!
Thanks to the lovely group of women that were sat next to us, they dealt with the idiot, whilst I tried to calm my daughter down & take her home.
We were lucky that the said idiot began this towards the end of the show so we didn't really miss much when we had to leave because of her.
How is it that anyone is supposed to want bring. Their children to this stadium for concerts when you clearly cannot control the crows once in the facility?
I will never attempt to go anywhere near your establishment again & I will mention it to all other parents that consider it also.

Money is clearly the only thing on the agenda when attending a concert here, once your in they clearly don't care of the experience.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"I went to see City v Dinamo Zagreb in this modern stadium.I travelled to the game on the tram which has its own stop at the etihad.The first thing you see is the shop;an Aladdins cave for young fans but really sixty quid for a shirt,you must be joking.The Outdoor bar and refreshments are a bit tacky but I guess regular City fans like them.All part of the matchday experience;lets see how much money we can get off you.Prior to getting in its an airport style frisking job ,of which I heartily approve.No spending the time ducking missiles when the fans get tribal these days.Once inside there is a corridor runs round the stadium with staircases going up into your section.The layout is pretty good and if you want to make a pig of yourself or have a bet you can do.On this night the programmes were in short supply as I didn't find any.The toilets have come on a bit since the old Maine Road.Anyone remembering the single 60watt light bulb lighting the very basic Gents at the end of A block will breathe a sigh of relief- well just to be able to breathe.If I was a swish rich kid , I could have a good meal before the game or even better if I was a lottery winner I could watch the game from the balcony of a private box but I don't think I would choose to.The views are pretty good,until some idiot decides to stand up and stay up.Stewarding of this is hopeless,probably because they pay a part time girl or old git like me a minimum wage so they don't really bother.I felt safe throughout the game and afterwards.Is this because they do so well at segregating fans these days.? The attitude of Football fans remains as tribal as ever though.How come we get a blind ref every week.? etc.They also mostly know how to score a goal and there are 40,000 master tacticians who should be earning a good living managing a team of millionaires !

To give them their dues they did replace both meals. My husbands was ok but mine was still lute warm. They wanted to replace mine again but as the match was about to start I ate some of my meal.

We saw 2 short films about the club which were very interesting and we got to sit in the heated seats that belong to the Tunnel Club members - a big bonus on such a damp day! At pitch level it looks much smaller than it is on TV and there was a great buzz around the ground ahead of the early kick off that day.

UK,Etihad Stadium,3.0,"Traveled to Manchester Piccadilly station and got the tram to the Etihad, staff at the train station was great to help direct us as we had never been before. Got to the stadium and went straight to the away end where there was a confusion to which gate to go in K or L, said K on the ticket but had to enter L. Finally got inside to a small bar with a poor choice of food but drinks was not overpriced. The steward was more than helpful to guide us to the seats which had plenty of room. The view from the away area was good but for some reason the ground did not impress me which I thought would after hearing thing about the Etihad. For some reason City fans do not fill this stadium and they sit watching the game like they are in a doctor’s surgery. A club like that should be sold out every home game along with drowning out the away fans with song. I can say now I’ve been to the Etihad Stadium but don’t think I will rush back. I think in truth City fans will agree with this review but will stay silent as it was at the game. I am a Aston Villa fan and this is not a review to be nasty in any way.

Its a Mecca for enthusiasts although at times apparently they use the stadium for football but that is no worry as football is a very minority sport in this city. Usual gates at the ""Etihad"" are about 250 people for their 4th division games.The facilities are awesome and with free entry what's not to like.
Yes its even rumoured that they might move ""Wimbledon"" to the ""Etihad"" stadium as parking is so bad in London, what a boost that would be for Manchester, bring it on as this is the city of Tennis.

On a match day, some parts of the tour are restricted (player areas) so if you want a full tour, book a non match day. The shorter match day tour was still worth it and I'd recommend it.",Sep 2019

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"The tour was amazing. Seen so much of the stadium. Only small thing I wasn’t happy with I never got good opportunities to take photos of the Colin bell stand looking from the east stand or opposite way. It was all down at pitch side photo
Ops and with the heaters on pitch didn’t get a few. The stadium tour was amazing apart from that. I am life long city fan and was amazing seeing the tour and things that I seen. Would love to go to a game in it one day.

The security man on tour was amazing. And really helpful with me telling me different things about city and the stadium.

I done the academy part of tour. And we got taken into one building shown the press conference room out onto a pitch. Then a drive around. It would have been nice for some photo ops of the Yaya or Kompany sign that is up. The guy taking tour said he would say when could take photos or not. He didn’t say anything though our tour until I took a photo of building and he said do not take photos here. I don’t think I would do the academy tour part again as not worth the extra £10.

It would also be nice if you get a ticket or something to say you were on tour. I have done a few stadiums in uk and you get either a certificate to say you visited stadium in the day or have a colourful ticket to keep. I normally make frames up of photo of stadium I take inside and put ticket in along with it.

Over all I am still on cloud 9 after seeing everything next time down will be a game

On the plus side Football Focus was being presented from the home dressing room so we literally rubbed shoulders with Dan Walker, Phil Neville and Alex Scott.
Fancy technology was used to bring things to life, such as the entry of the home team. Hospitality areas were an eye opener - how the other half live! The media areas were also interesting - you get a really good idea of the organisation that goes into match day.
The best thing about the entertaining tour was the excellence of our guides David and Julie. Here were two fans, passionate about the clubs history, a font of knowledge and only too willing to share their experiences.
A must for all City fans.

UK,Etihad Stadium,4.0,"Just got back from the stadium. Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and in good numbers. Entry was quick and easy. A nine seater golf-type buggy took us to our entry point as my g/daughter is suffering a knee injury. Inside the stadium I found the staff equally professional, pleasant and helpful. Seating was good (we were behind the goal post).

My criticism centres around the catering. I ordered five portions of chips. On receiving the first two they were cold. Pointed this out to the server who politely took them back and returned them to the hotplate (where they were immediately picked up by the server of the next queue and given to the next customer!). However, I did receive five portions of hot chips at a cost of 3 pounds per portion, (but cost only 1.50 when teamed up with an overpriced burger or hotdog. There were no trays or boxes to carry them so had to do two trips. Both the catering size tomato ketchup dispensers were empty and there was no mayonnaise or vinegar on offer. Did not try the mustard sauce (who eats mustard sauce on chips!!!).

There are a large number of ladies toilets which are clean and well stocked.Definitely generally better fan experience than other grounds speaking as a season ticket holder of another premiership club the Etihad is a good place to visit . Large screens give good information and replays .Music is good including Oasis tracks.Fans are self deprecating and quite funny and friendly.

Lucas and Georgia did the stadium with us, and the lovely Graham did the academy tour. Probably because we had the other tours to compare it to, we really appreciated the personal touches on this. Great not to be relying on ‘media devices’, but to hear stories from people who are entertaining and obvious fans themselves. Loved hearing about the past and present, and there are some really fun touches, like the interactive press room. Well worth the extra for the academy tour, and we even got to see Pep leaving after training. We are not converted, but have a new respect for City!

I normally walk down to piccadilly gardens or st Peter's sq. You can now use your debit card touch and go for the tram. Meaning you dont have to que for a ticket.

It can certainly accommodate the biggest of stage sets and due to its proximity to the city centre and transport links to teams buses trains and planes it is a perfect place to go see the best bands on offer never mind football.",Jun 2019

Staff friendly and helpful in most cases.",Jun 2019
UK,Etihad Stadium,4.0,"A really impressive stage, sound and lights set up. Our tickets had us so high up we were almost outside, I literally had the wall to my back. I could have carried out some engineering inspections of the roof I was so high up, and our tickets were not the cheapest seats!!!!

Metallica get 5 stars, it’s the venue I’m giving four green circles. It’s a large stadium, good signage and directions, but a bit basic.",Jun 2019
UK,Etihad Stadium,4.0,"I last visited the Etihad in June 2016, and was impressed then. Three years later it was even better and it wasn't just that the lifts worked. I have never seen so many support staff: by every door, by every gate, by every staircase - all smiling and ready to help.
The seats in the £95 section were comfortable and padded with reasonable knee room, and dry as the canopy roof extended over the seating if not the pitch or even the stage so the moshers and the band were soaking wet.
My only quibble (great word, quibble) is the distance from the orange disabled car park and where our disabled friendly seating was, I'm not a great walker and use sticks so it was a bit of a pain (literally) to walk three quarters of the exterior of the stadium twice.
On a safety note, we were pleased to see how quickly the stadium can be emptied, no doubt even more quickly in case of an emergency.
Still not keen on stadia concerts but Etihad is still the best open air venue so far.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"Stadium gigs can be a bit of a lottery, distance from the band, poor sound quality poor facilities are often the complaints. However the Ethiad is really well organised and for a stadium of this size it feels really intimate and the sound was really good. The car parking is close and easy - cash only. There are many parking lots on the way to the stadium but frankly for proximity to the stadium and space and security the Stadium is a great option. The stewards also give the impression they are there to make sure you have a good time. Highly recommended.",Jun 2019
UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"Wanted to see some of the football culture of a city so rich with it. The Etihad Stadium is a nice sight to see while in Manchester. Easy to get tickets for a tour. The tour group was a nice, not overcrowded, size. Our tour guide was amazing (think his name was Ray). They take you into the stadium, beside the pitch, in the locker rooms, and into the premium members club. Incredible to think that some of the best soccer players in the world have walked the same halls.",Feb 2019

UK,Etihad Stadium,3.0,"Had a hour to spare (whilst at Manchester Royal Infirmary) and brought my dad here as he's a Man City fan.
Today was a rainy Thursday afternoon and out of season. We were impressed with the outer stadium and were directed round the stadium and shown where to park using my blue badge. We were a bit disappointed with the Citystore being refurbished and closed, however there were two concessions around the back which were open. The staff in here were extremely helpful and friendly. We were unable to find a cafe or anywhere to get a drink until we spotted a cafe open sign at the nearby England squash courts/ sports centre. Once in, there was no one around and reception staff left me standing there whilst they chatted amongst themselves. When I asked if the cafe was open, I was told firmly it was closed and to try a vending machine. This was out of order.
Bit niggly that there didn't seem to be somewhere to get a warm drink despite there being plenty of people walking about and taking photos etc. I feel slightly less inclined to pay £25 each for the stadium tour...sorry Man City!

Muse on Saturday and was a bit worried but amazing organisation, stewards were fantastic and plentiful. Great and full security checks . No crushes. Will go back here to see bands even if it is way out of our area.

Ground staff were all pleasant and helpful and the drink prices were no different to any other stadium gig we have attended.

UK,Etihad Stadium,4.0,"I've never been to the Etihad before and i usually see gigs at the MEN, however when Muse was coming to town I wasn't going to miss out.
The Etihad may be known for being the home of Manchester City but what a great gig venue! I loved the zone out front with the ( very expensive but typical venue priced) food and drinks, and staff were very friendly if you needed help finding anything.
Beginning the stadium was fine. I half expected them to do security checks in the fan zone area though rather than not u til you get inside. It was unclear where to go once you got in...we just had to keep asking stewards, who again were very friendly.
The sound was great and it's obvious all the hard work that goes into getting the place ready and taking it all down after everyone goes. They did a lot to ensure it wasn't pure chaos at the trams too, making sure it was orderly.
It's a great place for a concert and I'd be happy to come here again for another great concert!

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"We saw Muse here on Saturday 8 June, and were completely blown away by everything - the performance, the lighting, the effects, the sound, the sunset! The Etihad is a fantastic venue for this type of event, and if you want to enjoy the sunset, choose high seats on the South East side - we were in block 307. But don't choose seats 218 & 219 - these did seem to be a bit precarious, at the very top of a steep set of concrete steps - one false move ... The organisation at the venue is second to none - fantastic, friendly security staff who will help you every step of the way. You aren't allowed to take your own food or drink into the venue, but the food & drink outlets inside will refill your empty bottle with water. Alternatively, an unopened 500ml bottle of water is allowed. Back to the food & drink outlets - they are ridiculously expensive! The toilet facilities are good, expect queues at peak times. In the God's seats we were cold to begin, you do feel a draught, and it was a cold & rainy day in June. But it does warm up once the gig gets going - would recommend bringing a fleece just in case! Transport to & from the stadium is very good, but it did get rammed after the gig, maybe because there were other events going on in Manchester. The organisation before and after was excellent, plenty of staff to help facilitate and manage the crowds, let them help you, they really are lovely!!

UK,Etihad Stadium,3.0,"If I attend a football match at the Etihad and stand up I will be asked to sit down and then risk being ejected if I do not comply. Why the is it acceptable to stand up and obstruct other customers view at a concert. Last night yet again I had to watch 2 mature men nearly coming to blows due to one of the wives having no consideration while the steward turned blind one. Surely if you want to dance then there is plenty of room on the pitch. Do these selfish individuals not think that some punters have chosen a seat on issues such as injury,age,medical condition.I must stress this did not directly involve myself but I am seeing such incidents at converts on a regular basis. Come on Etihad and other such venues sort your policy out so we can avoid such hassle at an otherwise excellent venue.Top venue,excellent facilities.

The main issue was the restricted view from our seats - South Stand, Block 213, seats 325 and 326. The view was blocked by a very tall speaker. We paid almost £90 each for the tickets and no warning that it was a restricted view. This was very disappointing and spoilt our enjoyment of the evening.",Jun 2019

It rained and the roof was open so if you are on the lower levels, be prepared to get wet. Luckily, they sale ponchos for inclement weather. I was too excited so i didnt mind!!

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"At last I was able to visit the club I had followed since I was ten. Back then Maine Road was our ground, which we also saw the remnants of the next day, by the way, but now time had come to enjoy the amazing Etihad as well as the club's Football Academy. First out was Graham to guide us through the inside of the Etihad rooms and ground. He took us through to the pitch, which this actual day still was covered with plates after the Spice Girls' concert the evening before. Passing though numerous rooms, among others the post match press room, we were allowed to sit in Pep's chair and have him virtually interacting with us. This left us all very impressed indeed. Graham was more than willing to answer our questions, also mine about the old times. Afterwards we were taken on a buggy ride with Ian to the Football Academy. He too is a most polite, professional, forthcoming and humourous guide. We had a very interesting tour, led by genuinely giving and kind employees. You can be very proud of them, City!

40 minute (minimum) queues for a sardine can on rails (aka a tram) both ways. There were additional buses on the way back, but the queue again was miles long.
Then once at the venue cheerless security and unhelpful staff.
Drinks were a rip off and decanted into plastic glasses (pint of wine anyone). Taking in bottles was forbidden apparently, yet you could see many coke bottles and lager ones. When you're expected to pay £25 for a cheap plastic bottle of wine you should at least be allowed the luxury of having it in the bottle and not as a 'drink me all now' option.

This did put a dampener on an otherwise excellent night, but things like this would stop me from going again.

As is generally the case, the ladies toilets were always busy and queuing estential. To be fair they did have lots of Portaloos as well. The Spice Girls gave a really good show, with fireworks too. At the end of the show it was very easy to exit the Stadium with lots of staff directing you. No problems. There was somebody who needed medical attention and the staff were able to locate the person by holding their high-vis jacket up in the air on a stick, thereby making the place to be sought easy to be foind.

While it was raining on the day we had seats in block 106 which were undercover and provided a good view of the stage.

Facilities including toilets and bars for food and drink were plentiful with low queues(although nowhere seemed to stock any sweets or chocolates - only crisps!).

After the concert was a bit chaotic exiting the stadium and knowing which direction we needed to be in but I suppose this is to be expected for a large venue.

A good venue for a concert although if standing there is no protection from the elements.

Staff were pointing us in each and every direction with no clear point for us to safely get a taxi. We may have walked 2 miles up and down being sent around in a wild goose chase. Not from around the area so not really any clue where we were going. Spoke to alot or families and groups in the exact same postion as us.

On attempting to regain entry through the barrier where we had been led out from at Door K, we were rudely instructed to re-join the back of queue again. After nearly two hours I had one young daughter in tears as we had missed seeing Jess Glyn and my adult pregnant daughter feeling faint by the length of time spent queuing. I was appalled at your staff’s lack of empathy or awareness of procedures to follow when your system breaks down and I was disgusted with the manor in which I was marched away from Door K.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"We went on this tour because we needed one where there was a Spanish audio version available, having two Spanish exchange students with us as well as 3 teenagers. The tour is well presented and our tour guides (Cameron and Judy) were helpful and informative, ready to answer any questions as well as giving the standard talks. If you are a football fan, you’ll like this tour even if you don’t support Man City because it’s as much about what a typical modern stadium provides for its players as about Man City specifically. You get to see the home and away changing rooms, go through the players’ tunnel into the dug out area, and see a variety of other aspects of the stadium as well. The opening part of the tour includes a well made 360 degree video presentation, and at different points during the tour you get to view 360 degree pictures of the area you are standing in. There is also a very clever interactive spot in the press room where you can sit at the interview table and be photographed alongside a VR version of Pep Guardiola. I am not a football fan myself, but I enjoyed the tour, so I’d guess that if you are a fan you’d like it venue more! I would recommend turning up the full 15 min in advance because you then get a chance to look around the small museum in the waiting area.

First we watched a video with French commentaries (I believe they can offer up to 10 different languages to the visitors) then we did the tour of the stadium and finished in the shop. The tour lasted more than an hour and Martin and Dominic accommodated to our itinerary timings (my group was catching their flight back to France after the visit).

Martin was full of little stories and you could feel his passion for football. He was an amazing entertainer, could answer the many questions asked that morning and made an effort speaking a bit of French to my group. I do not really follow football and the tour made me want to learn more about this sport.

Start the day with the tour so you can sit in 'Pep's seat' and see where they do the TV interviews and get near to the hallowed turf. Our tour guides were fantastic - Linda was a diehard City fan and was terrific.Ray was an old funny Mancunian. It set the game up magically. City have thought about an overall family experience and they have music and interviews before and after the game to entertain the crowds. High drama as the coach with the players arrive and are taken through the 'tunnel club.'
I had waited a long time to see City play at home and it was a perfect weekend. I absolutely love the set up at Manchester City after many decades a club to be genuinely proud of.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,Amazing stadium and the most important thing it’s the comfortable seats!! You can enjoy the football match,Jun 2018
UK,Etihad Stadium,1.0,"I was so excited about finally seeing Beyoncé live and found the evening quite disappointing.
The seats and surrounding areas were dirty.
The worst thing was, a few seats from mine a couple of mums were buying their young teenage girls countless bottles of cider and then openly handing out small pills from a small plastic bags.
The stewards appeared not to notice at all, in fact not looking at the crowds at all.
I couldn’t believe this had all got past the security checks.
It left me feeling quite sick and terribly sad.
I did ring the events number at the stadium the next day and spoke to a lovely lady who was very concerned about what I’d told her. I’m sure she tried to get to the bottom of it.
I hope things get stricter. My husband says they are strict on match days. I wouldn’t know about that.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"It was a choice between this, Old Trafford or shopping. You can see why this won out!

Despite my apprehension, Mike, our tour guide, made us non City fans feel at ease and said everyone was welcome at the stadium (even after giving me a yellow card for being a Liverpool fan!).

We had the full tour which lasted over 1.5 hours and was nearly access all areas. Everything was covered from what goes on behind the scenes to match day and all the preparation that goes into that.

My only complaint, there was no trophy room tour, but I suppose you can’t fit a 30 person tour in a broom cupboard...!

In all seriousness it was a great way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday!

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"I was bought a tour of the City Stadium and CFA by my wife for Christmas and it did not disappoint. Our host Paul Devlin was fantastic. Knowledgable, funny and always willing to answer any questions that came forward and was particularly good with the kids in the tour. He even treated a man united fan that was on the tour with dignity and respect, with the odd jovial dig here and there which was all in good humour. The tour took in most of the stadium and we also managed to get a brief glimpse of the CFA which is truly impressive. If I had one note of constructive criticism, I would have liked to have seen some trophies on the tour -Now we actually have them! I wasn’t expecting to be lined up to take a picture holding a trophy, but at least a room or display where they are on show for fans to see close up would have been the cherry on top. But all in all. A very enjoyable tour of the club I love. Keep up the good work!

Slightly expensive at £4.50 a pint but in line with “town prices” TOP TIP - if you have a season ticket you can use that to get a 10% discount at the bar.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"I had a tour of the stadium on Monday which was a Christmas present.
The stadium was easy to get to and there was plenty of free parking available.
The tour began at 12:30 and Jeff our tour guide, who was very informative, took us around telling us various facts about the stadium while we were shown the tunnel club, changing rooms, dugout area and media rooms.
There are plenty of opportunities for photos so bring a camera!
The tour lasts around a hour and a half and is ideal for city fans.

Even better was having champions league tickets the next night to see a 7-0 thrashing! Wish we could meet the Schalke fans who took the tour again...

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"Even if you are not a football fan, or perhaps a rival supporter, touring through the Etihad Stadium will not disappoint you. Ahead of the brilliant planning and story of the stadium's erection lies an astethitic home to the Manchester City Football Club and its supporters. With the knowledge and assistance of the club's tour guides, you may be able to experience what it feels like to stand within the glass tunnels from a player's perspective as well as the physical and mental training that goes in minutes prior to kick off.

The tour gives all football fans an understanding of what ""home advantage"" really means and the techniques used in all the dressing rooms, on the pitch and off the pitch to place visiting teams in discomfort.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"On Monday 4th March a footballing friend and I made a trip to Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. We were guided around all the areas of the stadium by an excellent guide called Martin. There were about 20 guests from various parts of the world including USA, Portugal, Hong Kong and France. The City fans were in the minority. Martin helped us get on with each other and made it a social occasion. We covered all the interesting places including home and away changing rooms, media interview rooms, treatments rooms, exclusive restaurants, seating areas as well as the home and away manager, support staff and players seats on the touch line. In each place we were encouraged to ask questions, take as many photos as we liked and try to get a feel of what it would be like for the players. It even include running out of the tunnel to a recorded sound of the crowd. As a Crystal Palace supporter I mentioned, as often as I could, that they were currently to only Premier League team to win there this season. It was all taken in good heart. His knowledge and the freedom of the areas we visited made it a very enjoyable visit. The atmosphere and some 'secrets' were were told throughout the tour so it would make it very worthwhile visiting even if you didn't like football. Thanks to Martin an Manchester City we had a great time.

It was an absolutely amazing day out. It was brilliant to get a feel of what the players do on a match-day.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"I attended the tour today and really enjoyed having an insight into Man City.

Martin engaged with the small group and I warmed to him. He clearly has a real passion for the club. I was lucky as there were only 11 people in the group which meant it felt very personal. Martin went out of his way to find out where people were from and regularly made links back to the information he had gained about us. He was very obliging in taking photos for people and seemed to really care about making the experience a memorable one. It felt like I was receiving Martin's version of the tour for the first time - what I mean by that, is that it didn't feel like he had said those things, or told those stories before - which takes a great skill especially if he delivers 3 tours a day. Martin also made sure that each and every one of us felt part of the tour - picking us out as individuals as we went along too.

UK,Etihad Stadium,2.0,"I was in Manchester for the City V West Ham game with time to spare pregame so decided to take the match day tour and was rather disappointed with the experience. I knew that dressing rooms were off limits but I left feeling like I hadn’t learned anything about the club, stadium or really seen anything memorable.

You meet at the club shop before making your way through reception into the stadium, brief stop in tunnel club (fancy dining/hospitality area). From here you are led out into hospitality seating (1st tier on halfway). Then led to dugouts, photo opportunity to sit in Peps seat. Then led to press room and that’s all. Tour took approx 1 hour (including walk to reception and security checking bags etc on entry to stadium).

I’ve done a number of tours dotted around the country and even a few abroad and left this feeling very underwhelmed. No club history, no trophy room, no hospitality suites, no visit to upper tiers of stands. If your going to a game anyway give the match day tour a miss.

This alone was outstanding and my son could not believe it. It was there we received info as to when the players bus arrives on match night. When we arrived at the stadium , i was overwhelmed at the efforts but in by manchester city. It was like one big holiday resort. From live music, games, astro matches, face painting. We stood on the blue carpet waiting on the players arrival and it was there the magic happened. My son was the lucky child to be chosen to join the players on the pitch before the game for the team photo. Manchester city go above and beyond for their fans.

The second we entered the grounds, every person we came into contact with that worked there, were extremly, polite,helpful, generous and friendly, they all made my brother feel so special for coming all the way from Ireland.
Our tour guide in particular 'Graham' was an absolute gentleman and a rey of sunshine. He made me laugh all the way through the tour and He made a 10 year old listen intently, which says a lot 😂

At the end of the tour, we went to use the 10% discount in the Man City store,just as we went to pay for the MANY things my brother bought(superfan), We bumped into Graham who had ran to give Cal Some City programmes (which he collects) and a page of printed autographs from the team. It warmed my heart so much and made my brothers day.
He said it was 'definetly the best birthday present ever.

As you can see from the pictures it was a beautiful sunny day, with the loveliest company, in the best stadium.

He was absolutely brilliant and truly made the trip for us. His passion for the club was obvious for all to see and his knowledge which I know is to be expected for a guide, was second to none, he went beyond with such detail I felt more educated than ever about this amazing club. He had a wonderful rapport with the people on our tour and his humour was absolutely brilliant, a true Liverpool fan through and through. We were sorry when it came to and end. He may remember a Scottish couple, my husband a Manchester United fan, he certainly gave him so grief for that 😂 in the funniest and nicest way of course. This is a must tour for any Liverpool fan you won’t be disappointed, even more so if Michael is your guide. Truly then best day out. Thanks for it the memories Michael 10/10.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"As an Arsenal fan I felt happy to visit this cathderal of football with memories of our 1989 league win here. The tour couldn't take in everything on my visit owing to covid but just to get to walk around the pitch was so atmospheric, recalling the great names of English football that had graced this stadium. Well worth a visit for all football fans!",May 2021
UK,Anfield Stadium,3.0,"As a life-long LFC supporter I had dreamt of visiting the Anfield stadium for years as I don’t live in Liverpool myself.

As an experience, it’s good to see the actual pitch from the stands and pitch-side. The tour guides were very good although I would have liked to have heard a little more about the history of the club. We actually got more info from the guide at the back of the group chatting to us personally.

On the plus side there was a lot to see and we were at the stadium for a few hours. They give you a device to take round which makes it look as though there is a match being played with spectators - a clever touch given the circumstances. It was nice to see the actual home and away dressing rooms and many areas in which you normally wouldn’t see. The pitch-side experience was good, just not enough time spent there. Seems as though too much time spent talking about Klopp so by the time you get to the pitch, it it quite rushed.

As I have a disability, I am exempt from wearing masks so it was nice not to be asked to wear one. I was given a sticker to wear which is a nice touch as we have had tours elsewhere that don’t do this. However, I personally feel that there were too many people on the tour, especially in areas such as the changing rooms. Perhaps they should have split the group when touring smaller areas. Being at the back the whole time, I also couldn’t see what was going on, so by the time I did have access, the group was leaving. Being lead like Cattle does come to mind. Apparently they are allowed 30 people (even though we couldn’t have that many at our wedding)! But this feels like too many given the circumstances.

There is a lot to see if you include the museum, including seeing the actual trophies won which is a positive. All staff were lovely and you are there for a long time, I just think the tour and numbers allowed needs re-thinking. It would be nice to hear more stories from the tour guides who were local and must have a few stories to tell. Another bonus is that photography is encouraged as usually it wouldn’t be allowed.

The Anfield Stadium tour is a real must for every supporter of football, in fact I was the only LFC fan on my tour. We have been on the tour previously before the new stand was built and the new tour was totally superb. The new tour takes you behind the scenes of Englands most successful football club. You get to sit in both the Press room and the changing room and even touch the famous sign. There's lots of freedom on the tour and your not rushed around the stadium you'll get plenty of photo opportunities and a visit to the LFC restaurant makes for a wonderful end to the day, the food is really really good and very keenly priced, its that popular you have to book. If you book the joint Beatles/Anfeild tour and the restaurant I think they do a deal so enquire...!!!

We spent over 4 hours here and could easily spent longer. Unfortunately during these strange times the cafe/ restaurant was closed. But still an amazing day seeing things you would not see on a match day..

Both the away and home changing rooms (brilliant seeing the difference) along with the Gerrard Collection, Liverpool museum and currently the Premier League Trophy is on display.

Overall the tour was enjoyable afternoon for a non-football fan, would be perfect for a Liverpool fan there is so much to see and so much to learn and would happily go on this trip again.

We enjoyed it just as much.
The stadium has a very good one way system and plenty of hand gel station, where was also plenty of staff who were fully knowledgable with any questions we asked.
Some parts are closed, but that didn’t change the experience.
We brought our daughter the Bronze photo package, which included one photo taken with the trophy, we ended up upgrading to the Gold package which included all photos taken.
You are able to take photos with your own camera/phone also.

You get a smart screen guide that describes the tour and you can keep the headphones at the end of the tour but there are guides to help whilst you walk around and follow the route, overlooking the pitch from level 6 and then down to pitch side to sit in the dug out.

Loads of photo opportunities including the champions league trophy and PL trophy.

Parking was easy at Stanley Park, a short walk from the stadium. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the club. The tour utilised technology really well and took in all the key areas including the press room, changing room, the top of the main stand, sitting in the Kop and the dug-outs to name a few. Included in the price was entrance to the museum to see the trophies.

Both of us really enjoyed the tour and spent some time in the massive team store. We also had lunch at the stadium restaurant. All in all a very enjoyable day. This was the slickest stadium tour I have done but was the first football stadium so not sure how it compares to other big football clubs.

I would definitely recommend the tour to all but it is a must for any Liverpool fan.

UK,Anfield Stadium,4.0,"The tour gives an insight in the history of the LFC and Anfield Stadium and you can really feel the atmosphere while walking around, exploring areas that are not normally open to the public such as the dressing rooms. The staff is everywhere, ready to help, but I think they should be receive more training regarding accessibility. The man at the reception, in fact, didn't know what audio description (which is not provided) was and offered BSL. For a football club that prides in giving opportunities to people with disability, that is a big deal. I hope accessibility will be improved so everyone can really have the opportunity to enjoy Anfield.",Feb 2020
UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Being a lifelong Liveprool fan, I am finally able to visit the stadium of my dreams. Taking an extended couple of days from my business trip in London, I hopped onto the train from London to Liverpool Lime Street Station.

Making my way to the fabled stadium was nerve-wrecking, with the butterflies in my stomach going in hyper-drive. As my guide told me, any first-timer to Anfield, their eyes will be start to water. AND IT IS TRUE!! My eyes were watering as I walked towards the iconic structure that has seen many legends passed through its gates. Looking at the world famous Shankly Gates was a memory that I will never forget.

Making my way into the stands, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rising at each step that I took towards my allocated seat. Settling into my seat and belting out the famous ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" at the start of the game was simply breath-taking (the singing sure took its toll together with the bustery autumn winds from the coast).

The stadium gives you a feel of history and what to expect for the future. It is definitely a good mix of the new and old. The closeness between the seats made the atmosphere magical and its a must visit for all Liverpool FC fans.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Brought my Dad as one of our anniversaries, too many to mention. A friend's season tickets but I paid the going rate, £57. It's expensive but I do all the aways and they're capped at £30 so this was fine for our less frequent trips to Anfield.

Everything about the day was fine. If I have one criticism it would be the leg room. The Centenary Stand is not that old that you could say people have grown since it was built! We are both 6' 3'' and you simply cannot get anyone past you when you're stood up without them making contact in some way.

Must mention the last terrible review of Anfield - Georgia2903 - Saints fan trying to be clever/ funny and ending up making a fool of herself. Clocked the pictures posted on TA; tattoos, dirty fingernails, Full English, squirty cream in your drinks, cheap holiday in Turkey. Scummers indeed.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"A LFC for many years I finally made it to Anfield. Fan support volunteers at Lime Street train station helped me find the bus/taxi rank to Anfield. The thing i took away from my few hours at the stadium was the friendliness of all the staff - from security to store staff. Even with all the crowds they all had a smile on their faces and are very much ambassadors for the club as much as the players on the pitch. The museum tour is going through a redesign but was very interesting the quote from Bill Shankly about Tommy Smith ""he wasn't born..he was quarried"" will stay with me. Couldn't fault my experience. Not a speck of litter or dirt and in a football club female toilets - free female hygiene products which i was well impressed with. If you are a liverpool fan..indeed if you are a fan of football nothing will come close to hearing the Kop and the rest of the stadium sing ""you'll never walk alone"" acapella

No speck of dust in the whole stadium. Every paint surface looks freshly painted and clean to the touch. Money no object.

I recommend the full tour and a complete walk around the perimeter of the stand to see tributes to the fallen at Hillbrough and the Bill Shankly Gates which are not in the tour.

We're fans of a championship club but couldn't fail to be impressed.

Well done.

I asked steward about this - who told me there was nothing they could do as it was in his words down to 'air ducts' in building. What ...I go to loads of venues to watch pop gigs , football matches ...never heard this excuse before .Also whilst there was plenty of screens there - you could hardly hear any commentary. Toilet was probably louder than anywhere here . So consequently little atmosphere. My Italian friend after hearing all the 'Ballyhoo' around LFC was a little bit disappointed.

Nowadays I am a season ticket holder and sit next to my son in a very prestigious seat looking down from the new Main Stand overlooking The Kop. Since the mid 1950's when Gerry Marsden got to the top of the 'hit parade' with the anthem from Rogers and Hammerstein Camelot we are treated just prior to the start of the game with a rendering of this charismatic song. You Will Never Walk alone rings out and tears can be seen in even mature folks eyes. This is am amazing sight and sound and sets the scene for yet another memorable occasion which will remain in memory indefinately. May this long continue ( ynwa).

My only gripes was that it was self guided - it is a faff using the audio guide and I often found I had to forward or rewind it get the right area. You do miss something not having a real guide.

Also, through my own fault, I completely forgot the Museum portion of the tour. I don't think it would have been too much for staff at the exit to remind visitors about the museum as they hand in their audio guides for those more forgetful people.

The tour itself is self guided with a small screen and headphones that tell you about the different parts of the stadium. When we visited last time it was a week day and we got a guide to take us around which I think is much better, from the website it says these are still avail eat certain times. You get to see the pitch and changing rooms as well as the whole stadium from the top of the seating area. There is also a museum that gives you history of the team.

Our tour guides (Kim and ooooops) were outstanding. Their passion was beyond amazing and the tour is reasonably priced and is perfectly thought of! Only thing extra I could have wanted was to meet Salah and stay there forever.
Thankyou!!!!",Feb 2020

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"We had a great time visiting Anfield for the stadium tour for my sons birthday and his first trip to Anfield. Started with a few pics by the famous and New statues then into the LFC Shop. Had a good look around and he bought a new top with his birthday money.. Put it on over his other lfc top immediately.. Ha ha.. Then onto the tour itself. Alot has changed since I was there last time.. All for the better. An excellent tour up to the top of the new main stand then through to changing rooms an interview areas. Press room an other areas. An there is old big ears on the way too. Then onto the museum with all the history and trophies.. Plenty of them. Just brilliant..,and finally, a drink in the Boot Room. Carlsberg for me of course. My lad loved everything about it and my missus enjoyed it as well, our official picture taker. Getting there an back was no problem.. Train to Liverpool, breakfast in town, a trip to the Maritime museum on the Albert Dock, then the no. 26 bus takes you right outside the stadium.. Runs regularly every 10 minutes. All in all.. A very good day..

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Ground has really developed over the last 10 years. Spacious, modern a really positive feel. Excellent store specialising in LFC merchandise (!) and there are bargain rails. Do the tour. Get to a game if you can, it is very, very special",Feb 2020
UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Oh boy! This is special.

The tour was excellent - lead by someone who has a real passion for the club and the museum was very good, not simply hagiography. It was special to be in the changing room and to touch the Anfield side on the way out to the pitch (not allowed on it but do walk round it!)

However what was really special was that I'd been given a ticket to the game. I'd been before, admittedly in the away end, and you didn't get the feeling that the fans mattered that much; now: what a difference.

The first thing was the overall ground, it has really been developed over the past 10 years. It still rises from the terraced housing but it feels as if it belongs. The club has invested in the local community and there is a wonderful sense of belonging.

The ground is now set in a plaza (before it felt cramped). There's a band playing before kick off, the super store is doing good business and there's a really relaxed atmosphere. I've got a ticket to the main stand which entitles me to be in the 'Dug Out' pre match area. (One area - once you are in the this area, I was not allowed back out).

Riding on the escalator up to the third level there's a wonderful view out to the mouth of the Mersey and across to the Wirral.

The 'Dug Out' is brilliant. Again, relaxed and easy going. Bars at either end but the kicker are the food stands, eat the world... all covered in the price of the ticket. I had tandori chicken burger - very good.

Then out into the stand. Stunning, wonderful - building atmosphere which is released at kick off as everyone sings You'll Never Walk Alone

You'd have guessed - I'm a fan: I can't compare this to other Premiership grounds (last game was Spennymoor Town v. Northwich Victoria) but I was so impressed. I think the tour though will appeal to non-supporters too, as it does cover the social history and impact of the club on the local community.

UK,Anfield Stadium,2.0,"I have been a lifelong supporter of the team and visiting the stadium was something I had dreamt of doing for such a long time. Unfortunately, I have mixed feelings with regards to my tour.
First, the best bits- Seeing the pitch in all its splendour, the dressing rooms (not replicas- the real ones) and the stands helping envision past and present glory does make the trip worthwhile. I’d probably do it again just for the experience.
The day I visited may have been an aberration but the tour itself was very poorly organised with large crowds herded like cattle from one stage to another. The bloke handing the audio guides had to ask me if I understood English- which is okay, I get asked that often and I don’t mind it but it was quite humiliating for me when the white gentleman next to me was greeted with- Ah! You are definitely English! I almost felt less welcome in what I considered my football home.
This was just one person and I am convinced it does not represent the culture of this club which I am proud to continue to be a fan of, but the club would do well to stay true to its core values and not try to merely rake in the moolah which is bound to follow the club’s recent and what I hope will be continued success.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"I took my 7 year old son on the Stadium Tour (a Christmas present to him) and it was excellent. Despite me being a Burnley fan, I found the tour fantastic and would definitely recommend. It's half guided and half self guided. Staff and various checkpoints are on hand to either introduce the next area or to answer questions - they are very enthusiastic about Liverpool FC as you can imagine and brought humour and knowledge to the your. The audio guide was really well done too - I'd say it was the easiest Audio-guide I've used, lots of opportunities to learn more or just dip in and out as you please. The view from the top of the new stand is fantastic, both inside the stadium and looking out over Goodison. Definitely recommend this tour. I'd also suggest you book as people without tickets were being turned away when we were there as they'd sold out. The club shop was very overcrowded and we struggled to find staff available on the floor to help us. The club shop at Liverpool One shopping centre on the other hand we found to be easier, so consider that if you have similar challenges with it being busy when you visit.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Following Liverpool up and down the country; weekends away, singing the songs and having a few beers is what I enjoy most but my neighbour had a spare for the Everton game.

Great to be back at Anfield though, seats in the main stand, looking down on the Kop, perfect. Season ticket priced seat would be £47 and at the moment, with the football being played, worth every penny.

Good camaraderie around our seats, my friend has built a good rapport with those sat around him, like on the Kop when you used to stand in the same place.

Parking is at a premium with residents parking in most areas or private arrangements charging £7-£10 from what I could see. My friend knew a place to park for free and we went in The Saddle pub first, £2.80 for a Guinness, a lot of shouting between a group of fans but I think they were friends! I couldn't tell you which pub to go in, none of them really stand out.

The facilities in the new stand are excellent and a real eye opener if you've visited Palace and Burnley this season.

Great atmosphere and luckily for me we scored 5 against Everton as I was in the Park End the last time we scored 5 against them.

A great night out.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"We booked an Anfield tour for the celebration of our son's 17th birthday - he's mad on Liverpool FC. His dad is Liverpool born and bred and although we live in Yorkshire he is loyal to his Liverpool roots. We arrived in terrible wet, stormy weather but were immediately given a warm and cheery welcome by the staff at the tour reception. Lots of jokes and friendly banter - there's a real genuine 'family' feel amongst the staff. We were a bit early for our tour time and they helpfully gave us our visitor wrist bands so we could visit the museum whilst we were waiting - this was really useful. The tour itself was so well organised and interesting - even to a football fan's wife. We had been on a tour here 10 years ago which was good but the tour has evolved and become even better. The tour guides Gordon and Mike were superb - so funny and lots of personal anecdotes - you could tell their genuine love and enthusiasm for the club and thorough historical knowledge. There were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos in key areas and the background stories were fascinating and funny. We all had a great time and left with happy memories. It really made our son's birthday special. Thank you to the Anfield Tour Staff - especially Gordon and Mike who made it special.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"We arrived an hour early in shocking weather and didn't want to hang around much so asked if we could bring our tour time forward. We expected it not to be possible but we were quickly moved to our new slot with a smile. The first thing that strikes you is the enthusiasm and friendliness of all the staff. Our lead tour guide was Gordon and he was an absolute diamond. From start to finish he kept us entertained with his encyclopaedic knowledge of all aspects of Anfield and the club and his passionate and humorous delivery. Being from Liverpool myself I already knew a lot of it but the rest of the family are native Leeds but they also loved the whole experience especially my son who is also diehard Liverpool despite having a home city team hopefully about to come up. We went to the main stand, home and away dressing rooms, players restaurant and the pitch level finishing at the lower levels of the kop. As I mentioned it was the enthusiasm of our guide Gordon that really made it special, so a massive thumbs up to him. If you come on weekends it's audio tour only so you will lose out on the personal touch, though it would still be a great day.
This was our second tour, the first one was ten years ago. We enjoyed the first, but this one was even better.
On a side note it's a real shame it's so hard to get match tickets so Gordon if you've got a couple of spares that would be great !

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Went to this wonderful stadium tonight to watch Liverpool beat Everton 5-2 and what an experience. The stadium is breathtaking, there is an outside park with football pitches for children, live bands playing, food stalls, pop-up bars. There's view points to see the team coach come in. It's an American style atmosphere right here in the UK.

I was brought along by friends as part of a business meeting (I support neither team) and I was not only blown away by what the stadium offers customers but what the stadium offers in terms of a show. Liverpool played some astonishing football and for once in many many years I can agree with the guys who took me who are relentlessly adamant that they're going to win the cup this year.

Thanks for such a wonderful time!

Our guide was Gordon. Truly knowledgable and shared the info with such sincerity, pride and humour. He clearly adores his team and takes pride in the company he works for.

My child is a Liverpool fan.
I am not but I enjoyed the tour tremendously.

The tour is about 1.5hours and you really get the stadium well including VIP areas.

Go to the retail store AFTER the tour as they don’t allow large bags into the stadium.

UK,Anfield Stadium,3.0,"We took our 8-year old son on the LFC Stadium Tour in November 2019. We’re not Liverpool fans, but our son is currently football mad so we took him on a couple of stadium tours over the course of a weekend break.

I must say we were slightly disappointed with the Anfield tour. We counted about 50 people on the same tour, which was far too many for one group. One part of the tour involved showing the view across Liverpool from the top of the main stand, where apparently you can see to Snowdonia in one direction and the Isle of Man in the other. However, being at the back of the large group, we couldn’t see anything. On trying to go and have a look at the view as the group moved on, we were told to move along and keep up with the rest of the group.

Too much time was spent with the tour guide talking about how many times Liverpool had won the Champions League, describing every final in detail as we walked the corridors. This meant that the latter part of the tour, which was the bit we had wanted to see (i.e. the dressing rooms, tunnel and pitch side etc.) was very rushed. In fact, in the press conference room, many people were still queuing up to have their photo taken in Jurgen Klopp’s seat when the tour guides told us all to move on.

Having been on a tour of Old Trafford on the same weekend (we’re not Man Utd fans either), I was surprised at some of the comments by the tour guide about how much Liverpool like to intimidate their opponents and make them feel very unwelcome. The tour guide at Man Utd was actually quite complimentary about Liverpool as a team - the same couldn’t be said about the Liverpool staff regarding Man Utd or in fact any away team!

On the plus side, the views from the top of the main stand were great and the augmented reality viewing of a pre-match rendition of YNWA using the audio guide was very impressive. We also used the LFC City Explorer bus to get to and from Anfield and the lady who was our guide on there was very friendly and knowledgeable not just about football but about the city as a whole.

Danny the guide (and Mark his colleague) was excellent. Of course the ground is impressive, but Danny certainly brought the Club and its history to life - his knowledge, enthusiasm and passion was second to none.

The surprise for me was how good the LFC story museum was. We spent way longer in there than we expected to and I think even non-LFC fans would be interested in the story it tells about the club's history and through that about the city as well. The other real positive was how helpful the staff were when I was setting up the visit to the stadium. I had a gift voucher for an LFC that I couldn't attend and the staff let me spend the voucher on the LFC Story Museum visit instead with a nice photo for each of us (posing with a virtual LFC star of our choice and a replica European Cup).

Much to my surprise, we left three hours later having been through the stadium, the players change room, visitor’s change room, players lounge and the store. Although I was required to identify myself as a non-supporter of Liverpool FC at the outset, at every stage of the tour the numerous guides based in the different areas were extremely friendly, professional and knowledgeable about their club. The same went for the staff in the (very impressive) supporters store.

All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one to seriously consider notwithstanding your sporting allegiance!

We had pre-booked the tour which as it turned out was a sensible choice as the place was packed. We were able to park within the stadium which as Everton, across the park were at home, was very useful.
What to say about the tour. It was brilliant. For the first part walking up the staircases to the top of the Main Stand there is an option to use the lift. The tour had an interactive audio which is very informative. The views ,historical fact boards, video introduction, trophy rooms, press & tv room, dressing rooms and team dining area along to the walk along the pitch side, the opportunity to sit on the management and subs bench and the Kop is something else. A special mention to the host of guides who demonstrate so much pride in their club and were so helpful. From here we visited the club shop which was remarkably busy with both fans and tourists. After that we went into the museum which shows Liverpool through the decades as well as containing a room dedicated to Steven Gerrard. It is only when we went to leave that we realised we had been there four hours.

UK,Anfield Stadium,3.0,"Six years ago we visited with our girls who were then 7 and 10. It was bloody brilliant and the guide was hilarious. We genuinely couldn’t wait to come back.
Scroll forward to today and what a disappointment...
Audio guides only in half term - a horrible little detail we hadn’t noticed in the small print - and a tour which took so long many people missed out on the actual museum where the trophies are!
Our tour time was moved the day before- due to filming on site - and we were given an 8.30 or 3.30 option. We went for 3.30 but luckily arrived at 1 to both eat in the Boot Room (I wouldn’t bother) and look in the museum- and it’s a good job we did. The audio guide takes two hours - especially when you’re in a huge crowd trying to see everything - and by the time we came out there was ten minutes to closing time.
Why have you ruined what used to be amazing???? The small, personalised tour was excellent... this was dull and the facade of being part of a “Liverpool Family” slipped a little; it was more a feeling of being a tiny part of a huge commercial beast.
I know the reviews are overwhelming positive and yes, if you’re a fan you’re not going to stop supporting them because of it, and no, I don’t think anyone will really care about my opinions, but if your kids get bored watching flat, facts- only documentaries, then a half-term tour is definitely not the one to choose - which does seem slightly ironic!

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Have been a few times both for match days and to do the stadium tour a few times.
Match days: the atmosphere is 2nd to none. Absolutely electric. Very easy to navigate. Easy entrance. Refreshments easy to access (despite Carlsberg being on draft which is a shame). Toilets are clean for a football ground. The stewards do a great job. Not being from Liverpool myself it is nice to see that every single stereotype about Scouse people is incorrect. They are very friendly and charming human beings who present themselves very well and are just there to have fun and to express their passion for this wonderful football club.

Anifled tour: very interesting tour. There is an audio guide but usually are taken around by a guide who is very approachable and funny. Obviously is going to be a biased view of the club by the guide as they are a Liverpool fan but this is done in a humorous way and they accommodate this to rival fans who visit so you can have a bit of banter with them. Have been with family and with service users (I am a support worker) and when I have been on business the guides are very helpful in making this accessible to the unique needs of those I am supporting and made this a personalised experience.

I decided to make the trip from London up to Liverpool for a few days, specifically to see a match, in addition to seeing the city. The atmosphere is unlike any other, singing YNWA gave me goosebumps. A few notes;getting tickets proved to not be easy, so if you read online that Premier League tickets aren't easy to get, they are not lying, especially if you are an international. I ended up buying a hospitality package through the club, it was well worth it in my opinion. Plenty of pre match things to do around the stadium, and you can enjoy a pint down on the concourse, american fans beware though, beer can not go into the stands. If you are able to get to a match here, it is a must do.

A cigarette lighter with the crest on it.. £2.50???
A bag of sweets, like cola bottles, or wine gums... £2.50... really Liverpool??? There's nothing special about bog standard sweets...and don't get me started on the 'Liverpool FC bottles of water!!!'.

As it was first time in Liverpool we wasn't sure where to get the bus but after asking a couple of people we found it. It was ok as we staying at the docks. The bus driver and tour guide was very friendly and gave us plenty of information about Liverpool and the history of Liverpool and Everton. I loved every minute of our journey to Anfield. When we finally got off our tour guide told us the times when the bus comes back. My heart was in my mouth when I went through the gates. We explored outside the ground first where all the benches are of the important people of liverpool fc . Great information about these people that have made Liverpool fc great. Then we visited the memorial of Hillsborough. It was a lovely memto of the fallen 96. We next had a look at the shop where you could anything from strips to keyrings and fridge magnets. We decided to see if we could go on the tour a bit earlier than our 12 oclock slot. The people at the desk was very friendly and we got in. Handed our earphones and small handheld tablet. There was plenty of guides around if you had a problem but you were allowed to go at your own pace. The small handheld tablet gave you plenty of info as you walked around. Well worth the money. Also when you get back to the dock's you can use your ticket for the rest of the day on the yellow bus. We paid £20 each to visit Anfield and £8 for the bus. Well worth the money

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,Fantastic tour of stadium and museum. Last did the tour in 2007 and enjoyed the original changing rooms etc. Wondered if the new facilities would lack some of the impact but needn't have worried. Guide Terry was superb and obviously loves sharing his stories. £20 each is a bargain especially if you're a LFC fan,Oct 2019
UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"So, I’m not a Liverpool fan and in fact I don’t even like football...but I absolutely loved the stadium tour and would highly recommend it.

The staff couldn’t have been any more attentive and really added to the whole experience.

The stadium is so impressive and to go behind the scenes and see the players changing rooms, media room and then walk out to the pitch was just brilliant.

The volume of people who visit blew my mind but at no stage did it feel rushed or too busy.

Make sure you pay a visit to the shop too, again it’s a great experience.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,The new Anfield tour brings you to experience the new Main Stand and the feeling of walking in to Anfield like the players do. The new main stand is just amazing compared to the classic old stands. Remember to take a walk around the Anfield area to see places like Hotel Tia and the great wall painting of Trent Alexander Arnold.,Sep 2019
UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"A visit to Anfield to see our beloved Reds play against Leicester City was all we'd hoped it would be.

Having traveled to the UK for a holiday from the US, we couldn't pass up the chance to go to the match. We booked a package through Dublin-based Marathon Sports Tour (highly recommend), and spent two night in a waterfront hotel and received two tickets to the match. We sat (actually stood for most of the match) in the Kop end of the stadium and loved every moment of it, surrounded by the most enthusiastic supporters we've ever experienced in sports. Truly an experience to add to your list.

The entire game day experience was amazing. Ample vendors and live entertainment outside the venue prior to entering providing a raucous and fun-filled couplenof hours. The food was better than the fare you'd see at stadiums in the US in our opinion.

The staff at the stadium were easily recognized and happily provided needed answers and directions to our seat.

If you ever have the chance to visit Anfield, on a game day or not, we highly recommend doing so. A win in the match probably helped a ton, too!

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"Visited here on Saturday with my partner and 15 year old son. We’re from Glasgow and Liverpool FC has always been his “ second” team so when we were coming to Liverpool we had to book the stadium and museum tour.
We booked for 10 am and thought we’d be finished by back of eleven but there was so much to look and experience that we ended up rushing away to our next appointment at 12.30! Audio self guide but also lots of staff at various points throughout the tour who provide additional commentary and information. The staff were all friendly, witty and helpful. The view from the new stand is amazing and it was a gorgeous autumn morning which really added to the experience. You find out about the history of the club, their influential managers, all their successes and their great players. You see the changing rooms, press areas, trophies, dug out and the famous “ Kop”. The museum is very interesting too and Stephen Gerrard has donated a lot of his personal mementoes - medals, shirts, photos, England caps etc. Would thoroughly recommend this tour.

UK,Anfield Stadium,5.0,"We bought this stadium tour as a birthday present for my hubby who is an avid Liverpool fan. We arrived early and booked in. We were given our lunch times, then went upstairs to the museum while we waited for our tour time. We had our photos taken with the Champions League Trophy (at a charge) and then made our way outside. We joined other people who were booked on our tour and after each of us being given our interactive headset set off into the arena. After watching a film we set off right to the top of the building to see the arena from above. While listening to the interactive tape by David Morrissey. We gradually made our way back down to ground level after visiting the players changing rooms, press room, trophy room, ect finishing off the tour with a sit in the dugout and then sat on the kop.
We only just had enough time to hand our headsets back and disappear back upstairs to meet Phil Neal and Steve McMahon for lunch.
Out of everything this was the only disappointing part of the day, the talk, and photos with these 2 gents was very enjoyable the food however was not. For the price we paid the food was pretty poor (unedible) and we had to pay for all drinks which were very expensive bar 1 small glass on arrival at the dining room -we chose coke but you could have had wine or beer, and the photo's this time were included in the price. We chose that particular day as there were 2 ex plyers to meet, there are different players on different dates for you to chose from when booking your experience. All in all a very enjoyable day - footy fan or not.

When we were booking in I asked the girl on reception (Morgan ?)would it ok for my dad to wait in the reception area until the tour starts as he's 85 and not the best on his legs. Not only did she arrange seating for him but she also arrange a wheelchair for him, fantastic service. If you're a Liverpool fan or a general football fan the tour is great and gives you the history and insight into this great football club and is done in a very visitor friendly informative way. But my outstanding feeling on finishing the tour was the pride in the staff and their outstanding customer service were nothing is too much bother and nothing is a problem. They represent themselves the football club and the city of Liverpool in the best possible way. Outstanding !

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,4.0,"We enjoyed our visit here .There has been a lot of work carried out since our last visit pre covid and there are more exhibits, arranged in a much more accessible way. The Egyptian room is really interesting. I gather they have 84 pieces on long term loan from the British museum which really adds to the interest here. There is a lot to see. We spent 2 hours and would have spent longer if we could have had a rest at the cafe. Unfortunately the cafe and the bookshop were still closed during our visit.

We enjoyed the art exhibits, particularly the section on the ""Glasgow Boys"" and learned a lot about art in this period (1880 to 1920-40s), in UK and around the world.

We loved the Salvador Dali room displaying the painting of Christ. It now has a room of its own and the positioning is stunning. The natural world and prehistoric sections are really interesting too, as is the section covering weapons and conflict was well done. For a medium sized museum there is a lot here for every one, adults and children alike and provides a good foundation for further study of a wide range of topics.

Good information boards around the place.

Will be better once the cafe and bookshop are open. Will inspire people to spend longer there.

However free entry ( donations welcome), and effective anti covid processes in place.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"Before you even enter this imposing building, you will marvel at its location within Kelvingrove Park, adjacent to the University of Glasgow and opposite the Kelvin Hall, the site of G.B. Davis Cup glory. Just over 10 mins from the city centre, this masterpiece of architecture is definitely worth a visit. Its chandelier-decked entrance hall housing a beautiful organ is worth the entrance fee alone which with astonishment is FREE.
As for the exhibits, they range from world -renown artists like Dali, the Dutch, Italian and French masters, Lowry and the Impressionists to Ancient Egyptian artefacts to furniture through the Ages, stuffed animals ( Roger the Elephant is magnificent) and even a Spitfire !!!! Look out for Elvis as he is the building as well !!! An excellent place to visit for quick looksee or a day's in depth culture. In Covid times, pre booking is essential. Thoroughly recommended.

Apart from that it was still possible to see all our favourite exhibits and make up for lost time.

Impressive works of great artists of those famous , Rembrandt, Monet and van Gogh. The museum houses Christ of Saint John of the Cross by Salvador Dalí. The museum has 22 galleries, housing a range of exhibits, including Renaissance art and artifacts from ancient Egypt.The museum also contains a large gift of the decorative arts from Anne Hull Grundy, an art collector and philanthropist, covering the history of European jewellery in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Brilliant exhibitions of Rennie Mackintosh, his wife and her sister, plus the Glasgow boys and the colourists, really interesting. The spitfire is great to see. The only disappointment was the large exhibition of stuffed animals, really sad to see so many beautiful animals displayed in this way, really not necessary in this day and age, would be better to have videos of life animals with information about them, encouraging sustainability and protecting preserving animals and wildlife rather than this outdated anachronistic display of such beautiful dead creatures, a real shame. There was no cafe open at this time, but understandable.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,1.0,"Kelvingrove is one of those places you must really want to visit to go through the hoops needed to visit at the moment.
First, you need to book a lot in advance and slots fill up quickly. Then you have to find your way in through poor signage and a road that says No Entry. It is not signposted from the way of the Subway station that now the entry is around the back. But once you figure it out you will encounter all number of unfriendly Jobsworths feeling important on high-vis tabards who do nothing but direct a few people and cars around the background and of the building. I wish I could have that job!

At the entrance I was told by one lady I could use the lift. Then at the lift entrance I was shooed out by a Jobsworth till I explained I wanted the lift. Then a conversation ensued that involved me being treated like I was 9 years old in answer to my questions. It went like this:
NO Maps
NO Shop (""nothing to do with us, it's outsourced"")
NO Café (people congregate for 4 1/2 hours)
NO turning back from one-way system
NO Seats
NO Mingling

Which really = NO Fun

Add to that the fact I have a health problem which means I need to sit down frequently and we decided to leave.

I also got the feeling if it took 7 Jobsworths doing nothing at the entrances, I didn't want to encounter anymore of them as they were all so rude.

So we crossed the street to a fantastic Italian cafe where we had refreshments, sat down and mingled and then just pottered around this interesting area where noone was wearing a tabard.

As a note, other museums and historic houses are making it work in these difficult times. Visitor experience should be better considered particularly for those with disabilities.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,4.0,"I lived in Glasgow from 1967 – 1971 and went there to meet up with an old friend I hadn’t seen since then. Despite spending four years in Glasgow, there were a number of places both in Glasgow and close by that I had never visited and I wanted to put that right during this trip. It was raining on my first day in Glasgow (some things don’t change) and we decided it was a good opportunity to visit one of those, Kelvingrove Art Gallery. Completed in 1901, the typical Glasgow red sandstone building is architecturally stunning, both inside and out. My friend is fairly knowledgeable about art and she was able to educate me about some of the wonderful paintings on display, such as Rembrandt's ‘A Man in Armour’ and what has become known as the Jewel of the Kelvingrove Crown ‘Christ of St John of the Cross’ by Salvador Dali. There are many other paintings, including works by Old Masters, French Impressionists, Dutch Renaissance, while the museum houses collections of arms and armoury and natural history among others.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,4.0,"On arrival you will find a good amount of disabled parking slots. Against each side of the parking bays there is a ramp for those who are in wheelchairs. From there on it is level access into the KelvinGrove Museum.

There are lifts and disabed toilets on each floor and well signposted. As you pass into each section there is plenty of fascinating displays to look at along with written information about each area.

On the first floor they have set out seats for visitors to listen to the 1pm Organ resital. This can be heard throughout the whole of the museum. You can also enjoy a drink and food on this floor too.

It would be helpful if they catered better for people such as myself who have a dairy allergy. Time and time again they mix a dairy allergy with a gluten intolerance. Believe me they are not the same.

If you are wheelchair dependent you have adequate space to sit in the cafe as well as move in and around the museum.

Free to enter, though they ask for a voluntary contribution. A good place to visit with lots to learn and see.

The main hall is amazing, overall it is a stunning building that is sectioned off housing various displays from Macintosh to animals of different continents to paintings & clothing.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,4.0,We nearly gave up on this visit as no one seemed to know how to get a wheelchair into the building- you have to go down the road to the car-park and then up to the main entrance where there is a lift. Due to a fire alarm and impressive rapid evacuation we were able to quiz the man in charge about the lack of signage. Apparently it comes down to the parks department not agreeing to have the Kelvingrove's sign on their grass. The staff were all very approachable and helpful.

Daughter 14 and son 9 also seemed to find things that interested them.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"The Art gallery and Museum is well worth a visit. The place was busy with tourists and there was a lively buzz. My wife and I went along specifically to listen to the organ recital which is a regular event there (The organist famously played some David Bowie stuff some years ago as a tribute to him). You can check on the 'What's on in Glasgow' website or on the Museum's website to find out when the recitals are on.
We were fortunate to turn up when there was also a brass band concert in the main hall, an unexpected bonus. The band and the organist provided an enjoyable afternoon of music. You are advised to show up at least 30 minutes before the show if you want to be sure of a seat.
The Art Gallery and Museum is so much more interesting since fairly recent improvements.
You can enjoy lunch in the restaurant on site.
Kelvingrove Park is to the rear of the Museum and Glasgow University is not far away (10-15 minute walk). Enter the Uni's main building and you will discover the impressive cloisters. You can also visit the Hunterian Museum in the same location.
The Museums are not too far from the city centre and they are free, but ....... please leave a donation.

Top points for this building

.1 Revolving doors - great if you’re a young kid or an immature adult, I would avoid going in doing a handstand

2. Wide stairs - These are great for skateboarding down or riding a BMX should BMX be all caps? Don’t go down in a shopping trolley, that’s madness

3. Organ - sadly they don’t do requests. You can ask them for roll out the barrel, who knows.

4. Cracking marble floor - you can use it to recreate the scene from Harry Potter or to a dance along to MICHAEL Jackson’s black or white.

5. Elvis Statue - thank you very much

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,3.0,"While I think the Galleries/Museum is world-class in terms of its unique collections, in my opinion it’s at best third-class in terms of providing helpful signs for visitors.

When you arrive at the imposing front, the only way into the building appears to be two sets of steep steps. There is no sign indicating that there is in fact a lift for accessible entry-I only found it by accident when paying my respects at a nearby military memorial. (The lift itself is only reached by a long walk to the left of the building and then doubling back on oneself!)

Once inside the building, there are plans showing the layout of collections & galleries (both on large boards and as handouts), but for some unaccountable reasons, only the room layout and contents for the Ground Floor are shown in bold clear lettering-the other floors appear only in very faint letters, which are very hard to read –what’s the point of having plans if they are so useless?
Please consult with various groups of people with less than 20/20 vision and get some better ones designed.

On this occasion, I had come to the Museum especially to see a temporary display. There was not one sign to show where this was situated. I was not impressed.

Spotting a man wearing a badge and clearly on duty, I went over and asked him where to find it. We were in the Main Hall, and he at first pointed me one way and provided explicit directions. Then he stopped himself and said “or is it the other way”. He then went over to speak to another guide. After both did much pointing, he came back and showed me the correct direction (the opposite way!). He apologised and remarked that even after several years working in the museum, he still found it confusing. (If he dings the layout confusing, what chance have visitors!)

Kelvingrove Management- please get more signs up to help visitors –and please also make then readable! And please start with signs to the lift to help those with accessibility challenges/those with prams.

On certain days you can also sign up for a tour around the organ but, be aware, it is limited to only 4 at a time so sign up at the Information desk as soon as you arrive. You can sit in free seats in the main hall and watch the organist on two video screens showing keyboard and foot movements. And then you can explore the remainder of the museum. It's great for kids, has good museum shops, cafes and wonderfully clean toilets! Visitors from abroad, please make a donation.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"Wow!
This place is simply stunning!
Being my first trip to Glasgow, obviously I turn to trip advisor for advice, and there it was, staring out at me from the screen in the top position of things to do.
It doesn't matter what your interests are, you will find something to delight you at this incredible homage to architecture, art, culture, and history. Kelvingrove Art Gallery has it all, so make sure you set aside at least a couple of hours to take it all in. The building itself is simply beautiful, from whichever way you approach it the facade draws your eye, beckoning you into its doors. Once inside you are treated to a maze of displays, all carefully brought together to please and delight the tourist. While I was there it wasn't only my eyes being treated to intricate artwork and visual perfection, my ears were in for a treat too. At 1pm, as I sat gazing upon the birds of prey, the melodic tones of organ music danced through the air. Making my way to the main hall, the acoustics vibrated through my body as a lone player sat at the magnificent organ to entertain the audience. I could have spent all day in this amazing place there was so much to see. This is a definite recommend from me for all ages, you simply can't go to Glasgow without visiting... You'll be so disappointed if you miss it.

The tour went at a fast pace but hit all the highlights of the museum in one hour. I knew about Glasgow as an industrial town, but learned a lot about the local arts community around the turn of the 20th century. Then I stayed to do more exploring of exhibits of interest on my own. For a small museum it packs in a lot of varied exhibits! Afterwards I stayed for a wee tea and sponge from the cafe and listened to the organ performance at 1 pm. It was a rainy day otherwise I would have spent time in the lovely park. It was my second trip to Glasgow visiting my daughter and I’m glad I finally had a chance to see the museum.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,4.0,"If you are looking for an informative free place to go on those wet days, then this is well worth a visit. With free access, this museum is situated on two levels with lots of displays on various topics. From ancient bones, paintings, animals and much more, all have good descriptive details which will take you lots of time if everything is to be read.
The only downside and this applies not just to this museum but the area in general, is the parking. It can very difficult to find a space nearby, with lots of residents only parking and of the spaces that are available they are often very popular. If you are prepared to drive about for 10 or 15 minutes you will usually get something, but note most require payment at the meter. Of course several buses do pass the area and the Underground subway is about a 15 min walk away.

We wanted to see Dali's St John of the Cross painting - and were really pleased to do that, but there was so much else to see. I really enjoyed the Linda McCartney retrospective exhibition: it was beautifully set out, in different ""rooms"", and gave a rather lovely insight into her life with Paul and their children, as well as documenting life in the musical world of the 60s and 70s. We didn't find the larger cafe until too late in our visit, but had a nice light lunch in the smaller cafe in the central hall. An added bonus of our visit was to hear the organ being played - a Friday special I believe. This really is somewhere worth visiting - and worth visitng more than once actually.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Kelvingrove. Plenty to see, do and learn. The building is split into 2 “wings”-the museum wing and the art gallery wing, which is mirrored over the different floors. For us the museum side was extremely interesting, and where we spent most of our time. So many different topics covered and so much to learn about. But even knowing very little about art, the gallery side was also very interesting, and we enjoyed seeing the paintings especially those by the big names such as Salvadore Dali, Matisse and Rembrandt.
We spent nearly a whole day at the kelvingrove, and still ended up skipping the last section, so would recommend giving yourself the whole day to visit and see everything at a decent pace.
Enjoyed our lunch at the cafe, which was very reasonably priced and much needed after a mornings wandering around the museum.
Spent quite a bit on the parking on site, and needed to top it up part way through the day, however with the entry being free it balanced it out a bit.

The museum is free but they do ask for a recommended £5 donation for entrance.
As you pass into the main hall the spitfire hanging from the ceiling dominates the room.
Below the plane in the hall is a very varied collection of stuffed animals , most dating back to the 19th century. Dotted amongst these are others items sue a sculptures, art, weapons etc.
The other rooms are similar and although the exhibits are good they don't really always flow well together. For example there are Jacobian dress and weapons next to 19th century sewing machines ?!
Star of the show for me is the Dali Crucifixion which is more impressive when you see the video about its purchase back in the 1960s.
Ultimately this place is worth visiting but could be better organised.

We started off in the cafe downstairs, having coffee and scones, a very nice start before our leisurely walk around the museum
After consulting the floor plan, which was given to us on our way in by a very help gentleman, we selected to have a look at the Glasgow boys art first, this did not disappoint.
We then worked our way through each area in turn. There were displays that did not seem to have any explanation on them, which was a tad confusing as to why they were there with no description

There was a gentleman performing Tai chi in the main hall, so good to see him and hear music in a museum

I especially enjoyed the Charles Rennie Macintosh exhibits, an ara I am especially interested in

On our way out we listened to the beautiful organ recital, very fitting in such a beautiful place

When we arrived in Glasgow it had closed, but we spent a while wandering around its beautiful pink stone exterior. It is a lovely building, surrounded by green space, a garden and a view to the University of Glasgow. The next day we walked to the gallery, open this time, and had a good browse around the Linda McCartney photography exhibition. Wow - this was a lovely exhibition and we were captivated by the huge collection of her family, travel and celebrity photos. The show was extremely well displayed, with great information and affection for her work.

Sadly we didn't have enough time in Glasgow to look further at other parts of the gallery, but I could see there was much more to explore. We did stop by the shop though - beautifully set out. Next time we are in Glasgow (oh I hope there is a next time!), we will certainly come back.

As for the exhibits, there is something for everyone. And I mean, everyone. Whether you're interested in 19th century local painters, the origins of the universe, mummification or native residents of the Americas... Not to mention the large section of taxidermy that will make your stomach turn and your skin crawl. The whole collection lacks cohesion and feels outdated and confusing, like I'd imagine a museum of the early 1900s.

When you enter take time to identify the 'must-see paintings"" and temporary displays you won't want to miss!

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,3.0,"I was disappointed in the Kelvingrove when I'd heard such good things. The collections seem to lack cohesion, as if they were thrown together and justified later rather than thoughtfully gathered. And there is a complete lack of self-awareness regarding Scotland's participation in colonialism. It features snippets and pieces of indigenous artifacts from all over the world without context, without cultural attribution, and without proper explanation of the items featured, if there was ANY explanation at all. Not all exhibits are properly marked, some 'hands-on, interactive' displays were missing. Several of the touchscreen displays were out of order. In general, there was a shallowness that might work for those who only ever go to a museum once in a blue moon but for those actually wanting to learn something or be inspired, it's wanting. There are a few gems in the painted works but not enough to make the trip worth it for them alone, save the Dali work.

That said: the pieces on display by Macdonald are better than her husband's, Mackintosh and I wish they had more work of both. The Dali, the crown jewel, the reason I came, and the reason I stayed, Christ the Redeemer, is stunning and always worth the time to see it. However, it deserves a better space. It's tucked in a tiny closet of a room, which is more quiet and reverent, grant you, but jammed with people so one can't get a good square look at the one true masterpiece in the gallery. It had a better space at St. Mungo's.

UK,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,5.0,"Located about 10 minutes away by foot from Kelvinhall subway station, this museum has so many galleries that you can spend countless hours exploring it.

One of my favourite rooms is the one on Mackintosh and the Glasgow Style. You can check out the furniture and reconstructed rooms (including a tea room) that were designed by famed Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

Don't forget to see Salvador Dali's Christ of St John of the Cross - the painting is tucked in a little room dedicated solely to it. The painting leaves many in awe, and the more you read about the history of its making and acquisition (the museum's purchase of the painting in 1952 was rather controversial), the more fascinating the painting becomes.

There are organ recitals almost every afternoon, and it's a good excuse to catch a break.

If you're feeling hungry, you can check out eateries in the nearby Finniestone area (e.g. Ox and Finch restaurant).

All in all, a trip to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum makes for a tremendously inspiring day.

UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"What an amazing experience we had yesterday! The tour revealed the history of the working classes of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. The buildings were true representation of the preserved examples of the thousands of similar houses that were built around shared courtyards, for the rapidly increasing population of Britain's expanding industrial towns. We can't express our gratitude to our tour guide John, he and the staff were truly brilliant. I can't recommend enough to go, we will definitely be back once the Covid restrictions allow us to explore upstairs!",Aug 2021

UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"The last surviving Birmingham Back to Backs are a hark back to the times when there thousands of similar housing developments in the city. The back to backs were built around shared courtyards but were deemed to be unsatisfactory and a public health act was passed in 1875 meaning that no more were built. The last example of an intact back to back development is Court 15 at Inge Street/Hurst Street which has been preserved by the National Trust. I visited in October 2020 during a brief Covid relaxation period and had the chance to take some photos of Court 15. It is a fascinating part of Birmingham’s past and worth exploring whilst in the city.

Everything about the visit brought back many memories of my childhood.
I can honestly say that everything about the tour is genuine and I remember the tailor mentioned and Harry Cohen who had a guest house in lower Hurst Street where some of the ""lesser "" acts at the hippodrome would stay.
My many visits to the ""Hipp"" as a child gave me my love of theatre which I still have to this day.

UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"The back to backs in Birmingham city centre are a great little gem of the National Trust, you could walk past them and miss them, if you do you will miss a treat. Go through the door a step back in time, the place smells of Victorian England, you think houses today are small!
You can self guide or go round with an NT guide , which is included in the entrance fee.
Fascinating insight to how life was for the poorest in society. In 1875, the Government sought to outlaw them due to their awful unsanitary conditions, but didn’t enforce the demolition and councils and land owners were free to ignore the law, even to the point of building more.
Well worth a visit.

Most rooms but the last few you are allowed to touch things, which my curiosity in how things were and worked was awesome. All the rooms were brimming with stories and items. There's also a sweet shop and a gift shop. If you're early they have a little room upstairs from the gift shop/reception which you can wander round in. Well worth a visit and losing yourself in time for a few hours. No cafe but lots and lots of places to eat. I'm only going to post one pic because it would spoil the surprises that lie in wait.

There were 8 of us in our group, we were taken through 3 back to back houses that had been redecorated to look as if they were from the 1840’s, 1870’s and 1930’s.
It gave you a real insight into the life of the poor working class of the time.

Fascinating and absorbing for all ages and taking about 90 mins , too small for a restaurant on site but there is a Wetherspoons on Hurst Street and the coffee is cheaper there!
There are several flights of very steep and slightly tricky stairs so if you are not so good on your pins maybe give it a miss.

What a lot of memories this visit bought back. The narrow stars the tiny kitchen and not to mention the small rooms and low ceilings. The guide was excellent and very informative making the hour and twenty minutes of the tour magic.

If you would like a guided tour of these sympathetically restored Victorian Back to Back houses, now in the care of the National Trust, you have to book ahead.

Not your usual NT stately home with all the grandeur but a stark chilling experience to see how the poor working class residents of Birmingham lived from the late 1800s up until the 1960s. The visit consists of a private tour (so you have to prebook) delivered by a NT volunteer. I am sure they are all brilliant but if you can insist on Wesley. He is so knowledgeable (he was a previous resident as a child) so he speaks with such passion about life and hardship in this community.

UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Visited a while back but enticed to do a review. Considering my folks first house in the 1960s was a back to back in Small Heath, this brings back real memories. The outside toilet with a pull chain,imagine in winter, the front bay window and door, just the small feel of it.
the tin bath, and the yard in front used to be called ""the entry"".
industrial workers had it tough in the victorian times, and it was not till 1970s that the back to backs started to vanish as they were regarded slum standard. I think they are rather cosy, but give me a modern house with a garden anyday. Still worth a visit, you will feel very lucky to be living now not then.

Our small group were led through each room by our very knowledgeable guide, Jean, who could draw from stories told by her own ancestors. Fabulous that these houses were saved from the destructive town planners of the 1970s and 1980s and then restored by the National Trust for the benefit of us all and future generations. Book ahead to be sure of getting to see these next time you are in Birmingham. Thoroughly recommend to everyone",Dec 2019
UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"Visited with family, you have to pre book to do the tour as it’s always busy. The visitors centre is part of the building, you can go up stairs to view some of the items such as wallpaper and old newspapers which is good for helping the kids occupied until the tour begins. You start from the sweet shop, I would recommend popping in the shop it’s lovely. Lots of old sweets. The tour guide was informative and provided a lot of information about the area and the houses. It was a great experience, the stairs are steep, the rooms were good and it was great that you could sit on the bed and chairs. You can walk around the court yard, visit the old toilets and the old wash house. There’s a weatherspoons across the road, great stop off for lunch, overall a great experience.

UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"A great place to visit and see how people lived in the past, so interesting. The tour lasted about two hours and well worth the entrance fee, seeing the different rooms through the ages and waking up and down the narrow stairs the people who lived there actually used was great.

The back to backs are a very short walk from the city centre so hard very easy to get to.",Nov 2019
UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"In summary,

as the tour guide said at some point of the visit: there’s lots of mansions, manors and aristocratic houses to visit, which represented the minority of the population in the industrial revolutions (still this way)... then what about the majority? How the workers used to live during a time of massive urban growth? And why most of those dwellings were demolished? You’ll get to know the answers in this quite interesting visit IN-site. As He said: we are very lucky to manage the last back to backs in the city - Agreed. Thanks Jeff and National Trust for this opportunity!

A grateful tourist.

UK,Birmingham Back to Backs,5.0,"We visited here on Thursday 14th November at 2pm and were taken on the tour by our guide who had lived in the Back to Backs until he was 14. Considering our group varied in ages from 21 to 73 and it was the most wettest, coldest, miserable day we've had in a long while, our guide kept us entertained and interested for the whole hour and a half! His description and knowledge of the houses and history through the ages was amazing and we could picture exactly what it was like to live there as he brought them to life. We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone living in or visiting Birmingham.Thank you.
