UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Brilliant day out. Every member of staff was helpful friendly and obviously loved working there. The beefeaters are a wealth of information, there was so much to see, will go again",Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,Loads of history all in one place. Great entertainment. Not overpriced. Definitely allow 3 or 4 hours to take it all in.,Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,The beefeater tour with Gary was truly excellent. He managed to make everyone laugh but also teach interesting facts about this incredible place. The Crown Jewels and Tower of London building itself were the most interesting areas and unfortunately the Royal Mint building was closed for an unknown reason hence the dropping a mark.,Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This took me right back to childhood and visiting here with my dad. I would recommend getting there early if you want to see the jewels as by lunchtime the queue was massive whereas a few hours earlier we were able to walk right in.
Give yourself a few hours to visit everything as the place is seeped in history with lots to see and it would be a shame to miss anything.
Some of the places to visit involve stairs and narrow spiral staircases so this is something to bear in mind if you don't like that kind of thing but you can walk all the way around the site if you walk up the walls.
We also had lunch in one of the on site cafes and that was lovely good service and great food
Definitely one of the highlight of our trip to London.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Make sure you get a tour with a Beefeater they are very knowledgeable and know the history that touring the grounds on your own you would miss.
Beautiful grounds so old with the modern city in the background.
I would say 2 hours is enough time.
A cafe on site.
Visit the crown jewels.
I would recommend and return!",Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We booked online and got our dates muddled and turned up a day early it was sorted easily with no fuss.
We joined Gary for the Beefeater tour and he was fantastic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and funny. The queues on the day were non existent and getting around every area of interest was easy and hassle free.
We saw all the main exhibits, the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Bloody Tower and time to get photographs with the Ravens.
Well worth the money.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We went on a Tuesday around 13:30, and it was so quiet! We went on the tour with our Beefeater, Clive. Clive was great, spoke clearly and loudly so all the group could hear, was full of interesting facts, and involved the crowd.
The whole experience was good fun for all ages, although I would say there are obviously a lot of stairs, so to be mindful of that.
Would definitely recommend.",Nov 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Beefeaters very knowledgable . Cut short due to rain but plenty to see in the towers, church. Will visit again. This was our 3rd visit",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,2.0,"Nearly £50 for one adult and one child. Admittedly, we went during the bank holiday, so our time was mostly spent in queues. The buildings are iconic, but once you get inside, the exhibits are of a poor quality and little effort to make history come alive. My advice would be to walk around the outside, and visit the Leeds Armouries, which is free to enter.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,We've visited the Tower of London a couple of times before and always have a great day. There is so much to see and the information is very well put together. A great day for adults and children alike,Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the tower. We were lucky enough to be on the tour with Yeoman Warder Kelly AKA Beefy 409 who was absolutely brilliant! He was very informative and extremely funny, he had me in stitches a few times. He said he was actually quite new, but I would have thought he had been there for years, certainly a great addition to the team.

We got there quite early, so were fortunate enough to be able to see everything whilst it was still quite quiet. It's an amazing feeling stepping back in time and learning all the incredible history that the tower holds. Plus my personal highlight, getting to see the Ravens up close and personal; beautiful birds!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,Used our london passes and went straight in. We arrived just as the yeoman tour was about to start. Our guide was Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts. He was excellent and very informative and also very funny. I live this place,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This was a fantastic day out on its own!

Tip: Start immediately at the Crown Jewels as the queues get massive later.

The place is huge and there is so much to see, read and take in.

My husband and I arrived with our 6yr old in the October half term and used our Go City passes for entry which saved us a significant amount of money.

The famous sights including the Ravens, the Bloody Tower and Crown Jewels were fantastic and we were amazed that people actually lived on site!

Highly recommended trip!

UK,Tower of London,3.0,£29.90 entrance ticket price. Really not worth the money. All rather dull. Queued for ages to see the Crown Jewels.,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,1.0,"We were very much looking forward to our visit as a fun and educational family day out. We were very disappointed in our visit due to the number of people there. We felt that, even taking Covid out of the equation, there were far too many people. We had not expected this, given that we had booked tickets online in advance. The website says that 'You can safely explore the history of this famous fortress, palace and prison' and all the attractions that were included in the ticket price. However, it was impossible to visit even close to everything, and certainly not safely, due to the volume of people - every tower / building etc had a queue. For the Crown Jewels in particular it was ridiculous. There was no way to social distance, no one controlling the numbers of people in any of the buildings. It ruined our experience. Given that we are still in a pandemic, the number of people was unacceptable. We arrived at 12 midday and had expected to stay until the closing time of 4.30pm. We left around 3pm as we found the crowds of people too stressful and overwhelming. We undertook a 45 minute Yeoman of the Guard tour at the start of our visit and whilst this was both informative and fun, it was again spoilt by the amount of people - it was difficult to hear the commentary. It would have been far more enjoyable and Covid friendly to have split the group into 2 or 3. There were plenty of Beefeaters around, so I think this would have been a manageable solution to improve people's experience. Also advertised for half term was 'Ghost Raiders' - a half term Halloween activity for the children - there was no mention or sign of this while we were there. I could not recommend that anyone visit this attraction during the school holidays. Such a pity when it could have been an amazing experience. I understand that venues are trying to recoup lost earnings, but it seems to me that the attitude of 'Historic Royal Palaces' stinks of greed and arrogance, having no consideration of their visitors' enjoyment or safety.

UK,Tower of London,2.0,"We visited the Tower with 2 children during half term. I expected it to be busier than usual but was extremely disappointed to find it so crowded. We had booked online for 1 pm but went in early - cursory check. We had paid for an audio guide but such a long queue to get into shop, we didn't wait. It felt chaotic and disorganised - get as many people in as possible. We saw battlements and the white tower, unfortunately not the Crown jewels (queue went beyond the white tower). In time of Covid, I did not expect this. Signs saying to wear masks inside buildings but they were by far and away exception. Only one member of staff on battlements who did not appear to be controlling flow of people into tower. By far the worst experience I have had in a public situation since beginning of Covid guidelines. Value for money would have been good if we had been able to see more. However it turned out to be an expensive afternoon.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Tower of London- I would suggest going as early as possible- we went when it opened and noticed it got busier as the day went on.I got and audio tour for my child and it made it so much more interesting - (ended up telling me facts) and engaging. As you don’t have to do it in a set order it was so pleasurable. Every member of staff we interacted , met were polite and had a smile.
We spoke three members of staff asking them questions each one of them had fantastic knowledge of the Tower of London. The cafe on site had a lovely selection of food for all. Highly recommend going to explore the Tower of London. It is definitely a day out .",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,3.0,"Nice, very busy during half term there was quite a que.
There is some confusion over the towers and would be good to hire out an audio for the tour which didn't come to mind when we booked. Need more than just a couple hours here as it could take most of your day seeing the history behind Tower of London. Great day out.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"An excellent family day out, so much history, would reccomend the audibility package to really make the day worthwhile if understanding of the historical events of the Tower is a priority. We had a 7, 10 and 13 years old and they all had a great time. Would suggest to book out the full day to really maximise the tru historical significance of such a landmark destination.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,It was great visiting the Tower of London generally but sadly a bit too busy (being a school holiday) to see everything. But we will definitely be visiting again,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Great visit and interesting facts. Will be back for another visit. Too much to see in one day.
Well worth a visit and very interesting facts.",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"There is so much history here, from the 11th century to today. Yeoman Warders are amazing - what a GREAT JOB! Their tour is excellent and included with admission - be sure to take the tour.

I became a member of Historic Royal Palaces to have more flexibility to go in whenever we wished during a recent trip to London. Membership is WORTH IT. Be sure to book directly.

Go in, enjoy watching the ravens (they truly take their jobs seriously and provide plenty of entertainment for their visitors), go see the Crown Jewels (WOW!) when there is no line, take plenty of time in the White Tower. The cafe is adequate should you need to grab tea/coffee/cake/light snack while you are there.

Wear comfortable shoes...old cobblestones are not forgiving should your choice of footwear err on the side of fashion vs. comfort and function. Enjoy this wonderful place!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It was a last minute decision to visit the Tower of London before returning home from a weekend away. Booking online was easy and the tickets emailed to us straight away.

There’s a lot to do inside and it’s really informative, it was lovely to see the queens guards doing their marching outside the Crown Jewels area.

I’m glad we went but it is probably something I would only do once in my lifetime. But all in all it was a good day out

UK,Tower of London,5.0,Me and my family loved it! @Beefy409 aka Scott Kelly was amazing he was a great storyteller and we got a photo with him! When we go back we would love to have him as our beefeater tour guide so I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to go!,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,Well worth getting there early to miss the queues into the popular Crown Jewels exhibition and White Tower (although they were around 45 mins at peak time compared to 2 hours in pre Covid times). We paid £29.90 per adult and £14.90 for our 8 yr old and it was certainly worth the money as we were there for over 5 hours. The Yeoman/Beefeater tour was both amusing and informative (thank you to Barney) and would say that the White Tower is not to be missed for great exhibits and interactive games for children.,Oct 2021

As it was half term, long queues for everything, as you would expect (particularly the Crown Jewels exhibit which was almost an hour queue!)",Oct 2021

UK,Tower of London,4.0,Had a lovely day out at The Tower of London with the family. Very easy to book the tickets online and not much of a queue to get in.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Very good time! The yeoman tour (I am so sorry, I cannot recall his name but it's the Scotsman #409 Yeoman guard) was absolutely incredible! A great storyteller and his ""we'll beheading this way"" joke slew me. Well done sir. Then we went through the white tower and I really enjoyed this historical tour. The fusiliers museum was surprisingly small, that being said it was enjoyable. The biggest let down was the Crown Jewels. The crowd control was dismal and the exhibits were quick to see. Felt like a bit of a let down in all truth. The white tower and prince's tower were far better in my opinion. But, and I can't believe I'm writing this, the best part was the cafe! Their cake selection is second to none, exceptional victoria sponge. If it weren't £30 to enter each time I'd be there for cake daily!

Chris our tour Beefeater was amazing, funny & knowledgeable and an hour with him passed really quickly. Crown Jewels - able to get really close & admire the amazing crowns. Lots of steps & cobbles & my knees are complaining today - but it was so worth it.

Book a tour with a Beefeater or take the audio tour to make the most of your visit
From torture chambers to Royal bedrooms there is so much to take in
Allow at least 2 hours",Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,Wonderful attraction especially seeing the Crown Jewels. I was lucky to go on a lovely autumns day and with a lack of tourists could spend more time enjoying the displays.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,Great visit here with teen and a 10 year old. We all loved it and spent quite a few hours exploring and admiring the jewels. Don’t bother with the cafe - lukewarm and expensive! Didn’t detract from the rest of the exhibits thankfully. Well worth reading the walls some fascinating yet terrifying insights to the history of the tower there. We took the hop on hop off bus out to the tower which took forever but was enjoyable as well as giving the feet a rest!,Oct 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Make sure you take the tour with the Yeoman- hilarious, educational and informative! The Crown Jewels are simply incredible and well laid out so you get a chance to get up nice and close and have a really good look at them.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Good experience but really wish we had stuck with the tour guide to appreciate the explanation and history.
Was great to see everything, ravens, crown jewels and the other important bits of history but I do feel like we may have missed something due to everyone raving how good it is, we just found it ok. I've marked it ""very good"" as I do appreciate the important history of the place and glad we did it.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Fabulous trip with my husband and his parents. Fir someone who doesn't really 'do' history i thoroughly enjoyed our few hours here.
Starting off with a tour by Yoemen Warder Andy M was a great bonus. I'd normally find these things drab but he made the 45 mins entertaining (think dad jokes and slightly un-PC, which we loved) and very informative. He finished off telling us both about the guards outside of the Crown Jewels and then about how he became a Warder...by the end we were all brimming with the British Pride that oozed from him.
After that a wander round the buildings and exhibits, plus a drink in the Armouries cafe (clean and spacious).
A thoroughly enjoyable visit.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Feels odd doing a review for the Tower of London. You just simply must see it.
We had a great morning out here. £29.90 each is a bit pricy, but we got two for one by printing off a voucher from National Rail, showed our train ticket at the box office and hey presto, half price.
(You're welcome! :)

We started off as many do with a yeoman (beefeater) tour that were running every 30 mind. The tour was free and starts just by the entrance. We had the honour of being led around by Yeoman Paul who is a real entertainer full of knowledge and a great sense of humour.
He said we made his day by asking his name for a review. Nope, you made ours, mate.
The tour is a fantastic way to start off the visit as its only 45 minutes to an hour and really sets you up to explore the rest of this beautiful historic masterpiece yourself.
We finished the experience with a well earned trip to the Spoons opposite so really did experience the best of British that day. ;)

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Me and my Mum visited the Tower of London on our most recent staycation in London. We were not disappointed. We’d booked in advance online and we got a souvenir book included in our ticket price.

We were expecting it to not last the majority of the day, but oh my goodness you definitely get your moneys worth. We arrived for the morning session at 11am and we didn’t leave the Tower of London until around 5pm. We stopped for some lunch in the restaurant which was lovely.

Take your time to look around all of the places within the tower grounds. The beefeaters know so much and are very knowledgeable so if you have any questions, do ask them!

The most interesting find for me was the fact that Anne Boleyn is buried inside one of the chapels. The chapel is right in front of the place where she was beheaded!!

You will learn so much - and remember it’s a whole day trip - not a quick excursion - so make sure you leave plenty of time to do it - and enjoy it!

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The tower and its artifacts are fascinating when you think of the history involved. However I found it to be a glorification of the monarchy, which I expected, and also war, which I didn't.
Looking at the tower's prisoners' graffiti while they were awaiting their fate was harrowing - despite knowing they'd been abandoned to their death, they still prayed to their gods. Blind faith, I suppose.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This is experience is absolutely invaluable and an absolute must for London, and England itself as a whole. The attractions and exhibitions are pristine, exceptional and teeming with information and history displayed in such an informative but still engaging way. We first visited in February 2017, and recently visited in October 2021. Still, visiting 4 years later, we felt as if we’d learned so many new things again and had the most incredible, special experience. Beefeater #409, Sergeant Scott Kelly, was just absolutely incredible, so animated with a passion for the country and its history that you couldn’t help but share in and feel to the extent he did, and such a warm and hilarious nature within his tour that you couldn’t help but be engaged and hang onto his every word. He made us laugh, he made us squirm in disgust, he made us come together as strangers to participate and marvel at history and he made us want to delve into our history as a nation further and further. There is so much to see and so many incredible elements to be enraptured by, I would suggest taking the whole day for this incredible heritage site. This is not the first and nor will it be the last time I visit and enjoy with the upmost passion this incredible place and it’s wonderfully put together displays and immersive experiences, as well as the incredible people who keep it running and are walking embodiments of tradition and historical importance.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We knew the Tower of London was one of the top attractions here in London, however, the history and the crown jewels just blew us away. The most important thing is to get the beefeater to give you a tour. Every hour on the hour there is one available just inside the main gate you will see a small crowd gathering around him. They are the most entertaining and funny lot . Facemasks were requested to be worn inside the buildings but not outside. The Crown jewel area was the most crowded but everybody kept trying to adhere to the social distancing. The jewels are very real - there are coronation crowns etc decorated with the most amazing precious stones among which are the largest diamond and the second largest diamond in the world. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Everywhere else you can take pictures. The Armory in the White tower is incredible should not be skipped. When you’re done with the tower of London, take some time to walk along the wharf to admire the Tower Bridge that’s very nearby.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Spent 6 hours here and could have done at least another 2. What an amazing place and they must have opened up more of the battlements and turrents since I last visited years ago. The Crown Jewels are still awesome and we were so lucky not to have to queue although i think the pre booking has improved the visit experience as it was far better without crowds of people and shuffling around. The Beefeater tour was entertaining and a must as they really do give you an insight into its history. Loved the interactive part of the White Tower where we tried our hand at dressing the king and shooting a cannon. Views across the Thames were of course amazing. It was certainly well worth the admission price. It gives Goosebumps to think you are treading in the same place as past king and queens - and very poignant moments in the chapel thinking of those executed. A must for everyone.

Tower of London has so much history and it’s uncanny to think of all that has happened in the walls, parades, stairs and so on!

Definitely worth the trip!

I spent 2.5 hours there and really enjoyed seeing almost 1,000 years of history up close. I did the self guided audio tour as well as the Yeoman tour which was superb - Scott Kelly was a fantastic guide and really brought the place to life.

Somewhat pricey but in my opinion definitely worth the cost.",Sep 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"We were a family of 4 adults and managed to get a 2 for 1 deal which I thought made the admission costs just about worth it. We started off with a Yoeman’s Tour which I thought was very good, it wasn’t too short or too long and gave me a good sense of foundational knowledge to look around afterwards. I was very surprised at how beautiful I found the jewels however I did feel like the wording of how we “occupied” some of the jewels was a little too generous.
Unfortunately we hadn’t realised that the winter closing times had come into effect since we planned the trip and ended up with only 3 hours to view the place. Which meant we missed a few areas and rushed around some of the exhibits, so do allow plenty of time to look around. In our research we read that the closing time listed was the closing time for the buildings but you would have half an hour to look around after that. This is wrong, we were all ushered out a little before closing time and they wouldn’t even allow my family members outside to wait for me until I could leave the building and were politely threatened with security which left us all feeling a little sour with the place after a pleasant afternoon.

You will need a good three hours to do it justice but well worth a visit.",Sep 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We did a Beefeater tour with yeoman warder Scott Kelly just after arriving at the site. The tour runs for about 45 minutes and is a good introduction to the site (complete with what can only de described as copious dad jokes). Definitely leave at least 2-3 hours, although depending on your energy level you could easily spend all day here.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We visited the Tower of London after doing a walking tour of the City of London in the morning. The tower itself is incredible when you think of its age, the history and the different uses it has had over the years.
We met a fantastic yeoman there who told us some incredible stories about the tower and his own experiences. The crown jewels are obviously a big attraction but we got a good amount of time to look at them although understandably the distance you can get to them and photography of them is of high security which is a shame but understandable.
Apparently there is an audio guide as well although we didn't bother with it as we were happy just wandering around.
All in all a fantastic way to spend the day. There's also a nice little souvenir shop outside and a few places to get something to eat and drink as well.
Tip: Make your way down to the bottom of the hill in front of the tower where the boat cruises/uber boats are as you get a fantastic shot of Tower Bridge as well.

There are staff located throughout the tower who are all very helpful and knowledgable. If you have any questions certainly approach the staff as they love what they do and talking about the Tower.

Great facilities at the site with excellent bathrooms, good cafe (with prices as expected for such an attraction £££) and lovely gifts shops with items of prices to match any budget for a momento of a great trip or gifts for others.

A wonderful (£5 extra) audio guide really helped to enhance the experience and I learnt so much! We also learnt a lot from a Yeoman who was positioned near the Chapel of St Peter Ad Vincula - funny, friendly and very informative.

So much amazing stuff to see from the etchings in the walls by prisoners, Henry VIII’s armour and of course the State Crown Jewels which were absolutely amazing.

On arrival, entry into the tower was quick and with the right number of staff to keep queuing down to a minimum. We did not make use of the tour guides and decided to make our own way around the tower but from what we heard of the guides, their knowledge was to a very good standard and they attracted large crowds. The facilities inside the grounds were good. The tower cafe was reasonably priced for London, but the selection of foods available could have been improved with more vegetarian options . The toilet facilities were clean and of a good standard. We spent 5 hours at the tower which on the day was plenty of time, however we went at the end of the summer school holidays so it was not particularly busy so more time may be needed at other times.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Had a great day out visiting the Tower. When I first saw the price when booking tickets I thought wow £30 each was expensive but having spent 5 hours and taken the Beefeater tour I can honestly say it was worth every penny.
We visited on 31st August which turned out a perfect day as there were no queues anywhere, we walked straight into the jewel house.

We did the battlements walk where you get some great views of Tower Bridge

Our tour with the Dave the Beefeater was informative and very funny, a quick witted man, it seemed that most people were British therefore mother tongue English which I think Dave enjoyed as he knows we all get his wit!

Beefeater Dave did have to deal with a police helicopter literally overhead (dealing with ridiculous people blocking tower bridge on their protest..but don’t think about the total disruption of normal people we saw 5buses stuck on London Bridge for at least two hours again due to so called protesters ..sorry went off track there!) which meant he had to raise his voice a lot..he did really well.

I have seen some comments about ticket problems..we had none..we printed them off went to the entrance and entered half an hour before our allotted time.

We had a fab day and enjoyed our history which we all know but this visit makes it real and loved seeing the Crown Jewels.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I have just returned from a day out at the tower and have never felt so compelled to write a review! I was with my two children, the youngest of whom has special needs, and my mum (who had an injured foot) I had chosen to come post covid as I knew it was slightly less busy and my son would cope better - however I really needn't have worried, as soon as we entered I got chatting to a Yeoman Warder, he showed me his sunflower wristband and told me about his family members similar to my son, made such a fuss of both of my kids and I felt so welcome straight away! This theme continued with all the staff, my con often touched people's legs, and got the rear end of another warder, I was mortified as usual, but he and another warder laughed it off and made us all laugh too, again making a fuss of both of my kids, as my elder child can often get a bit left out when her brother takes priority, this wasn't the case at the tower! When in the main, white tower the staff again went above and beyond, due to the steps we were all on foot and my son was tired, and lying on the floor, obviously although I try not to react to onlookers it makes you feel stressed, but the staff were able to approach us in such a relaxed manner, I didn't feel stressed or like we were a problem, only supported! One staff member magically got through to my son who has very limited communication and convinced him to walk to the dragon, once on that floor another staff member found his way to us and took both of my kids under his wing, showing them all the interactive games and helping them work them all in a fashion where they could both be involved! We were then offered the staff exit stairs so that it would be quieter, however we wanted to see the dungeon, so this guy held the crowd for a minute so that we could go down an otherwise very busy staircase a little more calmly! Throughout the day Yeoman Warders we had spoken to came over to chat and check we were okay, always including the kids, they also advised the best places for my mum to join in or sit out as she had injured her foot. I became a little overwhelmed with emotion near the end of the day when chatting to one warder because I have never quite experienced a whole venue that is so inclusive of autism and special needs, I would reccomend this venue to any and all families, I really felt like we might miss out not being able to have a guided tour (as my son wouldn't tolerate that) but I feel that we, and all visitors really, totally got the star treatment! I can't wait to come back, possibly on a girl's evening with my daughter and mum again to see the ceremony of the keys. We all had the BEST day!

The one way system was also great as it prevented it being over busy
A lot to see we spent over 2.5 hours there and there was certainly more ww could have done
The jewel tower is good to do early and beat the crowds ans the tours
There wasn’t any drink stations or cafes open but not sure I’d that was as we were last week of peek season

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Visited on 23/08/21, absolutely loved our yeoman warden guide John - amazing and entertaining story teller and also made an effort to acknowledge the bad things going on in the world and made some really touching tributes. Hearing what ranks you would need to reach in the forces etc to be in his position made me feel in awe and quite privileged to be in his presence also. He really made the trip for me! I love visiting the Tower of London and the history of it all is incredible, the whole place is kept immaculately clean, it wasn’t too crowded, queue for Crown Jewels went quicker than anticipated and the staff in all the shops were super helpful and polite (shout out to a couple of staff in the tower shop and a lady in the Raven shop who spent quite some time helping me try to track down a beafeater teddy (tip - if you want one and you see one - buy it!!!! we couldn’t get one in the end despite best efforts as were all sold out)

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Visited Sunday 10am on 29th August 21, had to pre book tickets which were easy to do. Easy to gain entry and pass security checks. Various hand sanitizer stations around the whole site. If you love history then well worth the visit, traitors gate, the torture tower, prison tower, the main tower with Henry 8ths armour and other kings and queens equipment. The crown jules is worth seeing and you go on an escalator which keeps people moving. Be warned lots of steep steps around the towers etc so if you struggle with steps maybe just visit and do the ground stuff. Guards on duty same as Windsor castle, ravens roam free around the grounds who are used to people. Plenty of staff around to ask questions too and gain knowledge from. Per visit it takes 2-3hrs to complete. As usual gift shops around. If you live old British history with kings including Charles 1,2 Henry 3, 8 then worth the visit.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Went on a Friday during school holidays but wasn’t too busy, loads of people but not so many you couldn’t walk through the various rooms and areas to see the exhibits. Listened to one of the yeoman give a history of the Tower, he was really entertaining and knowledgeable and could happily have listened to him all day. I personally wanted to see where Anne Boleyn died and was buried, but there is so much more to see and learn.
As with every tourist attraction in London this was a very expensive day out. Food and drink was fairly mundane in the cafe but absolutely astronomical prices (£7.99 for a very basic sandwich) so I’d recommend you bring your own packed lunch.
For the history and experience I’d recommend this to anyone who is able to climb hundreds of steps and doesn’t mind some degree of crowds.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Went mid week to try and minimise crowds. Good day out BUT be aware of the advertising saying ""Visit now to avoid crowds"". It was PACKED.

Social distancing was utterly impossible and mask wearing was minimal.

Beerfeater Dave led our tour. It was shortened from 60 minutes to 45 but very interesting and entertaining. Not all areas were available to visit and the queue to see the crown jewels was very, very long in the earlier part of the day. We visited towards the end of the day when the queue was much shorter.

Walked through the White Tower, along all (available) battlements, other buildings and grounds but could not cover it all. Planning to return to compete our visit.

I felt that the to the staff this was not just a job but a passion and they wanted to be there, this was evident to how they served the guests with humour and a smile. The only things that could made quicker was the queue to the Crown Jewels and the restaurant only took cards cash not allowed, not made clear until you are at the till with trays full of food.

I would like to thank all the staff for making everyone welcome please keep it up you are appreciated by us guests.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Really enjoyed it, but found awkward jokes aimed to Americans throughout the Beefeater explanation and not sure if he was following a script or was his own improvisation: I am not American, but quite strange to hear that in a tourist area with visitors from all over. Best is to start at 10 am when the gates open and avoid the peak of crowds and long lines.",Aug 2021

We're from the north, and spending a day in London on our way to Legoland, so had to choose from the many activities the capital offers, but we chose well. Enjoyed the visit, and my son loved it. You can get very close to the crown jewels in their glass cabinets (unlike, for example, the Mona Lisa in Paris).

I really enjoyed the beefeater tour and would recommend it. I think ours was called Mark, he was entertaining and funny, but also full of stories from history. The one criticism I had was that it was pretty gory, and there were young children in the audience.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"You go to the Tower primarily to see the Crown Jewels. They are beautifully presented and it is amazing how close you can get to them. They are well-lit, which makes the jewels sparkle. We visited on a Sunday morning in August 21, so there weren't many international tourists so we walked straight in and spent a long time looking at the jewels without crowds; looking at the queuing system in place I think it must get quite busy.
The rest of the grounds are good too- I was surprised at how much you get to look around.
Many of the Warders are very friendly and helpful but I think some of them are a bit 'clever' and full of themselves. One of them scoffed at my daughter's request for directions as it appeared obvious, but when he realised he was in the wrong because of the Tower's Covid restrictions in place, he 'wound his neck in', to use a military expression.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We visited for the ceremony of the keys where the tower is locked up for the night. This is after the tower is closed to the public and is a guided visit with in our case about 20 people.
It was a fascinating experience which made me realise that royal ceremonies cary on whether any one is watching or not, in this ones case for each day for over 700 years.
It was made special by the yeoman warden (acting as a guide) who was both informative and humorous.
One thing to note is that the paths are cobbled so not the easiest to walk on.
If afterwards you want to get a taxi you need to arrange a car to pick you up afterwards.
There is a taxi rank opposite the entrance but no taxis and trying to flag a taxi down at that time of night is nigh on impossible.

This was fantastic advice as we walked straight in. An hour later queues were very long and continued to get longer. The day was very interesting. We were there for about 2.5hrs. I would say allow more time if your children were older and would allow you to read more! (My kids were 4.5 and 7). It was raining the day we visited. But if it was a sunny day I would recommend brining a picnic to sit outside. We all really enjoyed learning about the different animals that previously lived there. Overall would recommend.,Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Wow. I’ve always seen it from outside but never actually been inside before. It’s much bigger than you can imagine, it’s the size of a small town, with so much to see. Every part has things to see from the bloody tower, the white tower, the Crown Jewels, the chapel. The list goes on. And with every part there things to learn. Information boards about certain events/people all over. It can take a while to get round so make sure you give yourself plenty of time. I wouldn’t recommend younger children as it’s not something that would interest them and they wouldn’t really understand the history. All in all a beautiful place to visit",Aug 2021

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I have lived in London almost 10 years and have always had Tower of London on my doorstep so never got around to do it and I’m SO glad I finally have.

We started our tour with the Yeoman Warder who was incredible. He made the door so engaging through his theatrics and incredibly projected voice.

The tour started by the entrance gate and ended in the central court by the White Tower and took roughly 45 mins. I definitely recommend tagging along, it doesn’t cost extra and you learn quite a lot more.

I also recommend queuing for the Crown Jewels as soon as you can as they can get quite long so best get them out of the way earlier rather than later.

There is SO much to see around the Tower and loads of interesting rooms to read about. Our entire visit took around 3.5 hours but you can easily spend more or less than that.

So much history and interesting stories in one location so I would thoroughly recommend a visit for residents and tourists alike

The Beefeater Tour was informative, engaging and very entertaining; the Crown Jewels were outstanding and great to see how they sparkle; walking in the footstep of royalty in the White Tower was amazing. The museum was very interesting to see the journey of the regiment over time and how equipment and uniforms have evolved and not least the ramparts that defended our city. This may have been my first visit but it certainly won’t be my last as there is still much to see.
We also took the opportunity to upgrade our entry tickets to an annual pass, giving us access to other Royal palaces in London and Ireland such a great idea

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The whole experience was well organised, which really helped as in our party there was an age range from 5 years old to 80! Very little queuing to get in, gave me hope as the 80 year old has mobility issues and the 5 year old has patience issues...
Once in the grounds, there are always staff to help, either guide you or to ask for information.
There is a travellator system to move you around the crown jewels displays and then there is a good amount of space when witnessing the other spectacular displays. Plus, we were very impressed with the 'White Tower' armour displays. The availability of a cafe, meant that the older person in our group could opt in and out, in comfort, from our adventures.

Visited with husband and teenage daughter. No queues so went straight in. Everything very interesting and well set out. Lots of stairs so not particularly suited to wheelchsir users who woukd miss slot.
Crown jewel collection was breathtaking, and we admire the queen for the strenght she must have to wesr the crown snd hold all the objects of power...they look so heavy.
All in all, a very interesting visit, beefeaters all friendly and knowledgeable .
We thoroughly enjoyed the visit althought teenage daughter thought it was boring",Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,A nice tour but at the end of the day we were all done. Best done first and allow time. No issues with tour and Beefeaters do a good talk.,Aug 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Was a fantastic experience that we really enjoyed with plenty to see with lots of very interesting items on display. Was very good be able to get within 2ft of the Crown Jewels used by past and present Monarchs. There’s lots of different area’s so being fairly fit is really a necessity with lots of stairs to climb but well worth it. The only thing I found a little sneaky is when you exit onto the riverside you can only go one way so you have to walk through the gift shop so if you want to visit tower bridge after you have to walk all the way round which is quite a trek straight after walking around the tower for a couple of hours. This could be made much easier if they didn’t want you going through the gift shop and not block the other way off. (Very Sneaky) I wouldn’t suggest it for young children as you could see them getting tired and bored.

UK,Tower of London,3.0,"While I've enjoyed the grounds of the castle and some of the exhibitions, the majority is military-centered and aimed at children more than adults. I would welcome more diverse exhibitions, touching on issues such as women's lives, more information about royal jewels and where they come from (were stolen from...). The tickets are quite expensive, upgrading to membership seems to be a beter option as it give you access to more than one place.",Aug 2021

Beautiful surrounds - very atmospheric and grand. So much space, so even when it was busy we felt we had lots of room. Friendly and attentive staff. Kicking myself it took a pandemic to visit.

Make sure you go on a beefeater tour - ours was Barry Stringer, he was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about what he does and added humour along the tour. Also a mention to Louisa, who also had passion for what she does and the knowledge she has is brilliant. The only downside to this visit? Was the queues for a coffee, it needs better organisation, I felt sorry for the guy serving us under extreme pressure and people stood there tutting because they had to wait. Other than that? Great day out for all",Aug 2021

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Wonderful to see so much history and this is the time to go because there was no queuing - instant access to the Crown Jewels - and plenty of room to see all aspects of the Tower. One word of warning: don't book tickets through Headout: I booked 4 and had a confirmatory email but only 3 tickets were sent. On requesting the 4th I got an email saying that although it was their mistake there were no more tickets available for that slot and they would be issuing a refund. Not much use when you have a student and 2 kids expecting a day out. I got a 4th through the booking office at the Tower and Headout did issue a refund but it all caused a lot of unnecessary stress and Headout's apologies were scant. Just book through the Tower's booking office and have a great day out!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"The Yeoman or Beefeater was brilliant! Scot Kelly. So informative and funny. Just the right length and kept everyone glued to him. Superb he was. We thought there was too much emphasis on weaponry. Stirling Castle is local to us and in many ways similar to the Tower of London in that many parts of it have been added, removed and changed over the centuries. Would have been good to have characters in dress and acting the part of Henry VIII etc. At Stirling Castle they have lots Royals and a nanny such as Mary Queen of Scots. King James and MQOS Nanny in dress and talking as they did then and acting the part while you asked them questions. This is brilliant. The Royal Rooms have been restored and are fabulous. Yes Stirling Castle was part of the War Machine, but people also lived there. What about the living quarters or prison rooms of captives? We saw lots armour etc but nothing related to the actual living there of people. The Crown Jewels are an awesome sight to behold. Great place to visit but as I said a little less emphasis on the war machine and a little more of how people actually lived there.

What an awesome tour, very humerus, factual, including the gorey bits 😁, and involved the children whom were present in the crowd. Excellent knowledge of the Tower, big beaming smile, and very interesting to listen to. Would highly recommend getting him for a tour. Simply the best
The Tower was an absolute joy to behold. As I grew up not far from there, on the Old Kent Road, it brought back many happy memories of my childhood and I remember always having loved the spectacular Ravens, beautiful as always. Scott was the cherry 🍒 on top of the cake.
Keep up the good work.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Great day out, the beef eaters really make this experience work, not bad when you consider that this is their home. Easy arrival, (pre booking was required and timed entry) but worked very well. The talk with the beef eaters is a must and Colin who did ours (his first in 15 months )was brilliant, he bought the history alive and gave our visit content. The chapel is very moving and of course the Crown Jewels. Food options were good and lots of areas to sit and enjoy a picnic, watch your food one of the ravens had a packet of crisps off somebody before they could react. Shop had the usual tack as well as some well thought out lines to buy. Can get busy and a couple of areas have a challenging access route, hardly surprising when you take in to what the site is.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"It was pouring with rain when I visited but I wasn't going to miss my chance. After buying a £30 ticket I went through the main entrance to be greeted by a catapult and some beefeater guards in their black and red outfits. I went into what was once the bedroom of King Edward the First and heard some of the history of the English kings who lived here in the past on a TV screen. You also see the throne room of King Henry the Third, of course the bedroom and throne room are recreations of the originals. There are statues of animals as the kings of the past kept exotic animals here as well. You can find where people were kept imprisoned and even tortured, with some torture devices still lying around. You'll find weapons like a crossbow and and items such as coins and pots from the Middle ages. You'll also get to see the Crown jewels, however you can't take photos of them. Go inside and you'll see crowns and sceptres, huge wine jugs and golden items costing who knows how much. The queen's crown itself rests separately from the rest with a huge diamond in the middle. In the centre of the complex you'll find the White tower, inside are suits of armour worn by different kings and the weapons they used, along with some games for the kids. Sadly there were no ravens when I was there because of the rain but they are an iconic part of the experience as well.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"The tower is certainly worth a visit if you are in London, its a beautifully preserved castle with a wonderful setting by the river and tower bridge. We got there earlier than our pre booked time but they let us in anyway, it was quiet on a weekday morning even in the school holidays so didn't feel uncomfortable covid wise. We looked around independently which took about 2 hours or so including a stop for a drink break. It's quite expensive for what it is though and i felt it missed the mark in some respects. When i think of the tower i imagine Anne Boleyn, the princes in the tower, Catherine Howard and the many other unfortunate souls who were imprisoned or died here, instead we were treated to a load of armour clad dummies on plastic horses in the grand white tower which seemed meaningless and out of place. The most gregarious of the crown jewels are rather oddly viewed from a moving walkway, and it was actually Queen Victoria's pretty and understated little crown-ette in a cabinet all on it's own which I liked the most. All in all it's well worth a visit even if it's a bit costly.

There was a bit of a queue to see the Crown Jewels but it soon went down. This was something I’d always wanted to see and it didn’t disappoint.

We easily spent a good three hours there with a 1 year old and 9 year old.

Take advantage of the on-the-hour beefeater free tours - not because they’re necessarily brilliant talks, but because the beefeaters are living legends and demand the greatest respect. Every stone has a story; every corner a myth. Ravens. Walls within walls. Jewels that command their own price - you think, stones, NO, dazzling - bewitching, well worth viewing. Even the view from the toilets is legendary. You’re absorbed in Anne Boleyn’s execution site BUT turn around - there are few better views: the Tower of London and Tower bridge, breathtaking, magnificent. An absolute must-see when in London.

Very informative and interesting, the best part was the yeoman tour lasting around half an hour but well worth doing as Yeoman Mat made it funny and interesting , even for our teenage son . The knowledge he had was amazing .
Can’t recommend this place enough for all ages .🤩",Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,We caught the guided tour which was definitely worth doing as the guides give a good insight into the history and happenings of the tower. The Crown Jewels are a must and quite unbelievable to think they are worn by royalty and then popped back into the tower. A good afternoon out. Some nice shops to stock up on souvenirs. Ravens are massive and quite tame. Allow 3 hours.,Jul 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London. Visited at 12 midday, last week of July and I expected it to be very busy but it wasn't perhaps due to the pandemic and minimum tourists so it made the visit more pleasant. So glad the yeoman warder tour was back on,big shout out to 'Shady' who was informative and fun bringing all its history to life. Would recommend hiring an audio guide for adults & older kids as you walk through each section of the tower for £5 each. Spent around 3 hours here, well worth it.",Jul 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We went on the last Beefeater tour of the day with Yeomen Scott Kelly #Beefy409 on 29th July 2021.

What an amazing time we had...
Yeomen Scott Kelly entertained the crowds with lots of information about the Tower's history by getting all the crowd involved in cheering and shouting when needed, he even checked that the children amongst the group were happy to hear all about the blood & gore. The enthusiasm he had throughout the tour while giving you the information made you want to continue the tour and were able to gain more knowledge as it's done in a fun way.
At the end of the tour there was the opportunity to ask questions and take photos, you can see by his smile that it's a genuine smile and that he really loves his job!
We had such as amazing time and could not recommend this tour enough.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"What a joy, the history of the Tower was brilliantly represented by the well-organised tour, exhibits and signposting. Despite some iffy weather our yeoman guide (Basher) was highly engaging, bringing history life for all ages. The contrast with the miserable representatives of Westminster Abbey we had just visited could not have been more stark. No wonder the Tower is rated #1. Ps hurry while there are no queues for the Crown Jewels!",Jun 2021

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"It’s the Tower of London, so it’s something with a unique history that’s got to be seen at some point if you’re British. The history speaks for itself and would be worth 5 stars so this is more about the way it’s displayed and managed.

It was an ok and pretty good experience, however I would have preferred more displays about the people who used the tower (to imprison and be imprisoned) and less about the wider context of war and weapons. For example I couldn’t find anything about Mary Queen of Scots despite her being a prisoner there.

The beefeaters and ravens were very friendly/engaging and helped to make it a more interactive experience.

Given I’d paid £30 for one adult and one child it was irritating to be constantly plagued by shops and machines selling trinkets. It was also annoying that we were not allowed to exit to tower bridge and so I had to walk the (really) long the way round with a small child, it seems this was just to get us to walk through another gift shop again!

But now is the time to go, with no international tourists and no queues!

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant now the whole Tower is open; there is so much to see, It never disappoints. One welcome return are the Yeoman Warder guided tours which are a must. I had the privilege of joining hashtag Beefy 409 Scott Kelly's guided tour. He is a natural orator and really brought the history of the Tower to life. There was plenty of blood and gore, which thrilled the children present... but it was lovely to hear the story of Lady Jane Grey and get a sense of the pity of the place. We were all given homework to research Jane. I suspect there will be a fair amount of google searching going on as Scott brought a real sense of empathy to her story.

All credit to the rest of the Yeoman Wardens working at the Tower today who were nothing but kind, considerate and helpful. A fantastic day out.

You do need comfy footwear as it is all cobbled and can be a little hard walking, make sure you have plenty of time to visit the Tower as there is so so much to see.
Would certainly visit again and again.

The food available was really nice, a lot different to the other attractions in London and the price is OK. 3 of us ate for less than £20. Would highly recommend this as a day out.

When you enter the site you will see a board for the next time. Definitely worth the money. We spent 3 hours at the site. Cafe on site or you could bring a picnic and have after you leave over looking the Thames. Lots of walking and stairs if you do have little ones or have mobility issues. If you are visiting the Tower not much close by in terms of other attractions apart from the Sky Garden which I highly recommend. You will need to book a slot for this too.,Jun 2021

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Even as a londoner, it's a very interesting place to visit. To really get the true value of visiting the Tower of London, you should make sure to join the beefeater tour (free with standard tickets) that take place frequently. Understanding the real history behind so much of the Tower of London makes a huge difference to your experience. Our tour guide (the self proclaimed chubby William Shatner) was fantastically funny, inclusive and open to provide even more history than what is just part of the tour. The same goes in the crown jewels area, do spend time asking some of the helpers as they are happy to share interesting aspects that you might not be aware of just from walking around and reading the notes on the walls.

We took a Yeomans tour which I would recommend doing for their insight and knowledge of the place. Our guide said he hadn't taken a tour for 17 months due to Covid but you wouldn't know it as he knew how to entertain a crowd and was clearly very knowledgeable.
It's a wonderful time to go now - just after covid regulations have been lifted it's not too busy but everything was open. We didn't even have to queue to see the Crown Jewels which are worth the visit just on their own.",Jul 2021

The beefeaters who tour guild are nice and loud so you can hear well and are really funny as well as super knowledgeable, worth doing the guilded tour with them (free). Loads to see and do.

A must do is a Yeoman Warder tour. I would highly recommend having a tour with none other that Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409. If you want blood, sweat, shock horror and gore and I mean gore then he is your Yeoman to give you it all.
Well worth it and then you can explore the rest of this Royal Hostorical Palace in your own leisure. You will get a glimpse of the Crown Jewels, see the Ravens and the guards. There is something for all ages. You can even have a photo with your favourite Yeoman Warder..",Jul 2021

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Overall I was very pleased with my visit to the tower. The staff were very friendly and the sights were beautiful. Lines weren't long and the food actually respectfully prices. The only thing I did find was sometimes the one way systems are too long, we got roped into one at the very start of the entrance and it didn't let us back out until halfway around the castle! Similarly, there are two gift shops in the actual tower but you cannot enter them unless you do the whole tour so I'd recommend just skipping those gift shops and going to the one on the pier just outside of the exit. There was a lot of interesting history but I would definitely avoid going on weekends so you actually have more time and space to read the signs.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Really enjoyed this day out. As English Heritage members it was nice to link the Tower with other local attractions.
The area is a lot bigger than I imagined and I would say to allow more than 2 hours for your visit.
Some areas would not be pushchair or wheelchair friendly as you can imagine...these buildings won't have lifts as I'm not sure they were invented in 1500s.
Cafe very expensive as you cam imagine. Not only because its London but also because its an attraction in London. I paid £15 for 2 coffees and 2 cakes. I mean the cakes were lovely! Staff in cafe very friendly.
Only thing that put a dampner on it for me was getting a scolding in the crown jewels exhibit. I didnt see any signs saying no photographs and as I was taking a picture of the queen's jewels I heard a booming voice behind me trying to get my attention and finally yelling at me 'no'.
I was embarrassed and actually had a moment when I left the building. I went round to check if there were signs and there was 1 small sign amongst other information saying no photographs.
I was stood in a que watching the guards so didn't see this sign. There was someone on the door letting us in in dribs and drabs so maybe they could mention something in future.
Had a really good day though and hope to revisit...where my camera would stay firmly in my.pocket, when I next visit her majesty's precious stones.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"As a London local it was 25 years since I last visited the Tower so the ticket price came as a bit of a shock! However COVID days suggested that this might be a good time and I was not disappointed.

As to the Tower itself, our trip speaks for itself: we arrived before 10.00 am and left at closing time. There was so much to see and it was all well exhibited and explained. The audio tour (an extra £4) was also well worth having. I imagine that the Crown Jewels is normally full to the brim with tourists whereas we were able to take our time and take several rides on the travelator.

The staff are friendly and helpful and clearly value working for such a national institution. If you fancy a trip to the Tower, now (July 2021) is an ideal time to go and avoid the tourist hordes. Be prepared to spend some time there in order to see all the various parts of the Tower (at least 4 hours I would have thought).

Unfortunately their online booking system was rubbish but the staff at the ticket office sorted things out. Make sure you get your Booking Reference number.

It's a shame we couldn't have a proper warden tour but we will return another time so we can do that then. Matt told us about the keys ceremony so we'll definitely be back more that, and we can't wait. This is an amazing experience and we truly recommend it!",Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,1.0,"As a regular visitor to London, both personally and also leading school groups to the theatre and other venues, I have never been to what is, statistically, the most popular visitor attraction in the country. Having taught English for over 40 years, knowing English history was both enjoyable and obligatory; to teach Shakespeare without a sound understanding would have proved impossible.
So, now retired, I agreed to visit the Tower to see what I had been missing. What a massive disappointment it was. I started with an open-minded approach as we walked around the battlements and looked inside some of the smaller turret rooms, which contained clear information. However, the tour started to grate on me with the Line of Kings, all fully armoured on horseback; apart from the absurd historical inaccuracy, what does this say about our history? That we just like to go to war? Ridiculous. Shortly afterwards, we went to look at what is meant to be the outstanding highlight - the Crown Jewels. Yes, I can understand the moving conveyer belt process, but what struck me as more significant is that all the jewels, gold, cups and other finery only came into existence from the reign of Charles II in the 17th C onwards - and he himself did certainly amass quite a horde. In fact, it seemed to me that the Crown Jewels themselves were - and possibly remain - a political statement about the primacy of the monarchy after the Restoration. The collection of armoury, the symbols of historic warfare, also left me cold. Caged ravens too? Really? The rest of our exploration, including dungeons and the chapel, failed to impress by this point.
And the final insult, for me at least, was being obliged to exit through the Gift Shop and walk a long way around, 20 minutes, back to our hotel - which would have bee a brief 5 minutes stroll along the river bank, had we been allowed to do so.

Conclusion - militarism, royalist propaganda and money- making. The best experience of the Tower of London is from the river or from a higher building such as the Sky Garden.

Staff don’t really care and really unhelpful. The only money spent on accessibility is shops and cafe areas. Totally ruined a expensive experience. The whole place need serious look at.",Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,Beautiful monument to visit in London. The history of this building is really interesting. The crown room is beautiful.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"This was my absolute FAVORITE thing we did in London. Absolutely do not miss out on a tour here. A beefeater who lives within the Tower of London led our tour and made it an absolute blast. Everything he shared was fascinating and his fun sense of humor had everyone laughing throughout.

The Crown Jewels are kept in the Tower of London and I could hardly believe that I was standing in front of all of them at one point. Don't skip the tour -- it added so much value and knowledge to the whole experience.",May 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,A really good afternoon. Interesting visit and plenty to see. It was quiet given covid entry numbers and that probably made a difference. No beefeater tour though. They have clearly struggled to fill some of the white tower rooms with stuff and it feels like they've found whatever they could to fill the space. The Torture at the Tower 'exhibition' was rubbish. Has an unusual 'village' feel to the grounds. Would defintiely recommend the visit.,Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,4.0,"First visit here, was very surprised that so many buildings fit into such a compact space. It was also weird how this historic building was surrounded with some of London's modern buildings. Security and Covid-19 restrictions were spot on, with plenty of hand sanitation dotted around. At first I thought the entry fee was a bit steep, but the place is basqued in history and loads to see. Food was definitely expensive, so bear this in mind. Staff are great, including the Beefeaters who were great at answering questions. If you are interested in the Towers past, this is the place to go.",Jun 2021
UK,Tower of London,5.0,This is definitely a highlight of London and must-see. There is so much history here and presented in a great way for families of all ages. The Yeoman are wonderful and give great information. Definitely go to the Crown Jewels first as queues do pick up later and the White Tower had a queue after we had been in as well. A couple of places were sadly closed but the majority was open and my family had an enjoyable time. Toilets were clean and the shop was full of nice trinkets.,Jun 2021

Weather was great which helped and very quiet so had time to enjoy everything without queues etc.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We spent almost 5 hours here one Saturday and we enjoyed every second of it. It's a huge site packed with history lessons every few paces. It's brilliantly organised, absolutely fascinating and staffed by fantastic people who clearly love what they do. The Beefeaters are amazing, wonderful with kids and those young visitors all seem to love them. My favourite but was the Crown Jewels but there is so much more to enjoy. I don't like the fact that they still messAges there and clip their wings. I feel that this is such an old fashioned superstition and that we ought to have left it in the 20th Century. I feel that it is cruel and unnecessary and should be stopped. But that aside, this is a brilliant family friendly full day out worth every penny of the entrance fee.

UK,Tower of London,4.0,"Having watched a recent documentary on the Tower on the TV my son was very keen to visit and experience this for himself.

Upon entering we were directed to the knight school which was set out very well on the lawn just outside the main entrance, it was very well organised and social distancing was not a problem as we all had our own little boxes to sit it. After about 10 mis my son became bored (nothing to do with the event it just want his sort of thing) so we decided to head straight to the Crown Jewels and I am so glad we did. There was no queue and we just walked straight in. My son was amazed at the displayed and certainly lived up to his expectations.

The Beefeaters were lovely and more than happy to engage in conversation about where we had come from and pose for a socially distanced photo.

A lovely day out to learn about the history of the Tower and its contribution to the London landscape

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"Firstly admission is by scanning of your ticket QR code, either on mobile device or printed sheets. There are ticket machines nearby, but don't join the queue without a ticket. You don't get to skip the line at the Tower of London, as everyone joins the same queue with pre-bought tickets. Once inside, if you have young children, you can currently take them to Knight School where they'll learn how to become a knight, albeit socially distanced. You'll then follow the route around and see all the different towers, and rooms, but if you want to see the crown jewels, I'd advise going straight to them if you arrive early, this will reduce your waiting time. There really is a lot to see and it will take a good 3-4 hours to see it all. There are at least three gift shops, an ice cream vendor and a resturant on site too, but prices aren't cheap. I'd at least bring a bottle of water and save yourself £3 for a tiny bottle of drink, Royal Palace members get it slightly cheaper. I had a very enjoyable visit and whilst I'll never need to do it again, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't been yet.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"We came here with our two children and had a great time. It was fascinating to see the Towers close up and to see the Crown Jewels. My daughter particularly enjoyed this bit! The place is steeped in History and you find out so much as you're walking around. It was a glorious day too and the =ir weren't massive amounts of people there. My only disappointment was that we did not have enough time to really look around! This is not the Tower of London's fault though. The tube trains on the central and district line were closed so we had to walk about 50 minutes from our hotel. We then had to be at another attraction at 2! I would definitely recommend checking TFL for any train disruptions as this place really does need a good couple of hours to absorb it all in.

UK,Tower of London,5.0,"I’m torn.

We visited at 9.30am in half term. Had a brilliant visit in spite of the rain.

We pretty much had the place to ourselves but that was the excellent and sad at the same time. The lack of tourists means that we could walk round the Crown Jewels and other exhibits over and over with no pushing or jostling but the place generally felt a bit sad.

Also, the Yeoman warders couldn’t give their usual tours and that was a big loss.

Hence, we went round pinching ourselves at how much space and time we had there but also with a tinge of sadness that it needs more people to visit.

We really loved looking at the Crown Jewels they were stunning and the atmosphere in there was very calming.
Everyone we encountered were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We spent around 4 hours here and got all the information we needed. I particularly loved spotting all the yeomans houses and the keys pub that they have onsite. Big fan since watching the Tower of London documentary.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Trying to find affordable child friendly things to do in London isn’t easy but Tower Bridge with it’s glass floored walkway was both fun and great value. However, once you’ve climbed the stairs (lift available for wheelchairs & buggy’s only) it’s a very short experience. The glass floor section is only a few meters long, so everyone up there is huddled around this one section and once you’ve managed to find a space to take a pic of the traffic below, you head back down again. We’re we’re only on the bridge for 15mins! You can then visit the engine room but my kids weren’t at all interested in that part of the experience. Overall I’d say it’s worth doing once, just to say you’ve done it as the unique view of the bridge below your feet is quite something.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,We enjoyed our visit to Tower bridge. The glass floor although it is small ( not as big as it looks in the pictures) it was a thrill. you have to walk up the stairs in the left tower to reach the top of the bridge though. We had no problem with that but someone else might have. the bad thing I have to notice is that wearing a mask is not mandatory. lots of people weren't wearing masks.,Oct 2021

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"We opted for a 0930 ticket and were first in line which was great as we go to the glass floor area swiftly and had unrestricted views from the top using the little sliding windows to enable us to get some lovely photos of those views and of course the glass floor area.
Anyway, there's a few steps to climb although they also have a lift.
All the staff were lovely and so welcoming, I would rate it as one of the best welcomes for a tourist attraction anywhere. They were happy to talk to you and ask how you were enjoying the visit. Everywhere was clean, the engineering inside awesome and the engine rooms was fascinating. I love Victorian engineering - the frills were added just because they could, now there is little pride in such things.
Two adults and a child ticket we felt was great value and we even got to use some spotless toilets in the bridge!
Highly recommend it - remember to take a photo of your feet on the glass floor and look up as there are mirrors...

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Tower Bridge offers a unique view - an elevated position above the River Thames. The operators should be praised for installing special windows which can be opened purely to take photos. Otherwise you would be left with the possibility of reflections, which can spoil your image. At the time of my visit only the west side was open to the public, so you are more likely to get a spectacular sunset than sun rise. Elsewhere, there are enough signs (in English) to guide you around the main features of the construction and operation of the bridge. They lost a point from me for having a 30 minute wait for pre-booked admission (it was a busy day, school holiday and I got the final pre-booked slot of the day). Go to the website to book, and to check out times for bridge lifts - it happened twice the morning I visited.a

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Booking is essential as queues do build up. Arrive early and book an early slot if you can. Print each ticket issued as a swop is done for entrance to the engine rooms at the end of the high tour.
There is a lift for those of less agile ability or laziness. The rise in the box does not detract from the view of those out of breath at the top. A short presentation is provided in a seating area for those athletes to warm down, and those from the lift to smile a lot, as the screen shows the story of construction. The talk was given by a non native speaker who was hard to decipher.
Walk out onto the upriver spar that has camera view ports built into the perspex coverings. Bring a stool if you are vertically challenged. Avoid the see through section in the centre of the bridge if you manage to get there beyond you fear of heights'. The is a mirrored ceiling that allows unusual poses at this point. Some will not be able to look up for looking down!!!!
At the South Tower, the roof has been opened out to reveal the intricate construction and has some statue figures depicting builders of the day and a foreman.
If Howard is on duty, he will ask you to spot the hammer.
Down again in the lift to join the public with a short walk to the Engine Room over plaques in memory of those involved in the history. Tickets checked and through the gift shop into the now defunct original machinery spaces. Fascinating to see how it all worked in the good old days of steam. No Eco here. It would have destroyed trade and affected the world we live in today.
Pictures and stories align the walls to the exit and the end of a brilliant tour.

My hubby took one look at the glass floor part and decided there was no way he could walk over it. I think because I could have the time to do it without anyone else around and the staff were great and even said to my hubby that he could take as long as he wanted as normally they move people along but being so quiet he could take his time.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Best advice is to take the stairs! Sounds illogical when there is a lift. Although there are some 200 steps, the journey didn't seem like it as you can pause to read the information along the way that is available as well as some audio/visual showings. You also see the structure. All this you would miss if you took the lift. Once you arrive at the top, you have the walkway experience with some unique views up and downstream. Also, there is a glass bottom part of the walkway. Its only for a short section but fascinating to watch different behaviours to it. It does not cover the full width, leaving enough non glass to walk on, but wide enough for an immersive experience if you can manage it. A great birds eye view of the traffic and pedestrians directly below your feet. You then descend the other tower.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"An often overlooked tourist attraction, we wanted to experience the bridge from the top! Tickets were easy to book and access was fine, from the bridge itself. If there is a Queue you just need to look around at London's skyline to be distracted.

You are left to explore the bridge yourself using a one way system. There is a lift for those who require it but you get a good sense of the scale of towers by using the steps. There is plenty information about the bridge and towers and its history. We spent around an hour exploring the bridge, the crossing and glass floor!! Then an unexpected bonus of seeing the engine rooms that you access via the gift shop - easy to miss this but worthwhile as they are still obviously operational. Great, unique experience :)

The views from up here are superb, and there are little slide open ones fso your images aren't through glass.
If you are not keen on heights, then you can walk next to the glass floor, rather than over it......not telling you which I did. You can spend as long as you like up here.
You walk down the south tower, then follow the track to the engine room, some superb pieces of machinery here, and shiney clean too......some super sized spanners. There are some really good films and information down here too.
I would recommend this as a must do to any visitor to London.

What was interesting at the end was we noted that it was a dog friendly museum which although we haven’t got our dogs with us it’s always good to know. At £10.60 per adult was excellent value for money.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"OK so i was wrong, what I thought was London bridge is Tower bridge, London bridge not for from Tower bridge was well boring. Tower bridge however was beautiful and I've pictures from so many angles it's right up there with the Golden Gate in character and charm.",Jun 2021
UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Almost everyone whose heard of London has heard of Tower Bridge. It's appeared in numerous movies, perhaps the most recent was ""Spiderman: Far from Home"". It's an iconic landmark. Most tourists who visit London plan to visit it, walk across it and take photos. What most people don't realise however, is that the upper structure is a walkway that was built to allow pedestrians to cross even when the bridge was raised. This walkway is still open today, albeit for a fee, which also includes access to the old engine room and guides on hand to talk about the history of the bridge. When visiting, there are 2 ways to reach the top, by walking up 206 steps or by using the lift/elevator. The lift wasn't working on the north side on the day of my visit, which meant I climbed the stairs and I'm so glad I did as I got to see the original colour of the bridge, some great views out of the windows and saw lots of history including how the bridge opens and how a man once jumped the bridge in a red London bus. Once up the top a guide greets you and tells you interesting facts about the making of the tower and points to a photo of a man who fell from the tower during construction, then swam to the shore and climbed back to the top and continued working. Then comes the main event, the upper walkway. This is where Spiderman fought Mysterio in the movie. Right in the centre is a glass floor where people either jump up and down on it to prove they wont fall through, or cower at the sides. Through the floor you can see traffic passing over the bridge. At the sides of the walkway are windows which offer great views of the Thames and includes small sliding windows which open to allow you to take photos without reflections from the windows. Once across you can either go down the steps or use another lift. Once back at ground level you can visit the old engine room, see the old boilers, use the restrooms and visit the gift shop. Whilst it's not necessarily an attraction you'd keep coming back to, it is definitely something worth visiting, it's different from the usual tourist attractions but isn't expensive either.

You can see the different sections of the engine room and lives of the people who operated the engine room in the history section. Towards the end you have the opportunity to create a penny press souvenir and there is a gift shop.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,Visited tower bridge today and done the experience for the first time it is worth noting that there is a lot of steps to get to the high walk ways but there is a lift available for the less able bodied visitors the guides are quite knowledgeable they where doing 2 different talks in both towers there is also 2 short films on the towers and another in the engine room where there is also guides on hand to answer any questions. On both high walk ways there is part glass floors what i didn't walk on as I had a slight case of vertigo the Guide who was by the glass floors pick up on this and asked if I needed any help unfortunately I didn't catch his name but thanks to him. Otherwise the views are amazing,Jun 2021
UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"I visited Tower bridge yesterday and really enjoyed the experience, the top walkways including the glass one are fab and offer some spectacular views of London. You also have the option to visit the engine room and gift shop afterwards which was great, well worth a visit in the future.",Jun 2021
UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Hard to add anything to the previous review by the Walsh family, which was spot on.

You get to walk across the top of one of the World's iconic bridges, as well as seeing behind the scenes and it's inner structure and engine room.

The views of the Thames are good and walking across the glass walkway 137 feet above the river is certainly bracing. Don't worry, you can avoid the glassed walk of doom, if you'd rather, but the sense of elation and achievement my wife felt from completing it, having been initially inclined to give it a body swerve, is almost impossible to quantify.

When we went at the beginning of June, we were the only ones up there as well, apart from staff. It really is a great time to visit London at the moment.

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"It’s hard to find a last minute thing to do in London at present due to COVID restrictions but thankfully there was ticket availability for Tower Bridge.

I’ve always wanted to explore inside the tower and found the family ticket offer reasonable. There’s not actually a great deal inside but the views look west across the Thames were amazing and the high bridge glass cross walk was certainly a highlight for both us and the children. All can be explored within an hour or less - wasn’t too busy/ over crowded and all the staff from security to guides were very welcoming and friendly.

Then you return to the bottom, walk round the corner and go to the engine rooms, this is also great to look around. There is a gift shop before you leave so you can get a gift before you leave. I would recommend this experience for adults and children, the staircases are wonderful.",Jun 2021

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"As the world starts to heal and people adjust to the evolving new normal, it’s great to see visitors returning to familiar London icons that make it such a special city.

If you are in London, take a walk along the south side of the river for fabulous views of Tower Bridge and Tower of London and then walk across Tower Bridge, with or without going to the top, and explore Tower of London and the surrounding area. It will transport you to another time in history and help escape from the pandemic paranoia for a while.

The views are especially stunning at sunrise and sunset.

UK,Tower Bridge,4.0,"Came here last week with my partner and our three youngest children (aged 17, 14 and 12). Tickets had to be purchased in advance on line and were for set times. Covid measures in place – social distancing, hand sanitiser, masks, one way system etc.
Got some great photos from the open windows and also loved the glass walkway. Lots of interesting information as well, regarding the history of the bridge and a short film to watch. The Engine Room is accessed after you come out of the tower – not much to see there, but added to the visit. I would definitely recommend a visit – even if it is just for the glass walkway and the views.",May 2021

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Finally after lockdown and having been past this bridge over many years, got tickets. £10 excellent price. Lots to see. Friendly staff and the glass walkway is fantastic. Shame there is a lot of the windows covered in blue fact film which blocks the view. The engine room and shop are a very short walk away. I wish, as I have a complete lack of engineering experience, that there was a guide who could talk about the fascinating Victorian engineering. This needs to be address as I also saw several other guest looking bewildering at the large engineering exhibits. Highly recommended.",Apr 2021
UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Having been to London many many times, this was the first trip where we realised you can actually go up inside Tower Bridge. And at £10.50 per adult it’s not a rip off price either.
Lots of stairs to climb initially but this is broken up with facts about the bridge to stop and read. Once at the top the view was great. There are photo windows rather than a mass open expanse which is great if you’re not good with heights. The walkway includes a glass section where you can see below to the bridge and river beneath you. The ticket price also includes entry to the engine rooms where you can see how the bridge was operated initially.
Allow about an hour-90 minutes in total for your trip. It’s well worth the money!

UK,Tower Bridge,5.0,"Firstly, I'd like to say that all of the staff were really friendly. The tour of the bridge is really informative about the history of the bridge itself, but also so many personal stories about the people that have worked on it and within it in the last 150 years. The old engine room is on display with brilliant interactive explanations of the workings. We paid about £10 per adult and spent a wonderful hour or so looking around, but we didn't dally or stop to rest. There are a number of stairs to climb but a lift is available. The glass floor looking down over the bridge was brilliant. Terrifying, but brilliant. Thanks to Mandy, I was finally able to cross it and look down! Highly recommended.",May 2021

During winter it is a treat if you visit with blue skies, but even the greyest of skies makes this bridge stand out. There's a viewing area in the middle where you can stand and look towards the city and HMS Belfast and London Bridge, which is less exciting in its architecture.",Jan 2021

A must do when visiting Edinburgh!",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"The most amazing views in Edinburgh. Beware - it is extremely windy at the top. I'd highly recommend (as I did) carefully getting your pictures and then promptly finding a spot in the rocks to sit. I've inserted a picture of me at the top of Arthur's Seat to accurately depict the wind. Safe to say, as soon as the picture was taken, I planted myself firmly back in a cubby hole in the rocks! Me and my partner love hiking, so we went equipped with a backpack (drinks, plasters, coats etc) and walking boots. However, many did not. I'd HIGHLY recommend walking boots at the very least as it is quite rocky and slippy towards the top. I found that had I not been wearing my walking boots, I wouldn't have been able to plant my feet quite so firmly and probably had a good chance of slipping. The uphill walk is so worth it when you reach the top and get the best view of such a beautiful city. I'd give yourself a good 2 hours to complete the walk. Enjoy!

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"As a group we decided to walk up to Arthur’s seat, I must say we were under prepared in the sense that we didn’t have appropriate footwear, too many bags and a very negative attitude at times! However once we actually made it to the top, it was so worth it, you can’t beat the view and honestly the accomplishment of doing it is so great. None of us are into our fitness and it was definitely hard going to get to the top. I would recommend sticking to the course coming down, do not take short cuts! I didn’t do this and I slid my way down… not a pretty sight, however not the only one!

Dress for a climb… it’s worth it!

It took us an hour and a half, including lots of breaks, photos and tantrums. Allow plenty of time to walk in the light and see the views in the daylight!

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,A surprising steady uphill walk but not tricky. The views are great even before you reach the top. Just be careful when you are at the top if you go to the summit as the stones are very smooth and slippery from the amount of feet that have polished the stones. Great view of all of Edinburgh.,Oct 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We loved this walk. It’s so special to find nature at the heart of a big city. We walked the circular route and then too a tricky climbing path up but this was really good fun.

- allow about 2 hours as a minimum
- there are no lights so make sure you return to the ground before sunset
- wear comfortable trainers that have good grip!
- take your time walking as some parts are slippy
- it's easy to get into the zone looking down when hiking upwards but make sure you stop every 15 mins or so to catch your breath and also look at the views
- it's very windy at the top so wear something warm....even though you may be sweating when you get there!

I would rate the trail as 2/10, no special equipment needed to climb but be sure to have jacket with you it would be breezy on top specially when you go in the morning which i do recommend to avoid crowds. You will be having a picturesque view on top and also during the trail itself. There are a lot of trail to choose from so its better to choose 2 so that you can experience two trails with different views.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Absolutely worth climbing for the view. Go early (7-8AM) to avoid the crowds! Or in the summer a late evening when it’s still light. You won’t regret that. I’m young but quite unfit (stamina wise) and this was hard work!! Really stunning views on the way up and once you get to the top. It is super windy up there! It also feels quite dangerous nearer the top to be honest. One minute you are following a path and then as you reach the summit you’re suddenly clambering about on the rocks. You do have to be careful, there are some sheer drops and hardly any safety features. You just need to use common sense. On our way back down we did recommend an elderly couple not to continue up as they were already struggling less than 1/4 of the way up. I also slipped and fell on the way back down as well as seeing other people do the same, so go steady!

However, to get a photo from the trig point at the top, its a quick rocky climb, which is where the decent boots come in.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"There was no way either my husband or I was going to attempt to climb Arthur's Seat, so we walked round the outer perimeter, a walk of at least 6 miles, most brilliant views, including the seaside, Leith/Portobello? enjoyed an Ice cream en-route, very hot day.",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"I read reviews and wasn’t sure about this. Didn’t have great shoes and I’m not that fit anymore. Read people saying they were on all 4s at the top.
It took us 34 minutes up from holyrood park and that included several breaks. I had ok trainers on but certainly not proper walking shoes. It was fine and no need to crawl at the end.
I could imagine the path being very muddy if wet.

Great views and burned off some excesses.",Sep 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Wonderful walk up to the top, with many different trail options. You can make this a strenuous, athletic hike or an easygoing meander up the hill depending on which trail you take and what you're looking to get out of it. Either way, you'll have fabulous views of Edinburgh all around you and plenty of spots to stop and have a picnic or just enjoy the scenery. Oh, and I recommend treating yourself to some ""from cow to cone"" ice cream at the bottom - very good!",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Great place to visit when in Edinburgh if the weather is good. Not a long walk up but quite steep, gravelly and hard in places. Well worth the effort. The countryside around Arthur’s Seat is great too.",Sep 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If you want a place to get a proper bird's eye view of the whole of Edinburgh, Arthur's Seat is the place to be. It's a couple of hours trek from the city. We started from old town, went to Hollyrood Palace and from there, walked up to this place.",Aug 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If you are reasonably fit, climbing to the summit of Arthur's Seat is easily achievable. The easier side is from Willowbrae rather than Hollyrood side which is far steeper, but easier to access from the centre of Edinburgh. Excellent views from the summit particularly on a sunny day at sunset.",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If you want a panoramic view of a stunning city head up to the top.

The Radical Road is currently off limits due to unsafe structure of rock yet there are other paths.

Wear hiking boots as where the terrain steepens it’s loose rock and a bit perilous.",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Fantastic views from the top and a lovely little walk up around the lock and past the ruins of an old chapel. Should be relatively easy to get up and down in an hour or so for anyone with any level of fitness.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"This is by no means a breezy jaunt up gentle slopes ! For those enjoying a Free Bus Pass wear strong trainers with good ankle support and take water as well as your time ! Nevertheless, it is a wonderful experience - you will have plenty of company and it is a rocky scrabble towards the end- you have been warned. I was not the only one clutching on to the chain rail and sometimes resorting to all fours ! Wonderful views at the top ! I would have appreciated a bit more information at the top on the surrounding panorama! But, so pleased I did it - despite seemingly being the oldest person around !",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We hiked up to the summit which took us 30 minutes. It is quite rocky so I would recommend wearing good shoes. We got to the top and before I could even take in the view my partner was on one knee! It was the perfect spot for a proposal with stunning views over the city. A lovely place to pop the question if anyone else is considering it! :),Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,This is quite a steep climb in places and it is narrow at the top and slippery. It is worth it to see the views - but it was misty on the day we went so couldn't see a thing! It was still really packed and busy so I would recommend going early/late to avoid the huge crowds.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Having planned a city break, my wife, daughter and I were astounded to find the beautiful area of mountainous countryside within a few minutes walking distance of our guest house.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Beautiful views of the city. Worth the climb. There are various routes up and I have never done the same one twice. Some are easier than others.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Came upon this by accident. At first both children protested about climbing all the way to the top. Now both of them feel it was one of the highlights of there holiday. Definitely on the to do list for next time we visit.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"This was an amazing walk and a great experience. 100% worth it. When you reach the top the views are absolutely incredible and surreal. You can see the whole city and it’s absolutely amazing. However, I believe you need more preparation than people are made to think. As an experienced climber who has have climbed Pen-y-Ghent and other mountains and completed various hikes I would advise for people looking to go all the way to the top ,as shown in my pictures attached, to wear appropriate clothing and hiking boots or gripped shoes as it’s very steep and rocky. When you get to the summit, you have to scramble and use your hands to climb so I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone is elderly or who will find this difficult and struggle. Overall it’s a really great experience and such a great experience for anyone and everyone who visits.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"My favourite thing about Arthur's Seat is reading the 1 star reviews on Tripadvisor about people who complain there was no seat and no view! :'-)
My second favourite thing was the view and lack of seats!

There are many hundreds of combinations of routes to get to the top and back down. Therefore there are many levels of difficulty. I went a short and direct route up from Ulster Crescent (see photo) after a walk from the beach. I parted ways with the less enthusiastic wife and daughter just past the lock (yellow circle on photo) allowing them to walk a flat bypass around the mountain where I met them on the other side. The way down I left to gravity and my feet.

The views on the top were amazing. I think our 1 star friends are people expect things that are far away to be close or simply don't appreciate that there isn't a city in the world with a unspoilt volcano in the middle of it that allows you to see 90% of it.

Find the right route for you and enjoy this breathtaking, natural, unspoilt, FREE experience.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,This is a great day out especially if the weather is good. We parked at the base of the seat (had to pay) and the took a gentle walk towards the top. At some point you have to go “more vertical” and exert a bit more energy but it’s genuinely no more than moderate exercise and trainers are fine versus walking boots. The conditions were excellent when we went. At the top there are the most spectacular views (and a lot of flies!),Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,Be prepared to wear good shoes. I wore conserve and this was a mistake. We went the day after it was raining and it was very slippery. I saw two people fall over. When we got to top unfortunately it was just clouds. It was a personal achievement to climb to the top and get to the bottom without breaking anything. If you want great views without the risk book Edinburgh castle tickets.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,This mountain walk is situated in Holyrood Park and takes approximately 45 mins to get up to the top and approximately 30 mins down. Wear appropriate footwear as well as ensure you carry a water bottle. We went on a sunny day and the views were stunning. It can get crowded on the top especially as there is no clear cut footpath the further up you go.,Jul 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Awesome view and well worth the climb. But you can cheat by driving up and parking near the Arthur's Seat if you want to miss out on the climb.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Can't say much about the views as it was pouing with rain - but we had a great time climbing up Arthur's Seat. It's a fairly easy climb - even in a torrential downpour - would highly recommend it.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"An absolute must for anyone visiting Edinburgh. We were so lucky that the weather was so good, which made the view at the top even more stunning.

The hill looks great from below, but after a medium difficulty 45 minutes climb, the views over the city and the Firth of Forth are spectacular. The most popular route very crowded the day we went, but there are plenty of other paths. Be aware that much of the climb is on rock, which can be slippery when wet. Suitable footwear is a must!",Aug 2021

This year however we decided it would be walked. as others have put it is a climb and the path maybe a little slippy especially at the top if wet but we were blessed by a good day. Took us 25 mins from bottom to top at a steady pace but is quite steep and scramble at the top.
The views agreat and well worth the climb.",Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"When visiting Edinburgh, we decided to go up Arthur's seat, it was a little bit exhausting to climb up but not too bad. Can also see the ruins of an old chapel and stunning views over Edinburgh and some lakes.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,This has been on my Edinburgh To Do list for several years but we have never managed to fit it into our itinerary. This time we had a window and the weather was perfect. Set off up the gentle path climbing up behind Dynamic Earth and things didn’t look too taxing. Then rounded the corner to see the full task ahead of us…much higher/steeper than anticipated however it wasn’t actually that bad with several stops en route to catch our breath. You just had to watch your step as the ground is rather uneven. The arrival at the top markers rewards you with the most stunning views of the city and surrounding water. Really beautiful and well worth the climb.,Aug 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,We took about 45mins to get up but I'm really unfit and we stopped briefly a few times. It's tough going in places and a bit of a scramble over rocks at the top but the views of Edinburgh are fantastic. Trainers should be fine for climbing but good walking boots make things easier. We picked a day with good weather and had lunch on the Royal Mile once we'd finished. The car park just round the corner from The Palace of Holyrood is £1/hour and had plenty of spaces when we arrived at 10am (Tuesday). It was however VERY busy when we got back down.,Aug 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,Took about 30 mins to get to the top and the fog had really closed in but we waited about 20 mins and could see EVERYTHING. We also met a local about 3/4 of the way up who gave us an insight into what we were seeing. Lesson here - don't be afraid to ask others about the views - it added a lot to our experience,Aug 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,A challenging walk to the top but well worth it. Several routes to choose from that some can be quite an effort.,Aug 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays you can only drive up halfway and park at the free carpark and do the easy route up Arthurs seat. A barrier is put in place to stop cars on the other days.
Mind you the other carpark close to Holyrood Palace is free too at weekends only. And the second easy route is from the lake through the trees.
Extremely slippery on a wet misty day. I lost my balance several time and slipped and fell once.
Believe me it is not as easy as some reviews state here when the ground is wet.
A que even on the most dismal day for a picture at the summit.
Thing with this walk is the weather changes so quickly, pack a waterproof and a woolley hat, you won't regret it. Oh and something to eat to give you energy halfway!

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Similarly to Calton Hill, we were told about this by a family member and suggested it would be a great chance to experience something outside and get in some more great views of the area.

I'm not afraid to say that I struggled a little on the way up with a lot of uneven terrain and crumbly steps but persevered because I really wanted to check out the views at the top. I'm not the fittest of people and when google described it was being "" slightly strenuous"" I was surprised that I found it as hard as I did but I'm proud of myself for doing it. I wasn't expecting to see so many little kids doing the walk up but I guess they are pretty fearless compared to me! At the very top there is a white pillar which had unfortunately had graffiti on it which is such a shame as the surrounding area is full of nature. I was surprised to see quite a lot of broken glass on the way too which is a harsh reminder of how horrible some humans can be.

Without a doubt the views were great at the top, and it was good to be able to say I'd done it but was definitely pleased when I was back on even ground again! The walk down was a bit easier than the way up but would definitely recommend trainers or good walking shoes as everything is quite uneven and saw a few people take a tumble at some points. On the way back down it had started to rain so was pleased that we went up when it was dry even though it was a bit more windy that I'd have liked but the rain didn't seem to put off many people and it was becoming fairly busy.

If you like walking, and you're okay with uneven terrain I would definitely recommend coming up to Arthur's Seat as it offers the best views of the city. I wouldn't have liked to have done this on my own, so i was very grateful to have my boyfriend there to help me up along the way!

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"A must do if you like walking.

We set off early, did struggle a little bit to find Scottish Parliament as a starting point but once we did we following the main path and following the sign for The Summit. It was quite a steep walk all the way, and rocky/dusty underfoot so wear appropriate footwear.

Climb to the summit using this route was approx 30-40mins and very worth it for the 360° views at the top. Amazing! Just beware there’s a lot of flies at the top to share either experience.

Descent back to the bottom was easy and calm. Depending on your fitness allow 60-120 minutes for the journey.

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,Great views at the top. I think this is a must do when in Edinburgh. The walk seems to be longer than it actually is. You can get to the top in 20mins. But the views are worth it. It doesn't cost anything.,Jun 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"I would recommend 2 to 2.5 hrs for this activity. The route starts just near the Scottish Parliament and continues upward from there. There are many pebbly areas so you will need shoes with a decent grip. I don't really hike but if I can do it, most people can. The route is not suitable for anyone with a mobility issue. It is windy at the top and the views are stunning. Definitely recommended.",Jun 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"I came to Edinburgh to do this hill and I wasn't disappointed
I didnt quite make it to the top but I did get a fairway up there. Better shoe would have helped but that was my own fault. The path is very step and its gravel underfoot. I did my self slip a couple of times on the way down but the view was worth it.",Jun 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"Absolutely loved climbing Arthur’s seat and watching the sun set on a clear summer’s eve. The colours were phenomenal as were the 360 views! Even if you don’t get all the way to the top, there are plenty of viewpoints that can be enjoyed along the way.

The hike itself is fairly easy - some basic fitness is required - but ultimately can be done at whatever pace you choose. For an average person it takes about 45 mins to an hour from Old Town, so fo factor that in if you are going for sunset.

There are various different paths you can take, some are gradual and slower, others faster and steeper. Signage could be better as to which path is which but you can more or less tell from the ground. The hike can be done in trainers/flat shoes but hiking boots would be more sturdy. The ground is quite loose, at least in summer.

I hiked alone as a woman and felt totally safe the entire time, there were people on the trail and at the top. Whilst I wouldn’t say it was busy, it was by no means secluded.

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,"If you're relatively fit, the walk up isn't bad (wear sturdy shoes), and you're rewarded with seriously beautiful views of the city and surrounding areas! Go when the gorse is in full bloom, and you'll see a carpet of yellow covering half of the mountain. The southern route (main path - the radical road is currently closed) up the mountain seems a bit steeper and more slippery, so if want to walk as a circuit, I'd recommend walking up the southern trail and down the northern trail.",Jun 2021

UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,I was totally unprepared for a little hike! But couldn't resist having a go having had Arthur's Seat pointed out by our tour guide on one of the bus tours. It wasn't ideal in flip flops! And some parts were a little steep and you do have to watch your step (especially in unsuitable footwear!!) but it was definitely worth it for the fantastic views and fresh air at the top! It is amazing to come to such a busy city and literally turn a corner and have such a beautiful place to walk with such a natural view of the city. Just amazing.,May 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,3.0,Lovely views from the top but quite a hard hike for me with some narrow and slightly treacherous sections. Need good footwear and to go in good weather. The path was gravelly with boulders as steps to climb up to the next section and required a reasonable level of fitness as some of the steps were quite high. On the way down we walked down the grassy bank at the back down to the paved pathway which were easier to manage. The park is really lovely to walk in with lovely views over the city and out to the coastline.,May 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,2nd time scaling the hill. There always is plenty of persons here which is good. Some areas are more rocky than most so I wouldn't recommend anything that hasn't got a good grip (especially not white designer shoes 😉),May 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,4.0,"Would be great for a sunny day but I don’t believe it is necessary in wet conditions. The rocks are pretty slippery and you won’t be missing out if you choose not to go. That being said, it’s good for an early morning start and some quick exercise before you punish yourself with whiskey and haggis for the rest of the day.",May 2021
UK,Arthur's Seat,5.0,I came to Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago from Glasgow on a wee day trip now we're allowed out!

They repeatedly went the extra mile and delivered a really memorable experience, it pains me to say this but far better than the impatient and impersonal guide we had of told Trafford earlier in the day. We will always be reds but I will certainly now view our rivals from a very different perspective. Many thanks again.",Oct 2021

Honestly the service provided by all members staff was top notch. Our tour guide was Jim and he was great, the way he kept us interested whilst sharing his knowledge of the club and adding a bit of humour along the way showed how much he must love his job. He also let my 2 sons sit at the desk in the conference room whilst the video of Pep was played to make it look like they were sitting there with him live, which was class! We've had a great day and everyone up here just seems more happy and friendly than people back home. We'd definitely come back.

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"Went for a stadium tour on Saturday and it was absolutely amazing. Roger and Keith were fantastic as tour guides and I could really feel that they were really passionate and loved the club deeply. They went out their way to make sure everyone was enjoying the tour and had their chance to take nice pictures. I missed the beginning of the tour because I wasn't familiar with the tram system in Manchester but Roger offered to take me through the beginning part for the exhibition again even though my tour ended! It's my first time on a tour and they've set the bar so high! Overall, I would say that the stadium tour was well worth the money and I would definitely recommend it to fellow City fans, as well as non-fans!

UK,Etihad Stadium,5.0,"Very lucky to be invited to hospitality in the Tunnel Club. What an experience. First class food and a great choice of beers and wines. Its a bit tight that Spirits are extra, especially when you look at what people are paying.

Food was excellent and service great too. The players heading in through the tunnel seemed a bit underwhelming as only one seemed to acknowledge the customers!!

As for the football genuinely no atmosphere at all!! Biggest cheer was Man U going down to Leicester.

But its a 5 for brilliant hospitality (though come on including Spirits won't bankrupt you).

At the front and got them all excited to see the stadium, she asked what they wanted to see and our son was just overwhelmed with excitement! We was so impressed with the tour and honestly cannot praise Linda enough, she even got the birthday children a little treat at the end of the tour (a big bar of chocolate!)

Just hope FFP is never based on genuine revenue. Not sure why Pep seemingly doesn’t like the place. It’s almost like he’d rather have some genuine passionate fans than buy the league each year.

You lean the history of Man City, learn what goes on during match day and what the future plans are for the club. You have access to where the players arrive, walk down the same steps the players walk down to the dressing room, access both away and home dressing rooms and walk through the tunnel to pitch side. You get to sit in Peps seat and learn the history of the stadium. You also visit the Tunnel Club and learn what happens there and visit the press room. Would highly recommend this tour.

Great knowledge, passion and genuine love for Man City coupled with a real sense of fun. Seeing Ray run out of the tunnel and wave at the crowd like a player made me giggle.
The reason for the visit was for my son’s 11th birthday, which I mentioned simply in passing to Ray as we chatted, so to receive a scarf and bar of chocolate from the tour team at the end was an amazing gesture.

Brilliant experience irrespective of who you may support and for adults and kids alike.

I had to go over a second time before someone came. Three of us asked for soup. One soup came with no cutlery and we had to wait a full five minutes for the other two. Then we had to ask for cutlery. It didn’t arrive so we had to go and ask someone else. When we wanted to leave we had to go find someone to get the bill. Eventually someone came to the table to tel is that all the tills had crashed. We had to wait 10 minutes after that before we could pay. Never using that café again.

The Egyptian room is really interesting. I gather they have 84 pieces on long term loan from the British museum which really adds to the interest here. There is a lot to see. We spent 2 hours and would have spent longer if we could have had a rest at the cafe. Unfortunately the cafe and the bookshop were still closed during our visit.

We enjoyed the art exhibits, particularly the section on the ""Glasgow Boys"" and learned a lot about art in this period (1880 to 1920-40s), in UK and around the world.

We loved the Salvador Dali room displaying the painting of Christ. It now has a room of its own and the positioning is stunning. The natural world and prehistoric sections are really interesting too, as is the section covering weapons and conflict was well done. For a medium sized museum there is a lot here for every one, adults and children alike and provides a good foundation for further study of a wide range of topics.

Good information boards around the place.

Will be better once the cafe and bookshop are open. Will inspire people to spend longer there.

However free entry ( donations welcome), and effective anti covid processes in place.

Davis Cup glory. Just over 10 mins from the city centre, this masterpiece of architecture is definitely worth a visit. Its chandelier-decked entrance hall housing a beautiful organ is worth the entrance fee alone which with astonishment is FREE.
As for the exhibits, they range from world -renown artists like Dali, the Dutch, Italian and French masters, Lowry and the Impressionists to Ancient Egyptian artefacts to furniture through the Ages, stuffed animals ( Roger the Elephant is magnificent) and even a Spitfire !!!! Look out for Elvis as he is the building as well !!! An excellent place to visit for quick looksee or a day's in depth culture. In Covid times, pre booking is essential. Thoroughly recommended.

As a returning member I thoroughly enjoyed my visit just as much (if not more) than my previous experience thanks to our fab tour guide John. Both tours (one pre covid) were absolutely brill, with so much to see and learn about, it's a real eye opener to see how people lived..the tour guides are extremely knowledgeable and charismatic and bring the Back to Backs experience to life, they are very good at what they do..a credit to the NT. The only thing I should mention is that there are a couple of steep staircases which could potentially be a problem for some..but Its definitely worth a visit folks!!",Oct 2021

So many people, huge queues, standing about, not to mention the actors grabbing you and putting their forehead against yours or whispering in your ear. Also don’t see what’s ‘scary’ or funny about a Middle Aged man dressed as a clown saying ‘I’m a lesbian I’m a lesbian’ bit inappropriate and I didn’t appreciate being grabbed by him either.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,1.0,Literally had the worst experience. £13 a head and there was approx 10 staff on.

Would not recommend - save your money,Oct 2021
UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,1.0,"I was so excited to go to the jail of horror this year after having a great time around 3 years ago. Was glad it was back after lockdown.
I have never been so disappointed in my life. We queued to get into the tunnel where a FRIENDLY witch told me not to be scared and commented on the clothes I was wearing. We then went up to the jail where we queued for 15 minutes. There was a nun who walked up and down and two other masked figures. Then we went through the hanging cell where they have a CD playing a girl screaming and someone standing there. We then went outside where there were 4 guys with chainsaws, again this wasn’t scary as we were behind about 30 people so we were well aware of what was coming. This then lead to the “circus” which was a tent.. I thought to myself “yes finally something scary”… it was a fully lit conference tent with one clown standing there. Honestly, I’m not even joking you.
Then it was over.
Like £13 and I came across maybe 10 different characters in total.
Will never be back and will make sure others don’t go. Complete waste of money.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,1.0,"Halloween jail of terror??

I got more scares on Barry's ghost train!!

I have been to several of these over the years including florida, Blackpool and Derry/ London Derry but this was just pathetic!
Characters standing around with Halloween masks, very little in the way of scares!

No atmosphere not even that dark.

This is advertised as an 1 hour experience took us 10 mins to go through, there's was 4 of us so this cost £51.

Tickets are not checked as you go in as we just walk in with no one stopping us to ask! This is not a good thing during covid!

I have email them regarding this as well as contacting via social media with no response from them so I will now be forwarded my complaint onto the ASA and trading standards as we as a group feel this was miss sold to us.

Worth a visit but certainly not worth the entry price! I love Belfast but beware,it.s expensive!!!!",Oct 2021
UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,3.0,"Firstly, the website is misleading as it says it is cheaper to book online at £10.80 per person and £12 on the door - this is NOT the case and they charge a booking fee per person when booking online!
Overall, the buildings themselves were fascinating to look at - hence the 3 star review. Due to Covid restrictions there are only self-guided tours available. The problem is that there are interactive audiovisual displays in various cells where the beginning of sentences cut out frequently. Having looked at other recent reviews this has been commented on before but nobody has bothered to fix it. The Block C experience culminates in a ‘SHOW’ which I imagine leads to the description and video projection of ‘the drop’ on the execution room. The sign outside says to wait until the show finishes. We waited… and waited.. and waited. The people who arrived there before us had already been waiting for 15 minutes in excess of our long wait. I called reception from my mobile to alert them that people were waiting (as there aren’t any staff to be seen inside) to be told ‘Oh it mustn’t be working - don’t bother waiting as nobody will be coming down to you!’ We all left in disgust planning to ask for at least a partial refund. The staff, having obviously got wind of disgruntled visitors were nowhere to be seen! Shocking customer service - they clearly know that the audio visual displays aren’t working correctly if at all and can’t be arsed to fix them or warn people when they arrive that they won’t get the experience they are about to fork out for.

The tour is self guided but there are information points at all points and interest including a couple of excellent holograms.
The only section which didn't have this information was the execution room, I think one was automatically suppose to come on but perhaps the sensors were faulty.
All in all though it was a really informative and enjoyable tour. We took about 80 minutes to get around but they could be longer/shorter depending on how many of the information points you access and spend time on.
Kilmainham Gaol though is still the best gaol tour in Ireland.

Self-guided tour of the prison, very well presented with interactive ‘guides’ as you progress through the cell block. I went mid-afternoon and was lucky to hit a quiet time, made it all the more eerie being in the cell block alone. Quite an extraordinary place to visit, the walk through the Condemned Cell and Execution Cell has remained with me still (you can avoid this part if needed).

Had lunch in Cuffs Bar in the old kitchen, great staff, excellent food and a fantastic location.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"I’ve been to the gaol in the past and thoroughly enjoyed the guided tours and varying perspectives along the way. I was unsure of the new “self guided” tours but I couldn’t have been more wrong. From start to finish the visit was amazing. The videos in many of the areas were short, fun and factual, some a little ghostly but all of them were top quality in delivery. The staff were really friendly, starting with Matthew, who give us a warm welcome and guided us to opening video. The changes are phenomenal and well worth the return visit. I wish I’d left the car behind and enjoyed a pint in the new bar. We enjoyed a sumptuous roast dinner and the staff were attentive and friendly, thank you Wayne and Aoife for great service.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,3.0,"The actual experience of the gaol was good to do, although it did lack in many areas. The gaol is made up of 4 wings and you only had access to one which had been massively modernised (it felt - fresh paint and well kept). It may have been a good idea to allow individuals to peer into one of the other wings without having to enter (lots of other experiences do this) to see how it has naturally declined over time.

I personally was not a fan of the mannequins they had in many of the cells - it felt really false and detracted away from the experience. Felt a bit Madame Tussaudy.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,4.0,"Crumlin Road gaol is around a mile and a half north west of the city centre on foot.

On my journey there, I walked through the Lower Shankill area which was an eye opening experience in itself.

The prison opened in 1846 and closed in 1996. It is apparently modelled on HMP Pentonville and one can only assume it to have been a grim experience as an inmate.

Seventeen prisoners were executed at the gaol over the years and the former grave of one of them can be viewed.

From the early Seventies, the prison population expanded greatly due to the ‘Troubles’,

Famous prisoners included Eamon De Valera, Rev Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness.

I paid the concessional rate of £10 including £1 booking fee online in advance of my visit.

The logistics of this don’t work as we ended up queuing for ages waiting for other people to finish watching videos - I also don’t go out to visitor attractions to watch videos, I can do that at home.

We really missed having a guide as it made for a far more interactive and informative experience.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,4.0,"This was a very thought-provoking, interesting tour. It really provided you with a feel for how things were when it was a functioning gaol. The tour was self-guided with videos instead of live guides due to COVID. You had to pre-book a time slot but we arrived 45 minutes early and were surprised that we were allowed to go straight in. Crowding in some of the smaller rooms and cells was an issue, as people are not prepared to pay any attention to social distancing rules. We really enjoyed it, but at times had to skip on past some rooms due to the large number of people inside, with more people packing in, paying no attention to the number already inside. Perhaps they could consider limiting the number of people and staggering entry times further. We visited on a Tuesday and would have loved to try Cuffs Bar but unfortunately it was closed.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,2.0,"Visited with a friend, Got off the Hop on Hop off bus, the jail has huge potential for tourists but needs to be better laid out to improve experience as the videos are brilliant and very informative and interesting. A group of about 10 of us were told go in to watch an introduction video first before the self guided tour, and didn’t know if we were to stay in there or come out when it finished. As a result of being put in a group, we all then started the tour together which was a disaster because there is 2 tiny rooms (holding cells) with TVs showing 4 different videos about the history of the jail in each room. And then before myself and my friend had finished watching these videos, the next group were out from watching the introduction video coming into the tiny room. The most informative part of the jail was a carton like video about the history of the troubles in the north, but this again was shown in a small cell that was full. There is no warning sign on a moving bookcase that closed on top of me while I was watching a video in the last part of the jail.
There is no member of staff throughout the jail, or outside the jail in the yard. The map is vital, as signage is limited outside. We were at the jail about 3 o clock and The toilets were not cleaned that day, maybe longer, and the sanitary bins were overflowing. The lack of cleaning is not acceptable at any time but definitely not during Covid and when it is 28’C.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,5.0,"This was a fantastic addition to the must see places to go in Belfast. Although this attraction has been there for a while they sensibly used their time in lockdown to revamp it and make it even better. Each room you visit now has sensors instead of having to use annoying headphones. There are also lots of well written information boards to read. These are very interesting and not stuffy at all. Lots to read and see so you need at least two hours to do it all justice. The jailer hologram is fantastic. The only thing I did not like was the video about the Troubles. This is in the main gaol part of the visit and is done in cartoon format which I don't think is appropriate at all, especially some of the rather flippant comments. I found that rather shocking. Everything else was superbly done and well thought out. Many thanks for a very interesting and informative visit. Will recommend!

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,2.0,"Given that this is one of the top rated activities in Belfast, I made sure to visit Crumlin Road Gaol whilst I spent a weekend in Belfast.

I visited in June 2021 so as COVID restrictions were lifting. I booked my ticket in advance online easily enough the day before. Post-lockdown the tour is now self-directed with a ton of videos to watch instead of a tour guide. For me, it just wasn’t that interesting as I had thought it might be.

The information wasn’t delivered in a particularly interactive way and it was hard to imagine what the prison might’ve been like when it was in action. Hopefully they can bring back the guided tours in the future.

If you would still like to visit, do set aside 60-90 minutes. Though personally I would skip it if you haven’t yet fine Belfast’s other main sites first. There are toilets and a small café inside.

UK,Crumlin Road Gaol,3.0,"Average visit. No tour guide, as all done with videos to watch, which where quite informative.
Only a very small section of the building open to see, just the ""circle"" and the lowest floor on one of the smaller C wing.
Most interesting section was the condemned prisonier cell, with a surprise twist.
No access to upper floors to appreciate the scale, nor the the special areas of D wing.
Also very little reference to modern day regime, such as education, employment, etc.
Having visited Shepton Mallet prison experience, this wasn't nearly as good.

From the video introduction right the way through the gaol to the courtyards of each ""wing"". Some interesting artefacts on show and you do get to enter some cells and experience what it would be like to be an inmate.

UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"A fascinating and important range of exhibits, let down by very poor dim lighting. Given that many visitors take photos, enough light to run at iso 400 and say an exposure of 1/60th at f4 would be helpful.

Too many cabs and carriage interiors under lit. The worst was the original Rocket explantion boards which were unreadable in the gloom.

I was with someone who was slightly visually impaired and had to give up at 15:30 in the fading autumn light.

LEDs are cheap to run, cool and can be purchased with colour safe non-UV output.

Given it is science museum, one could pass through the whole exhibition and learn very little about the develpment, history and importance of railways. Good technology museums are more than just places full of old stuff.

Such a shame....but thats the approach of the Science Museum these days.

One thing that has changed is the cafe areas in the halls. Both offer spacious seating areas and the food and drink selection is varied and reasonably priced. Photography is a little difficult in some areas due to the positioning of spot-lights etc. But on the whole you can get some pretty good snaps of the exhibits.

UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"We’ve visited the NRM many, many times over the years and today was the first post-covid. What a shame!

Governed by the Science Museum, this place needs some serious investment. Very helpful guys on the information desk in the Great Hall, who agreed with me on the following points:

1. Lots closed. No turntable moving, model railway not running, lots of the engines you used to be able to step into, you now can’t. Assume it’s to prevent gatherings of people. However, we went to Beamish earlier in the week and most was open, including the small houses, so it seems a bit odd…..

2. Saying ‘check the website for what’s on’ is pretty poor. Get some signage up explaining why stuff is closed, so it properly informs.

3. Both cafes are awful. Has the catering been contracted out? Staffed by incredibly young people who aren’t fully trained. Pretentious offerings and massively over priced. Really disappointing to wait 15 mins for a sandwich and another 10 for a coffee to be made.

Just felt a bit ‘meh’ this time when it’s been so brilliant before. Suggest the Science Museum turns it’s gaze north.

If you’re able, go a bit further up the A1 and try the Locomotion museum at Shildon. Brilliant museum.

Anyone who runs anything to do with the public knows that if you feed and water them properly for a decent price they’ll forgive the other, slightly disappointing elements of the trip.

UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"It is a little over thirty years since I last visited the National Railway Museum in York.

Needless to say there had been many changes to the exhibits in that time, for me one of the most interesting was the addition of one of the driving units from a Japanese Shikansen train.
Seeing a Battle of Britain class steam loco in cutaway along the right hand side of the engine was a unique way of looking at a steam loco, very very interesting.

Unfortunately part of the museum was closed off at the time I visited the notice saying that the hall was being used for storage. Hey ho hopefully on my next visit this part of the museum will be open.
It was a fairly quiet visit save for one school party split into various groups, it seemed that every time I went to take a picture of a particular loco or item then was a yellow baseball cap being worn by the children right in the centre of my picture, thus I didn't take that many pictures of the exhibits as perhaps I could have done. Talking of photography, I do wish also that once people have taken 'their' photo they move out of the way so that others like me can get 'our' photos.

I think I'll go back in mid-winter for my next visit (haa haa)

It is well worth the visit, I spent only two hours there but would have spent longer had it not been for catching my return train south. This guarantees that I will have to make a return visit to York.

My thanks to all the very knowedgeable volunteers and salaried staff at the museum

UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"This was an incredibly good museum to visit and a hidden gem in York. It's situated next to the main train station in the centre of York. There's an expensive museum car park, or a much cheaper one a few minutes walk away. The museum itself has several massive display areas that are crammed full of well kept exhibits. It's not possible to go on board most of the trains but there are good viewing areas and lots of information available to read etc. There's also a small model railway exhibit with running trains etc. There's a small (but very good) play area for children albeit most of what's in the museum will also appeal to them! There are some cafe areas and a shop which we didn't have time to use, and toilets which are fine. I hadn't realised how extensive and good this would be so didn't allocate enough time to visiting, but would highly recommend a visit if you are in the area. It's free to get in so repeat visits are straightforward, but I'd recommend at least a few hours!

There are so many things to see and everything is carefully laid out and easy to access. There are things for all ages and interests. Some of the engines have cutaways and you can walk through/under others to see how they work. If I had one minor complaint, it would be the need for an app or something you could use to find exhibits as there is so much to see. When walking from the car park, the very last turn before the entrance could do with an extra sign. There were several others and ourselves trying to find where the entrance was. This is not a problem if you approach from the city, just from the carpark. Also very close to the city centre, so it is a short walk, or ride on the noddy train, to get into the shops and other sights.

There is a section on the more modern trains, including changes in British Rail's service from London to Edinburgh, comparing journey speed, uniforms, wages etc from the 1950s to the 1980s.

It just seemed like some locomotives and rolling stock chucked in random places around the site, Due to Covid the majority of trains you could previously go in were blocked off, no mention of this on the website though. So you are essentially looking at a number of random trains with some vague, brief information boards accompanying them.

There is so much to see, it was great to see & have photos with favourite engines such as Mallard, Duchess Of Hamilton & Evening Star once again, but this time I saw other engines I don't think I saw last time, namely Lode Star (a GWR engine) the LMS 2-6-4t tank engine & the GWR diesel rail car which was great too.

Another favourite engine of mine was the SECR (South Eastern & Chatham Railway) D Class No 737 built at Ashford Works, Kent in 1901.

This is a magnificent engine, I liked it so much, I decided to buy the exclusive Dapol OO gauge model in the main shop later on.

I enjoyed my ride on the Mallard simulator again too & the lady on duty that day, was very helpful & friendly, as were all the staff/volunteers we met during our visit.

I enjoyed seeing the Flying Scotsman exhibition too & the Station Hall was very impressive, we had a very nice lunch there, then had a good look around there, again so much to see, you have to spend a whole day at the museum, 1 or 2 hours just wo'nt do.

The small shop in the Great Hall was unfortunately closed, volunteer/staff shortage probably, shame, but I was able to buy plenty of souvenirs in the main shop near the exit, again very helpful & friendly staff in there too.

UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"Very enjoyable, educational, and fascinating. Spent around 3.5 hours there. The ex L & Y and LMS engines from my neck of the woods are always interesting. I even, from my extreme youth, remember some.

The only disappointing thing in my personal opinion, was the awful 'streamlined' casing currently defacing 'Duchess of Hamilton.' I know it is prototypical, but both Stanier & Ivatt disapproved, and the casing was removed from the Duchess in 1947.

The Coronations were wonderful looking engines after the casing was removed, and to see the old lady so deformed was rather sad. Please, PLEASE, remove it!

Staff excellent, all volunteers, free entry but please donate to keep this asset going.

Cafe good value, scones and clotted cream very good. All food we saw looked good value, better to give money to the cafe inside than a chain cafe on high street.

Engines and railway carriages worth looking, royal coaches a time warp in history, Victoria coaches show the feminine touch. Japanese train makes you realise how big they were. 1930’s engines show how dominant Britain were in engineering in the 20’s and 30’s

UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"We had a good time overall today at the NRM. Our first visit for a few years. Grateful to be able to borrow a wheelchair for our daughter who is currently on crutches, but frustrated to find that several of the ramps were closed which meant that we had to go back against the flow a few times.

We enjoyed the trip on the miniature railway but it was sad to see the area outside looked quite unloved and scruffy today. It's also a shame that the bigger train ride wasn't running.

The biggest disappointment was the children's play area which used to be a must for our children. The 'improvements' to this area mean that it is entirely unsuitable for younger children. The two spider web climbing frames are clearly aimed towards school age children leaving nothing for preschool or toddlers to play on. There was also nothing that would be accessible for children with additional needs. This seems like a missed opportunity to install a play area that is more inclusive and imaginative for a wider range of children to enjoy.

We were sad to see the state of the Station Hall roof which is evidently leaking in many places. It seems like this should be a priority for investment in terms of safeguarding the Collection rather than investment in yet another 'Wonderlab' experience.

It is also a shame that the workshop area is now closed to the public as this was a great way to observe railway preservation in progress. We will be back as the NRM is a great place to visit for all things train related but please don't lose the 'living' aspects of this great attraction.

Great access direct from the train station. Nice seating and rest areas for us grand parents were we could keep an eye on the boys.,Aug 2021
UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"Big spacious areas with fantastic trains. Highlight was seeing the bullet train and the Mallard (fastest steam engine).

I enjoyed the history of railway nationalisation and privatisation, but sad that the section wasn’t that large.

Nice section showing the different trains and royal train carriages. I preferred seeing the section next to it, showing the evolution of passenger train services.

The restaurant in this section was a nice experience. Further down the platform are large tables and saw families who had brought down their own packed lunches.

There was a train cut in half showing how the steam engine worked, but felt without a tour guide, you didn’t get a lot of the understanding of how exactly it worked.

There was a paid virtual experience for the Mallard. It’s worth £3 a ticket, but I wouldn’t say it was as thrilling as I expected. A short 5 minute video with the virtual machine shaking and jolting.

The shop wasn’t exciting as I hoped for. And I didn’t buy anything in the end.

It was a solid experience. 2-3 hours would be enough for most people.

UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"I have visited this museum a few times over the years.

I am always impressed by the condition of the locos, rolling stock and items on display.

However, I do feel the museum could be a lot more interactive and hands on with exhibits.

It could also do with reintroducing certain things, such as the train rides out in the south yard, this area appears to have become a bit abandoned.

It was disappointing that the workshops and viewing platform were closed, as this a significant part of the museum! The shop in the great hall, which offers different products than the main shop, was closed for a good few hours in the afternoon.

The arrangement of the exhibits was also nonsensical and random. Grouping trains in some sort of order to show how trains and the railways have evolved would make more sense.

As a railway employee, I did find the new railway heroes exhibition a nice touch.

Overall an okay visit and good for a couple of hours, but is missing the wow factor to be “THE” official railway museum

We saw all the logos on the trains and how varied each one was and the trains from other countries like Japan. It also gave us an insight into how the railways helped in World War 2 with ambulance trains etc . Our boys in particular came away with a better understanding and enjoyed themselves, our 19 year old daughter joined in but wasnt as enthusiastic about it , our only regret is that the interactive things werent operating unless we paid extra for them, but we will do it again on our next visit if we are lucky enough to come again.

The exhibits showed the progress of the railways through time and were in excellent condition and easily viewed.
We cannot praise the staff enough; they were so friendly and helpful especially with accessibility.

I know nothing about trains, but really enjoyed wandering around some impressive specimens from Stephenson's Rocket, Queen Victoria's carriage and the Mallard to the BR Intercity 125 of my childhood and the more modern Japanese bullet train and the Eurostar.

On previous visits we were allowed to climb aboard some of the carriages, but this is obviously not currently allowed due to Covid.

There is parking nearby. We'd arrived using the Park and Ride and it was a 10-15 walk from the historic centre of York. We also noticed a little road train from near the minster to take people here.

This is nothing less than a history of resins from two replicas of Stephenson’s. Rocket to Mallard, Eurostar and even a Japanese bullet train. Many engines are situated around a giant turntable. Exhibitions such as a history of British rail, a first floor art gallery, maps and posters, cafes, some recreating those on station platforms and a bookshop too.

Well layed out, my only gripe is the fact that some exhibits are closed due to social distancing, which I believe in my view is now unnecessary. When will it be fully open?, if ever. Hence 4 instead of 5 stars.",Aug 2021

UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,Visited while on Holiday. My 2.5 year old loves trains and he was in his element. Even my 7 year old daughter loved it. Great history through the years and how trains have changed through the ages. Great place for the whole family.,Aug 2021
UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"We have visited this museum several times over the years and never a disappointment. There are numerous interactive exhibits temporarily closed due to covid. It is a large and engaging museum and I had a delicious cream tea on the ‘Brief Encounter’ platform. The royal trains, the Bullet train and the Mallard are but a few of the sights. There is a flat rate of £10 to park your car and a car park token to be purchased inside. Free tickets to book online. This is the cheapest car park in York and closes around 6pm. So we benefit and so does the museum. If you finish early at the museum, you can leave your car and pop into the centre. There are plenty of hand sanitisers as you walk around the museum. I also noticed several staff members cleaning the handrails through out our visit. Parts of site were closed and interact parts too, however this is due to covid and did not detract from our visit. I hope to return to see their new exhibition opening shortly, the Trans-Siberia railway. It is a lovely day out for those that have an interest in trains and even those that do not!

UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"National railway museum is free to visit, however when booking online,a minimum donation amount £5 is suggested, extremely worth every penny. Currently there are some areas not open but still lots of interesting engines and historical carriages to look at. There are even engines which you can walk through and around. Allow a couple of hours for a good look round. Very accessible to all apart from the internal engine sections.",Jul 2021
UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"Described by the crew of the boat trip we took as ""Yorkshire biggest umbrella"" we thought it a great option to fill a few hours before our train home. Didn't realise that it's FREE to visit & despite not having booked when we should have, the staff were friendly and accommodating in letting us in & I have to say WOW what a fascinating place, even if you're not a train buff. My sister and I absolutely loved looking at the Royal carriages and how train travel has changed over the years, an absolute must if you're visiting York with friends, family or alone, shame we had a limited amount of time as I'm sure we voile happily stayed longer and even had lunch in the cafe, still, it gives us a reason to go back",Aug 2021

Would recommend not trying to visit for last two hours need at least double, returning and making special visit again to visit the rest, have lovely land train to York minster as well parking nearby and reasonable on price for both and short walk from train station said online blue badge holders can park outside the attraction but could not verify this something blue badge holders could find out if needed.",Aug 2021

Waited 15 minutes for a stone cold fish finger sandwich for my kids. The bread was cold, no butter, no sauce, no salad, no chips. Just two bits of frozen white bread and 4 fish fingers, nearly £6! It’s a disgrace",Jul 2021
UK,National Railway Museum,1.0,"Really disappointed with our visit here. Took our 4 and 7 year olds who were really excited to go on some trains, but literally none of the trains were accessible. All you could do was look at them, which for young children isn't very exciting. Mine were bored after we'd looked at the first few as there was nothing to interact with. There is the miniature train outside but that was already fully booked and the Mallard experience, also fully booked. The Learning Zone plus the viewing gallery to see the trains outside was also closed. We lasted about an hour before we gave up. Would not recommend going here until all the restrictions have been lifted.",Aug 2021
UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"The current pre-booking of entry times is understandable but if visitors are allowed to enter up to 4pm they should be allowed at least 2 hours to enjoy the exhibits etc, ideally longer. So they could either stay open until 6pm or stop 'selling' tickets earlier in the day. The car park is convenient but £10 for a few hours is a lot, but at least it funds the museum. Visitors are now encouraged to donate when booking online although there are plenty of other ways to donate when you get there. If buying the kids guide there are 10% off vouchers to use in the cafe and shop so worth buying this before you visit these other outlets. Some exhibits had covid restrictions still so could not enter them, even with a mask on. Seems strange when we can enter actual trains with masks on at this time. Best tips are to allow at least 3 hours to visit fully and if you get a morning slot, leave your car in the car park and get the land train into the city centre to explore other places in York. At weekends special afternoon teas etc are available in one of the exhibits.

UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"This museum is wonderful for families, and a Mecca for train lovers. There are LOTS of trains to see, spread across two massive halls, plus another large room with smaller exhibits. I thought my 4 and 6 year old might have been a little bored, but there was plenty for them to see and do. They especially liked seeing the underside of a train, and the miniature railway, as well as being able to look into lots of different carriages. It was a shame that some exhibits were closed, but I totally understand that they have to abide by covid restrictions.
The guidebooks were well worth getting. The one for older kids was brill for my 6 year old (though older kids could definitely get a lot of mileage out if it), and the sticker book was great for my 4 year old.
All the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful, which really helped to make the visit.

UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"I visited with my 7 year old daughter for the first time and we had a brilliant time. We stayed about 2 and a half hours but could easily have spent longer here. We both loved seeing all the train displays and my daughter was very impressed with the royal carriages.
We loved the miniature railway and the mallard simulator was amazing. My daughter also really enjoyed the small outdoor play area.
It all felt very safe with floor markers indicating one way only throughout the museum and lots of hand sanitiser around. Activities had to be pre booked too so that everyone could stay in their bubbles.
We’ll definitely be back to visit again soon.

UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"This was okay if you’re interested in trains and the history. I think I personally would have found it more interesting if more exhibits had been open but fully understood the reason behind them being closed still. Walking around the trains there was ample space for everyone and there is a little cafe selling tea & scones that did seem slightly overpriced. I would go back again if in area as think there is more to see, just a shame closed off due to COVID!
I did rather enjoy the mini railway, that was quite enjoyable to watch.",Jun 2021

UK,National Railway Museum,4.0,"It is free to get into the museum although we did book a date and time in advance as numbers were still limited. The main reason for attending was to satisfy my partner's interest in trains. However this vast space does contain something for everyone.

High pond for me were:
Looking inside the royal carriages
Understanding the importance of the railways in terms of goods transportation -the milk and fish carriages were a first for me!
The exhibition on the Eurostar with the tunnel surrounding it as this gave you a real impression of how it travels under the channel and the sheer size of the uncle circumference.

Meanwhile my partner took many photos of engines etc and had to see the Mallard -the world's fastest steam train

A really educational and visual afternoon out!

It’s right next to York train station there is a miniature train ride which you have to get separate tickets for on arrival. There is also a play area for the children too. There was also a land train that goes from the museum into town

UK,National Railway Museum,1.0,"Really disappointed in my return visit to the museum. Yes I know it's free entry but what a disappointment. Compared to my last visit many years ago the quality has dropped right off. There were too few engines on display. Yes I know the current restrictions are a pain but nevertheless there was far too much space that could have been better utilised. As regards the food and drink. What a rip off. Prices far too high and very limited selection. the tea in the carriage hall was served in proper cups but was like warm at best and as for shutting at 3:00 when the museum was open for another 2 hours. What a missed opportunity. The tea room carriage was closed as well again another missed opportunity. Overall very poor.

UK,National Railway Museum,2.0,"We travelled from Norfolk for our second visit to the museum. Our last visit was 10 years ago. The museum itself is fantastic. The locomotives and rolling stock are all fantastic and well displayed, however, this trip was a total letdown due to the lack of staff in the museum and most bits closed.

First, we qued for some time to get coffee and cake for our party of 5, the poor woman was rushed off her feet and was struggling all on her own. We paid and walked to the table only to find no butter for our scones, napkins, spoons, knives, and plates. It took some time to eventually speak to someone and get these items. We were told there was a conference on that is why service was slow!! I don't understand why we have to ask for everything?

We travelled to the Great Hall and walked through the locomotives and headed for the North Shed, but found that closed due to lack of staff! So we walked to try out the Mallard Experience only to be told that it was fully booked for today! No notice to say this. We went to the cafe next door and watched for 45 minutes, nobody came to use the simulator and the woman sat doing nothing!! We could have easily had our 5-minute experience with time to spare!

The shop in the Grand Hall was closed so we could not look at the model railway stuff for sale!! Altogether a very long disappointing trip!

Good points...quick entry with online booking ticket. Very friendly entrance staff. Cafe and gift shop seemed very good.
Bad points. Mallard experience...no one at it..kids wanted a go....host unable to let them on as it was booked all day! Really ?
Same with miniature train....couldn't just go on with no one in the queue...need to book tickets !
Some exhibits need to be put in more accessible positions.....felt some were just there to fill a space.
Outside area very bare...weeding and tidy up needed...and perhaps put some exhibits outside ?

We had a quick stop at the cafe for some coffee and cake whilst we digested what we saw the service and food was amazing .

It was also nice to see the old station signs dotted around the walls of the museum as well as old posters for rowntrees products. I still cant believe this attraction is completely free! Spent a good 3 hours here, would’ve been even more if the other areas were open.

UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"My husband and I visited the railway museum on 17 June. Due to Covid you have to book your tickets prior to your visit to control the numbers in the museum. We got tickets for 10.15 am but we’re allowed to enter at 10.00 am as they allow you in up to 30 minutes before the time on your ticket.
It was very well organised and quick by just getting your ticket scanned. Although it’s free to visit they do ask for donations either when you book or do have areas dotted around where you can donate.
The museum is set over 2 main areas (a small 3rd area was closed due to staffing on the day we arrived). They have a great selection of different trains to view and it’s easy to get around and see them all up close and keep a safe distance from other visitors.
You can’t go inside some of the trains due to Covid but you can still see enough.

I found the whole museum very interesting from the Royal Carriages to the historic rocket and the modern Bullet train. The highlight of the day was viewing a cross section of a steam train and hearing a great explanation from a guide as to how it all works. The museum is free but we did leave a donation.

UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,Lovely few hours spent at the railway museum. It wasn’t too busy and was nice to see the miniature railway was up and running.,Jun 2021
UK,National Railway Museum,5.0,"Took my elderly father here for a birthday treat, and there were 5 of us in total. We parked at the Leeman Road car park (£10 for the day) which was just a bit too far for him to walk, and I noticed that there is a car park near the entrance, which probably costs a bit more but would have been worth it. The museum is free to enter, and during the pandemic, they request that you book tickets online, where you can choose a time slot, but I will point out that you can only enter 30 minutes earlier than your time slot, which is fair enough. The museum itself is very interesting, and I particularly liked the ground-level exhibition which made me feel that I had stepped back in time and was waiting on a platform for a train. We had a bite to eat in the cafe, and I chose an egg and cress sandwich priced at £4.25 and there was plenty of seating area outside. The museum does ask for a donation, and we were more than happy to contribute. Well worth a visit.

UK,National Railway Museum,3.0,"Enjoyed the majority of a visit today to the National Railway Museum with our grandson. Regrettably the pre booking of food with collection from the food station in the main concourse is a good idea but in practice fails to deliver There is no clear signage advertising as to where the food should be collected and having queued at the food station was met with a blank look from one of the staff members who were overseeing the tills. There were two staff members actually providing service to customers by way of food and beverages with two further staff hugging the tills Bad organisation and service only redeemed by tasty food but avoid the coffee which is abysmal
No doubt the justification for bad service will be the knock on effects of the pandemic which excuse is insulting

Car park all day in secure conditions with security number to operate barrier on your exit. Cost is £10. No charge for museum entry but a donation is requested of £5. Well worth the gratuity.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Very interesting! One of the best history tours that I have ever done. We toured the Churchill war rooms on a Thursday morning. Not too crowded but too many not masked or half masked. That was disappointing. Since it wasn’t crowded, we distanced from them. Audio tour was very good. Let us move at our own pace. We didn’t spend much time in the portion of the tour that was the Churchill museum.

One observation: it would have helped us understand the Blitz more to have included a section about the the damage to London and how ordinary citizens survived the Blitz. This exhibit needs context to help younger guests appreciate why being underground was necessary AND how typist lived outside the bunker and still managed to show up for work.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,"I was really looking forward to this visit and was not disappointed. The museum itself is well thought out and there is so much to see that i dont think i saw it all properly and will have to visit again.

Very interesting to see the conditions that the staff lived in and the displays about Churchill's life and achievements were great.

However, i did have an issue with a couple of things. Firstly, there were far too many people being allowed in. For a place like this you need time and space to be able to see and read everything properly. Sadly many times i felt like i was being forced to move on because i became aware of other people very close behind me. Especially in the churchill exhibition; too many people wandering in too many different directions made it difficult to get to all the exhibits and again i felt rushed.

Maybe a one-way system guiding people round would work much better.

Secondly, the cafe is very small for the size of the museum. I think i was expecting more from the menu as well. Hardly any choice and to be honest i'm not sure this can still be blamed on covid.

Those issues aside it is still definately worth a visit and i would recommend.

Best for those who can listen attentively and read though a parent willing to help 'interpret/summarize' could provide a child with an amazing introduction to Churchill.

I didn't know about this museum but a friend kept on us to go, so we did.
One tip our family has for our traveling friends out there: Take a good 3 Hours to see everything.
We went at 4:00pm and regretted not going earlier. It is a very detailed museum and it closes at 6:00pm on the DOT! The employees basically chase you out the door at 6:00!
We thought it quite odd but that's how it is at the Churchill War Rooms.
I wish we would have known how detailed it was and we would have reserved an earlier time slot.
Anyhow, what we did see, we loved and it was a super cool experience.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Our visit to the Churchill War Rooms was easy to prebook online a couple of days before our Saturday morning visit and allowed speedy, trouble free entry upon arrival. That said it wasn't busy at our scheduled entry time of 10.00am, so we probably wouldn't have had any issues without the booking.
The route through the War Rooms was still affected by Covid measures, so things were a bit out of sequence, but the use of the hand held audio guide made it easy to get the most out of the visit.
The War Rooms provided a fascinating glimpse into such an important part of our National and World history, the people who played a part in it and the environment in which they worked and lived. It was great to see and hear the video accounts of the War Rooms' staff, including the civilians and clerical staff who played an important role in the war effort. Their reflections provided an insight into their lives and their interactions with some of the more prominent figures, including Churchill himself, bringing added reality to these characters and the challenges they faced.
In addition to the War Rooms there is a significant section focused on Churchill from his early and family life, military career, political highs and lows, through to his death and the national reaction to it.
There is a lot to take in throughout both the War Rooms and the Churchill museum, so our visit extended over a couple of hours, by which time it was getting busier, and included a stop off in the cafe and souvenir shop.
Excellent throughout and would highly recommend to others.

The audio guide (no extra charge) was good.

The war rooms really give you a detailed idea of how London persevered through the war and how essential the underground bunker became during hard times.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"A visit comprising of two parts, one a walkthrough of the underground passages and rooms used by high figure government and war officials during the blitz of the second world war, and two - a museum mostly dedicated to Churchill's life in particular his contribution during the war. The walkthrough is an informative tour of the makeshift work areas and dormitories of staff with much of the original fixtures and furniture of the time leaving little to the imagination as to what the conditions were like there. The tour includes an audio handset which I found to be very informative and easy to use. The museum has many exhibits including Churchill's letters, books, medals, and more including some items of his clothing he was well known for. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit.

Coupled with the sobering and stark underground rooms from where the War Cabinet plotted their every move, and illuminated by the inspiring characters who worked there, this was time well spent .",Aug 2021
UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,"Booked tickets online to visit during our trip to London. My partner is a huge History fan and absolutely loved every minute of it. I usually am not bothered about History, however I have to say I did find it very interesting too!

The whole thing is set out really well, and even though we went on a Sunday, it was still nice and quiet and you could take your time looking round. At the start you are provided with a little speaker that you type the corresponding number in with the room you are currently in, hold it up to you ear and listen to the facts and information about what you are looking at.

All the rooms are behind doors or glass windows so you can’t actually get right up close but can still see everything.

After the war rooms there is the Churchill Museum - this is the bit I found less interesting as it talks about everything from Churchill being born and his life even before the war. However, there are some good interactive things that you can do such as quizzes and watching videos.

Overall if you are interested in History it is definitely worth a visit. It recommends spending 2 hours to fully experience everything however we left around 1 hour 30 minutes as we felt we had seen it all and had enough.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"Visited with my parents and we basically had the place to ourselves (our tickets where for 3;30pm), its huge, its well laid out and I loved the interactive elements as well as the personal stories from the people who where there.",Jul 2021
UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"I pre-booked our tickets online and used the e-ticket on my phone for entry which was straight forward,
Included in the entry is an audio guide which is set up in your language of preference which I think is a great addition, especially for tourists.
The one way system was easy to follow, however I would note that the order of the artefacts isn’t in numerical order. Ie you may jump from 8 to 13 on the audio list. I suspect the introduction of the one way system has led to this being out of sync.
The audio guide really brings the rooms to life and every now and again you can hear the sound of whistling in the corridors so you feel as though you are back in time working underground.
The bathroom facilities were clean and available through the route. There is also a cafe and gift shop which I found surprisingly budget friendly. Some items are expensive but there were a few pocket money friendly items available to purchase as a souvenir.
The whole experience took us around two hours, it is a lot of walking and standing but there’s a few opportunities to take a seat, so make the most of those on your way round.
I think £25 is quite expensive for the price, I was expecting to pay £17 or so, having said that you may find getting an annual membership more cost effective as that would be unlimited entry as well as entry to IWM, IWM Duxford and HMS Belfast (I have a review from a few years ago of my trip to HMS Belfast when I had an annual pass).
This trip is suitable for over 12 as I think young children would find the walking long and the audio guide may not keep them engaged, however this is certainly a family friendly museum. I would recommend this for a day out to friends and family.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"We hadn't planned to visit here on our city break but decided to go in as we were passing and really glad we did. The audio guides are great to lead you around the underground complex and give lots on information. We also stood listening to one of the very knowledgeable guides who added extra information and was obviously passionate about the importance of the rooms in the war effort. So pleased that they have preserved such an important place in our countries history.
While there we stopped off at their cafe for a lunch break which had a limited selection but the quality was good.
Good to see the place that features in many second world war films and where so many decisions that influenced the war were taken and many of Churchill's famous speeches were drafted.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,1.0,"In place of our COVID affected holiday we visited London for a few days. We had booked for the 3 of us to visit the War Rooms on Thursday 15th July, or so we thought. Stupidly we had booked for the following Thursday, as the lady at the reception pointed out when we arrived. No worries she said, I’ll just phone to see if we can make an exception and let you in. Back came the answer of NO. Tell them they can go online and book again for later in the day ( another £68.75 ) or they can drive back from Norwich again next Thursday. What a lovely example of jobsworth money grabbing and a great advert to tourists from everywhere. Yes we messed up but it was an easy situation to rectify and common sense could have prevailed. We went to the Imperial War Museum instead, which we highly recommend.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,"Amazing visit, had booked for 1PM by accident when I intended for 2PM however the staff kindly let me in anyway.

Feels amazing being inside of the actual bunker used by Churchill and his cabinet, loved the audio phones used to give a guide, however due to how the bunker is laid out currently it is out of order so the directions can be confusing.

Sadly the visit got cut short due to some form of emergency so I was unable to see the very end of the bunker

UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,I'm fascinated by the era and anything to do with Churchill as a war leader. This place simply oozes atmosphere and the sounds of the period add to this. Fabulous.,Jun 2021
UK,Churchill War Rooms,5.0,"To feel such history all around was quite something — and all the more special, having watched ""The Darkest Hour"" film.

As well as the actual rooms in which Churchill and his advisors managed operations, preserved in the state they were left in after the war had finished, there is also a museum detailing lots of other aspects of Churchill's life and career, as well as events around the time of the second world war.

Highly recommended — if you've seen and enjoyed the film, it's probably a must see when visiting London.

UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,Very enjoyable experience looking at a dark time in this country's past. The electronic guide was very thorough in giving you all the information you need about the different rooms and what it would have been like to work and live in the rooms. The Churchill museum part was filled was so much information about the great man and the events at the time. The shop was filled with many gifts (mostly over-priced) and book. Definitely would recommend for families to learn about what happened during the War.,May 2021
UK,Churchill War Rooms,4.0,"We have just returned from a 3 day trip to London. The highlight was a booking made to visit the War Rooms on our last day (Friday 11th June). My girlfriend has visited 3 times previously but for me it was a first. I was really looking forward to it especially after her enthusiasm, and whilst my visit wasn't ruined I did feel it was rather spoilt. The premise of the museum is a faithful recreation of Churchills war rooms, as they were, during and at the end of the war. Why then does someone see merit in placing an art exhibition in many of the rooms - mostly in the middle of the viewing glass, thereby obscuring the view especially for photographs. Most pictures were placed on huge wooden easels and one had to peer around then to see into the room - thank goodness it was not busy.
Whilst the curator may feel the importance of displaying art is justified, you must remember what the public are paying for - that is to see the rooms not an art exhibition. There are a number of areas in the museum where art could be displayed and monitored by staff if security is an issue. I feel the whole art display was an oversight on the museums part and it tempered my enjoyment. If I wanted to see pictures there are hundreds of places I could have gone to in London. I enjoyed my visit but feel cheated on the whole experience of the 'war rooms'
