Norway,Fram Museum,5.0,"A very nice museum about the polar explorer. There are 2 buildings, each with a ship you can go onto and explore. There is also a lot of information and other things to see around the museum. Very nice.",Oct 2021
Norway,Fram Museum,4.0,Someone must spend at least 2-3 hours minimum to fully enjoy this unique museum. It is very interesting to say the least,Aug 2021
Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We were amazed at the amount of people exercising upon this feature, yet more taken in with the amount of things to avail of.
Well worth the effort of getting up and around the feature.",Oct 2021
Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Must do! We were going to casually skip this but so glad that we didn’t. Watching the sunset with a bird’s eye view of Bergen the beauty is special. Besides, there is also a whole lot of things to do once you are up there!",Aug 2021
Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,Amazing ride. The view is taking your breath away. Bergen from above is an experience you have to do. The ticket for two persons was not expensive.,Aug 2021
Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We had dreamed of this place and we have not been disappointed ! Everyone does it but you just need to look at the view to understand why ! The journey in funicular is of course part of its charm as you see the city getting further and further away.
We went up quite late so we didn't get to enjoy everything that the Mount Floyen has to offer but it will just be an excuse to come back !

However, if you are planning to use your Bergen Card discount to get to the top, be sure to come while the ticket office at the city station is open; as you won't be able to get the discount if you buy your ticket from the machine. (As a lot of places, the office closes early even in summer, at 4 pm in our case but we went up at 10:30pm)

Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"Take the short 'train' ride and spend some time at the top for photos. Enjoy the view and take some sun.
Thereafter, take a short walk to the lake where you can do free canoe for about 20 minutes (you can get in the queue and do it again if you like). This is a very nice experience. It starts at 11 AM so reach there before that.

There is no need to do advance booking for any of this.

We walked down the mountain like most people. It takes some effort and can tire your legs but would still be good to do once in a while if weather is good.

Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,5.0,"We spent an eventful half day on Fløyen mountain. Even though it is quite pricy for a 3 minute ride, we decided to take the funicular up the hill because the walk up would have been quite challenging for the children. Plus we wanted to experience the view from the funicular, which is really amazing. We only had to stand in line for about 15 minutes but I understand that usually there is a larger crowd.
On the mountain we found several playgrounds, a somewhat outdated Trollskogen, good ice cream and a souvenir shop with many little treasures. The view from the top is worth many photos. The walk to and around the lake is very peaceful and beautiful. We did not stand in line for renting boats as it was a weekend and many people wanted to try it.
We also saw goats and hamsters which was quite the attraction for our kids.
There are several possibilities for different hikes starting from Fløyen mountain but we did not have time to follow any of the longer ones.
Because we had good weather, we decided to walk down back to the city center, which took us about an hour at a very slow pace. We found a playground with an extra long slide along the way and that was a nice surprise for the kids.

Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"We was arriving at the station around 1000 and it was not a queue.
Interesting tour with a view, it is very steep.
On the top you have a lot of options beside the great view over Bergen.
You can take a lot of different walks on the top or back down to the town.
You can buy food or something to drink.",Jun 2021
Norway,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,4.0,"I was in bergen for one night, it was a sunny day with hardly any cloud cover. I climbed up to see the great views of the city. Definitely recommend this if staying in bergen.

Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"Late October 2021 visit.
Went up around 4pm, great time to go up, just as it is getting dark, so you see both the sites in daylight, enough time for a hot chocolate, and then you can you back out in the semi darkness. All covered in snow up here. Although it operated every 30 mins, 4 coach loads arrived from a visiting cruise ship, so they seemed to increase frequency. Fantastic viewing platform. Happy to recommend.",Oct 2021
Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"If you like hiking, I recommend you to go up Fjellheisen via sherpatrappa. The route starts more or less in the same place as the cable car. Then, enjoy a nice coffee at the top of the mountain. And, go down via cable car.

The upper part of sherpatrappa may be slippery, so better have ice grippers in your shoes.",Oct 2021
Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,3.0,"If u have power in ur legs, use the stairs! It is not that bad, and u save a lot of money (1200 something steps). There is lot of benches and reating spots with spetacular view. The condole was not corona safe, even though it said in the webside that 10 person maximum. I kind a felt anxious with at least 20 other inside in a small place. The trip takes 4 minutes and goes straight to the cafe. Its good to note that the condole goes every 30minutes and u may have to cueue for the next one. We went to see the sunset and it was beautiful. More nice was to walk from Tromso center to the spot and back, coz we saw local people beautiful homes. Extra mention; the place and the condole is made accessoble, so people with dissabilities can enter. May need a little bit help with the stairs in the condole line (few steps) but there is a person who helps.

Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,The way up was super fast since the mountain is only 421m high. We were lucky since we went in the off season but the weather was still fantastic. the mountain might be short but it still had. a great view from both the cafe and outside on the padeo. I would recommend everyone to come by here on your first day in Tromsø.,Jul 2021
Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,"Pre booked tickets online and got a small discount. Not very busy, so went up on the first cart. Ride took just over a minute to the top and what a view. Just amazing. The sun went behind the clouds and colors were amazing. A must do if you visit Tromsø.",Aug 2021

Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,4.0,The cable car offers great views and is a quick and convenient way to get up to the mountain top. There is a lot of space on top to walk around and click photos. We went when there was a lot of snow. The restaurant on top is also nice and reasonably priced (at least for Norway),Mar 2021
Norway,Fjellheisen Tromso,5.0,You can see whole Tromso Island from here. Due to the COVID restrictions they don't serve alcoholic drinks unless you buy some hot meals.,Jan 2021
Norway,Viking Ship Museum,3.0,"A little dated in style, but due to close in October 2021 for 5 years for a new building. Nicely presented informative, the video was quite difficult to follow as you needed to look at all the wall surfaces. If when I return I'll revisit if it's open",Sep 2021
Norway,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,Small but really awesome exhibition of original viking ships preserved in great condition. Really feel the connection to historical times.,Sep 2021
Norway,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,a place to fantasize the life and the piracies of those primitive cavitation and who they were organized .,Aug 2021
Norway,Viking Ship Museum,5.0,"It closes on oct 1st, for five years, so I'd go asap.

It's not that much to do - but the viking ships are wonderful to take in and behold and the interactive movie transcends language.
I'm very impressed with how sacred the experience felt - it was a beautiful thing.

If it feels ""short"", remember that there are other museums within walking distance as well.",Aug 2021
Norway,Viking Ship Museum,4.0,"The Viking Museum is surprisingly small, but is interesting and (when you think about it) amazing that these ships are so old and still so well preserved! There were two intact ships and one that is a burial ship and far less preserved and more of a flat piece of wood. A lot of the artifacts were taken for repair when I was there (right after it reopened post COVID), and from what I understand, won’t be back for some time. There is a great video that plays - a lot of time and effort went into it and the museum partnered with the Viking Voyages. Also the current ticket purchase also serves to get you into the Volksmuseum down the street - so it’s two for one.",Jun 2021
Norway,Lysefjord,5.0,"The easiest way to visit Lysefjord is to book a ticket on a cruise which lasts usually 3 hours. The boats are very comfortable with wide clear windows so you can enjoy the full view of the fjord. This place is amazing and if you visit it, you will probably never forget its magnificence. You will also be able to take the most beautiful pictures ever.",Jul 2021

Norway,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"Amazing place and vibe, we went in November and the autumn 🍂 atmosphere made it magical.
Ticket 280 nok for two people, there are two exhibitions and an older and a more recent village one next to the other, very suggestive.
The church is of course the best building, nice experience",Nov 2021
Norway,Norsk Folkemuseum,4.0,"We have visited a few alike museums in other countries, so we came with certain expectations. While others often group certain buildings into regions within the country that isn't the case here. With the older buildings, there is also not a lot of information available and you can't enter most of them.
More interesting was the part when the time approaches modern life, something thst was new to us. You walk through a few floors that show life in the 20th century. Was quite cool to see certain items that I partially still saw at my grandparents and later even some that I owned (getting old I guess).
All in all worth the time and money.",Oct 2021
Norway,Norsk Folkemuseum,5.0,"Not too expensive, very cool buildings and easy accessiblr via public transport. We went there when the exhibits were almost all closed (almost no other people). We had a great time viewing all the buildings and especially the church.",Oct 2021

Norway,Old Stavanger,5.0,"Historic sightseeing - a must to do when in Stavanger. And dropp in on ""IDDIS"" and have a great lunch :-)",Oct 2021
Norway,Old Stavanger,5.0,"It is a truly magic little jewel box, and walking on these streets feels like wonderland. There are many cute shops along the way as well. You do have to pick a good time for a longer walk, as rain is frequent in Stavanger in any season. There is also hidden street are everywhere, so if you are a fan, keep your eyes open. A place for the coolest pictures!",Jul 2021
Norway,Flor og Fjære,5.0,"The gardens are fantastic, came around 24 years ago and they have developed the area beyond recognition. The themed gardens and water features are a feast for the senses, it hardly felt like Norway especially as the day was so warm and sunny. My trip was subsidised but if it hadn’t been I would have been pretty fed up with my meal as the vegan option while acceptable was not to the standard of the rest of the group.",Sep 2021
Norway,Flor og Fjære,4.0,"Lovely garden, nice restaurant with a beautiful view. Good food, but very boring children's dinner. But kids enjoyed the ""free"" ice cream bar outside. Chef André says in his stand-up show before dinner that he don't like black coffee. I love black coffee, but the one they serve there was terrible.",Jun 2021
Norway,Vigeland Park,4.0,"We met here with local friends but it was on our list of places to visit.
One thing can be said for sure - this park ain't boring. It features a variety of nice, but also really weird sculptures. On plenty occasions we were laughing or shaking our heads.
Apart of the statues, it is a nice and spacious park where you can spend some time. Only small minus is that there doesn't seem to be a great restaurant or cafe nearby (we weren't impressed by the ones we saw).",Oct 2021
Norway,Vigeland Park,5.0,"It is an beautifully maintained green park with a lot of place for outside activities. On a normal Summer day you can see many people hanging out, picnicking or doing different sports. It is an ideal place for joggers as well, who will benefit from the natural terrain. If you pay attention, you can find a hidden free book exchange location in a telephone booth - there are usually books in English language available that you could borrow. The central location of the park is also a huge plus, can be easily accessed by tram, bus (12 and 20 stop at the entrance) or metro (short walk from Majorstuen station).",Jun 2021
Norway,Vigeland Park,5.0,"Vigeland Park has a big exhibition of art in form of statues, and is one of the biggest collection of statue art in Norway. Worth a trip if the weather is good.",Apr 2021
Norway,Vigeland Park,5.0,"It was one of my favorite parks in Norwaym it was huge and there a lot of things that can be done on the park. During our visit, the vigeland museum was closed due to the covid19 restrictions. The park was not yet as green as it usually is beacuse it is early spring but we are blessed with a good weather and had a long, fun and satifying walk in the park that allowed us to connect with nature while looking at the beautiful masterpieces.",Apr 2021
