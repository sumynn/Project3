Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Amazing. Absolutely beautiful and full of history. The gardens can be visited for free an it already pays off the visit, but if you want, I'd definitely recommend the tour inside of the palace, it takes less than 2 hours using the Audioguide",Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"Can¬¥t realy review it, it is magic and it is a jewel but a bit boring after 25 rooms and for sure I hate this electronic guide.",Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,This is one of the must see attractions in Vienna. Great palace and amazing interior. Garden is also really nice.,Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We decided to do the self-guided tour of the Palace which meant we could go at our own pace, the ticket included access to the walled gardens and the orangery. The Palace and grounds are stunning. We took the tram from our hotel in the Museum Quarter and it was easy to find our way around. The grounds are extensive so for people not wanting to walk all the way round there is a small 'train' which does the circuit on a hop on, hop off basis for 9 Euros. We did a mixture of a lot of walking combined with the train. We felt we covered everything and were there for almost a whole day.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We went there for a couple of hours and remain for the whole day. It was just perfect! We dis the tour of the palace, kids enjoyed the maze, and then we went to the garden and up to the Gloriette with a wonderful view.
Definitely the best way of spending time",Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"If you're in Vienna it comes highly recommended to spend at least one full day at Sch√∂nbrunn and its gardens. The palace itself is nice to see. The price is a bit high, but the majestic rooms are quite interesting to see. It's certainly more impressive than the Imperial Appartments at Hofburg, especially the ball room. With the audio guide it took me almost one hour to complete the entire tour. As a visitor you have two options, but always opt for the longest one. You will see some special rooms like a hunting room which you won't see with the most basic ticket. And some of these rooms are the finest of the entire palace.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,We took a guided tour of the Schonbrunn Palace as part of a Uniworld tour. The palace is beautiful and we learned some of the history of the Hadsburg family and Empress Maria Theresa. The gardens are gorgeous and were definitely the highlight of our visit. The gardens go on forever! Be sure to take the time to walk through. We visited in September and there were no crowds which was very nice.,Sep 2021

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"The place is great, full of history and cultural, a nice garden and labyrinth, and a beautiful site of the palace and the city at the top of the hill. It‚Äôs a most on your list if your going to Viena!",Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,3.0,"If you are a fan of splendor, baroque and rococo styles - this is yours. We are not fans, so we did not go inside the palace.
We walked in the park - it is huge and crowded.
Despite the distance from the center (7 kilometers on foot) it is convenient to get - by subway. Between the metro station and the palace there is a machine with free water - very convenient. In general, stock up on water in the heat.
Pretty cute Japanese garden, although it's not old Austria of course.
My advice - visit everything in the center - Belvedere, Military Museum, Albertina, etc., and then, if time permits - visit it

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,Such an impressive place and a good audio guide included in the price. The additional charge for the maze and orangery entry isn't worth it as the gardens are so huge you can wander around and not need these additional bits. Certainly get a ticket where you can see the whole house though.,Sep 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,3.0,"In Vienna every place is a palace, the real palace wasn't as impressive as the others. The gardens and the view are very nice. Get only the gardens and palace ticket the all inclusive one is a bit of a tourist trap. In the palace only around 4 rooms are really impressive (out of 40) in my opinion it's only worth a visit if you have enough time.",Sep 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"It‚Äôs not Versailles so keep that in mind when you go. Smaller though the grounds are huge, too much for walking the whole grounds for us. The palace was fine, audio guides helpful. Not too many people fall 2021 with Covid so manageable.",Sep 2021

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,1.0,"You pay 22‚Ç¨ per person to see 40 small rooms. I have been to many palaces , these on looks big on the outside but the tour takes 1 hour! Doesnt worth it. I should have given my money to the poor instead.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"What a lovely palace! We bought spontaneously a ticket. We could take the tour oy after waiting 7 mins. A shame you are not allowed to take pictures insife. We really loved it. The palace is beautiful and there is plenty to see! If you are there, make sure to visit the garden. Take a walk uphil and enjoy the scenery. Definaty worth the hike up!",Sep 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Kind of a must-see/do on any first visit to Vienna. With a palace, a maze, a caf√©, a labyrinth, gardens...there should be something for most people and ages to enjoy.

We opted for the classic pass, which gave us access to:
- 40 rooms in the palace (including the ""millions room"" and more)
- the gloriette rooftop (which provides a fantastic view of the city, and a much better view than if you were to look out from the ground floor of the gloriette due to the trees)
- privy garden
- a maze (which was actually a little tougher than I thought it would be, which made it fun)
- labyrinths (that are more for a younger crowd, I'd say)
- orangery garden (which was the most underwhelming part of the package)

A few tips:
- When hiking up to the gloriette, there's a zig-zag path ""straight"" up in the sun, but there are also diagonal side paths in the shade.
- No big packs/bags in the palace, but you can have a little backpack (think, like, a little track bag size).
- If you do the classic pass, prepare to spend 3-4 hours in all.
- Take your time in the palace--there's a lot to see--and definitely get the (included) audio guide.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Beautiful palace with a great garden for a long leisurely walk. No wonder the Habsburgs made this beautiful place their summer residence and spent there up to 9 months a year. I'd recommend to take a guided tour, otherwise you won't be able to see the whole complex.",Aug 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,I've seen a lot of palaces and castles. Schonbrunn is definitely unique. As opulent the palace is the gardens are ten times more enticing. Definitely a place to see,Aug 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,We had a great tour guide and frankly it does boil down to who you get because they give such interesting fun facts about what happened in certain rooms of the palace. Super educational and really gives a lot of insights on the Habsburgs though it focuses more on Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Maria Theresa than the overall royal family.,Aug 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We allowed a day, which gave us enough time to see the main house, some of the gardens, outbuildings and so on. As this place has so many reviews, just 2 points particular to us:
1. Had to come back next day with our son, a keen botanist, to view the greenhouses (separate ticket/ entity); these seemed to close earlier than other parts of the park (may not always be the case, recommend u check).
On that second visit, we walked to Sch√∂nbrunn all the way from down town Vienna. Taking the route we took, where the last part is facing the palace itself (coming down the Johnstra√üe) is disappointing, as the road comes through significantly less attractive parts of Vienna and the views of the palace were less than we had expected. Anyone keen to walk from town to the palace may want to check for a nicer route.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,Expensive but worth the price. Plus points for free audio guides. Requires some walking from metro station,Aug 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"This place is so large and the gardens so nice you should expect to spend a half day here. Take the guided tour (with a human and not audio guide) if you have the time to spare. Walk the gardens, enjoy the fountains. Grab a quick bite to eat (lunch) at the Gloriette - expect a good view of the city not food that's to stand up and cheer for; but that's not to say it's not bad. Call it average. And continue with the carriage museum and the imperial chapel. Doesn't sound like much? Well, at a brisk New Yorker city pace it took a bit over 15 minutes to get from the Gloriette to the exit of the palace and another 5 minutes to walk to the carriage museum. Throw in all the camera candy and it's more like a 25-30 minute walk. Get the picture now? I arrive at 09:45 and didn't leave until 2pm.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"The fortress' commanding position on top of a hill high above Salzburg, offers beautiful views of the old city of Salzburg, as well as the surrounding areas. On a clear day, these views are unbeatable. The interior of the castle offers some rather impressive rooms (the delicate woodwork is especially noteworthy).
We did not like the fact, however, that the organization of the interior museum has been recently rearranged, such that now you cannot exit after simply visiting the archbishop's rooms, and you need to make your way through the entire military museum as well - even if military artifacts are the last thing on your mind, and even if, in these COVID times, you'd rather minimize the time you're staying at a crowded indoor space.

Everyone present vax cards (or similar clearance) before getting on the funicular, and registered for contact tracing via cell phone/text. (Why wasn't everyone doing it this way?) With all that, they kept the lines moving and it was a quick and fun trip to the top. There were several ways you could go at the top. The views outside were fantastic. The tour through the fortress I thought was quite interesting, and the information in each room was available in English as well as German.

Especially the Breughel room is art at its best. Some of the legendary paintings that were shown to me in school were available here. The Greco-Roman and Egyptian parts of the museum were a bit dull to be honest, especially compared to other museums like the Pergamon museum. The coin collection at the upper floor is only for the real art fans. The collection of Italian and French paintings is also downright impressive, but didn't appeal to me as much as the Flemish and Dutch paintings.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",1.0,access to Hallstatt is near impossible in a motor home in October. All motor home car parks are closed and all other car parks have height restrictions. Staff are rude and unhelpful. I imagine this to be a beautiful place but clearly Hallstatt doesn‚Äôt care for tourist money.,Oct 2021
Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"We visited Hallstatt and we went up to the Top of Hallstatt attraction by funicular.
We took some photos about the amazing view from the World Heritage View Point. Don't miss it if you are in Hallstatt.",Sep 2021
Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",1.0,"The view is nice, but I've seen nicer. Expensive tickets for the funicular, not worth the money and the view. Staff is very rude, everything was a bit unorganised. Would skip it and don't recommend it.",Aug 2021
Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"I walked up through the path which leads behind the church. The path is steep all the time but in good condition and no climbing is required. It takes some effort to reach the top but you can walk in your own tempo. Along the way there are amazing views of the lake and Hallstatt. There are also a lot of benches where you can rest. You can walk in trainers. The view from the platform on top is indescribable. I can read how crowded is usually there, but because of corona situation there were only a few people when I was there. This is an ideal time to visit tourist besieged places. It was also easy to get parking place in Hallstatt, because there were so few tourists. I recommend walking up and enyoj the view all the way.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"Question: We are planning a shopping day for the 25th of October at your Outlet Village. As we need to drive 150 km's from Slovakia to get there, I would like to make sure that we'll be able to take full advantage of your offers. One of the reviewers mentioned that you can register on a website in advance and one can pick up a card for additional discount at the Information kiosk, is that correct? I was looking through your website but could not find where to register for this additional discount card. Would you be so kind as to post a link with the web address that would take me there? Many thanks in advance!

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,2.0,"I‚Äôve been there many times, and I‚Äôm used that not every time your shopping is fantastic. But this time shops excelled with outdated clothes and staff, felt like pandemics hit the industry and only old staff not sold before 2020 was sent there. Probably the best to wait some time gor clothing industry to recover before going there again.",Sep 2021

Not every shop has offer just for you, but at the end of day shopping bag became solid. The negative is that food curt is not at all such rich as a shopping brand, problematically to get not fast food with normal service and normal prices.",Aug 2021

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The mountain peak is wonderful and the views from it are amazing.. One of the most beautiful things I have seen, although I have visited many places in the Alps.. Approaching the splendor of the Swiss Alps.. The access to the summit is by bus 25 from the main Salzburg train station till the end of the line , when you get out of the busy you will find the cable car station just in front of you. And as soon as you go up the mountain, you will know your way and find the whole city of Salzburg below you, as well as the river and the surrounding green attractive mountains.. Choose a day free of clouds, rain and with a good temperature to enjoy .. and have sport shoes with you that fit the slopes.. don't forget to bring juice or something to drink with you. The place is suitable for children and the degree of ruggedness is slight, but it is a bit difficult for wheelchairs and strollers.. The only problem is the crowding of people in the cable cars.. I benefited from the Salzburg card to ride the bus and go up to the mountain by cable car for free.. That activity is in my opinion the most important if you go to Salzburg

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Is also included in the Salzburg Card.
Be sure to pick a day with good wheather, otherwise you will miss out on the spectacular views. The ride looks scary because of the large span to the first pole, but it is smooth.
We went up and made the hike to the hill with the cross, like most people do. It's not that far but it's still a climb and you get nice views, also on the Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden. Top it off with lunch at the Hochalm Gasthof next to the lift and you will have spent three hours on the trip.
You can also hike to the Eish√∂hle and the Lentz cabin, but that is more for advanced walkers, and requires a whole day.
Walking shoes are advisable, if not necessary. Also take warm clothes, the wheather at the top can change quickly.
As to Corona: the 3G check was done before boarding.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"We enjoyed the hike on the Untersberg with great weather today Tue August 3rd but we were very surprised by the corona negligence of the cable car operator.
This morning we went into a cable car fully packed with 50 passengers - with this number you can barely move 10 cm anymore - and although everyone had to wear masks, NO ONE had to prove the so famous 3G in Austria. Everyone can take the cable car without having to show proof of vaccination, test or cure‚Ä¶..this in great contrast to hotels or restaurants close by‚Ä¶.This was really not corona proof.",Aug 2021
