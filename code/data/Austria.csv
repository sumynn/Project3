Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,Fantastic experience! All was clean and sparkling! The rooms with the acustic guide travels you in that time. In the palace we stay about 1.5 hours. In the gardens for sure you need 5 hours but for a first taste is good idea to spend 1 hour if you have less days in Vienna.,Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Amazing. Absolutely beautiful and full of history. The gardens can be visited for free an it already pays off the visit, but if you want, I'd definitely recommend the tour inside of the palace, it takes less than 2 hours using the Audioguide",Oct 2021

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,This is one of the must see attractions in Vienna. Great palace and amazing interior. Garden is also really nice.,Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We decided to do the self-guided tour of the Palace which meant we could go at our own pace, the ticket included access to the walled gardens and the orangery. The Palace and grounds are stunning. We took the tram from our hotel in the Museum Quarter and it was easy to find our way around. The grounds are extensive so for people not wanting to walk all the way round there is a small 'train' which does the circuit on a hop on, hop off basis for 9 Euros. We did a mixture of a lot of walking combined with the train. We felt we covered everything and were there for almost a whole day.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We went there for a couple of hours and remain for the whole day. It was just perfect! We dis the tour of the palace, kids enjoyed the maze, and then we went to the garden and up to the Gloriette with a wonderful view.
Definitely the best way of spending time",Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"If you're in Vienna it comes highly recommended to spend at least one full day at Sch√∂nbrunn and its gardens. The palace itself is nice to see. The price is a bit high, but the majestic rooms are quite interesting to see. It's certainly more impressive than the Imperial Appartments at Hofburg, especially the ball room. With the audio guide it took me almost one hour to complete the entire tour. As a visitor you have two options, but always opt for the longest one. You will see some special rooms like a hunting room which you won't see with the most basic ticket. And some of these rooms are the finest of the entire palace.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,We took a guided tour of the Schonbrunn Palace as part of a Uniworld tour. The palace is beautiful and we learned some of the history of the Hadsburg family and Empress Maria Theresa. The gardens are gorgeous and were definitely the highlight of our visit. The gardens go on forever! Be sure to take the time to walk through. We visited in September and there were no crowds which was very nice.,Sep 2021

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"The place is great, full of history and cultural, a nice garden and labyrinth, and a beautiful site of the palace and the city at the top of the hill. It‚Äôs a most on your list if your going to Viena!",Oct 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,3.0,"If you are a fan of splendor, baroque and rococo styles - this is yours. We are not fans, so we did not go inside the palace.
We walked in the park - it is huge and crowded.
Despite the distance from the center (7 kilometers on foot) it is convenient to get - by subway. Between the metro station and the palace there is a machine with free water - very convenient. In general, stock up on water in the heat.
Pretty cute Japanese garden, although it's not old Austria of course.
My advice - visit everything in the center - Belvedere, Military Museum, Albertina, etc., and then, if time permits - visit it

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,Such an impressive place and a good audio guide included in the price. The additional charge for the maze and orangery entry isn't worth it as the gardens are so huge you can wander around and not need these additional bits. Certainly get a ticket where you can see the whole house though.,Sep 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,3.0,"In Vienna every place is a palace, the real palace wasn't as impressive as the others. The gardens and the view are very nice. Get only the gardens and palace ticket the all inclusive one is a bit of a tourist trap. In the palace only around 4 rooms are really impressive (out of 40) in my opinion it's only worth a visit if you have enough time.",Sep 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"It‚Äôs not Versailles so keep that in mind when you go. Smaller though the grounds are huge, too much for walking the whole grounds for us. The palace was fine, audio guides helpful. Not too many people fall 2021 with Covid so manageable.",Sep 2021

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"What a lovely palace! We bought spontaneously a ticket. We could take the tour oy after waiting 7 mins. A shame you are not allowed to take pictures insife. We really loved it. The palace is beautiful and there is plenty to see! If you are there, make sure to visit the garden. Take a walk uphil and enjoy the scenery. Definaty worth the hike up!",Sep 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Kind of a must-see/do on any first visit to Vienna. With a palace, a maze, a caf√©, a labyrinth, gardens...there should be something for most people and ages to enjoy.

We opted for the classic pass, which gave us access to:
- 40 rooms in the palace (including the ""millions room"" and more)
- the gloriette rooftop (which provides a fantastic view of the city, and a much better view than if you were to look out from the ground floor of the gloriette due to the trees)
- privy garden
- a maze (which was actually a little tougher than I thought it would be, which made it fun)
- labyrinths (that are more for a younger crowd, I'd say)
- orangery garden (which was the most underwhelming part of the package)

A few tips:
- When hiking up to the gloriette, there's a zig-zag path ""straight"" up in the sun, but there are also diagonal side paths in the shade.
- No big packs/bags in the palace, but you can have a little backpack (think, like, a little track bag size).
- If you do the classic pass, prepare to spend 3-4 hours in all.
- Take your time in the palace--there's a lot to see--and definitely get the (included) audio guide.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Beautiful palace with a great garden for a long leisurely walk.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"You have to visit this place!!!
The beauty of the palace and the gardens around is something you can not imagine!!
Make sure that you have a lot of time to spend there!!",Oct 2020
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,We had a great tour guide and frankly it does boil down to who you get because they give such interesting fun facts about what happened in certain rooms of the palace. Super educational and really gives a lot of insights on the Habsburgs though it focuses more on Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Maria Theresa than the overall royal family.,Aug 2021
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We allowed a day, which gave us enough time to see the main house, some of the gardens, outbuildings and so on. As this place has so many reviews, just 2 points particular to us:
1. Had to come back next day with our son, a keen botanist, to view the greenhouses (separate ticket/ entity); these seemed to close earlier than other parts of the park (may not always be the case, recommend u check).
On that second visit, we walked to Sch√∂nbrunn all the way from down town Vienna. Taking the route we took, where the last part is facing the palace itself (coming down the Johnstra√üe) is disappointing, as the road comes through significantly less attractive parts of Vienna and the views of the palace were less than we had expected. Anyone keen to walk from town to the palace may want to check for a nicer route.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"This place is so large and the gardens so nice you should expect to spend a half day here. Take the guided tour (with a human and not audio guide) if you have the time to spare. Walk the gardens, enjoy the fountains. Grab a quick bite to eat (lunch) at the Gloriette - expect a good view of the city not food that's to stand up and cheer for; but that's not to say it's not bad. Call it average. And continue with the carriage museum and the imperial chapel. Doesn't sound like much? Well, at a brisk New Yorker city pace it took a bit over 15 minutes to get from the Gloriette to the exit of the palace and another 5 minutes to walk to the carriage museum. Throw in all the camera candy and it's more like a 25-30 minute walk. Get the picture now? I arrive at 09:45 and didn't leave until 2pm.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"A truly stunning palace and grounds. Wear comfortable shoes, as you'll do a lot of walking! I arrived early and went to wait for my 10:44 spot at the apartments. It's a remarkably efficient system where everyone has to enter at the exact time on their ticket. Don't be late! This means that even though it was super busy, the apartments were never crowded. The apartments seem to show off the enormous wealth of the family, while still feeling more homey than other palaces I've visited, which makes this a unique destination.

I'd recommend visiting with the Vienna card, so you can do everything you want on the grounds. I stopped in the Apfelstrudel show for a seat, a snack, and some air conditioning, and enjoyed spending 30 minutes watching professionals make apple strudel, with a generous sample.

Don't miss the carriage exhibit. It has a fine collection of carriages, but the real gem is the exhibit on Sissi in the same building. She's a fascinating woman who wielded an enormous amount of influence to raise her children the way she wanted to.

Take advantage of the train to the Gloriette, you'll never make the walk in the summer heat, and grab a reasonably priced sandwich and ice cream with a view. Then you can walk down and stop at the zoo for a quick visit with the pandas.

Wear comfortable shoes and pack water. This day felt like a day at Disney, but was well worth the trip.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"In Vienna there are so many place that you ""must see"" , however even among those there are a few that it is really a pity to not see - one of my personal favorites is the Schonbrunn Palace.
Former summer residence of the Hapsburg house - in the cold seasons the Hofburg was the residence of choice in the center of the city - now a tourist attraction/museum/public gardens complex, etc.
Tickets - dependent on the tour of choice, group, seniors, students, combos with the Hofburg,etc. there are multiple choices and divers prices, but from my perspective it is definitely worth it.
Due to the fact that is one of the most popular tourists attraction in the world try to book your tickets in advance to avoid the queues. Audio had set with a choice of 10+ languages is available free of charge at the entrance.
NO photos inside! - this is a pity but I can understand it. It would be really annoying if everybody was flashing and clicking insanely. However the tour of the royal chambers is really impressive the decorations range from very simplistic and ""spartan"" - keeping the royal connotation though - like in the room of Franz Josef, to real debauchery of cheery wood carved furniture covered with the most expensive natural silks, etc. ... go and be amazed.
Also outside the gardens and the zoo are attractions in their own rights and the thematic expos that are periodically housed on the premises offer a lot of things to check out...
Overall, definitely a must see! place when you are in Vienna ... go enjoy it!

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We visited in the first half of December as a family. My parents, husband and Teenage son and we all had a great time. It is worth making a day trip from Vienna city and exploring the Zoo and doing an activity such as the Strudel show and visiting the Xmas markets if you come in December. The palace itself was fun to visit, very interesting and lots to see, we did an audio tour as well having not much prior info and found this was well worth it. Might be a bit too long with little kids though our teenager was fine. We visited the zoo which was really great, it was cold in December so definitely need to rug up if you visit the zoo in the colder months. The Christmas markets outside the palace were great - lots of food to choose for lunch and mulled wine. The absolute highlight for our family was the strudel show. Highly recommend this- for young or old it was entertaining and a lot of fun. The young man who did the show was funny and engaging. The apple strudel was yummy as well. On arrival we went and got our tickets for the strudel show from the cafe. Then we did the palace tour the Apple show, markets and then walked around the zoo. So a whole day was needed. I can imagine in the warmer months you could spend longer walking around the zoo and kids would enjoy this. There are a couple of ways to get there. Bus or train. The Schonbrunn palace website has the details. Also advise getting tickets beforehand as the lines were pretty long. We bought the Sisi ticket as you can go to the Hofburg as well which we did and the imperial apartments. The grand tour was included in the ticket.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Definitely the best thing to see in Vienna. This is was the Royal's summer house. We did the audio tour which was great! Definitely get tickets in advance on their website....long lines even with tickets, too long without! I'm sure the other option is to go with a private tour guide company as well. The audio tour was perfect for us and our 2 teens.

We went over the New Year's weekend and it was packed. Standard tickets were sold out. But, we were able to get them via the ""Sisi"" package which also included the Hoffburg. If you do this, and go to the Hoffburg, there is a good place for lunch called La Sosta right around the corner from it..try to get a reservation or get there on the early side as they turned people away. At the Schonbrunn, there were many food stands out front (cash only).

My recommendation is to take a taxi to Schonbrunn, and get there when they open. Spend about 90 minutes on the audio tour, then walk up to the gardens in the back. There is also a nice restaurant with a view if you hike up to the top with beautiful zoo.

Overall, plan for at least 2 1/2 hours here, can spend most of the day here if you'd like as there are also other attractions here like the zoo, maze, gardens, etc.

There are a variety of audio tours available. Everything inside is so well preserved. Some of the ceilings are just pure magic cz they are so beautifully painted. My neck hurt badly but I couldn't help gazing at the ceiling in the ballroom. The chandeliers are humongous. There is a gift shop with some amazing stuff. Also pictures inside aren't allowed unless with a special pass to carry the camera maybe.

The story of the palace is comprehensive and had depth. I went outside th palace grounds and at the garden behind the palace and it was immense. No time to go check out the structures on top of the hill or to check put the old mini zoo they had on the grounds because we had to leave to follow our schedule. I still haven‚Äôt perused the brochures I brought but I hope the rooms of the palace were in there. I will check it tomorrow. I wish I could go back because I am sure I missed out buying some souvenirs because it was too crowded to buy much as there were many tourist groups inside the shop.

It is a trip worth making. Include in your itinerary.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We came by without pre-booking and got tickets at the office by the gate. We went to and from the palace using the trains. We didn't have to wait too long for our scheduled time. The palace entrance is to the left side of the main building. We headed to the back area where they checked your ticket. We got the self-tour recordings once we proceeded past the ticket checking area.
The palace was gorgeous. The different rooms were all quite interesting and beautifully decorated. I really enjoyed viewing all the magnificent paintings adorning the wall as well as the roofs of the palace. The recording for the self-guided tour was quite informative and fairly easy to use, just push the appropriate number corresponding to the exhibit you're looking at. It also didn't feel very crowded even though there were quite a few people. We went on the Grand Tour which included a few more rooms compared to the Imperial Tour. Just keep you ticket handy as there was an area which split the 2 tours and you needed your ticket to continue on the grand tour.
There was a market in front of the palace when we went in December and it has an amazing garden out back. It was raining when we went so the outdoor activities were a bit wet but the indoor one was quite enjoyable.

The grounds extensive to say the least and possibly the wrong time of year to visit gardens as even spring flowers were not in evidence making for blandness.

While we didn't have to queue, a person working with the guide did the queuing and we spent 15 plus minutes waiting on her to return with the tickets. Guide padded out the information at front of the palace which was annoying. Spent half the tour time outside the palace when given the time of year, less would have done the job. The inside tour was interesting but we had a large group with two languages being addressed. It appeared to limit the information provided. Also staff vigilant to prevent use of own cameras. Not sure there was value from the guide. Feel audio guide might have provided as much. However a must see if visiting Vienna. Is a good contrast to the Belverdere Palace and Orangery on the other side of the city, baroque in style and full of art.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"One of the many palaces on our list to visit and so pleased we did. Travelled on the local underground from the city centre to get to the palace and wow what a view when you walk into the grounds. We travelled early March and it was a bit nippy but once inside the palace it didn't bother you about the weather outside. There were several options of how many rooms you want to visit, we chose the 40 rooms tour and everything was very striking and lots of information regarding the rooms and plenty of tour personnel to answer any questions you may have. There were no restrictions on taking photos inside the building as well which is good to have all the memories. Becuase it was early March the queues where not bad either so gettting a ticket was not a long wait at all, but you can book on line via Trip Advisor. You also have to visit the gardens which are huge and you could spend all day there. Unfortunately in March nothing is in flower but you can imagine what it is going to look like in the coming months. There is plenty to see and do and you could spend a whole day there if you wanted but you need to set aside at leas 4 hours minimum especially if you are tourijng inside the palace. The audio guide which is free is very worth while as well inside the palace and there is a lot of history to take in. Definitely a place I would go back to as did not see it all and needed more time.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"First Sunday in March needed a fleece and wooly hat. Booked on line, but there was no queue. Choose the Grand tour of 40 rooms. If stately houses interest you, do the Imperial, stunning! Note; the Orangrie is being refurbished. Cost was ‚Ç¨20, ‚Ç¨13 children. No seniors price. Audio guide included. The metro appears to be the best way to travel. At the station use cash (it gives change) or credit card at an easy to operate machine and buy a ticket for ‚Ç¨2.40 each way, or a 24 hr pass for ‚Ç¨8, which i great value. Validate the 24 hr pass on a time stamp on the platform just the once, at the start of the first journey and thats you covered for the day. The station you want is Schonbruun on the U4 line coloured green. Metro maps are everywhere. The Metro is easy to navigate and the locals so helpful. The Palace is opposite the station. When you are finished in the Palace turn right on exit and then another right past the railings and you will see the lovely free grounds that surround with fountains, Folly's, the zoo and walks. We followed the signs and walked 15 minutes to the next station at Heitzing and got the Metro there. This has the added attraction of a MacDonalds with a pastry counter, and a huge Lindt chocolate shop. We went on to the Belvedere Palace. Use the U4 again changing at Karlesplatz to the U1 line to Taub-stummeng. 10 minute walk ot wait for the CAT main line train. The Belvedere is not quite as grand but has a fantastic art collection.

The tour includes a 3 course meal on the property. Drinks are extra but dessert is included.

The concert is in the Orangery Sch√∂nbrunnr. It's a much larger orchestra group than I thought. I guessed a string quartet but there must have been 20 musicians. The had a soprano and baritone singer who were both excellent.
The conductor was both serious and playful. He made the evening quite entertaining.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"Having been to the largely disappointing Hofburg the day before I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but my admittedly modest expectations were exceeded.

The tour is well set out and whilst it is busy, it moves at a reasonable pace.

We arrived at 10.30 am, queued for 20 minutes, and got on a tour at 11.10am which gave us time to drop our bag at the free and efficient cloak room.

We also went in 5 minutes before our timed ticket and it was apparent they are quite relaxed about you being precisely on time.

The palace is full of interesting furniture, paintings etc... and you get a sense history has stood still.

The audio guide is informative but to the point which was very welcome- 1 to 3 minutes commentary per room.

We had Vienna passes which got us the grand tour but unless you are interested in seeing every room you wouldn‚Äôt miss much doing the shorter and cheaper tour.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,A must see visit. We had the Vienna Pass ticket - really good value in itself and includes the ‚Äúhop on hop off‚Äù bus. The palace brings alive the wealth and power of the Habsburgs with an easy but compelling narrative. Can not recommend highly enough. We went to the Strudel Show afterwards and I think you can infer what that involved!,Feb 2020

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,3.0,"The place is an amazing building with beautiful Gardens and so much to see. But the tour of the actual palace is quite poor, no photos are allowed which is disappointing, I could understand banning flashes, also the staff are dressed in plain clothes and hard to identify and just wander around and it feels like they are there purely to tell people off for cameras not to ask questions to or find out a bit more. Finally the two mirrors opposite each other are ruined by an unnecessary piece of perspex. The Place itself is 5 stars the actual experience as a tourist though takes the grade down.",Feb 2020

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Took the advice of a local and bought tickets online and opted for an early start. So glad we did as not too many people around but you could see they were geared up for lots of visitors by the queue system in the ticket office. Luckily our online ticket meant we could go straight to the start of the tour showing our tickets via mobile.

Fascinating seeing how the royal family lived and how the palace was used and decorated. Each room was different and felt like they had just stepped out to let us in.

Well worth visiting the Palm House and the Desert House both greenhouses are huge and totally different climates. Just walking around the Gardens was lovely. There is also a zoo within the grounds that you can also pay to visit. We didn‚Äôt. Small scale and pens a bit small for some animals in my opinion.

Easy to get to via public transport on subway then short walk. Passed bus terminus where all the tourist buses park during peak season. Must get very busy!

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"The palace is very easy to get to by railway from the centre. We got the railway to Hietzing station and then walked through the palace grounds from the entrance near the station to the palace.
We went on the Grand Tour which takes you through many of the rooms.
The best thing about the tour was the audio guide which was issued to each visitor in a language of your choice. It gave a good description of each room and, because you weren't stopping to read notices, you could keep walking and listening.
Don't forget to go around the ""back"" of the Palace. Here there are extensive grounds and many excellent viewpoints of the Palace.

The gardens were closed due to a storm but the palace was very impressive. Took the imperial tour which took us about 2 hours with the audio guide. Very interesting and good displays. Well worth a visit",Feb 2020

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"My wife and I dedicated a day just exploring the glorious Schonbrunn Palace and its beautiful gardens. I would suggest the audio guided tour to relive the history of this place. It was exciting to learn about Habsburgs summer residence and at same time admire its highly decorative interiors and paintings. The tour of the palace can be a bit pricey but it is worth a visit

But for me the highlight of this place was the walk through the gardens and the picture frame view of the palace from the Gloriette. Don't miss the various sculptures located around the Gloriette like the Neptune Fountian and the Roman Ruins. It does get busy during peak hours, so if you looking for great pictures, time yourself well and get there early. I would definitely add this to your bucket list if you plan on visiting Vienna

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We did the Grand Tour using an audio guide. We bought our tickets online and arrived right before they opened so we could tour before the tour buses arrived. Schonbrunn is beautiful (although Versailles is better in our opinion), and the audio guide tour provided enough information for us. The grounds are very beautiful and you can tour the gardens and orangerie in more depth with an additional ticket. If you are in Vienna for a few days, consider getting the Sisi ticket, which also includes entrance to Hofburg Imperial Apartments and Sisi Museum and the furniture and silver collections. We were not able to make it back to see everything lit up at night, but are sure tit would be worth the trip.

It takes a while to walk around the gardens, the visit of the palace itself is at least one hour. I recommend not taking less then half a day to enjoy this attraction. It is worth going up the hill to view the magnificent panorama of the city.",Jul 2019
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"You definitely won't want to miss Schonbrunn Palace if you're in Vienna. It's truly one of the most gorgeous palaces in Europe and it absolutely rivals Versailles (as it was intended to).

It takes about an hour to do the tour with the audio guide, which is very good and informative. The rooms are gorgeous and the grand Hall of Mirrors is astounding. Leave at least another hour for walking through the gardens and extended grounds afterwards.

The first time I visited was in early April and they have a lovely Easter Market set up in front of the palace. From what I understand they do a Christmas Market as well. That would be very lovely to see if you visit in December.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"It's obviously the main tourist attraction in Vienna and deserves the top spot. We did the Grand Tour which has 40 rooms to be seen and that also had the free audio tour which gave a nice piece on each room. Though it can be hard to remember which empress is being talked about!.
The pricing is not too bad for an expensive city and it is true that if you have visited many other royal palaces in other cities you could give this a pass but that does not mean to take anything away from it.
If visiting in summer I would imagine that the grounds alone would make the visit worth it.

The tour itself is about an hour long but you can spend as long as you like walking the grounds and up to the Gloriette arch above the Palace.

If you are on a hop-on/hop-off bus tour do factor in the times you have allotted for each stop you wish to make because a few hours can pass by rather quickly and suddenly the day long tour you have paid for will only get you to a couple of attractions if you go into each one.

But regardless a visit and tour of the Schonbrunn Palace is highly recommended.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"Due to the time of year we were able to visit without the crowds. The audio guide of around an hour was just right and very useful.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"The palace is worth a visit. Its a little way out of the city but with the hop on hop off bus its very easy.
This is included in the vienna pass, worked out well for us as we only wanted a little walk around without spending the full ticket price. I think its around 20 euros on the door. The gardens to the rear are very nice. I imagine it would be beautiful in the summer. Quick tip - the ticket booth is just inside the main gate on the left, don't walk down to the main palace as you'll be sent back. (like us !)",Jan 2020
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"The place is truly huge and imposing as you approach. A Christmas market filled the foreground court yard. The queue of Chinese tourists trying to buy tickets for the inside tour was long so we opted to look at the gardens for free.

My first thought were ‚Äúhow spectacular ‚Äú as I saw the lines of rose pagodas trailing off into the distance, at the side of the palace. But the view at the back of the palace is utterly spectacular as you turn in from the rose garden. Acres of sculpted grass and flower borders, with a huge marble pool and statues framing the lower ground tier. Then, a grand proscenium of granite on top of the facing hill, overlooking the whole vista. The scale of this design is hard to fathom.

You can wonder around the whole landscape. There‚Äôs a zoo in the grounds too. At the hill top, you get a view of the whole Vienna roof-line.

I‚Äôll be back to look inside the palace and see the beautiful rose gardens in summer bloom.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"The Hapsburgs ruled Central Europe for so many centuries and the last 150 years from this palace. Much like what Versailles is to France, Schloss Schonbrunn is to Austria. For me this may have been the best Palace in Europe. It is more modern than Versailles but still Napoleonic enough to be of that great palace era. The tour is great and you get to see all the rooms. We hired a guide just so we could see the high points and keep moving. He, Marco Pongratz-Lippitt, was great and it allowed us to skip the line and maximize our visit.

The only thing I did not like is you could not take pictures. Otherwise the grand halls, the artwork and the great salons were all amazing. It really gives you the picture of Vienna at its world-wide height before WWI and the collapse of the empire. For me this is a Vienna MUST SEE.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"Even in mid-winter the palace was busy: I hate to think of the crowds in the summer peak season, although in summer a lot more time could be spent in the gardens and visiting outer buildings.We did the ""Grand Tour"" which adds the private apartments of the Emperor's family to the state rooms of the ""Imperial Tour"". For the small additional charge, take the Grand Tour if you have time: I particularly enjoyed the private rooms which tend to have been modernised over the centuries and so give an insight into the last few decades of the Habsburg dynasty. The audioguide worked well and kept descriptions short, no doubt trying to hurry visitors through the rooms in order to meet demand. There is not much original furniture left in the palace, which gives the state rooms a somewhat spartan appearance despite the ornate wall and ceiling decorations. Again I suspect this is done to speed up the visit. After doing the palace itself, we took an icy walk to the Gloriette which is worth it just to get an idea of the layout of the grounds and the siting of the palace, Schonbrunn is one of the great European palaces, along with the likes of Versailles, the Alhambra, and Blenheim, and although it does not have their architectural flair, it is a must if, like me, you know little about the Habsburgs and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and want to fill that gap in your knowledge. Tourist tip: avoid the pay-toilets in the ticketing building - use the free ones in the adjoining restaurant building.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"It is a lovely palace to see - if you are not going on a guided tour, audio guide is a must otherwise you'll miss all the facts about the palace and the way Habsburgs lived. We got there relatively early, 9:30 entrance and it was a good choice, since the crowds afterwards were a lot bigger. If you can, get there even earlier. Most of the rooms are rather small, and the path that you can use to walk trough them is not meant to take in a lot of people. Having too much people around you could ruin your experience. It would be good if they did a better time management of groups they let in. Maybe to let in one group every half an hour or so, because if you have two groups close to each other it is already very very crowded.

This portion of land, however, didn't always house such grand lodgings. The original Katterburg mansion, used primarily as a hunting lodge on the country estate, was joined by a palace built between 1638 and 1643 at the behest of Eleonora Gonzaga, Ferdinand II's widow. It's during this time the estate was referenced as ""Sch√∂nbrunn"".

The Sch√∂nbrunn Palace's neoclassical style seen today occurred between 1740‚Äì50 after Franz I gifted the estate to empress Maria Theresa on their wedding day.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"We took the full tour, including the private rooms, and did the audio tour. The palace was huge, it was an incredible mix of history, architecture, and personality. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour, though the walking spaces through the rooms doesn‚Äôt really encourage taking time to really look deep. We were kept at the same pace as everyone, as it was uncomfortable to take more time in one room due to the lack of space and how the tours are scheduled by time. It isn‚Äôt a leisurely trek, it‚Äôs a bit rushed. I was also disappointed that the tour didn‚Äôt include the kitchen‚Äôs or any other part of the massive building: it‚Äôs only the state rooms and private quarters. Worth the price of admission, for sure, I just wanted more.
The gardens, however, are an entirely other story. One can spend an entire day here easily. There is a ‚Äútrain‚Äù that runs the gamut of the grounds, like 9 Euro, and it‚Äôs worth it. There are tons of statues and gorgeously manicured gardens that are fantastic to walk through. It‚Äôs pretty heavily wooded so it feels like you ‚Äúfind‚Äù things when you turn corners (the map isn‚Äôt very specific of the grounds) and that adds to the fun of exploring. There is a maze and a labyrinth that are both fun to go through. We spent four or five hours there and could have spent more had we arrived earlier in the day. They closed at 5pm.

The garden is also nice - I would prepare yourself to allot an adequate amount of time for this as the palace is situated in the opposite direction of city center and walking to the top of the hill in the garden is a trip. But I highly recommend seeing this as it captures the Habsburg family history of Vienna.,Jan 2020
Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Although this was not, per se, the Habsburgs' permanent residence, this is the actual palace that you should visit if you are after lavish interiors and historical gardens. Whilst its exterior is quite plain, the insides are magnificent and the audioguide will give you a comprehensive narrative of what you are seeing. My advice would be to get the tickets on their website, and book their grand tour, which gives you access to more rooms to visit. The palace is easily accessible by the underground stop of the same name. Don't miss the gardens, which I think you can even visit for free (the main ones, you will need a separate ticket for the Orangerie).

Tip number 2 - Visit the grounds first. I made the mistake of entering the palace first then venturing outdoors. I could see through the windows that the grounds were almost empty for the start of my visit, but by the time I left people had definitely started to arrive. You can't take photos indoors so as long as the palace isn't packed a few people aren't an issue. Outdoors though the photos do look better with fewer crowds.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,2.0,"Crowding has been mentioned already - so we expected some crowds, but certainly not as much as we encountered (this was on Fri 3rd Jan, 3:30pm). The rooms were beautiful, but difficult to see over the heads of other people (incl. large tour groups). It felt like a busy train station at peak hour. It would probably be better to as much as halve the amount of tickets available (and/or have different times for tour groups) - but then of course it wouldn‚Äôt be as profitable.

I would say - give it a miss if you can (we had already seen Versailles in Paris which was a much better experience), but if this is your only opportunity to see a historic palace then do it but be prepared. :) (possibly try getting there first thing in the morning) Buying tickets online beforehand is a must! Just get there early so that your time slot doesn‚Äôt pass while you‚Äôre waiting in line to enter, and look carefully at which line you‚Äôre in - our line stopped for some time because the people at the front were early, until we figured out we could just go around them and enter.

Also note - photos and videos are not allowed, for ‚Äòsecurity reasons‚Äô. Plenty of other museums allow photos so it‚Äôs unclear why this is - possibly to protect the value of the tickets, though it does help in not making the crowding worse - but it adds to the feeling that this might just be one big tourist trap. :(

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,3.0,"This was by far my least favorite attraction in Vienna. The palace is amazing and the chance to see furniture in situ should be stunning, but the entire event is handled as if a cattle call.

Getting tickets in advance are a must. We knew this and planned days ahead for our timed entry ticket. From the moment you approach the ticket entrance of the palace, you will notice a change in your experience. From inconsiderate tourists who aim for the sides of the doors to avoid those queuing up to enter the building in an orderly fashion to the general scrum forming at the ticket scanning area (where they first check that you have tickets for when you are entering) to actual gate ticket scanning which should occupy many lanes but had no indication they were open. Once through there you face two lanes - one which queues you for the audio guide and one which avoids it. Unfortunately you are not told which is which. We tropically do not do audio guides, counting instead on signage within the exhibits to determine where we spend our time. THIS WAS A MISTAKE. Not all rooms had signage, and those that did were limited to only ONE sign which in some cases was placed in an area which made it impossible to read without blocking traffic. So maybe the audio guides would have been better. But the time anyone spent in each room was minimal. There was a stunning dining room display but the only reason I found it interesting was because the hofmobiliendepot museum covered it in more detail.

The unique aspect of this tour is that you see the layout of the rooms. This can definitely be of interest to some. But other museums offer just as much furniture, costume, decor with far more attention to EXPLAINING it and those museums should garner more of your time.

But it‚Äôs schonbrunn. Everyone should do it once. But don‚Äôt think this is it. Vienna has so much more to offer if you look for it.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"This is a must-visit if you are in or near Vienna!

The former imperial summer residence was such a beautiful place, both the palace and the grand area around it.

The Sch√∂nbrunn Palace used to be the residence of the Habsburg emperors from the 18th century until 1918.

It does not cost a thing to walk the grounds. There is so much garden and paths to walk and areas to explore, but my brother and I walked up to the Gloriette first so that we would get a good view of the palace, and let me tell you, it was incredible. You not only get an amazing view of the palace (great place to take photos) but you also get a panoramic view of the city, AND the Gloriette itself is gorgeous. I‚Äôm pretty sure there were toilets there as well.

We the walked down towards the palace, past the grand fountain and down towards the backside of the palace. When we went around to the front there were myriad of stands selling everything from red hot wine in souvenir mugs to Christmas ornaments and hand carved birds in wood.

It was such a great experience! I recommend this destination to all who plan on visiting Vienna. Keep in mind that we visited during Christmas, and so there might not be stands there at other times of the year, I don‚Äôt know, but I would still go in a heartbeat.

If I only had time to see one ting in Vienna, this would be what I‚Äôd prioritize!

Anyhow, we were able to get in without wait once finding our way in.
The palace was beautiful. It takes a while to walk through the building. We stopped by the Cafe on site which was nothing special. I say not to spend any time and money at the Cafe.

The palace was overcrowede with tour groups that saw us as a group of 4 stuck in a line to walk through rooms. It was dangerously overcrowded, we eventually pushed past the tour groups and had some room to breath, not sure what we missed but if you were claustrauphobic you'd have had a melt down.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"The Palace tour (both the shorter and Grand version) overlapped with the Hofburg Palace tour somewhat. However, the tour provided more visual context for their lifestyles and just more physical space as the layout of the Hofburg Palace and Sisi museum tour is less than desirable.

Either way, I recommend buying tickets online beforehand so you can skip the myriad of lines. Also, when you go into the tour entrance area during the winter, the long line ahead is for coats. Go around!

You can use the podcast app on your phone along with your personal headphones to listen to the tour as opposed to using the handheld audio guides.

Onward, another queue to get an audio guide. The Palace, its rooms and antiquities are interesting and beautiful, but i felt ""cattle-herded"" from room to room so you didn't get to enjoy them. Far too many people, large groups passing in a stampede every couple of minutes. Awful! Wasted 4-5 hours here for essentially a 30 minute rat race.

It is a very nice experience to see the original furniture still in the palace and to hear all the history behind it. If you are in Vienna, this is a definite must see. The entrance to the palace is included in the Vienna Pass if you have bought one. Afterwards we went to walk in the gardens and took numerous photos, just be aware that you do walk quite a distance when you go to the gardens as they are very big. If you want to see green and colorful gardens, you have to go in the summer, if you just want to experience the magnitude and view, anytime is good. If you like to buy memorabelia, there are two shops available with very nice souvenirs. The directions on the grounds are also very good.

Choosing Sch√∂nbrunn was an excellent decision. It never fails to impress. Tours are well organised and run smoothly. We did the Imperial Tour, which is just the right length. I can't see how I would cope with 3 hours walking around on the Grand Tour. If anything, I would suggest improving the audio guided system. It's outdated and needs modernising - Bluetooth to your phone app perhaps? An added bonus on our visit were Christmas markets outside. Always recommend this place. 5 stars!",Dec 2019

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,2.0,"Schonbrunn is worth visiting, as are the gardens. The main problem is sites like this one and Instagram that tell every visitor to go and visit it. It's the goose that was laying golden eggs that's been completely ruined by tourists. The irony is not lost on me I assure you. We visited in December some 7-8 years ago and although the Christmas market was on it was quite busy but pleasnt to get around. We visited,Christmas day, and there were huge huge numbers. And it's not pleasant, they operate a timed entry system so they can maximize the number of visitors the can get through evening them out. But this means you can't linger. You wouldn't be able to linger or wander anyway, you get shoved out of the way by tourists. And if there is a couple of tour groups as well as individual visitors they are all crammed through the rooms and passages.
It's a very unpleasant experience and it gets worse throughout the year. We talked to our guide and this is the low season. There's many other nice palaces in Vienna, save yourself a day or half a day of queueing and go visit one of those.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"Vienna's greatest palace might not compare with the lavish grandeur of Versailles or St Petersburg but it is still a treasure trove for history buffs. The rooms include Sisi and Franz Josef's bedroom as newlyweds; the very room where the widowed Franz Josef died in 1916 after a 68-year-reign; and the stunning Great Gallery--one the grandest spaces in Vienna--where President Kennedy met with Nikita Khrushchev in 1961. My favorite was the Mirrors Room, where a 6-year-old Mozart performed for Empress Maria Teresa in 1762 and ended his performance by jumping into her lap and hugging her. You can learn all these stories by renting the excellent audio guide, which is an absolute must as there is only basic information displayed in each room.
If you are more interested in visual beauty than history, then you truly must get the Grand Tour ticket, instead of the less expensive Imperial Tour. For 4 extra euros (currently) you get to see up to 18 additional rooms including the most beautiful in the palace at the end of the tour. This is the only area of Schonbrunn that compares favorably with the other great palaces of Europe, and where I found myself walking open-mouthed from room to room. The Porcelain Room, the walnut Lacquer Room, the Gobelins Room: each room is beautifully covered with the material after which it is named. You will be surprised and dazzled.
My only disappointment when I visited in March was that I could not see a few of the rooms on the main floor and those on the ground floor because of restoration, but I guess that must be expected at a palace that must constantly be kept in good shape. The gardens and park are lovely, and if you wish to see those as well, plus some of the zoo, you must allocate an entire day to Schonbrunn.

The main hall inside the palace is a stand out on the tour but I think that is the main reason why you would do the tour with the audio guide.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"We joined the Grand tour online, which is 40 rooms out of 1400 rooms, one could choose the cheaper tour of 20 rooms, but I recommend the extra 20 rooms, duration is about 60 minutes. Cost was Eur 24 for English, with limited history knowledge, the take away for the palace is for a bunch of emperors and queens to enjoy during summer. Some queens had many children, like 14-16 could not really remember. Some died very young, so life is probably fair from normal civilian point of view.
Some rooms well well decorated, while some decoration is worst than my hotel room. The guide is of course very knowledgeable, and spoke with presumably a German accent, giving the English tour a exotic foreign touch.
Visiting the Garden is free, just go from the right side or the palace, where tons of tours just bypass the rooms and go for the free garden visit.
This details and decoration of Schonbrunn could not be compare with the Versailles, but for 3-4 hours from the start to end, this is highly recommended.

If you're happy to make your own way around the palace, with either a printed guide or audio guide, then, despite the queues for tickets, you don't have to wait long for access. The palace, both inside and out, is stunning, but you need to see it for yourself to appreciate it. If you can, make the effort to visit. You're unlikely to be disappointed.",Dec 2019

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"I can't recommend highly enough a visit to the outstanding Children's Museum. My eight year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself. Before entering the museum itself, there is an area where both children & adults can dress up.. fantastic fun. Children can sit in a sedan chair, ride on a rocking horse & sit on a throne.
Once in the museum itself, she loved looking at the exhibits themselves, but especially the fact that there were so many fantastic interactive things for her to do, from dressing wigs in one room, playing with toys that Hapsburg children would have had & most especially the dining room.
We all enjoyed the Imperial Tour in the palace. It takes roughly 40 minutes. Just right for young children, any longer and boredom set in.
Great place for adults & children alike.

1:38 p.m. It's timed entry into the palace. It took about 1.5hrs to see the state rooms and then we walked around the gardens for about an hour. We walked up to the Gloriette which is another large structure on the palace grounds. Beautiful view of the palace end of the rest of Vienna from up there! There are many more out buildings to see on the palace grounds but since it was December we didn't explore the rest of them or the zoo.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"I did the Grand Tour, and I think the extra rooms you see are worth it, compared to the Imperial Tour. I visited Hofburg a few years ago, and Sch√∂nbrunn was very similar in terms of the experience you get (i.e. getting a sense of how the royal family lived). I would probably recommend Sch√∂nbrunn over Hofburg if you only do one, because I felt it was even grander - and you also have the gardens to explore too.

Though we were all pretty exhauated after a long flight we still wanted to make a visit to the palace as our first sightseeing and cultural exploration in Vienna. Would not regret making the decision as the exhibition, weather and environment was beyond elegant, grand and most importantly very historically relevant and realistic. Many of the imperial rooms are very well preserved and the audio guide helped a lot in understanding all the artifacts that were displayed. Highly recommend visiting though it was quite crowded during peak hours as we visited during summer times.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,4.0,"As an Englishman who has visited Buckingham Palace, you always feel like you have to compare to our nations Palace. However this beautiful building is steeped in history and offers a fantastic lesson on the background in Austria.

I would highly recommend that you receive the audio guide, because everything is in German as you guide your way through the rooms. It was a very busy afternoon so make sure that you are a patient and take the time to listen to all descriptions. Try not to get stuck behind groups!

The best piece of advice we can give you is to pre-book your tickets. When we got there the queue to get in was a 2 to 3 hour wait. Fortunately we were able to buy a ticket to multiple museums (called the Sisi ticket - ‚Ç¨34, instead of the ‚Ç¨20 standard entrance fee), that meant we could jump the queues(!), but the benefit was that we could also then visit the other Palace orientated museums in the centre of the city afterwards. Which we did.

The imperial tour would seem rather short, so we also recommend that you do the grand tour, which gave further insight and access to some beautifully decorated rooms too.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"After reading and listening to so many ways to arrange this we decided to play it by ear and do it ourselves.

We caught the underground train from Statd Platz which cost ‚Ç¨2.40 each way and took around 15 mins. When exiting the station turn right to the entrance gates.

When through the gates there is a ticket office directly on the left. When we entered there was a queue for people buying tickets however we went to the information desk as we wanted an English speaking guide. A gentlemen advised us of a ticket which cost roughly ¬£43 for two of us with an English speaking guide. He took us straight to the front of the queue and we were served immediately and told to enter the Palace on the left where we meet our guide at a specific time. If we did not book the guide the ordinary tickets had a 3hr waiting time for entry and we had just over an hour with our ticket.

We had a bit of time to kill however the Palace Gardens are free and there was a wonderful Xmas Market to peruse.

The palace and tour was excellent and very informative, far better than an audio guide. The gardens are free to enter and are impressive but the guide explains a lot about them which gives you a much better perspective.

I would say a must if you visit Vienna if your interest in art or history and organising it ourselves saved us around 50% of the hotel price.

It was very busy up there with a lot of coach tours and there is a cafe near the Strudel show which serves the most amazing cakes and pastries.

Unfortunately, today, the experience was truly awful. It was over crowded to a ridiculous extent, making it virtually impossible to see any of the exhibits. There is a timed ticketing system, but it does little to alleviate the overcrowding.

The exhibits look generally tired - as if the curators haven't had any time to look after them. Many parts of the building are in obviously poor condition and the crowds will not help to resolve that problem.

Austria,Sch√∂nbrunn Palace,5.0,"The summer palace of Hofburg dynasty is an easy subway ride on U4 (4 stops - ~10 mins) from old city / district 1 Vienna. There are beautiful gardens on the outside that you can walk around for free (unfortunately, we went in the winter, so no flowers, but you still get an incredible view of the greenery of the palace). The palace tour inside was a neat experience with a self-guided audio guide (which helps explain the history of the rooms as well as some background on the Hofburg dynasty). We did the Grand Tour (all 40+ rooms) - it was only a few more euro per ticket and we figured lets see all of the rooms while there. If you are not in a time crunch, spend the extra 20-mins and do the Grand Tour. Key tip - book tickets in advance online as you need to pick a 15-min slot to enter and it gets very busy at the palace in-person (i.e. if you do it at the palace, you may be waiting for 30-mins to 1hr+ for your time slot after buying the tickets).

From there the plan was to take 2 trams to the Belvedere where we aimed to see the Klimt collection and others. Consequently we took a walk around the gardens and statues at Schobrunn and shopped in the outside Christmas market.
What a wonderful experience we had. Because, it was winter, of course, most of the flowers and displays were missing but all the gardens were set out as they would be in summer. We climbed the hill at the back of the garden to the Gloriette. Absolutely wonderful views to the palace and beyond from there and a coffee and cake inside. The views from the area around the palace up to the Gloriette were equally fantastic, incidentally. If we return, we would probably visit the interior of the palace itself.

Very well organised tourist establishment and has to be as clearly very popular when certainly when we visited it was very busy. Even with this we went on the full tour which was well worth it though a tour that you did not have much chance to stay given numbers.

Gardens are extensive and very organised. They will be stunning in the summer.
Excellent all round facilities as well.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"If Venice is a ""Pearl of the Adriatic"", Salzburg is a ""Pearl of the Alps""! I did not plan to write a review about Salzburg Altstadt (Old Town), because there are almost 9,000 of them on Trip Advisor, but when I opened them - I saw that most are 3-4 line remarks, only a few are larger, and this does not do a justice to such a wonderful place!
So, here are a few more tips if you plan to visit:
- Since I made a comparison, it is as walkable as Venice, and the concentration of culture is incredible for such a compact town.
- I can see many people visit Salzburg as a day-trip, but this makes sense if you are only the history buff (the ancient fortress, old streets and churches).
If you are also a fan of Mozart and classical music, you need an additional day, and if you are a fan of ""Sounds of Music"" - you need one more day for the experience related to the film.
- Once you there - visually you are basically in the 18th century, like a Time Machine, pretty cool (if you go to Steingasse at night, it will be like you are in 15th or 14th century)! The collection of the iron trade signs in front of the Getreidegasse stores is maybe the best you can see (they even have persuaded McDonalds to make one!))
- At the same time, don't forget that Salzburg is much more than Getreidegasse with it's shops: some people say Salzburg is not ""authentic"" anymore, but it is only if you don't step off the tourist routes.
- By the same reason the best authentic meals you will most likely find not in the Altstadt, but away. My best food experience there was on the north bank of Salzach River, in the New Town, and I discovered that Salzburger Schnitzel is better than Wiener Schnitzel (they put mushrooms inside the meat ; )
- What I didn't realize before I came - is how Salzburg is beautifully located at the foothills of the Alps: the panorama from the Hohensalzburg Fortress is magnificent, especially on a sunny day! And it's weird to see from above how no one really wanted to build a home next to the town's executioner's little house - you will see it well standing still alone close to the hill on the south side.
- That's why I also recommend a walk on top of the hill from the Fortress to the Modern Art museum - you will take great photos and can have a beer with the view! But count a couple of hours for this.
- The Cathedral (Dom) is truly magnificent (inside), and I believe when they say it is ""the best baroque church north of the Alps"". The architecture ensemble inside is very harmonious because they built it fast. The spirit of Mozart, who used to work there every Sunday, helps to enjoy the atmosphere. You are not allowed to come and not like Mozart! ))
- If you come in winter, Salzburg is reasonably good base for skiing: there are many ski resorts within 1,5 hours of driving. But remember that during the blizzards you must be careful and the wheel chains on cars sometimes are required by law!
- the underground garage is the best option for a car: it's a little more expensive, but VERY conveniently located.
- So: great fortress, great (classical) music, great schnitzel and schnapps, great skiing - what else do you need?

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"The old town with its old historical buildings and great architecture is very beautiful. On both sides of the Salzach there are countless squares, small alleys, as well as shops, caf√©s and restaurants for every taste.
Everything can be easily reached on foot. Comfortable and relaxed, most things can be easily integrated into a tour of the old town in 2-5 days.

But not only during the day, also in the evening, when it is dark and lit, it is wonderful. A walk along the Salzach. There are many benches that invite you to linger. Music. Nice people. Very worthwhile.

You also have a great view of Salzburg and the mountains when you go to the fortress ""Hohensalzburg"". There you can also go to one of the restaurants / caf√©s and enjoy the view over Salzburg.

Definitely worth a visit. In addition, there are tons of other sights, nature and many other cities in the ""nearby vicinity"".

Even more recent, some parts of the old town was used as the scene for the famous The Sound of Music movie and the streets and shops that Maria and the Von Trapp children passed on the horse cart in the Do Re Mi song are still recognisable now.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,3.0,"First off, I will say that the city is charming and the location is very scenic. The major pedestrian area is what you expect in most cities, and there are attractions in and around Salzburg to keep most folks happy. The reason for my low rating is that Salzburg is no longer as ""authentic"" as I remember it from decades past when I first came there. Tourism is now king and catering to the tourists of upmost importance. The cute little shops of a thriving downtown for locals are now replaced with gimmicky shops (""Christmas"" shops selling ornaments made in China, tee shirt and cheap knick-knack shops) taken over. And while I can understand someone wanting a refrigerator magnet or tee shirt to remember their trip, why does old town Salzburg need a Louis Vuitton store or other similar high-end stores (and these seem to be cropping up in a lot of tourist towns)? They add nothing to the charm or authentic feel to the town. The restaurants, once cute family-run operations serving authentic cuisine, now have menus posted on boards outside showing the flags of the countries whose languages they have menus and serve tourist cuisine serving to the lowest common denominator in expectations. I'm not saying to avoid Salzburg, but the catering to tourists has gotten to the point where the authentic has slowly melded into the ""perceived and expected authentic"" of many tourist areas

There are many tours for the city, including the sound of music tour, which bring you to most of the sites where the movie Sound of Music was cast.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"Salzburg looks best in fine, sunny day. That's without doubt. Colourful Baroque architecture looks best while bathed in sun's rays. Actually, all architecture looks in its best in such a nice circumstances. Unfortunately, we weren't that lucky to see Salzburg in its full glory. We have arrived in the morning, leaving fine weather on the other side of the Alps. Still, or despite the not so cracking weather we have had a really nice time. It is quite hard to describe all this our roaming around its nooks and corners, and that's for very simple reason. There's so much to see. Apart from the Fortress towering over birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, there's twenty seven churches, monasteries, town hall, palaces, squares, passages, boulevards, museums, art galleries and countless number of cafes and restaurants that tempting you to just to have a look, just to nip in. You can wander around there for hours. Interestingly enough, behind all those pastel elevations and opulent facades there's also hidden interesting history reaching very far back in time. As far as Neolithic period, where first traces of human settlements in this area coming from. But first permanent settlements came along with Celts in around 5th BC. It took a while before Roman Empire encroached into their territory and around 15 BC merged them into city called Juvavum, that sixty years later become municipium, and evolved into prosperous town. After collapse of Roman province of Noricum, Juvavum fell into ruin. City's rebirth in the beginning of 8th AD, and its new name of Salzburg, what means Salt Castle (or Town because ""burg"" means either fortress or walled town) is being credited to St. Rupert. With securing its independence from Bavaria in 14th century came prosperity and wealth, and even occasional conflicts could't stop city's rise culminating from late 16th to 18th centuries. Salzburg, being a seat of Archbishops and Prince-Archbishopric of Holy Roman Empire for ages, became a scene of great rebuilding of city centre programme in Baroque style under direction of Italian architects, ordered and supervised by its ruling archbishops. And, which one became, after turbulent years of 19th and 20th centuries, one of the best preserved old towns on the other side of the Alps. That's from Italians perspective. if you're travelling by car it is good to arrive in the morning, leave a car on underground car park, which is quite cheap, and enjoy sightseeing., simply because later on you can have a problem with finding free spot.

Our previous visit, in June 2016, when I had also written a detailed review of this place, and as such, I will keep this one ""short and sweet"".

Not much changes over the years but the place is now cleaner and with some major renovation and roadwork projects ongoing. In fact, on the day of our visit, there was a major religious ceremony and celebration that came with a long road procession, with worshippers and priests moving from one cathedral to another at the other side of the town. It was grand and crowded with many by lookers too.

As it was a public holiday, many shops in the old town were closed for the day (including the factory outlet we were supposed to visit), including the market. Only gift and souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants were opened, mainly catering to the tourists.

Besides the procession, other areas were quite quiet and thus we moved around the many small lanes in peace, those ""hidden gem"" like cafeterias and pastry shops etc. And it's so convenient and easy to walk-around here.

Of course key landmarks like the ""most popular"" chocolate shop, the cafe Mozart used to patronize, including his birthplace building were still crowded with foreign visitors!

It's very nice coming back here to ""see see, walk walk"" and immerse in the Austrian's culture and way of life!

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"Ulrike Koller of guest relations changed our initial room,(which had stairs to the bathroom) to a wonderful and comfortable room with no stairs. As we are an older couple, this really made our stay more comfortable. She assisted us with our luggage and even walked to the area where our driver had brought us to assist us with our luggage to hotel. Our room had a refrigerator and welcome drinks and snacks. We received a welcome gift with soap, chocolate, drinks, and a welcome gift. There were delightful magazines and books to read. The tv and WiFi were good and the shower perfect. The hotel is in an excellent location to explore Salzburg. It is on a lovely walking street with shops and near many options for food. The restaurant at the hotel had wonderful food with an inside and outside eating area. We ate there twice during our stay and the food was delicious and the service excellent. We have never experienced better guest relations than with Ulrike Koller. She made us feel well taken care of and very much at home at the Goldgasse Hotel. Thank to all the staff.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,4.0,"The most popular place in Salzburg but in terms of old towns, there are lots of equally attractive ones in the rest of Europe. They all become too similar, but we left realising Mozart's affiliation and the gorgeous mountain backdrop gives it the distinction and promise it deserves. The usual pastel colours, cobbled streets, squares, boutique shops, passages and courtyards are in attendance and give it that 'welcome to Salzburg' tag. You have the choice of walking inside the old town or the river side to appreciate different appearances. Very expensive whatever you want to purchase, but the more you come away and the cheaper life gets.
Very nice how the mountainous region dominates the area and summer nights are great when the town is lit with promenade vendors present. The whole area is clean, very safe but if you want to park your car and not get ripped off then you'll be able to find a underground solution about 10 minutes walk away...

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"My Honey Bee and me were in Salzburg this Christmas; I had seen pictures of the large equestrian frescos at this site but wasn't certain of it's location. We stumbled across it while searching for the Monchsberg lift. It is, I think, a former horse bath where those arriving from a dusty road could scrub up their ponies before calling upon their city friends. It is strikingly beautiful and across the street is the Sound of Music museum which illuminates the difference between the real Von Trapp family's story and the Hollywood version. A must for any aficionados of the movie; give them both a look if you find yourself in Salzburg. If I see you there I'll sing a verse or two of Edelweiss for you. ENJOY!

Here are some other tips: Find the new university building ""Unipark"" and take a look inside. There's a great library downstairs, a nice canteen and THE best terrace on top (take a picture of the fortress from the ""unknown"" side). Next to the Museum of Modern Art there is a path through the forrest which leads to the Humboldt Terrace. Take a beautiful picture there and just sit and listen to the city.

There are gorgeous gardens, quaint streets and incredible views. Lot‚Äôs of good places for a casual cup of coffee or traditional Austrian meal. So many people try to experience Salzburg on a day trip or rush to check the key sites off their list. Salzburg really opens itself up to you if you slow down and take a few days to explore it.

The charm and pleasure of Salzburg is you can literally walk everywhere and it is easy to get off the beaten path. You can stroll along the river or explore the narrow alleyways. If you are feeling up to it, do yourself a favor and get up to the ridge line of the hill that runs through Salzburg. There are hiking trails that connect the fortress and abbey to the modern museum.

Surprisingly a lot of tourists for November and sometimes that's annoying but it must be a lot worse in summer. Are there a lot of shops -- yes like any medieval old town -- but I love the interesting metal signs here, the various passageways and the mountains all around. Don't want to look at shops head up to Kapuzinerberg park, Mirabell Gardens and take a walk along the river. Oh yeah there are horse drawn carts you can ride - these are common in most European cites -- you should know horse poop smells! You should also be aware in winter many European cities protect their fountains by draining them and covering them -- if you are lucky they will be covered in something transparent but sometimes they are covered in wood.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,3.0,"To be honest, the old city of Salzburg is not very attractive area to walk around. The main Platz is gravel with a dozen horse drawn carriages for tourists and they smell.

There was construction going on in a lot of places and some of the main statues and fountains are now covered in a glass and steel structure to protect them from idiotic tourists who have to climb on things to take selfies.

Every place in the altstadt‚Äôs narrow street is a store selling to tourists and lots of brands that you see everywhere. The entire place is just one store to sell a watered down, disneyfied version of what the city was at one time. Too bad.

A very interesting smaller cemetery, Petersfriedhof. Mirabell Gardens is quite nice. We tried the special Mozart sphere chocolates from Furst which is made there, but they were just okay for me and my wife did not care for them.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,4.0,"We spent three days in Salzburg, which is very easily accessed from the airport via the cheap streetcars No. 2 or No.10. The old town is split into two major sections, one each side of the river and linked by several bridges. Both areas offer plenty of interest to explore on foot via the extensive pedestrianised areas - much of the history relates to former resident, W.A. Mozart.

There are many fine buildings, monuments and plazas to enjoy and although the City does seem to have perfected the art of squeezing entry fees from visitors, there are some that can be enjoyed for free.

Salzburg also offers plenty of attractions for shoppers and those seeking food or refreshment.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,4.0,"Salt Fortress, or by which it is more commonly known, Salzburg (Old Town) is a walking town.

The main area of Salzburg is the historic centre known as Altstadt, which was listed in 1996 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was only a 10 min walk from our hotel.

It is a beautiful part to explore, being just under 2.5 sq Km‚Äôs in size, easy to walk around (Cars are banned from the streets) and has many things to see over a few hours. I got to have for lunch a traditional Austrian Veal Weiner Schnitzel, with cranberries and parsley potatoes, which was divine at the many local restaurants.

We saw just about everything that is to see in a few hours and worth the walk. The town has lovely Baroque architecture and way too many churches, abbeys and a Cathedral for the size of the town - about seven I think all up.

We saw and ‚Äòselfied‚Äô outside Mozart‚Äôs birth house and where he grew up, visited the cathedral, the cemetery (which was very pretty if cemeteries can be), walked / shopped along Getreidegasse, is one of the oldest streets in Salzburg, visited the Mozart bridge which was used in The Sound of Music and also the famous Hohensalzburg Fortress, which over looks the Old Town and is one of the largest castles in Europe.

Whether you are staying in Salzburg or just stopping by for a few hours to break up a trip, worth doing the 3 hours walk around.

This area is very expensive and people there are not very helpful. I drove into Salzburg from Munich, Germany. As you enter Austria there is a sign of ""Zollamt"" on the highway but no clear sign in English for the toll payment. There are no toll booths, nothing. As you exit the highway, Austrian police stops you and they demand 120.00 to 2000.00 euros fine for not paying the toll. I tried to explain to them that I am from US, renting this car from Germany, all the signs are in German but they don't care. Apparently, all foreign registered cars suppose to buy some kind of toll voucher. Just be careful and do not drive into Austria.

This is not a car-friendly place, but they have modern parking garages built into the cliff sides. Park your car and enjoy walking around.

Yes, the origins of Salzburg are related to salt, which was a valuable commodity in ancient times. Wealth from the salt trade contributed to the building of the castles, churches and other buildings that are still noteworthy.
Water is another basic commodity that played a significant role in the town's history. The waterwheel in Kapitalplatz is a part of a canal system that has brought water to Salzburg from Berchtesgaden 16 miles away since the 13th century. The weekly Saturday streetflooding is credited for sparing the residents from the plague that killed millions in the 14th century.

After 10 mins waiter was heading to couple right next to us who had just sat down. We asked him if we could order. He looked down his nose at us and said. NO!
So we went to three more cafes before we could get something to eat!
Group walked back to bus. 50mts from bus, driver starts engine for air con as its 35c outside(heatwave conditions here). Parking monitor runs to bus and demands bus be turned off!

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"If Walt Disney were to create a fantasy city that summoned up everything we would like about a charming Bavarian city, he would create Salzburg, specifically the Aldstadt, or Old Town. You can walk the entire Aldstadt, every street, in under an hour. From very building hang the iconic wrought iron signs. The views are precious. Above it all sits Fortress Salzburg, accessible by a funicular railcar. Concerts are held in the ancient Fortress virtually every night.
For the well-informed, the Aldsatat is mainly Mozart. He was born here on the main drag, the Getriedegasse. There is not a spot on the planet so devoted to the memory of one person as is Salzburg to Mozart. Lest you think it is mere commercialism and kitsch, it is not. Mozart remains perhaps the most ineffable artistic genius that has ever lived, and one feels his presence in this charming town.

Streets such as Steingasse and Getreidegasse are delightful. The former, once the premier thoroughfare to the south, a route for the transport of the white gold, salt, that was the main source of the city's wealth.

Churches and the Dom were wonderful. Franziskanerkirche with its great Gothic features and Collegiate Church with its vast interior were most impressive.

We enjoyed the public modern art pieces, including Radfahrer, Caldera, Awilda, Connection, Gherkins and Awilda. The Wetterstation Meteorological Pillar, dating from 1888, is a gem.

The Salzburg Christkindlmarkt, as it is known today, has a unique and festive atmosphere that draws numerous visitors and is also very popular with the locals. If you don‚Äôt enjoy Christmas shopping with your wife, just have a couple of cups of the mulled wine and it will all seem a little better.

The shopping options are expensive but fun to window shop. I was disappointed to see that a genuine pair of Lederhosen run about 500-900 euros. Expect to spend around 5euros for a .5 liter beer and 20 euros for a dinner. There are slightly cheaper options for food but 15-25‚Ç¨ is the average (not including drinks). We had a great time having some beers and people watching.
If you would like to find some cheaper options for food try walking across the river and checking out some of the delicious street vendors and small restaurants.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"Salzburg's Old Town is a beautiful place to spend a day or two or three. Avoid the city (and very commercial Sound of Music) tours and do it yourself. Salzburg is very compact and easily walkable. Depending on available time, my must see sites in order are the Dom Quarter museums, the Cathedral, St Peter‚Äôs (including the cemetery and catacomb) a peek in a couple of churches (Kollegienkirche and Franziskanerkirche), at least one of the two Mozart houses and a trip up the M√∂nchsberg cliffs (or the Fortress) for views over the city. Take a stroll through the many squares and hidden streets to admire the architecture, do some shopping (Getreidegasse or Gstattengasse) or stop off for a beer or coffee at one of the many cafes. They are currently working on the Residenzplatz to renovate the paving front of the cathedral but this will be completed soon. Top Tip if you are staying a few days ‚Äì buy the Salzburg card.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"Great place to go for lunch or dinner. The night we went it was beautiful weather so everyone was out in the beer garden. However the interior rooms were full of character and would have been equally nice. It was also very affordable for a family. You simply walk through the interior hall and pick you food items. (We got a bunch of stuff to share) The pork knuckle was by far the best thing, although I know it might sound a bit off putting for some ;). Then you bring the food to your table and go and get your beer. I love, love, love that the beer all over Austria is still served in steins. No plastic solo cups thank goodness! It‚Äôs not only better for the planet but it really makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a true Bavarian beer garden. It‚Äôs about a 10-15 min walk from downtown Salzburg but worth the bit of extra effort. Enjoy!

However Alststadt refers to the entire old town section of Salzburg on both sides of the river which is on the UNESCO list. Salzburg is actually one of our favorite places in Europe and we have been there three times and would definitely return. There are a wonderful variety of churches, restaurants, shops etc but it is the historic charm of Salzburg that we are in love with. On this trip to Salzburg we were there during a national holiday and there was an antique car race and exhibition going on which was lots of fun.

Many major sites are here: the Cathedral (Dom), the Residenz, St Peter's cemetary, catacombs & church, and more.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"You know Salzburg is a beautiful city and worth of a visit already. I will just point out a few things for your consideration.

you might want to avoid coming here during some kind of festival (unless you are attending the festival). We visited during the week of the Whit-sun Festival (I think there is a Whit-sun Music Festival, not sure of dates , in addition to the religious one for Pentacost which we ran into). The place was a total zoo. The Cathedral was completely rigged with TV screens and speakers. All our hope of witnessing a nice Sunday mass with music gone to smoke. Lodging was difficult to find. We had to book a place more expansive and a bit out of the way.

I suggest that you go to the area around St Sebastian church for dinner. There are a lot of good restaurant on Linzegasse. The ones in the Old City - no so much. Linzergasse is just a short walk from the Old City. Beside the quality of the kitchens there, the atmosphere of the area in the evening is much more lively and charming.

Don't take your dinner at the Panorama Restaurant up there by Festung Hohensalzburg (the castle) - lunch may be. They will be too occupied with the ""Dinner and Concert"" crowd (there is a concert nearly every night in the castle). Thinking about a view while you dine? Not inside the restaurant's dinning room, unless you get a table by the window. Besides, the food is lousy and the service is bad.

If you are a serious music lover and hope to take in a couple of concerts, you had better do some serious research about concert offerings way before hand. There are 2 long running concert series, one in the Castle, one at the Marabell Palace. We went to the one in the Castle 30 years ago. (Some 10 years into this series). Back then, there is no such thing as ""Diner and Concert"" Concert started earlier and the program was more hefty. The group performing then was the Mozart Quartet. It was great. Now the program is geared toward the tourists - Strauss' waltz, Mozart's Little Night Music, and the like. I am not knocking the capabilities of the musicians, just a bit disappointed at the program. There are other concerts. but likely will be available for specific dates. If the performer is of noted reputation, tickets will probably be difficult to come by.

Visitors from English speaking countries be aware -some tour guides from Panorama Tour kind of snicker at tourists that go on the ""Sound of Music"" tour. Despite of the fact that it is their most popular tour - at least 3 big buses full every day. ""The Austrian people don't know about Sound of Music"", a guide from another tour declared - ""only the English speaking people"". I am of Chinese heritage and though that tour a bit silly myself, but I was taken aback.

Personally, I think you should give Salzburg itself (not counting excursions to the Lakes or Hallstatt) at least one full day. Go up to the Castle for the great view of the city, wonder the lanes of the old town, visit the cemeteries (both at St Peter and St Sebastian), take a stroll by the river on the pedestrian walk, and savor the beauty of the city.

There are bucketloads of museums to visit - there's an interesting exhibition on the Anschluss & book burnings etc, az well as a great section on music & musical instruments in the aforementioned Salzburg Museum; the toy museum - Spielzeug Museum - is great; Mozart's birthplace is worth visiting; Haus der Natur, the natural history and science museum is very good and you've got two modern art museums in the same area - all within 10-15 minutes walk of Mozart Platz.

If you're into Sound of Music, there's loads of locations to visit - the fountains behind the Dom, the view to the castle from the Museum der Modern, Mirabell Gardens (only a stop or two away on the buses).

It's well worth investigating the Salzburg Card - available as a 24hr, 48hr and 72hr card, where you have free entry to just about every museum in Salzburg, including the funicular up to the castle and the lift to the Museum der Modern, as well as free public transport.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"I normally don't bother with the all-inclusive tourist cards as they can work out quite expensive, but some quick sums soon showed that it was well worth getting a 72 hour Salzburg card for 38 euros. You can buy these for shorter times as well. They are sold at the tourist offices (Mozart Platz or the railway station) and the time starts the first time you use it. It gets you free entry into all the main attractions in Salzburg old town, including a 40 minute boat ride on the river - definitely worth doing- as well as free transport on the buses. This was useful for getting back to the airport.
Over 2 1/2 days, seeing a couple of attractions per day plus the boat, I would have spent 70 euros without the card.
The top ten attractions in the guide books are pretty much the ones to go for- especially the Fortress, the catherdral and the Dom Quartier.
The Museum of Modern Art has great views over the city, and the building itself is interesting but the exhibitions were disappointing.
The main museum had some very wordy exhibitions but the one on music was fascinating, with lots of old instruments alongside video clips of modern day musicians playing them.
A pre-booked concert in the Mirabelle Palace (booked on-line a few months before we travelled) was great. They take place regularly and I would think you'd be able to pick up a ticket on the night.
Overall, a great place for a short break.

Austria,Salzburger Altstadt,5.0,"The old town is so beautiful in its neoclassical perfection gazing on it from across the Salz River, and it is completely humane to stroll through. It's not big. It's more or less flat. It's reasonably easy to orient on the cathedral. And if you find yourself suddenly slightly lost, you'll probably wander on something wonderful to see. Technically, you can only go so far before you come to a cliff-face or the river. Go ahead! Wander and enjoy.",May 2017

The scenery was beautiful. Walking along the bridge and touring the old town was indeed something unforgettable and peaceful even in peak seasons. Of course, there were lots of historical sites and buildings worth to see.
Do not too focus on 'The Sound of Music' as there are also many other joyful things to do like going to the mountains and salt mine.
However the atmosphere was a bit commercial sometimes and this might not be avoided by a city depending on tourism.

Hot wine, bratwurst, roasted chestnuts, all make for festive fun. The only negative of going in the winter is that the beautiful fountains are all closed down and boarded over to protect them from the winter weather. So one misses some of the beauty that is available to tourists at warmer times of the year. HOWEVER, we love going at that time of year. Munich was much the same, but had it's own unique places, as well. Wish we had more time than three days there.

On a clear day, these views are unbeatable. The interior of the castle offers some rather impressive rooms (the delicate woodwork is especially noteworthy).
We did not like the fact, however, that the organization of the interior museum has been recently rearranged, such that now you cannot exit after simply visiting the archbishop's rooms, and you need to make your way through the entire military museum as well - even if military artifacts are the last thing on your mind, and even if, in these COVID times, you'd rather minimize the time you're staying at a crowded indoor space.

With all that, they kept the lines moving and it was a quick and fun trip to the top. There were several ways you could go at the top. The views outside were fantastic.

Due to several bad reviews I decided against the castle and the museums, so I can't comment on that.

But the view alone is worth the few euros.
I would allow 1-2 hours for the drive and the view. With lunch or a drink, more likely 2-3 hours.
It is possible that all seats in the restaurant are occupied. You are well attended. The places by the castle wall are particularly popular. Wait a moment and hope that someone will leave soon.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,This is a must visit when in Salzburg. You can choose to either climb up or take a tram up. I chose to take a tram up and go by foot on the way down. This was a very well preserved and big fortress and has spectacular panorama views over Salzburg as well as the alps. Highly recommended to stay till afternoon to get a bit of the setting afternoon sun.,Jan 2020
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,The tram up is an easy ride and brings you back in time. Plan on spending all day at this attraction.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,2.0,"After first being told the tickets we had purchased were for another castle, we bought new tickets as we were holding up the long line. But after double checking, I knew we had the right tickets. It then took 15 minutes of trying to explain that the tickets were valid. To be fair, we had not realised the need to print the voucher (it's 2020 people, there's really no excuse for a tourist attraction not to be able to scan a barcode on a smart phone, especially when it is the #1 attraction in the city!).

It was only after one of the agents saw the Viator logo that they accepted the tickets were valid. Even if we had printed the voucher, it is difficult to see how this would have helped as the barcode could not be scanned by the scanners at the gate, so we would have had to line up anyway and exchange the voucher for tickets, which kind of defeats the purpose, especially as the cost is marginally higher than tickets purchased directly at the counter.

As for the fortress itself, it was OK. Like many other reviewers, I felt the displays a bit unimaginative and lacking, and the state rooms were definitely underwhelming. High points were the view over the city and nice terraces to have a coffee or bite to eat. In theory both could be accessed without buying tickets for the funicular or the fortress, so unless you have a particular interest in high level texts about military and castle life in the middle ages through to the end of WWI (oddly, for all the military focus of the site, there is not a single mention of WWII), there's not a lot to recommend this package.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,Must do when you are in Salzburg. I recommend buying ticket online. It is little cheaper than at the desk and you save time avoiding cues. My advice is to purchase all-inclusive ticket so you can visit apartments to get acquainted how magnates lived hundreds years ago. There is also interesting expositions of arms and uniforms inside.,Sep 2020
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,3.0,"This castle dominates all of Salzburg and its surroundings from way up high. The best (read:easiest) way there is by a funiculaire.
Also it is best to get a combined ticket, as the most interesting rooms (especially the ""gold room"") are extra, and once you are up there, it is best not to have to buy extra tickets.
For the kilometers of walking through rooms and outside area, there is little to see inside as to furniture, artifacts for the roaming time it takes.
On the other hand, the view is stupendous.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Entry to the castle was about ‚Ç¨12 each as we didn't want to see the staterooms (a few ‚Ç¨ extra) but even so we actually spent about 3 hours there.
Unusually, the castle was actually owned by the Archbishop rather than a secular magnate and I think I read it was never actually captured. It was originally just a Roman watchtower and then expanded through the eleventh to fifteenth centuries to the huge structure it is today. When you see the height and sheer face of the rock it is built on it is not easy to see why the site was chosen.
Inside there were various museums on the history of the castle, medieval music, weapons and armour, medieval childrens games and the Archduke's Foot Regiment. Although I'm sure it sounds like purgatory to some we actually spent nearly 3 hours exploring the various rooms. The panoramic photo terrace was just magnificent. The land is so flat and then the mountains just rise up from nothing, quite spectacular.
We were absolutely baking from the end of the visit, not helped by having to wear masks. We sat on the cafe terrace overlooking the town and I indulged in an iced coffee with ice cream and double cream while Deb had her penitent black coffee. Suitably refreshed we took the funicular down the hill and then ambled through the town.

The Funicular ride up and down was fun, especially for our daughter! The ride was included in the price of the tickets and they were not at all expensive.
There were lots of cool exhibits, lots of cannons, and even a great deal of history and explanation of the fortress.
The Fortress is kind of a mini village. There are quite a few terraces with turrets. And last but not least is the beautiful view of the mountains in the background...so stunning.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"What made Salzburg great was its super defensive position that was anchored by a tremendous fortress on a hill that dominates the city. This fortress was the community's refuge and it never fell. While our family saw it the entire day we walk the city below, my son and I visited the fortress while my wife and daughter did the Sound of Music tour. This may work for your family as well. My son and I definitely thought we got the better end of that.

We had the Salzburg Card, so the ride up the funicular was free. Once on top, the views from the ramparts were amazing, not only of the city but the surrounding mountains as well. While the ramparts are good, there is a tower that is also included in the card that gives you even better views, especially 360.

While there don't miss the fortress itself that has a church and castle and other odd museums like the marionette museum. There is a reason this is number 2 attraction. You simply Must do

The best part about the castle is the festungbahn which is really a fun experience. to reach atop you have to buy festungbahn tickets. The first frstungbahn was built around 1892 as a funicular mode of water balancing, later it turned into a mode of transport to the fortress.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"This is a must visit attraction in Old Salzburg. You can't miss it as it dominates the City skyline and is even more impressive from the inside than out. When we went the little cable railway wasn't working and I can tell you it is a super steep climb. But the climb itself was great with constantly changing views of Salzburg on the way up. When you get to the Castle entrance it costs 11 Euros for an all access ticket. More climbing eventually takes you into the fortress proper. It is set out in a circular route with little access paths leading to the walls on each side. The fortress area itself feels like a little village inside. There's plenty to see and it's very pretty. The history is well explained - actually a religious fortress - and if you like old military kit there is a small military museum section with old weapons and uniforms galore. But perhaps best of all are the views of Salzburg and the mountains. If you can, bring a large lens camera with you because on a sunny day you will not be disappointed. All my photos were taken with an iPhone so there are still sights to capture if you don't have the camera. I have not given 5 out of 5 purely because there wasn't (as far as I could see) anywhere to sit and have a snack or a drink once you get to the top. Otherwise it's wonderful.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"The ‚ÄúGreat White Whale‚Äù of Salzburg, perched on a rocky outcrop, looking every inch a ‚Äúproper‚Äù castle, not some Disney-esque confection. So after consulting the guide book, purchasing the superb value Salzburg Card, (entrance to castle included), we set off for the summit. Well actually, we set off for the funicular railway to the summit, it seemed a long way up and we didn‚Äôt really fancy the trek.

So we made our way to where we believed the base station was but couldn‚Äôt see it. There were quite a few lost souls milling around, also looking confused. The problem was that the ‚ÄúFestungsBahn‚Äù was undergoing maintenance and was closed! It did say so clearly on an illuminated sign outside of the entrance but it was being blocked by the building workers white van. So we had a choice ‚Äì ascend by foot, or not ascend. We chose to walk to the top and to be honest ‚Äì were glad we did.

No doubt the good folks who live in the shadow of the castle and therefore used to the walk, will pour scorn on the toiling tourists struggling up the hill. To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt too bad for two, not very fit, sixty-somethings and before we knew it, we were at the entrance gate. The climbing doesn‚Äôt stop here by the way ‚Äì it just becomes a little more interesting.

Inside, you have enough attractions to keep you occupied for at least half a day. As well as just strolling around the castle grounds, there is a guided tour of the interior that takes you to some of the castle‚Äôs higher (literally) points, as well as the famous Salzburg Bull - a large, semi-automated organ. I would strongly recommend visiting there first, as the tour numbers are limited and even if you cannot get on the next tour, you can book one later on and use up the time strolling around the castle grounds.

The main body of the castle interior includes the museums, as well as the ‚ÄúGolden‚Äù rooms. These rooms are very, very impressive but provided our single disappointment ‚Äì they were not included with our Salzburg Card. I think I understand why. There is a great deal of conservation work going on, to keep these impressive rooms in the condition they deserve to be. This work cannot be cheap, so I consoled myself as we handed over our coin, (about ‚Ç¨6 per person), that this would be going towards a good cause.

I was very impressed with the castle and when I say it was worth the walk to the top ‚Äì I really do mean it.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,3.0,The Castle is basically worth visiting for the view of Salzburg below and for good photos.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Our visit to Hohensalzburg centered around a Classical Concert on Christmas evening. I had wanted to book the dinner and concert, but got to the reservations too late in the season. I was happy to have just gotten the concert tickets!

The tickets included a round-trip on the funicular, which was a bonus. We'd done the trek up the hill to Hohensalzurg the day before - in the daylight and proper shoes - and that left us both a bit breathless. We were heading back up to the Fortress following a filling (and boozy) Christmas dinner, and I didn't like the thought of that trek on a full belly.

We were able to show our confirmation to the man working the funicular desk; he gave us two tickets for the train and pointed us through the door. A funicular was waiting, so we walked on and settled in to wait for the driver. Once he was in, we planted our feet, expecting a slow ascent. NOPE! That thing took off like a shot! I turned around, half-expecting to see a panicked operator, frantically pushing buttons as he desperately tried to slow the contraption down, but again...NOPE!

For as fast as the funicular was going, the stop at the top was smooth and practically undetectable. It was a short walk (in the dark, with a drizzle and bitingly cold wind) from the funicular station to the concert location.

We were in the second row, right at center stage. The seats weren't overly comfortable, but they were good enough for the two-plus hours we were there. I loved the way they'd decorated the space, with the ever-present gigantic ball ornaments and mini-trees. The stage was set for 8 performers, who walked out a bit late.

The music was beautiful, their playing mesmerizing. I can't even begin to fathom the number of hours they put in to practicing together and alone. They were sharp, in sync with each other, and created incredibly transcendent music. I was in awe.

I only snapped a couple pictures of the performers at the end, transfixed as I was by their playing and the story the music was telling. It was one of the most awe-inspiring moments on our trip (I include Christmas Mass at Salzburg Cathedral on this list, as well), and I'll hold on to the feels the music left me with forever.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,2.0,"I hate to write a more negative review but I was really disappointed with my trip to Hohenwerfen Castle. From the outside, it looks really cool and menacing the way it's built up in the hills. But I had a really difficult time trying to figure out how to get up to it. The signage is really poor and confusing. It didn't help that the funicular wasn't operating while I was there. Me and several others were at the bottom of the castle trying to figure out how to get up there. The only way we managed was by walking up which would've been fine had that been it when we got there but the entrance is a long steep hill up and then after you make it passed that, guess what, more hills to climb! Thankfully I'm an active person but for anyone older or with mobility issues, this could be a huge hindrance. Once inside, the map was kind of useless that they gave me and there wasn't really anything to look at other than walls and a couple of canons. The best part in my opinion was being able to look out over the rest of Salzburg. Bring your camera because you can get some beautiful photos of the town from up there.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"This is a iconic site you can see from almost most areas within Salzburg and is something that should be visited if your here.
There are 2 ways up a funicular railway ( closed on my visit) or a walk up quite a steep set of steps and steep roads , however i5 is worth it once your at the top. (Avoid cloudy or snowy days)
There are 2 ticket types and would recommend the all inclusive as this allows access into the guided tour which takes you to the top of the castle and the views are stunning in all directions.
It does have a small cafe/ restaurant which will give a chance to have a comfort break.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Having not visited the fortress on my first trip to Salzburg, I was determined to see it on this trip. Unfortunately, the day was rainy so the views from the fortress walls were not as outstanding as they would be on a sunny day. However, this is a very worthwhile site to see. Seeing the golden hall and the golden chamber with its richly decorated stove (a rare example of late gothic ceramic craftsmanship), was worth the price of admission. Be aware that if you wish to see the Prince's chambers and the magic theater, then the web tickets are the least expensive and you won't need to stand in line to buy a ticket.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"The highlight of my visit to Salzburg.

I did not allow technology failure to thwart my quest to reach the castle and along the way appreciated why the castle had never been captured by enemies during its existence.

It was so tiring negotiating the steep path and stairs while enemies lobbing arrows, stones and anything they could reach their hands on on you. Would have been easier just to wait out for the defenders to run out of food which almost happened in 1525 when the Archbishop's people only had 1 bull left and engaging in a psychological warfare, paraded the bull on the castle parapet to show the enemies they still have food. The enemies left crestfallen.

The castle is huge with so many rooms but is not decorated as extensively as the Archbishop's residence in the city. Some parts have been converted into museums - the Arsenal, Marionette Museum and Rainer Regiment Museum. Paid castle tour is also available.

One can get a vantage view of Salzburg and surrounding area from the castle. So beautiful in the sunny morning.

It was worth the effort.

We caught the funicular up (a very short ride but included in Salzburg Card) and walked down.
Very little is heated so by the end of the 2 hours I was feeling the cold (5 degrees) so make sure you dress warmly and expect to do a lot of walking.
Most is not accessible as there is a lot of climbing.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"I found this fortress to be excellent! Such an impressive, imposing structure dominating the landscape over Salzburg.

The best way to experience it is to buy the ticket at the Festungsbahn (i.e. the funicular) and ride the funicular up to the fortress - it's included in your ticket.

I purchased the all inclusive ticket for a few extra Euro, which allows you access to a few additional rooms. Totally worth it in my opinion. There were very few people in those rooms and I mostly had them to myself. Super impressive painting, architecture, etc.

The tour directs you in a one way fashion through the fortress, with each room dedicated to a different part of the history of the fortress. There are signs in German, English, and Italian. Very straightforward descriptions of what you're looking at.

Excellent views over Salzburg from various viewpoints. Few places throughout the fortress toilets can be found, there's a gift shop at the end, and there is a terrace (x2 I think) where you can buy drinks/snacks.

I recommend going either early in the day or much later. The first time I went it was earlier in the day and there was no line at the ticket counter / funicular. The second time I visited, around 1230pm, there was a VERY long line. Fortunately, you can buy your tickets online, which automatically gives you access to the front of the line!

On a clear day we could see for miles.

You can chose to walk to the top of the fortress through a windy walkway with stairs or take the funicular, we chose the second option which was fast and efficient and saved our dodgy knees.

At this time of the year it is also fun wondering through the Christmas markets both before and after your visit.

We explored the fortress with stunning views of the Alps, historic information dating back centuries and met many of the locals as well as a few Americans. Coming in December we had the chance to participate in a small Christmas Market at the Castle, enjoy some mold wine and then hike back down. Overall we took about 2 hours at the locale but could have spent all day. There is also a tram for the less able to hike the steps/hills. Overall a very worthwhile place to visit. If going get the Salzburg Day Pass which provides access to many locales and the bus system.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Definitely worth doing, especially if the views are clear--panoramic views all around. Take the rail unless you have marathon-running fitness.

There are some places to eat in the fortress, although we did not try them.

The museum exhibits are amongst the best presented that I have ever seen. They use multi-media graphic arts and illustrations, rather than little cards that inevitably get lost in translation. My daughter, who is 9, was as engaged as I was, and learned a lot. So definitely worth the few extra Euros to get the full experience ticket.

We did not eat at the fort, but we did see almost everything else, and the experience took about 2.5 hours.

The fortress is very well-preserved, the audio tour and museum offer a lot of interesting history (of the region, the fortress, the rulers over various times, etc.), and the views from the top are stunning.

I'd budget at least two hours, but you can easily spend more time up there. From late November to late December, they sell gluhwein, and other beverages and snacks as well.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Clearly it is a beautiful place with some spectacular views. You get there with a funicular which is included in the ticket price so it‚Äôs great.
If you have height issues you should go to the right side after you exit from the funicular, on the left path it‚Äôs a bit more scary.
The place is super kid friendly, as the descriptions inside the museums are funny and really seem to target children in expressions and explanations.

The video room before the Banquet Hall was very cute and well made! Props to whomever implemented it!

Only one thing I felt was a bit amiss is the progression of the museums. For example you start with medieval then go through first world war then back to medieval, which for myself didnt make much sense.

Other than that, super great, go and see it!

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"Strongest advise if doing a few museums is to get the Salzburg museum card. We got the two day card and saved over ‚Ç¨40 each on what we did in that time thanks to the card

As others have said there are several compartments ,for want of a better description ,to the fortress.

Your journey starts , and first payment , is if you get the funicular up. Tucked away behind the cathedral , the 7 minute journey takes you up to the lower level of the fortress. You can walk up for free , long and steep path but not too bad. (we did this later in the week for a walk along the terrace)

Once up at the 1st level the views are great down into the old town . Then either a lift up or steps to the second level where the tours start. Again you pay for each one you decide. The fortress website lists what each offers so check before to make sure you don‚Äôt over pay for something you are not interested in

Displays range from medieval history , the bishops , art and history of the fortress . Also the 7th Austrian regiment from late 1800,s to 2nd world war.

Surprisingly we spent two and a half hours walking round. You could spent longer if you read a lot more of the panels, which where in English as well as Austrian.

The Christmas markets were setting up, but not open yet.

We wanted to end the visit with a hot drink and went to the Tavern. The worst service we have ever experienced if I am honest. We found a seat inside, outside seating available . Inside is laid out like a medieval banquet with plenty of seats . Two other couples where inside, one served with coffee appearing to want to pay and the other waiting. After 30 minutes waiting , i approached the bar area to be ignored by two men. I asked if there where any staff on hand to be advised. O they where working, they then proceeded to laugh at me and told me to chill !!!!!!!

The couple waiting to pay said they had been waiting over half an hour too. As we put our coats on and left finally a waiter came from the kitchens, disgusting level of service and totally marred our visit.

No signs really point towards it, you have to get into the heart of the inner city on foot to finally get near the funicular, though my guess is that a climb, at least on the way back, would provide its advantages on a bright day with a fuller view of the walls than zooming up and down. Quite a lot in the castle and the palace is not for visitors, what is does not really look historic though the architecture definitely is.

We snacked the whole time, drank beer, wine, water, and relaxed from 3 to 7pm. Not only is the view nice but the Fortress is pretty cool itself! The food is pretty good, but not the best. Instead of a full on dinner I would recommend you eat bar food the entire time. The entrance fee up this Fortress is approximately $15-20 and that includes the cable car ride up the top.

Also, they have a string puppet museum inside the fortress which is real nice to check out.

This is a must if you visit Salzburg!

We had limited time but there is a museum with lots of exhibits and a church which are worth a look.

Views from the top are superb as you can see the whole town below.

Good opportunities for selfies and great views out to Mondsee and the old ( Maria Von Trapp was here), convent.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"The day we visited, the sky was thick with cloud, so we weren‚Äôt sure if the view would be worth it by the time we got to the top.

We walked up the hill to the fortress. Seeing the rooftops of the city from different heights was well worth the trek, if you can handle stretches of steep uphills on a concrete path. Getting to walk through the old medieval entrance to the fortress was great too. You might miss out on this if you just take the cable car (although, in hindsight, we would probably have been better taking the cable car up, and walking down).

When we reached the fortress, it was 4pm and close to sunset. We climbed up through the narrow bridges, stairs and corridors to the main complex. There was mist and cloud over the city, but the view was still amazing. We were so high up, we could feel the cloud on our faces. The buildings were clearly visible and as the lights came on, the city twinkled below us.

We opted for an audio-tour which took us to the very top turret of the fortress. It cost a couple of euros each, and gave us a chance to see a historic ‚Äòbull organ‚Äô, as well as some other rooms, and we got to walk through the walls of the fortress, which was very cool.

We didn‚Äôt visit the other museums inside the fortress because they were closing by the time we got there. Same was true of the cafes and restaurant.

The cable car ride back down was easy and simple, and there was a jewellery shop at the bottom on the way out.

Totally worth it, even in the rain and the fog. The view might not have been as spectacular as it would be on a clear day, but I‚Äôd still recommend it. It‚Äôs definitely worth visiting, whatever the weather.

I bought the cheapest ticket for the fortress (‚Ç¨13) and took the funicular up. After walking around, trying to find anything open besides a restaurant, I hesitatingly went in the marionette place. It‚Äôs only slightly enjoyable...not seemingly kept up. The lady at a booth nearby told me whatever she was guarding had to be paid for separately. As I walked around in search of the artillery room, I tried to open the doors to marked rooms, such as the kitchen...locked. Everything was locked. What‚Äôs the point of putting up a sign if no one can go inside? And that artillery room...closed for some sort of renovation.

I walked around again, figuring I had to have missed something...sure, some world war museum I had no interest in, but in reality, i‚Äôd just spent about fifteen dollars to get a view of the city below. Big deal. I went back down and spoke with the ticket manager. I said I was severely disappointed and that they should let people know that certain sites are closed before we pay the money for a glorified city view. She told me they don‚Äôt give refunds and I would have to contact the home office.

The medieval costumed workers and guides were friendly and helpful. After an hour tour, using audio guides for the English version, we had time for a cappuccino in the courtyard and enjoy the magnificent views of the mountains.

While on the tour we learned that the movie ""Where Eagles Dare"", a WWII film with Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton, was filmed at Hohenwerfen. On returning home to Wisconsin, we borrowed the dvd from our library and enjoyed picking out the places we had seen at the castle.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,Bought the early bird package on line. Clear and easy enough. Early bird package is for arrival before 1000am. Not only saves a bit of money but getting there earlier avoids the crowds. There are several exhibit areas with pretty good explanations that can be visited. You can also walk through a couple sections of the fortress buildings (to include the tower with its not to be missed views upon Salzburg and the surrounding areas). I myself found it to be an interesting part of our visit to Salzburg and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone visiting for the first time.,Oct 2019

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"This excursion makes for a wonderful evening. We booked the VIP package (dinner + concert). This was worth every penny!!! The cable car brings you to the fortress & is free when you show your printed ticket. I do recommend arriving at the ticket office 45/30 min before the dinner to allow for the cable car ride & exploring the fortress. The views & sunset SIMPLY AMAZING!!!! Dinner (3 courses) was very good & very filling. After dinner we walked over to the concert. There are 3 flights of stairs to get to the concert area. The VIP included priority seats+program booklet+drink at the intercession. Our seats were on the front row!!!! The concert was perfect!!! The concert room is beautiful and very easy to imagine the performances. There are no words to explain the talent of the musicians. The group included 3 violins, cello & piano. Just EXCEPTIONAL!!! The group performed 6 pieces mostly from Mozart. Once the concert was over the cable car brings you back down. Because the ticket office is on the back side of the Cathedral there were not any taxis waiting at the stands. No problem though, we walked back to the main road where we found a taxi.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"We paid 12 euros for the funicular. The line was not long maybe 10 minutes wait. Once on top the views are incredible on a clear day, but nothing else about it. We didn‚Äôt go inside, I don‚Äôt think that the 15 dollars included going inside, but anyway there is so many things to do that we didn‚Äôt care.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,We thoroughly enjoyed the visit. After a ride up the funicular and a walk around the castle and its various nooks and crannies we finished with the museum where we found the regimental area and its WW1 exhibits very interesting.,Oct 2019
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"I headed past the giant Mozart Ball [the golden one with the man on top] and headed up a narrow path towards the funicular sign hanging outside the entrance. For a basic ticket not including a tour of the museum it was E12.90, for the full tour it was about E16. For a great view try and get the end carriages - though it is a bit of a fight to get these so get there early. There are early bird tickets for 10am people to buy online, though I don't think they were much cheaper from what I paid there...

The trip up takes less than a minute to arrive at the top. There are 3 levels - the front with spectacular views of Salzburg and a new restaurant, the rear with views of the hinterland of Salzburg and the Panorama Cafe [see seperate review] and the fortress itself.

To get into the fortress there are 60 or so steps up, but there could be a lift for those unable to do this. Once inside, there is a courtyard and the museum and other areas to explore. I'd say about 1-2 hours is all you need there, plus time for a meal or a coffee to enjoy the views.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"The reason that this is not 5 stars is because the chop the castle up in sections to be able to charge more. The real burn here is that the Salzburg Tourism Card will not get you into the more ornate residential section even though it covers the funicular ride and the rest of the castle attractions. Nonetheless, the audio tour is well done and there are a number of interesting exhibits. The views of the alps and the city are excellent and worth the visit alone.

It's really a bit difficult for Americans (who went from log forts to trading settlements and skipped the castle phase) to grasp the context and logistics of occupying and expanding a site for nearly a thousand years. This is one of those places where you want to slow down a bit and really think about the history of the structure, city and people involved.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"I first visited the Festung on a school trip many years ago. Predictably it has changed little since then. Sadly the building that housed the armoury was undergoing some building work when we visited this time but it appeared that this would not last too long. We chose to walk up to the entrance. It is a steep hill but the views over the city as you walk up are worthwhile. The funicular railway up to the fortress from the city is quite costly (19 Euros, if my memory is correct). There are spectacular views from the walls in all directions. The ticket price includes the use of an audio guide which is available in several languages and is quite good. Be aware that some of the staircases are steep and spiral - something my wife found difficult as she suffers from vertigo. The displays are well done and informative. There is a cafe / restaurant within the walls which is good if somewhat pricey - as one might expect. Well worth a visit.

This was perfect, because we missed most of the crowds, and seemed to have the place to ourselves for a while before the big tours came through.

This was one of the better museums I have been to. The placards were simple and to the point, and the english translations were perfect.

The views alone from the fortress are worth the price of admission. We had a beautiful, clear day, and we saw the surrounding landscape and alps. The hills are truly alive on a clear day.

You have to do this if you are in Salzburg!

There was quite a bit of restoration work being carried out when we were there but not really a problem.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"I tend to seek out the highest spots in every place that I visit, so the Fortress was a given. I hiked up twice before actually visiting the fortress. The funicular is much easier, especially if you're not used to steep climbs. Once you arrive, you take a directed path through the castle and learn a lot about its expansions over the years. You can also see the Salzburger Bull, the organ used to wake up the town for years. The presentation made sense of the fortress and its many walls. I also thought it was cool to walk on the old battlement on the way out. Beautiful views can be had from the fortress courtyard, and from just below the entrance. It seemed that you could get there without a ticket, but I'm not positive. Don't be afraid to walk back down along the Monchsberg ridge. It's an easy walk, and the views are lovely.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"""Rome of the North"" as sometimes Salzburg was called, greeted us with proverbial Irish ""gloom and doom"". Nearly...But it was cloudy all day, and we were just waiting for the moment when skies' gate will open and it will start pouring. There's many paths leading to fortress Hohensalzburg. Paths, and funicular railway for those who wanna avoid climbing up steep Festungsberg. We've chosen the longest way. After wandering for a bit around Old Town we marched roughly along eastern slope until we'd reached it's northern tip around Pfarre Mulln and then slowly started our climbing uphill through first line of ramparts at Monikapforte gate. We followed path running at the edge of the cliff that offers amazing views of the town and fortress. Path led through the park on the top of the hill and next to Hotel Schloss Mochnstein, and then Museum of Modern Art. From the museum there's only little walk to the Burgerwehr and the second line of ramparts. And from there, it still was about half an hour of walk before we finally reached fortress itself. And the view was really impressive. It's construction began in 11th century under Archbishop Gebhard von Helfenstein. Its primary design was basic bailey with wooden walls, but in the following centuries fortress was gradually expanded. In its over 900 years long history citadel witnessed war between Emperor and Pope over bishop's investiture, 15th century Hungarian War ( when main building was enlarged and arsenal and granary were constructed), 16th century Peasants' War (when erecting external bastions started as a precaution because of fears of Turkish invasion). During Thirty Years' War various new parts were added to the fortress such as additional gatehouses and gunpowder stores. In the 19th century fortress was used as a barracks, storage depot and prison until finally ceased to function as a military outpost in second half of nineteenth century. It's refurbishing started shortly after that and today it is largest fully-preserved fortress in this part of Europe. Apart from castle itself there you can also see Gothic chambers, St. George's Chapel or Museum of Marionettes. Not to mention spectacular views of city of Salzburg. Some scaffolding is still in place here and there, as renovation is underway. Tickets are quite cheap as for such a big place. You can get basic one or all-inclusive. Tickets for kids are cheaper. Also, get yourself ready for queuing, especially if you wanna visit chambers.

The two restaurants were closed.
Well worth a visit!",Sep 2019
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,2.0,"I honestly expected a lot more from the visit. The fortress is a mediocre structure, poorly presented and shoddy maintenance. Once again something that could've been so much better ruined by commercialism and way too many tourists.",Sep 2019
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"The view from the fortress is amazing and the tour and historical presentations are informative.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"Great view, but lots of restoration work going on in the internal areas and it wasn't clear if there was a direction to walk in, what to learn from the origins of the fortress. Kind of stumbled upon that. This is also true of the religious depictions, but this may be me stumbling around in the wrong direction.
That happened. Hopefully this improves as it is an appreciative sight standing above Salzburg.",Sep 2019
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"I didn't think I'd initially visit the fortress; I usually have a long list of churches or palaces or gardens to see and photograph... but my friend suggested it and I went along on a rainy morning. We took the funicular up and did ""the whole tour"" ticket. It is a large complex, and it was fascinating to see the various spaces & rooms, and follow the expansion over centuries of construction. The surviving gothic gold room is astonishing; it was certainly good to be a powerful prince bishop back in the day! The tiny, exquisite St. George's chapel within the fortress was a gem of architecture, too.
Great views down onto Salzburg, from various windows and a rooftop viewing platform. Even in the wet/rain/mist, it was a delightful experience.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"The ""funicular"" makes it easy to visit the fortress from the old town. Walking up to it looks a daunting prospect. It's a big old place, and checking out every nook and cranny could take a while. It feels old, despite a good deal of conservation (ongoing) but pedestrian management was efficient and there were no major roadblocks.
The view from the top is spectacular on a clear sunny day, and no great physical effort is involved.
Entry is included in the Salzburg card, which is recommended to those who want to visit more than a couple of major sights.

There is plenty to see, you will need some stamina to get up and down the slopes.",Sep 2019
Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Fabulous place and a must see when visiting the beautiful city of Salzburg.

Follow the fortress‚Äôs evolution through the ages and the subsequent additions made necessary by advances in military technology. Although the gates were opened to the French during the Napoleonic wars, it would seem these evolutionary steps were successful as the fortress defences were never breached.

Excellent, informative displays throughout help to give chronological context to life in Hohensalzburg and within Austria generally.

The icing on the cake are the breathtaking views of Salzburg from the fortress which are pretty priceless.

The concert starts at 8 and is held in the beautiful Golden Hall. We had front row seats and the intimate concert featured Mozart, Dvorak, Strauss and Bach pieces with one intermission. Warning there is only one women‚Äôs restroom stall and it is several floors down - I barely made it back at intermission as there were 10 in line!

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"The fortress is an interesting excursion that is recommended. We did an early bird entry at a slightly discounted rate and I would surely recommend this early entry again. There was no waiting anywhere including the vernicular. I can imagine that this does have a tendency to fill with tourists mid day during the summer. The fortress doesn't have to take a terribly long time for those who are only looking for a short visit. The walk up is intense though, so think twice about doing it without the vernicular ticket. The one bit of information that I wish I'd understood a little better at visiting, was that a Salzburg Card gets admission into the fortress. We did end up buying this card after we had previously purchased admission to Hohensalzburg Fortress so essentially, we paid twice. Perhaps reading this will help other guests, not make the same mistake that we made. If you are utilizing public transportation or seeing any of the sights within Salzburg, however, it simply doesn't make sense to do it without the purchase of the card. It's extremely inclusive and a well planned visitor can get a LOT of bang for their buck out of it's purchase.

Once at the top, there didn't seem to be much happening at all, other than restaurants. Many of the smaller rooms were locked, with signs stating 'No entry' on the doors. We went inside the main section and were faced with around a two-hour queue to see the rooms and museum, even though we'd already bought tickets! When we queued up initially, we understood that they were only allowing a limited number of visitors in at a time, in order to keep waiting times to a minimum, though obviously this was very far from the case. It was totally impractical for us to stay and enjoy the tour. There was a small puppet display, which required more money placing in the machines in order to make them move and sadly, that was about it. A waste of time and a bigger waste of money. Of all the visits we have made to Austria over a period of thirty-odd years, we have never seen a more blatant display of inefficiency.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,"Honestly it is an awesome place. First of all it is a very beautiful fortress with huge territory and several museums. The museums are amazing.

The first one has audioguide which tells you about fortress' history and describes the purpose of some rooms. It also contains a viewpoint at the end of the tour where you can enjoy the stunning panoramic view of Salzburg.

The second one contains a lot of different exhibitions regarding different ages. For instance, you can see the stuff of World War I and II, Middle Ages there. There are also a magical theater made of animated decorations accompanying with audio. The audio is available in several languages: English, Spanish, German and probably French, but I'm not sure.

The third is Royal rooms museum. There are an archbishops chambers. Also you can see several stands with videos about archbishops biography and fortress history there. These videos are available in more languages than theater. I can remember that Russian was available too, but if you understand English, then it will be better to use it. Russian translation contains weird accent which is not nice to hear xD

And last but not least there is Marionette museum which contains a lot of different characters.

So, it was amazing. You can spend half day there. I think that it is a must-visit place in Sazlburg! :)

One reason of many is that everyone talking about it when it comes to castles in Austria. But I must say, it's nothing more that one of those overhyped castles. As I was reading a reviews here, people reviewing the views (?!), not the castle. Yes the view from the tower was beatiful 360¬∞ scenery, but apart of that, castle has nothing to offer you for 10‚Ç¨ price ( basic ticket). When I compare it with castles in Germany in same prize category, than the view is only good thing, which this fortress has. I get the audiogude, and had to return it after 6 places to listen, which is very little, when I consider size of castle ffs. No rooms, no kitchen, nothin'! Just one room with pictures of biscups which ruled and what part they built. Then Little torture room, tower and that's it.

It was refurbished from the late 19th century onward and became a major tourist attraction with the Festungsbahn funicular railway in 1892. During 20th century it was used as a prison.holding Italian prisoners of World War1 and Nazi activists before Germany's annexation of Austria in march 1938. it was selected as main motif for the Austrian Nonnberg Abbey commemorative coin minted on April 5,2006.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,1.0,"It's more of a tourist trap than an old fortress. There are cafes, construction work and trash everywhere. You can't enter a lot of the buildings, and some of the few you can enter has an addition charge to the already expensive entrance ticket. Furthermore there wasn't much information unless you got the audio guide which you had to get on the far side from where you enter the castle.

We have seen a lot of old castles and this is one of the very least interesting but one of the most expensive.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,1.0,"We visited the castle yesterday and opted for the basic ticket rather than the All inclusive ticket based on the information in the brochure. All we were interested in were the views from the top of the castle, and a visit to the Golden Hall and the Golden Chamber.

The all inclusive ticket included sections A B C & D of the castle. The Basic ticket included sections A B & D. According to the official brochure Section C only included the Regency rooms and Magical theatre. As the Regency rooms did not interest us we opted for the Basic Ticket.

When we went to visit the Golden hall and golden chamber we were told they were part of the Regency Rooms?

The brochure clearly has several errors.
Firstly it shows sections 11-13 in the B area, whereas according to the ticket man they are All part of the C area.
Secondly, the index for Category C refers to the Regency rooms, Magical theater. Regency rooms is item 11 on the index.

So based on the above the public should be able to visit sections 12 & 13 on a Basic ticket ie. The Golden Hall & The Golden Chamber.

To the ticket man working on the 30/7/19, you should learn some manners and customer service.

I‚Äôll be chasing up for a part refund on this one.

I‚Äôve attached the official brochure to make things clear!

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"This is one of the places in Salzburg you should see. I enjoyed the visit, but I‚Äôd like to provide a couple of opinions and a feedback:

- the tickets: if you buy your tickets online, and you‚Äôre from North America, make sure your QR code is not cut. The ticket PDF file is made for European A4 size, while in North America we have a Letter size. If your QR code it cut because of that, the scanners at the fortress won‚Äôt recognize it. So, make a copy of your QR code as a screenshot on your phone. A feedback for the Salzburg Burgen and Schl√∂sser Team: please move the QR code somewhere closer to the middle of the page, so it won‚Äôt get cut if printed on a different document size.

- the guides: there‚Äôs only one place in the fortress with an audio guide; that‚Äôs not enough. I was kind of lost in the rest of the fortress. I love to hear about the history of the place, stories about it, a live interaction with the guides. That‚Äôs missing here. Or, maybe I just didn‚Äôt find it, because I had no idea where to go. The fortress is HUGE, it has some signage pointing to this tower or that building. But I had no idea where to go to see the most. What route should I follow to see this or that? So, I was just randomly walking one way to see what‚Äôs in there, and then the other way, to cover the most of the fortress. My Apple Watch was happy though, I closed all the rings today, I guess :) A feedback for the Salzburg Burgen and Schl√∂sser Team: please provide real or maybe just more audio guides, or create some routes people could follow to see the most of the fortress without a feeling of being lost.

- exhibition information: most of the main exhibition is described in three languages - German, English, and I believe the third one was Italian. Sorry, didn‚Äôt pay attention much to the third one the moment I recognized English. I‚Äôm not trying to be ignorant, it‚Äôs just the mix of fonts (sizes and styles) in the description made it really hard to read through, so I just keep scanning for English text to learn the most about that particular exhibition. The mix of fonts made it really tiring, and eventually I just gave up and stopped reading. Which makes me really sad, because the history of this place is why I came here today. Besides all that, as I already said, while the most of the exhibition is in more than just German, there are many smaller pieces that are only in German, especially in the sections describing battles and weapons. However, the audio guide in that one place I mentioned at the beginning, was in multiple languages, which is great. A feedback for the Salzburg Burgen and Schl√∂sser Team: please be more consistent in your exhibition descriptions, especially in font usage. I understand you can‚Äôt fit English everywhere, and I really try to learn local languages of the places I visit, but my German (or lack of it) failed me today on many occasions. I feel I missed so much I could learn from the history of this wonderful place.

Despite all of the above, THIS PLACE IS WORTH TO VISIT. I tried to enjoy it, and I did; no regrets here :)

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,5.0,The best place to view Salzburg is from the Fortress. You can enjoy the furnicular train up to the fortress or hike up the mountain on a series of narrow roads and stairs.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"Despite being the holidays and a major tourist attraction, the disorganised nature of the place was a little off-putting. There didn't appear to be any organised way to have the used audioguides returned to the start of the tour so those wanting the guides had to wait until they were returned from where they were handed in.

Furthermore, there are no toilets within the castle once you start the tour (we had little kids with us with unpredictable bladders) but the way in which you have to be let out to go to the toilet, handing in your audioguide and then go through the entrance again, but you can't rescan your ticket so you have to wait to be let in, was a bit of a joke. Also, the fact you have to scan your tickets at every single access point makes the tour seem hectic and haphazard. One entrance price/ticket should give you access to everything and there should not be gates at various junction points.

Despite this the place is beautiful and a great step back in time. The walk from Hohensalzburg along the cliff was stunning and we took the elevator back down from the Modern Art Museum.

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"We did the pass that included the funicular up and down. The walk up the hill is very long, steep and potentially dangerous as there is loose gravel. If possible take the lift, especially if you are with older family members and children. It's worth the extra few euro.

There is an option for the basic pass and the ""extra pass"" which includes the Regency Rooms. We did the extra pass, which was a little pricey. I personally found the rooms to be overrated, but my partner enjoyed them. The most interesting part was the information about how they restore the original paint of the rooms. Unfortunately, some of the sections of the rooms were under restoration, so I felt a little cheated having paid extra.

There are lots of exhibits in the castle. The English translations are very basic, almost childish, but I suppose it is an effort make the museum accessible to all? We found the medieval weapon and armour exhibit to be interesting. You can also see old coins and games that children used to play. In addition, there was a marionette museum in the centre of the complex. We thought it was a little creepy!

The best part of visitng here was by far the panorama viewing decks. We got spectacular pictures of the Alps and Salzburg. If you are not a diehard history fan, come for the views and a brief pass through the museum!

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"Standing imposingly over the city of Salzburg, Hohensalzburg Fortress (which translates, fittingly, to 'High Salzburg Fortress') is a sight that it's hard to manage to miss when visiting the Austrian City, visible from most parts of the city centre.

Indeed, its appearance is somewhat reminiscent of Edinburgh Castle's, albeit visible from further away. Work began on the fortress in 1077 but it has been updated several times throughout the centuries, but holds the distinction of being one of the largest surviving medieval castles in Europe.

Accessible by foot, it's worth noting to choose your route to the fortress sensibily: The one Google Maps sent me was possibly the shortest route, but it involved a fairly testing steep uphill walk that took it out of me (and while I'm not an athlete, I'm also not exactly unfit) I learned on the way down that there's a far more user-friendly route involving several staircases from the centre. It is still an uphill journey, but this definitely takes an edge off it!

There are furnacular railways that offer some degree of quicker transit up the hill, however when I visited in April these did not appear to be running, which isn't ideal for those less physically able. Thankfully I was up for the walk!

Once you scale the hill, you are presented with a very sizable castle to explore. Various courtyards, viewing platforms and museum rooms await visitors. It's a very well maintained structure, but this has been done so without losing its character. There has been some typical tourist modernisation in the form of a gift shop and some cafe/restaurants (which again weren't open when I visited) but in general I was quite taken by how much of its original 'feel' it maintained.

Some of the views it offers over the city and surrounding areas are nothing short of spectacular, and while I didn't visit all of the exhibits (there was a puppet museum that I've seen enough horror movies to know is a terrible idea) what I did was thoroughly interesting and not too badly priced.

It's hard to advise visiting Salzburg and not taking in Hohensalzburg, its looming presence makes it almost obtuse not to visit, and as harsh as the route that I took was, I still feel that it was worth it. If you only go to one of Salzburg's castles or palaces, I would say this is probably the way to go

Austria,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,4.0,"Unless you are with one of the many larger groups and travelling independently, you will need to check for the funicular railway entrance to take you up to the castle as its unobtrusively tucked away. The castle looks majestic dominating the city skyline on top of the hill. And when inside it is a much larger complex than we imagined. Added to over the centuries it ended life being practically the size of a small village. Therein lays a problem as it has different courtyard areas, parapet views, now several restaurants taking advantage of the views, viewpoint turrets and museums. The map they give you on entry I found hopeless to logically move about the different areas in some order. With one walking route when inside a castle section you emerge some way away from where you started. And with some museum rooms interesting, others less so it can take some time to cover most of the castle.

Also visited unrelated museums hosted in the fortress and included with the ticket. Fortress museum was very interesting, including impressive displays of medieval armor and weapons. Puppet museum was a waste of time. Rainer regiment museum was very interesting.
We went up to the fortress on foot (with little kids), not too big a deal - a few stairs and sloping streets, all with a very nice of view of the city.

Especially the Breughel room is art at its best. Some of the legendary paintings that were shown to me in school were available here. The Greco-Roman and Egyptian parts of the museum were a bit dull to be honest, especially compared to other museums like the Pergamon museum. The coin collection at the upper floor is only for the real art fans. The collection of Italian and French paintings is also downright impressive, but didn't appeal to me as much as the Flemish and Dutch paintings.

They have a permanent collection that blows my mind over and over again. Very heavy meaningful paintings from late medieval times to Renaissance and Baroque paintings. So much mythology and iconography packed in one place. I love the caf√© under the dome and enjoy my coffee (and breakfast) in this opulent place that has very interesting acoustics!

Can only recommend. One of my favourite places in my home town.

When I visited this June, there was an antique Egyptian and Greek collection, which was super intereseting, well organised and cared for. The painting collection is also amazing and contains pieces from famous painters and artists. You need at least half of a day to see it and enjoy it as it deserved. Last floor hosts a cafe, where the staff is really nice and you can feel as a royalty.

I had to wait for this a long time. Almost got impatient, but it was worth the wait. The waiter was very, very friendly. Probably noticed my 'Wiener Accent' , when I spoke German to him.

I could have stayed all day there and I definitely should have taken into consideration the queue and how huge this museum is. You need minimum 3 hours and that is with not long pauses at each paintings! You can easily spend the whole day there, the pictures are arranged in themes, I know some change. Most are allowed to be photographed, I wanted to take pictures on all the allowed ones, since i wanted to capture all the beauty, but in the end I decided not to and to just enjoy them in that very moment.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"This museum has so much to offer that it's a mammoth task to do it all in one day. I did manage it and it took me 6 hours with quite a lengthy pause for lunch (about an hour I'd say).

The museum has a lot to offer. Ancient Egyptian and Babylonian sculptures and artwork, some of the finest furniture and sculptures from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Countless paintings by Rubens, van Dyck and others. It can be completely overwhelming if you don't pace yourself!

I would suggest that you read up on the exhibitions and plan ahead for what you want to specifically see, otherwise you can get lost amongst a dozen fine paintings of ""Virgin and Child"" without being able to stop and appreciate the beauty in each one. It's one of the best collections of fine art in the world, and if that's what floats your boat then it's worthwhile.

The food is also very good and reasonably priced. I had a three course meal and it was superb, the wait staff were also really great.

A note on the current coin exhibition: As of March 20 there is a coin exhibition. Unless you're into Roman Emperors and their coins, it's either very worthwhile or totally boring. Personally I found it really interesting (I'm interested in ancient Rome and it brought it to life for me), but there were a lot of very bored looking people in that exhibition. So unless you like that, don't bother with it.

To see two things- an artist I am familiar with, and one I do not know. It saves me trying to see everything in one day and being overwhelmed. There was an exhibition of Caravaggio and Bellini . It was superb. The unknown artist I selected was Brueghel. and there was a great selection of his paintings to view. While some people might feel my selection method is limiting, it makes the best use of my time and you never know what you will see along the way.

Anyway, as we could not find this information, we assumed naturally that it would be open for our visit on Monday Feb 10th. We arrived about 10.30 am of course to find that it was closed on Mondays. I would like the administrators to know that whilst sheltering briefly at the closed front door, we were joined in quick succession by at least 20 other tourists (not all one group but in 2‚Äôs, 3‚Äôs & 4‚Äôs etc), who after a brief chat with us (some in English, some in German & some in Spanish) had all checked the website as we had done for opening times, not found them and had assumed the museum would be open. If you are a museum employee reading this, check what the weather was like on Feb 10th, driving torrential rain. Every one of us got soaked to the skin ! ‚ÄúVielan Danke‚Äù
On a more positive note, we returned to the museum later during our week stay in Vienna and the museum was excellent. The building itself (interior & exterior) was a work of art in itself and inside there were too many highlights to list them all. My personal favourites were the portrait of Jane Seymour by Hans Holbein; the portrait of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian by Albrecht Duror and the mechanical gold ship manufactured in Augsburg (a gift for the emperor‚Äôs amusement). Well worth a visit.

The art museum has very impressive collections of fine arts and decorative arts. This museum is our favorite museum in Vienna. Everytime we visit Vienna, we spend a few hours in the museum going over its enormous collections. Last September, we visited this museum as one of our routines in Vienna. Upon entering the museum building, its elegant lobby with stately staircase and the impressive artworks displayed on the ceilings and walls greeted us. The museum‚Äôs impressive fine art collections and ‚Äúsculpture & decorative arts‚Äù collections alone demanded about 2 hours of our time. The picture gallery‚Äôs collections included artworks by great masters such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, Rembrandt, Reubens, etc. The collections of sculpture & decorative arts were so intriguing and charming. The museum‚Äôs layout of the display chambers are visitor friendly unlike huge size museums like Louvre, Uffizi, and Metropolitan Museum. This fine art museum is a must-visit museum in Vienna, followed by the museum in Neueburg with great Collection of Ancient Musical Instruments & Collection of Arms and Armour.

The sculptures, especially at the top of the grand staircase, the ceiling paintings (including a couple from the young Gustav Klimt) throughout the museum are the art treasures by itself. The cupola is so beautiful, from the second floor all around balcony you can see the interior of the dome better and upclose at the marble columns and allegorial scultpures. Under the cupola is the museum cafe where the lunch is reasonably priced (for a museum) and sitting there even just for a cup of coffee and enjoying the magical surrounding are worth every penny. And then there are the collections! Many many work from the great masters through the ages, paintings, sculptures, delicate ivory works, jewelry, decorations, furnitures, coins, crowns.

Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the special exhibition. The original works of Caravaggio were few, it was certainly not what was advertised.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"Perhaps because the name 'Kunsthistorisches Museum' is so hard to pronounce to non-German speakers this museum is not on every traveler's lips as the Louvre or the Prado. But make no mistake, this is one of the very greatest European art collections, capable of taking the breath away even from those who are seasoned museum travelers. I finally visited the museum after knowing of its existence since I was a child, and I was blown away by what I saw: Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Caravaggio, the largest set of Peter Bruegel paintings in the world, the most complete Flemish medieval paintings collection in existence, Vermeer's 'The Art of Painting', Holbein's 'Jane Seymour', Arcimboldo's portraits. And these were just the highlights! It is an art lover's fantasy come true. Personally, I was taken aback by the overall high quality of the paintings on display, the result of centuries of judicious collecting by the Habsburg Imperial family.
Even more impressively, the paintings only make up half of the museum, on the first floor. The ground floor--which unfortunately I was only able to skim by flying through it--contains antiquities collections from Egypt, Greece and Rome on one side; and golden treasures and objects d'arts also assembled by the Habsburgs on the other. It is impossible to appreciate all that the museum contains in one visit, so I recommend concentrating on areas that interest you the most to have a fulfilling and memorable visit. And don't forget to appreciate the elegant rooms themselves and look up at the decorated ceilings every now and then. If you intend to spend a whole day in the museum (there is a restaurant inside), I recommend Thursday when the museum is open until 9pm and the crowds get thinner after 4pm.

The building is impressive in size and design and just across the walking park is the history museum so lots to do in close proximity. During the holidays in the park area, they have a small Christmas market as well. The museum holds many of the great masters artwork, where you have a chance to get up close and personal with the works. In addition, the sculptures are an added bonus. Regarding tours, to some extent that is a matter of taste. On the tours, the greatest works will be discussed. If you decide to go it alone, each painting has a summarized write up on the wall, also in English, and I found most of these descriptions quite good.

The museum has plenty of arts to look at, it was very interesting. In addition, I really liked their restaurant, it just looked so beautiful and my Mrs grabbed a quick bite.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"I was fortunate to arrive in Vienna just as the new ""Carvaggio & Bernini: The Discovery of Emotions"" exhibition was opening. It will be here until 19 Jan 2020. You'd be nuts to miss it. This museum is filled with a very large number of wonderful objects, but the 65 masterworks here now -- gathered from fine museum collections in Vienna, Rome, Florence, Milan, Genoa, Bologna, Varallo, Madrid, Berlin, Antwerp, Amsterdam, St. Petersburg, Paris, Lyon, London, New York, Los Angeles and Hartford (as well as a few private collections elsewhere) are extraordinary to behold.

Moreover, they are expertly interpreted in a way that will appeal to anyone who takes the time to read the fascinating multilingual signs accompanying them. (Each visitor also gets a small printed booklet in multiple languages with details of all the works on display, to include those by other artists and sculptors who were contemporaries of or were influenced by Caravaggio and Bernini.)

It's one thing to look, and another to understand. The exhibition is arranged according to concepts common at the time the artists lived. These include things like wonderment and astonishment, horror and terror, motion and action, liveliness, suffering and compassion, vision and humor. Such a broad perspective is very satisfying because it reflects common themes in human life, even while presenting them in a specific historical context.

You may not like every single sculpture or picture. Some are horrific. Others lay on religious symbolism in a way that may seem ""over the top"" to modern sensibilities. At their best, though, they are remarkably human, and it is that humanity which draws us in.

If you're concerned about crowds, you needn't be. The exhibition is very well organized, requiring the purchase of tickets (easy to do on line, or in person at a booth near the museum's entrance) for particular time slots. These cost 10 Euros each and are in addition to the normal entrance fees.

While this makes viewing more costly, it means that a) you can count on seeing the exhibit when you want to; and b) you will walk through it with a limited number of other visitors, so as to have a more leisurely and rewarding experience than you would if you were being pushed along or crowded out by a very large numbers of people, all straining to see the works of art. It worked out beautifully when we walked through, unhurried and uncrowded. What a great experience.

Just to note, non-flash photography is permitted for some works, but for many, there are signs stating that no photos can be taken. I personally think people taking pictures are a distraction, and so took no photos inside, just one of the giant exhibition poster passed while ascending the museum's grand staircase. I opted instead for a nice collection of high quality postcards and a copy of the exhibition catalogue.

If you would like to come back with some souvenirs, there is a small gift shop conveniently located right by the exhibition. But I'd recommend you visit the main store, located in the basement, which has one of the best collections of art gifts I've seen anywhere in Vienna. I have bought lots of things there, both for myself and for others as gifts. I try to visit every time I am in Vienna, even when not walking through the art collections. The main gift shop is free to enter and very well and imaginatively stocked, with something for all ages, all interests, and all pocketbooks.

I would certainly recommend the accompanying catalogue, whether in hard cover or paper. The photography and text make it a pleasure to leaf through while remembering this remarkable exhibition.

If you miss ""Carravagio & Bernini"" here in Vienna, you can see it in Amsterdam at the Rijksmuseum (the exhibition's co-sponsor with the Kunsthistorisches Museum) from 14 February to 7 June, 2020.

Highly recommended.

Of course in addition to that, once we enter the entrance, we can easily recognize masterpieces which we learned at the school.
The cafe on the second floor seems always busy, and necessary for many people to take a break. We stayed there a little longer not because it was hard to catch a few waiters, but because the architecture is amazing.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"I have always thought of the Kunsthistorisches as an art museum and indeed it does harbour a world class collection of Art (I particularly love the Bruegels); however the museum has much more than just paintings - ancient antiquities (Greek, Roman, Egyptian, etc.) and other collections .

In a way then this is a number of museums in one - and with that it is potentially of greater interest to families with diverse interests.

My only slight gripe is that there was a Caravaggio exhibition for which there was an additional charge/queue for tickets and it also meant that certain rooms were blocked off.

We used our Vienna pass and were able to walk straight in to the museum.

I have put recommended length of visit as 2-3 hours but many people (especially those with children) will want to take less time. In that case I recommend doing some research beforehand (there are plenty of websites which can help you work out the highlights).

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,1.0,"First, it‚Äôs very small. It has two floors with exhibitions. And it‚Äôs collection can‚Äôt be compared with any really great famous museums such as Louvre or Hermitage.
Secondly, the 0,5 floor (yes, they call it 0,5 not first) doesn‚Äôt have any inscriptions/names/definitions in English language. No other languages than Austrian are used. Such a shame for the international museum! On this floor the Egyptian collection and crockery are displayed.
The second floor with paintings have some english inscriptions.
Thirdly, their staff is horrible: they are rude, unintelligent and don‚Äôt know English as well. And you‚Äôll face great difficulties trying to find anybody when you need them. We tried to ask about some exhibits, but with no success. The management should really try and educate their staff so they be able say a few words about their museum, or better translate the descriptions.
Finally, the lighting is terrible. Many light bulbs are just broken. Seriously, you don‚Äôt have money to fix them? Your tickets cost 18 euro!

We spent almost 5 hours in this museum and could have done more. The Cabinet of Wonders is not to be missed with the highlight being the famous Cellini Salt Cellar made of solid gold.
Another highlight in the Roman collection is the most exquisite cameo I have ever seen--the Augustus Cameo.

The Painting Gallery's central attraction is the Breughel Room. This fine arts museum has more of his work than any other. My favorite is the mysterious ""Hunters in the Snow.""

We had bought tickets online for the Caravaggio/Bernini exhibition as well as a Guided Tour in English at 5:00pm. The guide was extremely informative and very enthusiastic. She covered about 75% of the paintings including the 10 Caravaggios in the exhibition. It's well worth seeing and the combination of the two Baroque artists--painter and sculptor-- adds a unique dimension.

The Kunsthistorisches (Art History) Museum is one of our favorite museums in the world housed amidst Hapsburg splendor.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,4.0,"This is the family art collection of the Hapsburg family who ruled an empire in Europe for centuries. You should go selectively to certain floors, for what interests you, as you cannot see it all in one day. The cafe was a huge disappointment. We never got it. We picked a rainy day to visit the museum, but so did all the other tourists. On Wednesdays, the Cafe closes early at 3 pm. They only had 11 active tables with full meal service and people lingered for ever at their table. The lineup snaked around the corner with a lot of pissed off people who were counting on a quick lunch of a snack and coffee. The museum should be more people and service oriented. The staff were brusque, rude and brushed everyone aside. I can guess that they were understaffed and unhappy, but so were we all standing in that long line!!! Way to piss off a few hundred people! Focus on the art, and go eat elsewhere.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"One could spend at least two full days at this museum, one the great museums in the world. My ability to take in art in its various forms has diminished since I first visited the Kunsthistorisches in 1971, so this time we focused on the small but marvellous exhibition of works by Jan van Eyck, including a splendid Madonna on loan from the Royal Museum in Antwerp, and several of his contemporaries, and on Netherlandish and German art from the 15th through 17th centuries. The room full of Breughels alone is more than worth the modest price of admission (12 euros for seniors). It was nice, too, to see most of the Vermeyen cartoons for the Tunis tapestry cycle on display. The last time we were here, 7 or 8 years ago, they were shut away.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,1.0,"It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and there were no queues at the ticket office, at all. Neither was there anyone standing behind us. We had allocated at least two or three hours for our viewing, since we take museums very seriously and had already been stymied by walking the length of Vienna to visit another one, whose exhibition had been moved to another venue because of refurbishment. We made the mistake of asking where this alternative venue was, before we purchased our ticket and got the rudest response we experienced during our time in Vienna. Firstly, the young woman had no idea that this other museum's exhibits had been relocated and after several comments about wasting her time, told us quite vehemently that she was not the tourist information office! Needless to say, a ticket for this particular museum was not bought. As I began to write this review, I noticed that several other visitors have had similar complaints about staff attitude, here... a great shame and something which needs rectifying, immediately.

Her reverence for each work was obvious and her understanding of the relationship of each work to its place in history was enrapturing.

We visited on 15 September and it was busy but there is plenty of room to get a good look at the paintings and plenty of places to sit which is great as it does get very tiring as there is so much to see, we spent the whole day there. The building itself is equally beautiful and there is a very elegant cafe that sells good food.

My only criticism would be the terrible girl that was on the ticket desk when we arrived, there was no greeting, no smile and her manner could not have been more offhand, she was absolutely appalling and should not be allowed anywhere near visitors, sadly she was not wearing a name tag. Dispite this rude young lady we enjoyed our day amongst some of the best art in the world. The Egyptian collection was also amazing but slightly marred at the end by a member of staff chastising my husband for not having a rubber end on his walking stick, there was no sign in the museum stating this. The problem was the way my husband was spoken to, some members of staff obviously need a lesson on being courteous to visitors, other members of staff I must say were delightful.

There is a nice range of periods and even of art - not just painting but sculptures and many, many objects as well. Was really intrigued with the ancient Greek, Roman and Asiand and Egyptian sections - was not expecting those!! Most exhibits have English interpretation panels (a few areas did not), but you can also rent audio tours if you want. Came especially to see the Dutch and Italian Rennaissance art and was not disappointed (love the Titians, Bruegels, Holbeins, etc.), with pretty easy to navigate layout!

All finds are presented in various showcases and clearly described (in majority in German). What is interesting some finds can be found in on-line database of the Museum.

On the first floor, are presented different paintings. In the several spacious rooms, divided by countries in which artists were born, can be found amazing artworks of inter alia Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,4.0,"FINDING THAT DOOR. Massive scaffoldings tell you that the museum is under repair. You need to walk into the square to find the entrance.

LOWER FLOORS. These lower-floor galleries show us ancient artifacts and the line between art and applied arts are blurred. You can buy an audio guide at the main hall (ground floor). Otherwise, much of the display texts here is only in German ‚Äì especially the Greco-Roman and many parts of the Egyptian galleries.

You can get a hang of the time periods easily: Jh. = century, n. Chr. = A. D., v. Chr. = B. C.

The other side of the mezzanine holds a vast collection as gathered by the Habsburg Monarchy. You can imagine this diverse assortment of stuff as what we in the modern days call ‚Äúhoarding‚Äù. A high-end kind of hoarding though, and it‚Äôs in their culture to gather a comprehensive ‚Äúsurvey‚Äù of everything from natural curiosities to art to utensils to exotic artifacts. Mainly art. And also jugs and bowls and bells and compasses.

From room to room all exhibits here are arranged along a (largely Habsburg‚Äôs) historical timeline. So you‚Äôll find yourself reading from the wall introductions about what happens to, for example, Charles V and Ferdinand I, as you walk through the stuff each of these monarchs is interested in.

UPPER FLOORS. The upstairs follow what international galleries do. They give you ‚Äúworld renowned painters‚Äù. You will see names like Peter Paul Rubens and van Eyck, and the other half of the floor is dedicated to the Western Western Europe (no surprise ‚Äì Italy, then Spain, then France). Think Caravaggio, Velazquez etc.

They couldn't speak proper English, so I couldn't understand where it was and we didn't have the time to go and search. They were really rude about it as well. So at the end we had to buy another ticket there just to enter. In the end we paid DOUBLE to go in. So much for booking in advance. So take my advice and rather go and buy your ticket there, do not think it is better to book in advance!

Budget the entire day for this, it will not be enough. Entry is easy with the voucher. No need to wait in line, go to the shop and they will issue your ticket.

The layout of the museum is superior to the Louve, use the app and you can get a free audio commentary in whatever language you prefer. Also in each gallery is a couch with an iPad where you can a description of the display pieces. There are some absolutely astounding pieces here. Breathtaking is a word that is often overused but completely appropriate here. I'd say a day here is an absolute must for any visitor to Vienna.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"The museum was the main goal of my Vienna visit, but I never expected it to be such an excellent introduction into the city and palaces sculptures' motifs as well, underscoring how much power was assigned back then to the art as a means of ideological visual education. Having spent 1,5 days in the museum I have made plenty of personal discoveries and enjoyed new for me artworks (e.g. unexpected parallel to the modern popular mass culture is a 1524 'Arya Stark' self-portrait bearing uncanny resemblance, in fact Parmigianino's enchanting masterpiece). The discoveries haven't stopped after the museum visit ended, because the next day during sightseeing I realized I recognize many of the city and its palaces sculptures' motifs and whatever I used to know about the big name old masters the most influential of them in Vienna must be Luca Giordano's The Fall of the Rebel Angels, whenever I saw its impressive replicated Laocoon-like convulsion-wriggled figures conveying the ideals of Counter-Reformation to the empire subjects on the city streets. Just walking the city you can recognize in the city sculptures' many familiar motifs, not only Biblical but antique as well (Hercules lifting Antaeus, Amazons, etc).

Practicalities of the museum visit: the air-conditioning wasn't felt at all in the big inner rooms with Roman numerals, I slightly felt it in the small outer rooms with Arabic numerals (as of 14th and 15th of July). Six or seven rooms were entirely closed for reconstruction during my two-day visit. For lockers you need either a 1 or 2 euro coin, but there's a manned storage facility as well. Backpacks have to be left in a locker, normal shoulder bags are OK. Photo of the permanent exhibition without a flash is allowed.

Temporary exhibition: Yan van Eyck ""Als Ich Can"". Probably I somehow unfortunately missed it. In the room dedicated to the special exhibition (0.5 floor, the same floor as the Kunstkammer, Egyptian and Antique collections - beware indeed almost no English translations of the exhibits, an audio guide cannot make up for all of them; the Egyptian rooms maintain specific humidity level) I saw only few works by the painter, and few works by his contemporaries like Rogier van der Weyden.

The museum building (as well as the whole square) is a stunning art object in its own right, specifically built to showcase the Habsburg art treasuries, its highlights are covered by audio guide, including Klimt, Munkacsy contributions. Seeing the interiors I couldn't help but felt as the Mask film protagonist having to recover my awestruck jaw from the floor. Really a mind-boggling shrine of a high art which symbols and messages are probably half-obscure nowadays.

We loved the Kunsthammer section which contains some of the most beautiful treasures from centuries of Hapsburg rule. All very beautifully displayed with lovely lighting - good explanations of everything in English. We spent much longer than usual looking at lots of the displays but there was lots more to see. I enjoyed buying a book in the shop called Insight Guide which gives you little stories and thoughts about some of the exhibits. We also enjoyed some of the art - Vermeer and Brueghel being highlights but the main focus was on the treasures. We also ate lunch in the central hall which was lovely.

The Egyptian section included 4500 year old jewellery, mummies in the original wooden caskets, loads of statues and carvings but again, no English translations. The Roman section also had some incredible artefacts and the detail and emotion on the figures equalled anything we can do now. My favourite was a sphinx which actually had the cut outs for the wings, like an Airfix kit. The layout is quite confusing though, you have to double back on yourself and revisit some rooms to get to others as there isn't an obvious route.

They have some excellent works by painters including Raphael, Caravaggio, Velazquez, Rubens and Vermeer. We followed Rick Steves' excellent ""tour"" (in his Vienna guidebook) to help us find and focus on the most significant works. One thing that is helpful to note is that the museum labels the larger rooms with Roman numerals, and the smaller rooms around the outside with Arabic numbers (1,2, etc.). I missed this initially and we spent a lot of time hunting for room 10 among the Roman numerals!

There were long queues to buy tickets when we arrived. If you have a chip and pin credit card, you can use the convenient machines and wait in little to no line.

The museum is not air conditioned, which impacted my enjoyment of the gallery on this very hot day during a recent heat wave in Europe. I persisted because the art was so good but couldn't wait to get out of there because of the heat. If you're there during a heat wave, be warned!

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,4.0,"I kinda wanted to give it three stars but felt that might be a bit unfair. Still, in comparison to the major treasure museums of other once great European powers I found this one underwhelming. The paintings in particular, while big in number, are low in wow factor. There were maybe half a dozen that jumped out at me with the vast majority being unremarkable religious fare that you can find in churches all over Europe. Maybe the Habsburgs just didn‚Äôt have an eye for painting.

Similar story for the antiquities. A nice Egyptian exhibit is followed by a blah Greek one. The Viennese treasure collection is what saves the museum in my opinion. There are a large number of remarkable objects here that give a window into the world of the well heeled during the imperial highs.

The building itself is beautiful inside, especially the main staircase and cafe area. However, it‚Äôs layout makes for a bloody confusing museum. There is no logical order through exhibition spaces which I found frustrating.

Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt say don‚Äôt go, but if you‚Äôre on a budget or short on time don‚Äôt feel bad about giving it a miss.

Linger at those that catch your eye and marvel at the detail, the craftsmanship, the harmonious composition, remembering they couldn't buy oil paint in a tube or ready-stretched canvases, but they did have many apprentices and helpers.
The Kunstkammer is also a must for the marvelous workmanship of royal ornaments and decorative tableware. The Greek and Roman section, as well as the Egyptian section, are also wonderful, if you are not too tired.

I found this museum on TripAdvisor, and based on the description, I decided to go... and then, did not want to leave. This museum is one of the best that I have ever seen! The Egyptian exhibit is awesome, with so many artifacts, sarcophagi, statues, jewels... Just for this exhibit, I could have stayed for a couple of days. Then... the old master painters... So many Rubens (yes, many, small and large - and very large!), and Van Dyck (one of my two favorites), and Rembrandt (the other favorite)... And just in case I was bored (hardly!!), there was the actual building to enjoy, with a grand staircase, and columns, and ceilings (OMG! These ceilings!) I want to go back, but the next time, I will get there early in the morning, and leave when they close (BTW, they have a ""grand salon"" where you can get food and refreshments - that salon is oh-so-grand!) There is so much to see and enjoy! It is spectacular! And on the way out, I went to say ""thank you"" to the information desk - and they gave me plenty of ""other things to do in Vienna!"" Am I in heaven???

The middle level is Medieval to Renaissance paintings. I normally do not care much for Medieval art but this was excellent. The commentary on the audio box is extremely helpful.
The Special exhibit was mindblowing!!!
The automatrons made out of gold! You cannot appreciate this without the audio as some of these automatrons move and play music. Absolutely amazing.
I don't know when this exhibit ends however.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,4.0,"The museum is divided into four wings, and I have to say that each of them deserves to be its own museum. The biggest problem I found is that the regular ticket allows for only one entrance, which forces you to rush through the museum and in turn, doesn't let you fully appreciate the collection. We started from ancient Egypt and Greece wing, and after spending over two hours there, we realized that we've only seen a fourth of the museum... I suggest going there first thing in the morning and dedicate the whole day to the museum. Make sure to take breaks between the wings to fully appreciate everything. Or just rush through the parts you don't care about that much... Check the museum layout in advance and plan your trip.

My opinion is to visit this in the morning, to buy online or have a Vienna Pass just to skip the line. I stayed there 6 hours, but average rate is 3-4 hours. For art lovers i recommend at least 4 hours for 1st floor. I really loved that they have sofas all over the 1st floor where is painting area, and I stayed for hours near my favorites painting. For Budget travellers: you can take water and sandwiches in your bag, just put your bag in one of the locked storage units and have snack breaks there. Otherwise there is a restaurant but it is crowdy and a little bit expensive. Just FYI in Vienna tap water is very good so you can refill your bottle.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,1.0,"Probably the most frustrating and disappointing museum visit of my life.
For the most part, I blame the despicable way this museum handles customers, and for a small part, I blame bad luck.

To start with the customer-service: it's a mess. Starting with the long queue I encountered outside the building, which - I assumed - had to be for the ticket office, so I stood in line. But then I saw some people disappearing inside at another door also marked simply as Entrance - and I kept wondering and frustrating myself: are those other people in on a secret? Is that perhaps a fast-lane entrance, maybe for people who bought their tickets online? Should I stand patiently where I am or should I go and check that mysterious other door?
In the end, I stayed in my queue, but dammit, that's not my ideal museum visit at all, when even before the start, I have to contemplate that I'm treated as a member of a mindless herd and I'm offered no information about which door leads to what. In the end, when I was already inside the building, I found that the other door also leads to a ticket window - one of the 2 ticket windows! - which is a joke. Two tiny entrance halls, with a capacity of roughly 15 people each, with one poor person sitting at a ticket window in each of them. So yeah, the mystery of the long line outside was solved.

Anyway, off I go, after a pleasant 30 minute standing in line - lucky that the weather was nice outside.

After my patience was rewarded with a ticket, I was finally free to enter - a gruff employee with a couldn't care less attitude and not a single word of ""hello"" scanned my ticket - and at this moment, my fate was sealed.
The ticket is strictly single-entry, so unless you bring a picnic (as I noticed, many wise people do) or you're willing to stand in another long line at the cafe, you're now stuck in the building with no options for bodily nourishment.
All right, all right - I had no plans to eat in that cafe anyway, but as I was moving about in the building, I couldn't help but notice the constant long queue there - especially because it so nicely blocks one of the main thoroughfares, so you constantly need to elbow your way through people eager to have lunch, if you wish to move from one gallery to the next. Great. And yeah, I understand the queue there, of course - not everyone is wise enough to bring a picnic, and maybe someone wants to fully appreciate every single gallery of the museum and plans to really spend a day there, so they need to stop and eat at some point during the day.

Anyway, we come to the museum for the art, don't we.
Yeah, right.
At my time of visit, the two main attractions were the Wes Anderson exhibition (its last weekend) and the Mark Rothko exhibition (in full swing). And I specifically came to see these two exhibitions - two exhibitions I'm interested in, for 16 euro - what a deal! So I thought.
Well, the Wes Anderson exhibition was as crowded as some more popular circle of hell - but normal crowds consisting of individual people I could handle. But there were many groups lead by some guides (museum guides? I'm not sure) - and gee, I've never seen such pushy guides, either. If I happened to be standing somewhere where their group was supposed to be, they just pushed me aside. Lovely.
My claustrophobia was soon in full swing so I fled Wes Anderson in search of Rothko. The situation was a bit better there, and there were even sofas placed at strategic points - as they should be - from where you can look at the paintings.
I looked at them with interest and also read all the info - perhaps I shouldn't have, because if I had been in a bigger hurry, I might have had a chance to see the main attractions of his exhibition, the late paintings.

And this is the bad luck part. (But also tied in with the non-existent customer service.)
Just as I was reaching the last, possibly most interesting room of the exhibition, I noticed that the room is cordoned off. I sat around for a while, waiting to be able to enter, but no such luck. After a while, a more solid cordon was brought and installed at the door. Why? For what? For how long? Do you need to pay extra to go there? Do you need to stand in another line? So many questions.
Well, the employee cordoning off the cordon and answering people's questions about what's going on wasn't exactly at the top of the situation either - I heard talk of some technical difficulty in the room, which might be solved in 15 minutes or an hour or maybe 2 hours, or who knows...
All right, it's something of an anticlimax, but what can I do. I went off to see some of the permanent collections, and yes, there's good stuff here, for sure, but I came for Rothko, and he was snatched away from me. Anyway, I lingered. And checked back on that forbidden last room about 3 more times. No luck. No further information. I'll never learn what was in the last room.
And I'll never return to this hellish museum which acts like a really high-brow institution that holds its customers in utter contempt.

There is also the famous Canova sculpture 'Tezey Kills Centaur', surrounded by lavish baroque details.
The Kunsthistorisches Museum Collection is exceptionally beautiful and rich. It includes six collections - Kunstkammer, Picture Gallery, Egyptian and Middle Eastern Collection, Greek-Roman Collection, Coin Collection and Library.

Next to Kunstkammer we were most impressed with the collection of paintings, one of the best in Europe. Here you can see works by famous masters of painting such as Caravaggio, Rafael, Velazquez, Tiziano, Tintoretto, Rubens or D√ºrer. And many more. Paradise for painting lovers.
One of the most important and largest museums was created from the Habsburg collection of works of art, especially from portraits, collections and paintings by Ferdinand Tirol, Emperor Rudolf II. and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. Such a unique museum rarely exists in the whole world.

A curation by wes anderson and his partner called Spitzmaus Mummy in a coffin and other treasures so having pre booked on line always with skip the queue as a bonus ( EVERYTIME) we headed there from our hotel. There's no obvious skip the queue ticket line so you just have to walk past the existing queues straight into the turnstiles where you will be scanned in. The cloakroom is down a short flight of stairs and is free. There is also a locker set up if you need one. In retrospect I should have picked up an audio guide but didn't think at the time and just headed into the exhibit which was beautiful. By the end of it my son was bored so unfortunately I only had time to take a quick look upstairs ( beautiful cafe) and a detour through the gift shop ( picking up a bendy pencil).

The coffee shop would be worth a visit on its own - done in the same decorative style as the rest of the Gallery (not tacked on as an afterthought), it was an art treasure in itself, with reasonable prices for its location. Travelling to the Gallery is easy, with good Underground, tram and bus connections. Can't wait to revisit. I have ticked a recommended visit time of 1/2 hours, but you could spend any amount of time here and find something to wonder at.

It is located opposite to the Hofburg palace and the Ring ( as they call it in Vienna ) is full of many tourist sites and all of them can be accessed on foot. The building is beautiful from the inside as well, but the displayed works are only good for art lovers.

In addition to a great art collection, with lots of Breughel and Rubens, they have major archaeological sections. Ancient Egypt rooms are done very well and the collection is excellent. There is a lot of Greek, Roman and Cypriot.
They have an astounding and unique collection of various gold treasure and jewelry collections found all over Central and Eastern Europe from the late Roman period. Their collection of gold and silver crafts from the Renaissance and later are fantastic.

Attended the Bruegel exhibition 8 January 2019 in a late afternoon time slot. The customer experience was woefully disappointing, but I score it as poor because the exhibition content itself was wonderful.

The event was shockingly overcrowded - impossible to get near the major works especially with several guided tour groups monopolising prime viewing positions for lengthy explanations. We ran out of time with the museum closing promptly at 6pm giving us just 90 minutes to view the work. Getting PA announcements reminding visitors of closing time added to the frustration. Surely important exhibitions like this should be open in the evenings to increase access and spread crowds. Signage on low rails was useless as it was hidden by the crowds and the lighting was inadequate.

My dealings with the museum staff on the day and since have demonstrated an inflexible attitude and a complete lack of customer orientation.

And what a display it is! From the grand building itself, the beautiful Klimt murals, the elegant cafe, and of course the tremendous artwork inside, this museum truly is a feast for the eyes.

Since this is one of those massive museums, I knew my wife and I would probably have to focus on select sections and save others for another visit. Priority number one was the current Bruegel exhibition (running until 1.13.19) for which I wisely scored skip-the-line tickets online well in advance of the trip. That exhibition nearly brought tears to my eyes! Yes, it was very busy, but there was time and opportunity to see everything and in detail. Just seeing that many Bruegel works together under one roof was mind-blowing!

Already exhausted after the exhibition, but very, very pleased, we took a break at the cafe and enjoyed some Austrian wine. After that we decided to carry on and see the beautiful Egyptian collection and the amazing Kunstkammer with all its weird and wonderful treasures.

Although we didn‚Äôt get to the rest of the collection, this partial visit was more than satisfying- especially with the Bruegel exhibition. We‚Äôll have to save the rest of the museum for our next trip to Vienna- I can‚Äôt wait!

Some tips:

If you intend to go the distance and do the entire museum, Thursday‚Äôs are a great day to do that on as closing hours are extended 3 hrs from 6pm to 9pm.

Also, if going over the holidays like we did, do take advantage of the large Christmas market that‚Äôs spread out between the Kunsthistorisches and her sister, the Naturhistorisches museum. Load up on some bratwurst and punsch, or other equally delightful goodies to help fuel your day of art viewing- especially if you aren‚Äôt planning to take a break at the cafe.

After visiting few exhibits, we went to the cafeteria to get lunch around 2.30. there was a reasonably long line which was not moving. At around 2.45 they stopped seating people with no announcement. when pressed they said there was a scheduled event and and they only have 7 tables to seat the rest of the crowd and perhaps all museum visitors who wanted to get something to eat. they did not let anyone buy pastries for take away. one could just skip this cafeteria and go outside, except that tickets are single entry and they were not letting people back in, even after the security people were told that cafeteria is closed and there is nothing else onsite to eat anything. the cafeteria could have put notices outside and inform people about the event, they should at the minimum let people go out and come back in same day or perhaps another day! Better scheduling and organization and letting visitors have some few choices could have helped, just like the weather outside the museum administration and staff are cold!

The visit will go better if you obtain a map so that you can keep track of where you are. We were fortunate to see the Bruegel exhibit which is worth coming back for if you do not purchase a timed entry to this exhibit before arriving st the museum. The works of Bruegel are not to be missed. The scope of most of his works are beyond breath-taking. Many of them contain more than 100 people, all with fully detailed faces! There are seven salons of his works. Take your time so that you can fully appreciate each work. Many are the subject of the recorded tour.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,4.0,"Wien

The excursion to the antiques was short as the lightning made concentrating on the partially excellent objects very difficult. One gets the impression that the intention is to avoid the dullness of the likes of Canova by dramatic light effects that clearly have nothing to do with the time the objects were first viewed, and therefore one has to even more than usual reconstruct the original structure, which intrigued me in an Odysseus story, a wounded Amazon and another female sculpture. For the vases, the drama being sought with background lightening so that the surface of the vase becomes comparatively dark seems even more counterintiutive. As if to mock the spectator a particularly dull Canova (Franz Ii) is mingled into the antiques.

The quick look at the front sequence of the first floor left the impression that the Habsburg were not overly successful in attracting talented painters in to Austria. Even the not really overwhelming French baroque part of the Louvre has much more quality. Yes, the post Carravagists, the Carracci and some other paintings are interesting, but the distance the hang each from the other is fully adequate only for the glorious two rooms with the Tizians, Tintorettos and Veroneses, yes, it also does the del Sarto really well, but in the remainder the distance underlines that there is more interesting baroque art in Schwaben for instance. But do not miss the small corner room with the Giorgiones!

This sold out show had timed entrances; even so the exhibit was very crowded. In front of his oil paintings people were 4-5 deep, in front of the prints only 2 deep. The one change that could have improved the viewing would have been to put the audio guide reference number at a higher level, to make it more easily visible without the need to battle to the front line.

The entrance waiting area had huge blowups of some selected paintings, allowing visitors to see the details of his work. The enlarged photos made his work all the more remarkable, as a 12 inch detail was, in truth, only a few centimeters, if not millimeters in the actual paintings.

Exiting the show we then wandered through the collection of other artists. These were rooms saturated with old masters, such as Rubens, Titians, etc.

There was a lovely cafe, decorated in a lush Viennese style, but unfortunately it was closed for a private party. I would have loved to have eaten in such a romantic and imperial setting.

The following rooms filled with the so beloved master. Lots of great masterpieces out of Antwerp churches. Emperor Joseph II abolished various monasteries and the Jesuits. Thus he had the opportunity to buy the artwork for a fraction of the real amount. We regret that they can no longer be seen in the places where they are made for.

The exhibition however needs some planning, I advise to purchase entry tickets in advance through the KHM web. After visiting Bruegel, you can visit permanent exhibitions of KHM and art lovers will not be disappointed since you can see great works by Caravaggio, Rubens, Rembrandt and other master pieces.

Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"One morning we went our separate ways, my husband to the Natural History Museum, and I, for the third time in my life, was drawn back to the vast and sumptuous Kunshistorisches Museum. My principal goal was the Pieter Breughel the Elder Exhibition, time slots of which I was disappointed to find sold-out online. Fortunately, once I was inside, I was delighted to find a place available for me in the 11:00 slot.
To quote the Museum‚Äôs website: 2019 sees the 450th anniversary of the death of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c 1525/30 ‚Äì 1569). To mark the occasion the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna is dedicating the world‚Äôs first ever major monograph exhibition to the artist widely regarded as the 16th century‚Äôs greatest Netherlandish painter.
Packed with familiar and famous Old Masters, this museum was, unlike the Louvre or the Prado, never a royal palace, but originally designed as a gallery to hold the fabulous Habsburg collections.
Armed with an excellent and indispensable audio-guide (‚Ç¨5) for the Breughel Exhibition, I hastened through the galleries displaying Renaissance masterpieces (Cranach, D√ºrer), Flemish Baroque (Rubens), the Dutch Golden Age (Rembrandt, Vermeer, Ruisdael), Italian, Spanish and French Painting (Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto, Raphael, Caravaggio, Canaletto,) and Spanish, French and English masterworks (Velasquez, Poussin, Gainsborough.)
The Breughel Exhibition was far too crowded ‚Äì indeed the whole of Vienna was busy that week, so I was grateful for the expert audio-guide which enabled me to focus on the exquisite ink drawings and paintings, sometimes partly obscured by taller visitors, and to note tiny, almost invisible details I would otherwise certainly have missed: the man putting out the fire on a chimney in one of the paintings, the riders disappearing into the distance, the woman with the basket, etc.
It was a delight being transported back into the 16th century world of one of the most brilliant artists in Western history, with scenes from the seasons, and lives of Breughel‚Äôs people: The Return of the Herd (summer), The Gloomy Day (autumn), the Hunters in the Snow (winter) ‚Äì the spring painting has been missing for ages, the pair of paintings: the Peasant Wedding and The Peasant Dance, and other well-known works such as The Tower of Babel, Mad Meg and Children‚Äôs Games. The latter is both bewildering and charming, packed with dozens of children occupied in more than 40 games, some of which are still played today.

Instead of letting the artifacts rotting away, it found a way to present the artifacts by engaging prominent movie director, Wes Anderson to curate an exhibit which consolidated pieces from various Museums and presenting them in one cohesive theme. That aspect of collection took two years of Wes Anderson's and his partner's time but the effort was definitely worth it. Apart from that, whilst we were there, there's also a special exhibition on Bruegels' works (the most prominent being the Babel's work), and yes, do book plenty in advance or else, you are going to miss it (as we did). Apart from that, there were other exhibitions on precious pieces from the Hasberg's royal family, Egyptian's collection and so forth. We ran out of steam towards the third quarter as the Museum is truly massive in scale. Be prepared for a large crowd of people, and so, our suggestion is to start there early.

Due to the large numbers it‚Äôs also quite warm throughout the exhibition.

I wouldn‚Äôt bother with this exhibition - I love Bruegel but this was just an exercise in frustration.

We also enjoyed the Wes Anderson exhibit too!

Museum is beautiful",Nov 2018
Austria,Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna,5.0,"From Oct 2 to Jan 13th 2019 you can see the world's first exhibition of paintings, prints and drawings from Pieter Brueghel the elder - whose 450th anniversary of his death (he lived from 1525/30 ‚Äì 1569) is celebrated with this exhibition. Vienna is the ideal location to host such an exhibition as almost a third of the master's paintings are in Vienna due to the collection of several Habsburg members. Nevertheless, most of the masterpieces are very old and fragil and therefor never travel. Now you can see these pieces coming from all over the world, Museums and private collections. A special treat.
It is unbelievable how relevant the paintings are still in today's world. Brueghel in fact was ridiculed by his contemporaries (called the ""Peasant Brueghel"") - but infact he was revolutionary and set new standards in many aspects, as a storyteller, a satirist and a social critic. Some of his detailed paintings are blown up on walls of the museum (today with digital technology and HD photography this is possible) , so you can study the little details of facial expressions and tiny things that occur at the same time in one picture but that might not even be seen with the naked eye. Plus he continuously makes allusions and tells allegories - so it is not only landscape painting but it really goes deep into what keeps society together and a reflection on how nature interacts with society and vice versa. Also attributes to the persons explain their position in society, like a little monkey in the basket of a woman means she is a malingerer. Or the beehive as a symbol for the church.
As you can see a lot of things need explanations - so while you anyway need to book online your ticket in form of a time slot before going to the museum, you may just as well book a guided exhibition tour which starts every hour or time slot. Or you can also rent an audio guide for 5‚Ç¨ which gives you even a bit more freedom, as you can choose to go to the painting/drawing where no people stand in front to listen to what the audio guide says. and once you have arrived at your time slot (you have twenty minutes plus the exact time to get into the exhibition) you can spend as much time as you like inside the exhibition.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,3.0,"It's a strange place. All the staples of a good European city are there. But it's still really boring. The people aren't particularly friendly. That may very well be a cultural thing as they don't seem friendly to each other either. It‚Äôs clean but that just adds to the vanilla feeling. It‚Äôs safe but almost too safe. That sounds strange but it makes the city feel like everyone is just going through the motions. There are some aggressive panhandlers in the downtown Karlsplatz station but beyond that it‚Äôs almost a Stepford Wives situation. There is lots of beautiful architecture and yet it doesn't pop. I know that sounds goofy but it just doesn't. It all feels and looks like Paris outtakes. On the plus side, the public transit is great. Do validate your ticket as they check regularly but the subway system works wonderfully. Don't even bother with ANY part of the Lipizzaner stuff. Especially the ""practice and tour"" portion. It was a total rip-off. You literally sit there and watch horses trot around in figure 8s endlessly. And you can't take any photos. Then you find out that's the only exercise those horses get. They just sit in their stalls waiting for the show. To me it seemed like animal cruelty. Based on my experience, I'd split a trip to Vienna with a jaunt to Budapest. You can see Vienna in 3 days and be fine. It's definitely not a Paris or New York where even multiple visits won't cover it. That‚Äôs just my 2 cents.

Our guide Herbert (sourced through Get your Guide) but is available direct also. Would recommend him as he was excellent and helpful on other places or museums to prioritise such as the Imperial Treasury and those which added little to your knowledge if you have visited Schonbrunn palace. This was the silver, imperial rooms and empress Sisi museum in the main Hoffburg Palace. Plenty of history everywhere you walk on this tour which covered Michaelsplatz via square opposite the Albertina museum, a former palace of a Hoffburg daughter and ended in Stephensplatz.

I thought the streets where rather wide and the shops were far and few. There were a few cute and interesting shops off the main street in little laneways. Maybe the time of year did not help. It did not seem like many of the coffee shops offered outdoor drinks/eats and they were far and few.",Feb 2020
Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,4.0,"Travel should be easier today, than when I was there 30 years ago. I was there during Maifest and radishes were everywhere. But thankfully so were pastries. I visited the Demel coffeehouse and bakery. I only wish I had purchased some pastries to go. I stayed in a hotel that was in a neighborhood in which I felt uneasy. I had not booked a hotel ahead of time, because my dad was ill and my trip uncertain. However, at the time Austria had booking offices along the autobahn. I stopped at one and was able to get a room. I didn't feel comfortable leaving my room at night and I got very hungry by morning. Today, I would book ahead and get travel insurance. I spent one day walking all around Vienna and returned to my room with a lot of black soot on me. When I got home my dad said they probably still used coal for heating. And that was the case then. I still think Vienna is worth a visit.

The outer suburbs of Vienna are hugely empty, rotting buildings...closed shops and soulless. There was a pervasive attitude of rudeness and arrogance amongst the service industry and I actually can count on one hand those that stood out positively...We really walked....and I mean walked a great deal thinking things would start to look up somewhere...anywhere!

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,5.0,"Vienna is exceptionally beautiful easy to walk around city. Centre of the city namely 1st district is the very centre of this rather elegant city. You can walk around and discover lovely little shops, and when you‚Äôre tired have a nice break in one of the beautifully decorated classic Viennese cafes. All of them will serve beautiful pastries cakes and really good coffee. You will not be pressured to leave or order more. The cafe culture in Vienna is such that, you can sit and chat or read as long you‚Äôd like. Even if there‚Äôs a long queue outside.. therefore if you end up in one of those queues I‚Äôd recommend to move on to another lovely cafe and sit down and enjoy that one , as I mentioned there are plenty of choices . Small antiquarian shops are filled with quirky antiques and jewellery , fashion shops are full of good quality (but very expensive ) clothing. Do take a walk around and discover rather than trying to take taxies etc it‚Äôs very small and best parts are pedestrianised. (K√§rntner Stra√üe and Graben and Stephans Platz - St Stephens Square ) and surrounding streets are a must see . Just outside this zone you‚Äôll see the ring road which is also very busy . Take the tram and have a look around .. the museums quarter, Rathaus (municipality building) parliament , theatre and opera buildings and the Hofburg palace are facing this ring road almost like a necklace around the very pretty centre. You‚Äôll also discover little plaques like ‚ÄúHans Christian Andersen lived here‚Äù a very unassuming building behind very flashy Chanel shop, or ‚ÄúMozart wrote -The abduction from the Seraglio - opera here‚Äù on another building etc.. I would also highly recommend to pop into smaller churches not just the grand St Stephens . You Amy even find yourself listening to a beautiful organ concert on a Wednesday afternoon out of nowhere. More pricier activities include watching the Spanish horses by the Hofburg palace (the horses are called Lippizaner ) but best to check before you travel and even buy the tickets to avoid disappointment. Museums are nice and Albertina museum hosts more Modern collections and exhibitions that are worth checking out. Wonderful wonderful beautiful city . But as many great things, not cheap. Enjoy!

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,5.0,"We chose Vienna for our new year break. 6 adults. We were not disappointed at all. There are so many historic buildings to see and beautiful churches. We had christmas and new year markets to visit. We used the metro to get out and about and we took the train to Bratislava for the day. We had some excellent food in many different restaurants.
The weather was fabulous when we visited, it snowed on our final day 3rd January.
New year celebrations were great in the square at Rasthaus. However the fireworks were cancelled about 40 seconds before they were let off. They said it was due to the weather, too windy but we are not sure if there wasn't more to it. Disappointing but these things do happen.
You have a choice of going to the performing horses, the opera, the orchestral offerings.
On New Year's day in the square where the new year market was, they showed the live Vienna symphony orchestra concert on a big screen, it was packed with lots of people waltzing in the square, great to witness.
On New Year there are 350,000 visitors but you wouldn't know it. The celebrations were spread over the whole city centre with stages showing live music of various genres. It was great fun and we would definitely go there again.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,4.0,"Not many cities can boast an expansive, beautiful and original historic centre like Vienna.

Some European cities were thoroughly bombed during WW2 and what available nowadays are reconstruction of buildings based on original plans.

Vienna was fortunate to escape such destructions and buildings built by great architects like Von Erlach are still standing until now. The medieval Stephandom dominate the skyline.

The Habsburgs were prolific builders and their edifices, statues and fountains dot the central area of Vienna giving the area a unique, unmatched extravagant character.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,4.0,"Beautiful old town of Vienna we explored on a paid 2 hour walking tour. Unfortunately the weather was pouring rain and with over 70 umbrella clad fellow tourists, it was very difficult to enjoy the experience. My ad ice is to book a tour grouo that has a maximum limit of tourists , say 25, and the experience would be much more personal and enjoyable as there is so much history to learn about this gorgeous city.",Dec 2019
Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,5.0,"It is impossible to describe Vienna's historical city center in a short review. I just recommend that when you will be there, do not miss details of buildings. Virtually every house there has its own charm and specific characters that are not repeated by architects of houses nearby. In my eyes that is what makes the city so interesting.
Once more advice, do walk down to the bank of the Danube canal (right on the edge of the city center). You will have to cross tram lines and find stairs that lead there, but these minimal efforts will be hugely rewarded :)
Finally, you can always count on a free cup of excellent coffee in one of the two Nespresso boutiques (near the St.Stephen's cathedral and near Opera) and I hope you will be polite enough to buy a pack of their coffee-cassettes in return of their favour :)

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,4.0,"Staying in the Museum Quarter for several days we visited the centre of Vienna a number of times. Starting with the parks on each side of the Ring take a walk through Rathauspark by the Vienna Town Hall, home to one of the larger Xmas markets & skating rink. Then Volksgarten, Heldenplatz in front of the Hofburg and the Burggarten beyond. Cross the Opernring dual carriageway and walk through the more formal Marie-Theresien Platz. Return to the Hofburg and instead of emerging through the arched tunnel into the centre take a right through a passageway and come out in Josefplatz and admire the various Palais and the adornments on the buildings. Head north and you will end up in the central pedestrian precinct where most of the high end shops are. Enjoy the area around St Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral. There are all sorts of interesting buildings to be seen.
A personal favourite is an arcade with a relatively unassuming entrance off Herrengasse called Ferstel Passage which runs out into Freyung. Apart from the shops & cafes check out the fountain and criss crossing staircase behind it.

Not only do we love the elegant Viennese architecture on the well preserved buildings along each street,but the entire network of streets is a sheer pleasure to stroll through. Mouth watering chocolates behind windows, scarf and hat shops, art galleries and buzzing cafes comprise the center of this welcoming city. Tourism is blooming and this has caused the locals to rather withdraw further towards quieter Viennese districts. A reason for this is the crowds and long queues at restaurants, cafes and stores which is becoming rather tiring ordeal for local professionals who were used to up until 5 years ago to a quieter city. Despite all the hustle and bustle, one must walk along the center numerous times to get to know it and appreciate its timeless beauty.

There are always things to see, without much pretence as to what the city is about: the grandeur of a bygone era and impressive exhibitions of art and culture. If you can stay for a few days, pace yourself. A few well-visited museums and attractions, with rest times in between, away from the crowds, are far better than cramming as much as possible in as little time as you can. Public transport is great here and prices generally not gouging with deals to be found on food, admission prices and package deals. Recommended, 5 stars.

Use the cathedral as your marker and you can soon get your bearings to visit some amazing sites.

It felt very relaxed and safe.

Did not use a walk tour but mapped out three full days to ensure all main features were seen and all museums we visited and buildings had excellent information points.

If you are going to ""do it your self"", go to the central information centre or cathedral as they were very helpful in allowing a good plan to maximise our time.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,4.0,"Of the 4 cities we visited on our last trip, Vienna is one of those cities that you walk away from a little confused. On the one hand, it's amazingly clean, chic and beautiful. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site (the historic center is, not all of Vienna), really influencing music from the early 20th century on. There are apparently beautiful gardens (so we heard - we never saw any!). On the other hand though... the whole area is just a giant outdoor high-end shopping mall. I felt like it was too expensive to even window-shop. I could never find a quality souvenir so I ended up getting a small snow globe from the train station (snow globes originated here so there was a last-resort reason for getting it). The whole place felt lovely but slightly commercialized.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,5.0,"Vienna has an extraordinary history as the centre of the the Holy Roman empire and Hapsburg dynasty.

The wealth must have been extraordinary and evidence of this is to be found in the wonderful stately buildings that seem everywhere in the centre of Vienna.
Palaces, museums, churches interspersed with grand shopping pedestrian streets with hotels, restaurants and caf√©s aplenty.

This is somewhere that you can definitely do a bit of walking! If we have any criticism it is that we sometimes struggled to find things and to work out where to go - signposting could certainly have been better.

Hofburg Palace itself was a the most confusing. As far as we could tell a large part of the palace is now a conference centre but persevere and you will find many wonderful things around Hofburg

We did not have time to visit anywhere near all the museums and sites but our highlights of those in and around Hofburg were (in no particular order):
‚Ä¢ Spanish Riding School - a wonderful spectacle in a majestic setting
‚Ä¢ Kunsthistorisches Museum - one of the world's great art museums
‚Ä¢ The Imperial Treasury - amazing treasures - some over 1000 years old
‚Ä¢ Sisi palace - devoted to Empress Elisabeth
‚Ä¢ Albertina museum

The Vienna pass saved us quite a bit of time because we didn't have to queue for tickets at some of these places.

We were blessed with good weather and walking around the parks which surround Hofburg was a delight.

We had a very nice time last time, so we decided to stay at the same hotel again this time. On the first day, we almost did a whole day walk of the Vienna city center with stops for coffee, cake/pastries, and lunch. Our walk included many attractions such as the Hofburg Palace, Sisi Museum and Kaiser apartments, St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansdom), Albertina Platz, Vienna State Opera, Maria-Theresa Platz (we walked there next day), the amazing golden Plague Column (Pestsaule), and beautiful and live Graben street with lots of cafes, restaurants, and designer stores. It was a wonderful walk and we did not get tired of walking for about 8 hours because the buildings, statues, streets, cafes, and shops are all amazing, and above all the building architecture is so beautiful and full of history. As expected, the Graben street was very busy and crowded with tourists. We went back to the city center area the next day to do more sightseeing, visit the Sisi Museum and Kaiser apartments, go to Maria-Theresa Platz, and see some other parts of the Vienna City Center such as National Theater and Vienna Philharmonic. We did not need any transportation for the city center walks. Only one day, we took the train to go to the beautiful Sch√∂nbrunn Palace and Gardens, which is about a 30-minute easy train ride. The walk of the beautiful and historic Vienna city center is a must when you are in Vienna.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,5.0,"Dubbed as the capital of classical music, Vienna has so much more to offer. Someone jokely said to me once that the butcher in Vienna plays better violine than a professional in Asia. It may be a joke but there is some truth in it. I said it as an ex-musician from Asia. One time I was on the street of Vienna and the firemen's marching band has an open concert. Gee, the pitch and tempo were so precise and elegant, they can easily be in any major music hall. And yet, they are just firemen playing. For art lovers, Museums Quartier can easily be a few days of deep exploration, not to mention Albertina, Museum of Applied Arts and others. Love food, Vienna cafes are the best for a relaxed afternoon either at Landtmann, Demel, or Sacher or the one in the corner. For a real meal, Figlm√ºller, Salzamt, Pfudl, etc. all in the center area. Walk a bit and you can be in the hip informal eatery cafe like Vollpension. And if these things cannot psych you up for a visit, maybe Sigmund Freud Museum will. Or you can get out of historical center and visit Schonbrunn or Hundertwasser for some awesome out of center experience. You would not be bored in Vienna.

The main trains are always on time, the trains are a great way to travel. The trains and stations are immaculate. The city is immaculate. The buildings are beautiful and the restaurants and cafes are great, Vienna is very spread out and walking on the wide pavements is a pleasure. The parks are gorgeous and spacious, watching the horse and carriages going through the parks was like going back in time. Six days was not enough in this lovely city as there is so much to see.

Austria,Historic Center of Vienna,5.0,"Walking the city center felt like a sheer conspiracy against me, a poor tourist who cannot make up my mind, should I chase the stunning photo opportunities on the left, or on the right, do I need Ariadne's thread to return to this or that place later. Old Greek, Old Roman and Biblical allusions everywhere.

I feel for those who live far away and face basically Paris judgement's difficulty with a looming Trojan war while having to decide between a Prague, Vienna or Budapest visit. My personal answer would be to look for the city spirit and architecture which one likes. As for me both Prague and Budapest are rather romantic, Vienna is about classicism which is somewhat sterile as for me. The first two cities have breathtaking riverside views and walks, Vienna compensates for its lack of spectacular embankment walks by celebrating Neptune's kingdom with fountains sculptures. All three cities are different and interesting in their own right, any of them cannot cancel out two others.

The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, as well as the late 19th century Ringstrasse lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"We had a short stop on our way from Ljubljana to Vienna. Honestly, we had no idea what we would would find in Graz, so this was a great surprise. One moment we were in a rather quick moving elevator, the next, we were standing by a beautiful clock and looking over the city. We didn't get to explore much, but what we did was lovely. I would certainly go back to se more of it.",Oct 2019
Austria,Schlossberg,4.0,Schluss Eggenberg is part of the Universalmuseum Joanneum. The ruines of the castle are not the main attraction but the view of the city is fabulous! An attraction not to miss for children: the longest underground slide track in the world. It‚Äôs constructed in the hill of the castle and we need to take a lift to access to the top (either taking the lift from downhill or from uphill). The children loved it even the slide is very short: 40 seconds maybe for over 60 meters high!,Jan 2020
Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,We went to the top twice because my son wanted to see Graz in a different time - first with the Schlossbergbahn in the evening and second time with the lift in the morning. The next time will try the stairs but the weather was so cold and don't have enough time. The most interesting thing is the Clock tower and the beautiful scenery from above.,Dec 2019

Austria,Schlossberg,3.0,"Pretty sure that the braver and more energetic a person is, the better this experience is. Since we took the elevators up and down, we enjoyed the views from the top, including from an incredible but seemingly out of place pagoda, but there seemed to be more to the experience if we had more energy for it. In fact, we did not even go to the castle at the top because there was so much walking even after taking the elevator.

The slide down seemed pretty expensive even if I had been brave enough to take it. But, then again, the elevator down was not cheap either though.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"It's hard to miss as you can see the castle from most of nearby Graz. There are so many ways up and down you are pretty spoiled for choice. There is a little rail up the mountain, steps up the side, tunnels that take you partially up the inside... your choice.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"Visited the Schlossberg many times and every time it's an awesome experience. You can walk through the forrest from a few different ways also my favorite are the stairs. It's such a great view of the city and the Clock tower is a unique piece of art. You can't go there with your car so be ready to walk about 10-20 minutes. Once on the top, you can enjoy a drink with a great view of the city. At night it's a fantastic sight on the city lights. And at the day it's just a mix of beautiful architecture and a great landscape. I recommend everyone to visit it if in Graz.",Sep 2019
Austria,Schlossberg,4.0,"The first thing you need to know is that Schlossberg - ""Castle Hill"" - has neither a castle nor a fortress for you to visit because Napoleon ordered the main structures demolished in 1809. There are interesting remnants to see because the city ransomed them: the 4-story octagonal bell tower (1588) that still chimes; and the clock tower (ca. 1265, with changes/additions through 1712 and complete restoration 1995-1997). A ""Gothic Gate"" re-discovered in 1982 has limited public access (with a surprising amount of tourist trash discarded at the bottom of the steep steps).

I found the historical interpretation here to be sadly lacking. There were a few signs giving basic information about the three remnants cited above, and others for the impressive 1544 ""stall bastion"" and the 1909 ""Hackher Lion"" statue honoring the 100th anniversary of Maj. Franz Hackher zu Hart's courageous defense against attacking French forces.

But mostly a visit here is about the panoramic views of this medieval city, which you can doubly appreciate if you get to the top via the Schlossbergbahn funicular, a real bargain at just ‚Ç¨2.50 single adult ride /‚Ç¨5.50 unlimited rides, 24 hrs. Great views all the way!

For more scenic outlooks, and a real kick, you can descend Schlossberg via the zig-zag staircase just below the Clock Tower. The 260 steps were built by Russian POWs during World War II. They will take you to the bottom of the hill near a large network of underground tunnels hewed out of rock to protect residents from bombing raids. If you'd like to see the tunnels, you can at least take the Graz M√§rchenbahn ""fairy tale train"" for children that runs deep into the interior, with intriguing special effects and a scary story narrated in German. It's fun and costs ‚Ç¨8.50 for adults, ‚Ç¨6.50 for kids, or ‚Ç¨27 for a family ticket.

Unfortunately, the kiddie train seems to be the only way to see the extensive wartime tunnels, which had 20 different entrances, protected up to 48,000 people, and served as a military command center. At least there is a decently detailed sign (excerpted from an online publication, Der Grazer Schlossbergstollen, by Barbara Steltzl-Marx) about what happened here.

Surely there must be more to see than flashing lights and fantasy scenery in 6.3 km/4 miles of wartime tunnels that literally kept this city alive in the worst of times. If there is better access or some kind of historical tour of the tunnel complex, I did not find it.

Bottom Line: If you're a history buff, I suggest you visit the Graz Museum in the old city center BEFORE coming to Schlossberg. At the museum, the story is fully detailed -- and fascinating. Yes, it's fine to walk on a leafy hilltop with expansive views, but it could be so much more with greater attention to the long, complicated history associated with this special place.

Not too far to go, being right close to Hauptplatz. There are a number of places near the bottom, as well as in the square to eat or drink before or after; or of course there are the options at the top - two eateries with outside seating and one enclosed restaurant which has a roof bar, but with limited hours of opening.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"Hill Schlossberg in Graz at the same time is a natural spectacle, the central area for recreation and lookout. An exceptionally nice place for a light trip. It takes only a short time to climb and enjoy the beautiful view of Graz and its surroundings. The city owes its name to the castle that was built more than 1000 years ago on this hill. From the Slavic word Gradec for the 'little castle' later appeared Graz. The fortification of the Schlossberg goes back to at least the 10th century. At the top of the hill is a magnificent castle built. The castle was never conquered, but it was largely demolished by Napoleonic forces under the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn of 1809. The clock tower (the Uhrturm) and bell tower (the Glockenturm) were spared after the people of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation. Up to the top can be reached by cable car (Schlossbergbahn), or Schlossberglift, a futuristic lift. But we climbed beautifully along a winding trail through the beautiful forest. It is certainly worth it.

Sclossberg (Castle Mountain) is a large recreation and walking area in the middle of city, with a 200-meter high hill in the middle of park filled of trees, flowers and greenery.
There is a number of ways to reach a top of the mountain, both easy and hard. The easiest is to take a Schlossbergbahn, a Cable-car, taking you directly to the top, the Clock-Tower and best view-points of the hill. A good option is an elevator going from inside a Schlossberg-tunnel, this way you are coming up to a little lower level, where all the bars and restaurants are situated. The hardest way is to take steps, the Kriegssteig from Schlossberg-platz, and climb up some 250 steps along the sunny side of the rocky mountain, a bit exhausting but picturesque work-out, rewarded with nicest views on the way. And finally there is a long, quiet and stressless promenade up to the top of the hill from the east of the city, beginning at the Karmeliter-platz and at the Stadtpark. This path is a nice nature experience, which allows to walk up with bicycle, children carriage etc.
On the hill there are a number of restaurants and cafes, a small souvenir shop, lots of flowers and comfortable benches, as well as a great view-points. Views over the city are best from here and allow a perspective in almost every direction, with mountains in the background.

Austria,Schlossberg,4.0,"Go up, take a walk, leave the busy city and sometimes scary trams behind you! Get a new point of view. Take your friends and family for a stroll to old trees and cannons and feel like an astronomer on earth, find your favorite destinations on a beeline map and imagine what life was like, when the ancient castle was not a ruin yet. The fascinating remains of the basement and castle moat are venue for all kinds of concerts in the warmer evenings of the year. So the Schlossberg (castle mountain) has a lot to offer, there is something interesting for the whole family. I prefer to take the lovely funicular up to the top and then hang out at one of the restaurants for a coffee with great view over all of Graz ( who knows it can play a game of recognising architecture from above), of course you can also find a shady place in a beergarden und old chestnut trees. How very Austrian! By the way, if you have a regular tram ticket for the day, it is valid for the funicular too! The stairs up or down along the big wall are something for people who like a physical challenge and no small kids. But there is many ways up, find your own through the lovely Sporgasse with its small boutiques and artisan food stores or through the Burggarten from the back. Discover whats your favorite part of it yourself!

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"Location that is ""required to visit"" when you are in Graz. Fortress can climb in several ways, which is great. One of these ways is the stairs, which are wonderful, maybe a little easier to sand, than climbing, but tastes should not be discussed. Another way is an elevator, an elevator that is paid for something small and which leads directly to the top. The third way is a walk, just like a staircase just not a stairway, but a straight path leading to the top. Fourth and my favorite way is climbing the funicular. The entrance is mostly paid and I think 1,2 E per person but we were on holidays so the entrance was free. The peak reaches 1min and the view is spectacular.

The fortress is very beautiful, as we were at the time of the holidays so Advent was up there, so everything had a special charm. People who love beautiful photos should not miss this because Grac looks like a palm and pictures are phenomenal.

There are various options for all kinds of visitors- if you‚Äôre feeling a tad adventurous and up for the stairs leading up to the clock tower, by all means, you can ascend via the stairs.

We passed the tunnel that was built during World War 2 as a bomb shelter and now serves as a cut through from one side of the hill to the other. The views of the city are beautiful and the clock tower and gardens are beautiful too. That is about all that we saw, but didn't really know how much more there was to see.",Aug 2017
Austria,Schlossberg,4.0,"The other reviews pretty well sum up this attraction and the views are wonderful. If you buy the combined ticket of elevator and funicular I recommend you go up on the funicular if you have mobility issues as there is quite a climb from the elevator station to the funicular station at the top. Better to walk downhill from the funicular. rest rooms seem to be an issue as the map at the top near the restaurant shows one WC location near the elevator station. In fact there is only one bathroom at that location, a locked (?) single cubicle at the wine bar for those who require assistance. The regular restrooms are at the base of the hill near the elevator station so you might ride all the way up only to have to ride all the way down again to find a restroom.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"Located at the top of a hill, Grazer Schlossberg serves as kind of a sentinel overlooking old town Graz. Aside from the panoramic views of the city that you would get from here is that you'll get to see closely its clock tower which is the only remaining original edifice of this castle. According to our guide, most of the castle was destroyed when Napoleon entered the city with the exception of this clock tower. You have a couple of options in reaching Grazer Schlossberg. You can climb up a steep staircase at the side of the hill, you can take a ride in a miniature train that will bring you up the castle, or you can also pay a minimal amount to use a lift that will also bring you to the top of the hill near the clock tower. Whatever option you choose, just make sure that you have your camera(s) with you and you're wearing comfortable walking shoes.

I do believe they have cable cars that will take you up and down the hill which are highly recommended if you're travelling with seniors or kids, or if you don't want to sweat a lot. Like most places in Austria though, this place could do with some serious tourist-friendly directions since there are many options of stairs to take when you're climbing the hill with no clear indication of what the destination up there is.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"We had the opportunity to stop and briefly see parts of this city on a drive from Slovenia, through Croatia, on the way to Slovakia. We had a private driver/guide for 7 countries on this trip, and he was always coming up with small treats like ... ""hey, let's stop in Graz, Austria for a few hours!"" So we did stop and enjoy a Sunday late morning and afternoon, including a lovely one hour stop at the famous Clock Tower park at the top of the city.

We parked our car in a modern underground car park in the middle of the city, and walked about 7 minutes to the old town. It was a Sunday morning, beautiful weather and we saw numerous multi-generational families walking in full Austrian local costumes. I lived in both Germany and Austria while in college, and it was Sunday, so families in Germany and Austria do tend to dress up, spend time with family, and GO FOR A WALK on Sundays. We very much picked up on this vibe as we walked in to the old town. Thankfully, there is an elevator for around 2 euros per person at the base of this city (small mountain) elevator, so you don't have to climb up stairs if you are not so inclined. Other TripAdvisor writers have said it is only about 10 minutes or less to walk up, if you decline the use of the elevator. Once up at the top, the views are magnificent - great tourist photo opportunities. There are beautiful views, beautiful gardens, and even a very beautiful vibe up there. Being a Sunday, it appeared there were more local people just enjoying themselves than there were bus tours and obvious tourists.

There's a couple of ways to get to the top of Castle Hill. One is to climb the numerous stairs built into the side of the hill. Another way, is to take the elevator built inside the hill, for the cost of a few euros. A third way is to take a mini-train, which is also built inside the hill.

Austria,Schlossberg,4.0,"Every time I cross the Slovenian border into Austria a concert of classical music starts playing in the back of my mind. When walking along the streets of Vienna, Salzburg or Bad Ischl there's always that hum of Strauss' ""On the air blue Danube"" waltz. The images are almost always the same: men with huge gray moustache/beard/sideburns striding along with me all sorts of Franz Josephs, Franz Ferdinands and the omnipresent princess/empress Sissy-like women figures are just around the corner, there are astronauts too somewhere in the mix. The impressive architetcure somwehat reminescent of my homwtown, the large and well kept, not to say pristine, buildings, the carefully manicured lawns and parks all tastefully tied together with a bow of a sublte hm-tza-tza, hm-zta-tza. It changes while driving through the countryside to Hallstadt or Sankt Wolfgang or some other ""alpine"" or lakeside destination to the almost furious Radetsky's march. The green hills and the high mountains with their calm blue lakes echo the yodeling (I don't think I've heard anyone yodl actually but...) voices and the fast paced polkas with men in leather shorts and ladies in colorfull dresses, braided hair and large chests. More or less that's the way how I see Austria and because of it I always like to go there. It almost feels like home but it's not, everything is familiar but completely different. I also like the classical concert in my head for the time I'm there. This time around we chose to visit Graz and I was pretty much in my Austrian mood from the start.
Having happily ""Radetsky marched"" our way from Slovenia into Graz I expected the waltz to kick in when we got there - but nothing happened. No Strauss boy's orchestras, no Mozart's genius as if my entire mental classical playlist decided to stop playing. It was a bit unnerving.
Graz, however, managed to make a playlist of it's own for me. The loudest sounds in the city centre that I can remember were the river Mur and the tram. The architecture is still impressive but it's not Vienna, it's as if Vienna went and met something new and modern with weird shapes, colours and sizes and decided to give it a go. There were moments when I thought I was in Stockholm and Oslo with very little of Austria in it. It felt worldly, I suppose, deffinetely multicultural and multi racial, vibrant, full of people. Somehow it seemed that german isn't the dominant language, somehow it seemed that the dominant restaurants aren't with local food and somehow the music changed from jazz (two guys playing a trumpet and trombone on the main street) to a sort of ""lounge music"" thingy played out loud in a big square that topped the city's library. Nice big plastic, colourfull, weirdly shaped ""deck chairs"" on a sunny august day with 25 deg in the air isn't what I expected but the proverbial words of Oliver Twist: ""may I have some more?"" There's a church that has Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini depicted together on a stained glass window - in the city center! The Kunsthaus museum (museum of modern arts) hardly needs any further description although we did get a 50% off the entrance ticket because they had only 1 exhibition at the time (you'll not be seeing that in my neck of the woods), the Murinsel bridge is basically a small colourful ""arena shaped"" lounge floating on the river a nice place to chill. As any selfrespecting old city Graz has it's own fotress on top of a hill overlooking the city the Grazer Schlossberg and you can get there by: making some 250 stairs, funnicular car or elevator - be carefull when buying the tickets for the funnicular somehow we managed to buy tickets with a 30% discount for the elderly (I must have pressed the wrong button or something) but the lady operating the car made no big deal out of it - still...There's lots and lots of Graz to see the Radhaus, the Eggenberg castle and park and ofcourse the Arnold Schwarzenegger musem just outside in Thal bei Graz to name but a few.
I guess the tune im my head changed and I like to think it changed for the better thanks to - Graz

The Schlossberg Hill ( mountain clad hill ) of Graz is right in the middle of the city center which is a forested public park with hill top fort. It takes a short time to ascend and enjoy the beautiful views of Graz and surroundings. The city owes its name to the castle which was built more than 1000 years ago on this hill.A city funicular that brings you to the top of the Schlossberg in a few minutes. A lift taking you to the Graz clock tower in just 30 seconds. And there are over 260 steps take you up the hillsides from Schlossberg. The overall experience is stunning.

To me it is a wonderful piece of history that is unstructred and wasted. It is beautiful but terribly disjointed. I am just a tourist in the city, however Graz needs to take the lead from the amazing work Ljubljana has done with its castle. (please read my review of their castle)

The steps take us to the Click tower. It's a beautiful structure and the views of the city of Graz are amazing. You need to walk more uphill from here for the castle. There are large plateaus with lush lawns and shady trees and the People had come to enjoy their Sunday with kids. There are two Cafes / bars at the top. The first one on the left after the bastion is a buffet type with excellent sitting. Try and take the valley side table, grab a drink and enjoy your day. It's simply superb.

The ""Schloss"" is the place to start and end your day. You can't miss it.. it's the only hill in town. The stairs zig-zag up the face offering joggers a beacon of invitations to treat. If you are not game, there's the lift or funicular to zoom you straight to the top... and back down again.
The reward for your efforts comes in the shape of magnificent views from the Clock Tower across the city and the opportunity to dine at Restaurant Aiola Upstairs with totally Austrian-sourced menu.

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,Many people say to walk up and down the 260 stairs - if you are like me that is not really an option. Instead you can enter one of the tunnels carved into the mountain to avoid air strikes in WWII and ride a glass lift inside the mountain to the top. Well worth the small charge in my opinion. Then you can use your energy to walk the top of the mountain to see all the sites - still a workout.,Mar 2016

Austria,Schlossberg,2.0,"we got up there on a national day (we did not know that before). the bergbahn (funicular) was full of people both ways and so was the park itself. the place of full of local people and there was a smell of sausages and beer all around. Not the worst smell but it was too much of it.

It may seem as half of the park is the memories of an officer who defended the place with 900 austrians against 3000 french, in 1809. No insult to austrian military glory and no doubt the guy was a brave officer, but it is quite amusing - if you see the place and if you know there were also walls on top of that tremendous rock to help the defenders, you would say that one could easily defend it with 90 people against 30 000 or 300 000 or no matter how many enemies - the place is so well protected by nature itself.

View from the top is also a bit disappointing - Graz was heavily bombed during WW2 and a lot of what you can see from the top of the hill, is the dull post ww2 modernist buildings, not a beautiful old town like you can see from the castle in Salzburg.

Perhaps we were simply not lucky - national day and uncommonly warm (for end of October) weather probably added quite a few hundreds of local folks wanting to spend time there. anyway, we spent there like 20 minutes and went back down without hesitation.

You can have a long walk along the hills in which it is located, and you can reach the top of the park enjoying the very best view of Graz and the clock tower, both during the day or in night.
The park is quite, well-mantained and extremely safe: I had my visit in night, but I felt myself always in safe and relaxed.",Oct 2012
Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"You can walk up (long and steep), take the lift (doesn`t go right to the top...) or take the funicular railway (Schlossbergbahn) which goes virtually to the top. I prefer the funicular as you get a changing view as it goes up the steep hill in the middle of Graz. There are lovely views onto the city with it`s stunning Old Town and the green sprawling suburbs. There is a rather posh restaurant and bar and a second cheaper eatery near the top and a modern cafe just above the clocktower.",Sep 2012

Austria,Schlossberg,5.0,"It can be really hot in Graz in the summer and many of the businesses and public transportation are not air-conditioned. It was on such a scorching hot day that we headed to Schlossberg. As I rounded the corner from the street to where the elevator went up, the temperature dropped at least 10, if not 20 degrees! If it hadn't been late in the day so we needed to head up before the transportation closed, I would have sat down at one of the cafes near the elevator and spent hours. To explain - the elevator is deep in the mountainside and the opening spews cool air out!

Anyway, once on top, the view was wonderful and it was much cooler up there too. Beautiful clock tower near the elevator! We walked upwards toward the castle and the funicular down. There was a nice cafe near the funicular that we stopped at and had wine and beer. Overall, a wonderful place to visit when you are in Graz.

(Don't miss the colourful troll in the station garden). The summit is a further steep 20 metres or so passing in front of a restaurant with very reasonable prices.

The sign said as crew before interfering with windows so I left my wife in the back carriage and went to the driver section.
She was preparing things so I waited before interrupting her to ask about window adjustmeny in the back carriage. ""Don't Touch"" was the message so I walked to the back of the front carriage to return to the back one and my wife.
As I exited the back carriage door it closed and I had to squeeze out.
There appeared to be a button on the outside of the back carriage which I pressed to have the doors open but No. Tram is moving off and I am holding on to the Grab handles.
The Tram curved to join the main line and stopped allowing the front carriage passengers see my waving from outside the back carriage .
Our driver descended from the front of the Tram, hands on hips and stated get in here or get off. I asked for the door to be opened so I could join my wife...."" in now this way or nothing""
So that is why my wife who finished Chemo treatment two days before had to go up alone. The up trip made no additional stops
The Driver of the New tram on the return stopped at every .
station.
Yes the view and experience was worth it but as many of the front passengers who saw what happened were amazed at the lack of even a ""look back"" before the Tram took of and the dangers it created.
Reported to Tourist office on getting back but being Sunday was somebody actually advised on Monday as promised.

At the terminus at the top of Postlingberg Hill one can take a walk around the castle surrunded by a dry moat with a few restaurants and ice cream parlors strategically located on the walking route. From the Postingberg lookout one can view the city of Linz and see it from a bird's eyeview spreadout in the valley with the Danube flowing through the city center.

ATtthe top, 15-20 minutes wandering around, 5-10 minutes taking photos and/or looking at the views over Linz and 1 minute in the church (nothing wrong with it, but just a typical church as you can find all over Austria).

The church was closed. I think we were the only people to do the Grottenbahn all day. There was a fair number of people in the caf√© though.

The Postlingbergbahn was really cool. Nice seats üí∫. A pleasant ascent to the peak, as well as ride down.

The tickets can be bought at conveniently located machines (note that some - at least the one we used at the train's 2nd stop on the ascent - only accept coins and credit cards, no bills).

The tram terminates in the Hauptplatz at the Danube side so wait on that platform. They leave every half and in the hour at both ends of the track. When you get to the top if you want to go to the Basilica first or get away from hoards if people! take the steps up to the right. We looked in the church and then went down to the cafe and had coffee and cakes and looked at the amazing view. It was about 6 Euros return for seniors.",Jun 2017
Austria,P√∂stlingbergbahn,4.0,"It's a short, maybe 15 minute tram ride from the main square of Linz to the top of the hill overlooking the city and the church that is perched there. I enjoyed every minute of the tram's winding route through the city and up the hill. It offers beautiful views of the countryside and makes you feel like you are really in a rural area although you are still technically in one of Austria's largest cities.
Technical tips: You can buy a round-trip ticket at the tourist info point on the square (if you do this, you need to validate the ticket before you board the tram) or you can buy a ticket (no need for validation) directly from the machine on the platform.
Make sure you are standing at the right platform, it will have the tram number on it (I was standing on one for normal city trams before I realised!)

Austria,P√∂stlingbergbahn,4.0,"My main reason to take a ride on P√∂stlingbergbahn from Hauptplatz to the top of the village P√∂stlingberg was to experience one of the world's steepest narrow-gauge railways and the steepest grade of any railways in Austria. Of course, for the serious amateur photographers the ride up to picturesque P√∂stlingberg will also guarantee you panorama views of the Danube River, Linz Old Town and beyond when weather is desirable. The departing point of P√∂stlingbergbahn starts at the Hauptplatz, not far from the Tourist Information Office. The nostalgic design of two-colored tones tram runs from a separate platform next to City's public tram stops; tickets are sold from its own self-help ticket machines located on the platform. You can buy a combined day ticket for ‚Ç¨ 9.40 from the machine or the nearby Tourist Info.Office(includes a brochure for the rider). This combined day ticket will allow you one entire round trip on P√∂stlingbergbahn ride (‚Ç¨6.20 if just buy this ticket ) and a 24 hours day ticket (‚Ç¨4.40 if just buy this day ticket) for unlimited rides on the City's entire trams and buses system. If you have a day to visit both Postlingberg and Linz Old Town, where you will see most of attractions, this combined ticket is a bargain. This historical bahn features low floor for easy access; chugs its way slowly on the narrow gauge track up and down P√∂stlingberg ; It runs every 30 minutes weekdays and every 15 minutes between 10.00 a.m. and 17.00 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. At the terminal on the top you will find a small twin towered pilgrim church P√∂stlingbergkirche perched on the hilltop overlooking the City below and the surrounding areas. Not far from there is a visitor's terrace for viewing of the Danube River and Linz old town including Hauptplatz; old and modernized structures; several steeple churches. On the clear day you can see tower of Mariendom Cathedral and a few significant landmarks. The best time to enjoy the panorama views are around earlier morning or late evening. Other times the sun is not at good position for your clear shoots if you are serious of taking some quality photos.

Austria,P√∂stlingbergbahn,5.0,"Linz is a large city but, during the snow period, it seems smaller and even quite cozy. The tram service is brand new and is quite excellent. Buy a ‚Ç¨4.40 day ticket. Travellers arriving by train should remember the tram lines running through Basement 2 of the Linz hbf and head towards the city centre, about 1 km away.

If having sufficient time, suggest the traveller take the special tram from Hauptplatz and head towards P√∂stlingberg which is in the hills just beyond the University. A good lunch and a pleasing glass of Austrian white wine can usually be had at the P√∂stlingberg-Schlosl. A walk after lunch to the former Ursuline convert, Ursulinenkirche, is worth the effort. Very few people seem to visit P√∂stlingberg in early January so the snow is often un-trodden.

When you reach the end of the line you are rewarded with an expansive view of Linz and the Danube. The small church at the top of the hill is worth a quick visit to see its elaborate decor. There is a viewing area and a couple eateries along the path, one of which is in an old ""schloss"" or castle. There is also a children's amusement park, so you may see numerous families on the tram ride with you. You can walk along wooded paths and enjoy the scenery before you head back down the hill.

As told elsewhere, the return ticket (May 2016) is approx. 9 Euro. However, for twice that amount, you can purchase a 24 hour ticket which will cover you for all the Linz corporation transport, both busses and trams - and the Postlingbergbahn.... so why wouldn't you? - Tickets available from the Tourist info office near to the start of the Postlingbergbahn tramway, as are (free) maps of Linz and separately maps of the transport network.

As stated below, Two types of tram run on this historic route; original-but-refurbished trams or modern trams.

One arrives on the top of the hill, under the Basilika of the Seven Sorrows of Mary. A kind of dry moat around it houses deer - we saw one buck with enormous antlers.

The trip up took about 20 minutes each way, with each stop clearly announced (in German), but also signposted on red signs at the stops (which also showed the current altitude). Best bet? Get to the top; go up the slope to the Linzer Tiergarten for a coffee, admire the view (not possible just from the stop), and go down the mountain again!

At the top there is a small church and some pretty good views of Linz...you will in particular see the industrialism of the city with the chemical works etc. If you are visiting Linz it's worth given it a go...but the lack of scenery during the journey is just a tad disappointing...Note if you are not good with quickly ascending/descending vehicles this may not be a good idea.,Feb 2014

Tickets are available for purchase at the Information centre as well as at the Haltstelle. Look for the machine facing the Information Centre. Be sure to activate your ticket before getting on the tram.
It's a long & steep ride passing a residential area just over the Danube before it starts its ascent through some lovely semi rural scenery & then rural & more dense vegetation. Note the designs of private homes & apartments.
There are a number of tram stops some with quaint stations & the best Haltstelle sign is at the top.

A great way to see more of Linz.

Once their you can visit the church enjoy the views over the city or visit the Grottenbahn which is great for kids.

If you like catholic churches you will also be happy. Very kitschy souvenir stall, looks like run by the church rather than usual commercial owner.

Austria,P√∂stlingbergbahn,4.0,"I have known about this tram system for 20 years and finally made the trip 2 weeks ago! The line has been modernised and regauged to 900mm so the trams can run on the rest of the Linz tram system! The trip begins at Hauptplatz, the main city square in Linz. The journey starts by crossing the Danube, it then got out and the stop where the museum is, I was quite disappointed to find it closed! I then got back on the next tram and enjoyed the view as we ascended the hill. The grand finale of the route is it passing through one of the towers of the old hill fort. At the top there's plenty to see and do! Great views of the city, a lovely church and a fairy tale museum! The next morning when I was on one of the regular Linz trams I saw to vintage trams crossing the Danube! I was happy to see them, but didn't know they still ran. I would be nice if they could have advertised better when the vintage trams run as I would have loved to travel on one of these!

Although it might sometimes be a bit crowded and it is also not too cheap the views of and over Linz are worth each cent in my eyes.

Austria,P√∂stlingbergbahn,3.0,"We decided to visit P√∂stlingberg with a large group on a sunny afternoon. The tram trip in itself was not much to write home about but the view on top made it worthwhile. There were surprisingly many people waiting for at Linz Hauptplatz which resulted in the tram being pretty crammed. I had to stand the whole way up which was not so bad since I had a good view outside at the houses and sights. The tram didn't go that fast and stopped pretty frequently so the ride lasted around 20 minutes. Walking up is not such a bad alternative after all and then you can enjoy the sights on the way more easily. Considering the waiting times for the tram and the amount of people that were packed inside I will probably walk up next time as long as the weather is good.

You can walk in trainers. The view from the platform on top is indescribable. I can read how crowded is usually there, but because of corona situation there were only a few people when I was there.

From around 10 am, it is almost impossible to get a parking lot in and near Hallstatt.
The one and only disappointment was that on the top of the mountain, we wanted to come down with the funicular (Hallstatt Salzbergbahn), and after long minutes of searching for the cashier (who was a worker we caught in his run because there is no kassa there), we needed to find out that you can only pay with cash, not with card.

Take a look and enjoy the view when you are there. Enjoy the sun, less tourists (but still crowds) and there is a caf√© to stay if you like.

There are different options to reach the skywalk. you can walk up the mountain, it takes about 1 hour (up or/and down). 1-way with the ride costs 10‚Ç¨, uq and down 18‚Ç¨. Or you take the combi-ticket including the visit of the oldest salt mine of the world (1-hour-tour) for 34‚Ç¨.
Each option has it pros and cons.

I would go in the early morning, or the late afternoon/early evening - when less tourists are there. For photos the late afternoon will be better. The sun is then in the back. In the early morning you can better make a walk from Obertraun around the lake. There you have the sun in the back, shining about 7/8 am in the morning over the mountains to Hallstatt.

I edged about halfway along it and took some pictures of the distant town below us but my brain kept reminding me how silly I was with each jolt of someone jumping on it because they thought it was amusing.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"There is a trick we have learnt in our two night stay which others have also commented on. Firstly make sure you spend at least one night staying in Hallstatt. Then when you are here, make sure you get up early in the morning to explore both the town and the skywalk without all the day trippers.

We first made our way to the classic view point of Hallstatt with the village on the right and the lake on the left, there were about 10 other people there. When then made our way though town to the Funicular and took the first funicular of the morning to the skywalk and had the entire skywalk to ourselves for at least 30 minutes before another couple joined us. It was quiet and breathtaking, there was no jostling to take the perfect shot and you could spend as much time as you wanted right out on the edge. Well worth the money and the early start.

The buses tend to arrive at 10am and last one leaves at 6pm. Outside of those hours the village takes on a different personality and you can truly appreciate and understand why it has been listed as a UNESCO site. But during the day, it‚Äôs a disaster, wall to wall people jostling for the best view points. There really does need to be some control over the number of buses and day trippers coming to the village as the crowds are ruining for everyone. I would not have the patience as a resident to put up with some of their behaviours.

Of course he sold us tickets he did not have. Lined up while he got tickets 20 minutes gone.Extremely expensive funicular ride. Everyone in Hallstatt must be a multi millionaire by now.Went up took photos headed back but hundreds in front also want to get down Got to bottom 2 hours gone. Walked to village no time to see anything as bus was to leave.Place crowded selling tourist rubbish.Hallstatt millionares everywhere.
This place is totally ruined.There are nicer lakes and villages elsewhere in Austria.To the locals I say take back your lifstyle. Firstly ban all buses.The place was not designed for them. If people want to visit make them come by train which arrives on the other side of the Lake.Then turn them around and send them back.Tell UNESCO to take back their listing, it has ruined what should be a sleepy little village. You have all sould your soul.
To all tourists I say give this place a miss it has been totally ruined.You see far greater beauty travelling by train through the Alps. I am sorry we were convinced to visit as we are part of the problem. If you must have a look at the place go to you tube.
Mass tourism has ruined many areas of the world and I am afraid Hallstatt is forever ruined.Get off the beaten track, don't follow the tourists and the tourist companies. Go find a village that has not be sold out to the Euro.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"Guys, you can't miss this tourist attraction. It's an amazing drive from Salzburg. I think it took around 2 hours to reach this heavenly place.

On the way you can find amazingly beautiful parks and lakes. You will find those typical wooden benches near the water body for you to sit and relax and have a cup of coffee if you are carrying it. The view takes your breath away.

Once you reach hallstatt, you need to take the cable car which takes you on top of the mountain offering you a 180 degree view. You can just get lost watching the divine beauty of the nature. The Skywalk is fine but you barely get a few moments to stand there as it's populated by groups of tourists for getting a photo opportunity. Better is to catch a seat in the restaurant close to the skywalk and have an uninterrupted view of the beauty all around you.

There is also a walk way that goes down the mountain which was closed but I am told it's a great walk for 30 odd minutes offering different views of the nature.

I believe there are salt mine tours arranged which start from the mountain stop.

If you want to find yourself by losing yourself in the captivating beauty of the nature - this is the right place.

Parking is the most challenging aspect of visiting Hallstatt, there is ZERO street parking, there are designated lots showing the number of open spaces available, but the day we visited, our lot showed 20+ available & there were 3.

We also did the Salt Mine Tour - cannot recommend, it didn‚Äôt measure up to other Salt mine tours we have done, but many people in our group enjoyed it so that is something for you to research & consider.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"Arrive Hallstatt. Park in the paid parking area. Walk a little way to the Funicular building where you can purchase tickets to go up and down, and there is a gift shop and clean restrooms there as well.

The Funicular goes very regularly, so the wait is short. Once at the top just follow the markers to the sky walk, the restaurant opposite it, the salt mines and the burial grounds. There are views of the lake from the top that you can't get at lake level. You will find a WC at the top too. Take all the time you need visiting all the sights, then take the funicular back down. They offer children, adult, and senior prices.

After all that, be sure to walk through the entire Centrum and look in all the shops along the lake. It is truly an incredible and beautiful experience. We also had lunch in a very good restaurant which we could not find the name of, but it was big and near the WC near the end of the stores. Part of it in a banquet hall and a little door will take you into the restaurant.

Rick Steves said in one of his shows on public television, that if you are going to Austria, you must visit Hallstatt. He was so right!

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"Hallstatt should be on anyone's list when traveling in Austria. It is one of the most scenic places we have ever been to with breath-taking views, especially from the Skywalk ""Welterbeblick"" which is a World Heritage Site. My husband and I have been there twice since 2015, once by ourselves when our private tour guide recommended a drive to Hallstatt, and again with a total group of 8 of our friends, also on a private tour in 2018. One gets to the top using a multi-level ""Cable Car"" that ascends to the very steep top in ~3 minutes. From the top and horizontal apex of the ""glass"" overhang, one can enjoy spectacular vistas of the landscape and charming town below. There is a cafe at the top with one of the best ""Apple Strudels"" we have ever had and members of our group all agreed after spending several days in Austria tasting many apple strudels served in Austrian restaurants. A walk in the town is also delightful with lot of shops and places to dine. SC

A few minutes ascend in the cart then you reach the summit where you reach the terrace and can walk around, go further a field with the steel viewing point, or chill and have a coffee in the cafe. The views are splendid indeed and differ in contrast on the mountain range whilst ascending on the funicular. But personally I preferred the beauty from the ground where more colours and finer detail can be obtained within closer proximity. But still a great breathtaking experience to be had and at least you can't spot that many tourists when looking down...

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"One of the, if not the most beautiful place I have ever seen on all of my travels. Views that are truly breath taking. The air is so pure and the place is so calm, it really is wonderful.

We travelled from Salzburg on the train, easy enough to figure out with a little research online, one change and then onwards directly to Hallstatt, tickets were around 100 Euro for two, but well worth it. From the station, there is S boat to take you into Hallstatt, a 5 minute ride and 10 Euro return for 2 passengers. The boat runs parallel to the train, so you arrive and it leaves and visa versus, very good coordination from the guys running the service.

Be prepared to do a lot of walking, Hallstatt is in the mountains so there are hills and steep climbs, although these are all perfectly manageable paths as long as you have a reasonable level of fitness and mobility, the little effort required is well worth it for the views!

We walked to the salt mine and the viewing platform, the views were astonishing and the natural beauty of this place is unreal, it really does look like a picture postcard.

A 10 minute walk (uphill) from the Skywalk is the world‚Äôs oldest salt mine. Since the mine is not suitable for wheelchair users I sat in a restaurant near the skywalk upper station with a cup of coffee and enjoyed the view while some people from our group went to the salt mine.

To go to the skywalk we had to first take a funicular and then a lift - both wheelchair accessible. The return tickets costs 16‚Ç¨ and if you want to combine it with a visit to the salt mine then it costs 30‚Ç¨ p/p.

Though one can enjoy the beauty of this quaint town by just walking around but a visit to the skywalk will show a different picture all together.

But it‚Äôs good to challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone from time to time, so up I went!
So worth it - the views on the way up are great, but of course the views from the top are just amazing. There is a walk you can do (which I sadly didn‚Äôt have time for, as I was on a half day tour and we only had about 2:15 in Hallstatt) as well as the walkway and viewing platform which sticks out enough that you can take a selfie and have the crazy beautiful lake and mountains over your shoulder. The funiculars run on a schedule of every 15 minutes, which is handy - and gives plenty of time to get up there (360 metres up) look around, take photos galore and make it back down if you have to rendezvous with your tour bus.
There is also a cafe at the top, which would provide one of the better views you‚Äôll get with a meal!

Being on a tour, we had the opportunity to buy tickets for the Skywalk from the guide, which was a bit cheaper and meant no queuing to buy tickets at the counter.

We visited the Skywalk as part of the trip to the oldest salt mine in the world. We took the return ticket to the salt mines inclusive of tickets up and down the funicular which takes you to the Skywalk (the hike would be too challenging given the incline with or without kids). The Skywalk is quite small but offers great views of the village of Hallstatt, Hallstattsee lake and the Dachstein mountains. Spent around 20-30 mins taking photos and admiring the views. A restaurant is situated just above the Skywalk which is great for a pleasant meal with lovely views.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"If you‚Äôve made the effort to get to Hallstatt then don‚Äôt miss the funicular up to the Skywalk. The views generally of the lake and mountains are fantastic, and once you walk out into the platform (be patient at the busy times across the middle of the day) you get an incredible bird‚Äôs eye view of the town of Hallstatt. The restaurant is perched a little higher, a good place to linger with a beer or lunch. There‚Äôs also a little hot dog stall for quicker food (and very good, great fries).

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"We went up this hill over Hallstatt with the funicular. Good thing is you have a few options when buying the ticket. We took the cheapest one, up with the funicular, down on foot. There's a path going down right to the center of Hallstatt. Or up the hill, but I wouldn't recommend it :-) We stayed there for about an hour, had a beer, enjoyed the great views... The lower funicular station is near two of Hallstatt's public parking lots but it could be very difficult finding a free space, especially if you arrive later in the day over a weekend (as we did).",Aug 2018
Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"Even if you are not in the area, I would say definitely come here and take in the sights. Beware of the limited parking. We parked 1/2 hour walk away from the town.

The skywalk is a short funicular train ride up the mountain in Hallstatt. Another small elavator up, and you reach the skywalk on the right side.

Is usually crowded, but the crowds were/are accomodating. Once you are at the corner of the skywalk, everything suddenly changes. The entire lake of Hallstatt and the neighbouring towns are all visible from a giant balcony. You feel like Saruman addressing his orcs! :D

The walk is designed very cleverly. It is slightly angled up from the sides, so that even if you lean on the railing, the forces are distributed so that you would not fall 300m down!

The sights are superb. Also a small restaurant at the top if you wish to eat.

I finally took a tour to Hallstatt, and the Village is everything I expected. The Village is tucked under the Dachstein Mountain range on the Lake. All the houses are painted in pretty pastel colors. Our
Tour guide Wolfgang secured tickets for the Skywalk. The Funnicular travels up the mountain at a 90 angle to the restaurant and skywalk. Beautiful view of the entire village, lake and mountains. Some ice and snow still visible. Wolfgang gave us 3 hours to photograph from the skywalk, or explore the village itself. I don‚Äôt think there was enough time to hike to the Salt Mine,
So my husband and I took a lunch break high above the village. The tour is worth the money. Wolfgang has a great sense of humor and took a head count at our meeting place and time. Do take the tour! It is a nice ride through the Austrian country! Bring cameras!!!!!!! And hope for sunny weather!!!!

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"This beautiful landmark is located above HallStatt with a gorgeous view over the lake and mountains which surround the area. It can be reached either by cable car [16Euro round trip\pp] or with a 60 min walk on the side of the mountain.
a. Cable Car
Station is located near the BUS Station [3-5 walk]. Cost of a round trip I find a bit expensive however there are alternatives and options in case of family or large group.
Duration is approx 10 min to climb and if you get a good seat,you can film the entire climbing and\or make some pictures.
b. 60 min walk
The option which i highly recommend is talking a walk on the mountain hill. Not only is good for the health but pretty much from all angles you will get extraordinary pictures before you even reach the top; and we did it in winter therefore I assume in summer you will stop not to catch your breath but simply to enjoy everything.

Reaching the top you can enjoy a nice coffee\food at the restaurant or visit the Skywalk. Careful if you have problems with heights. Everything is secure but it is configured that you have the best views and feeling of the height! If you got that out of the way, the panorama is exquisite. Just take your time find a quite place and stare. If you won't forget technology just for a few minutes, you should go see a doctor :).
I would image that in summer is even more crowded as in Winter when we went, therefore a quit place might be hard to find, but totally worth it.

Summarize : It is a must while in Hallstatt. If you plan a City Break it is definitely one of the attractions that I recommend seeing [seriously go by foot, you won't regret it; if yes please let me know why as I can't find any;)]

P.S. Almost forget. the mines 'Salzkammergut Hallstatt' are also located very near. We did not visit them as our child is not yet the allowed age [>4years] old, but I believe they could complement your Skywalk views with some Salt History and Fun

I was here during winter and there's a snowfall so it was foggy and the view was not really clear enough to take a photo. But the snow that covered all the mountains have their own charms. So if you want to come in the winter time it's better to check the weather forecast first and avoid the days which has snowfall because it's gonna be dark and foggy.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"The Bad Goisern and Hallstatt region is beautiful in the true sense of the term ‚Äòjaw dropping.‚Äô The Skywalk however is something else.

Set high above the hustle of the Hallstatt township, the Skywalk provides the most amazing panorama of the area, framed on all sides by the sheer mountain faces and capped by the widest and most clear sky you‚Äôve ever seen.

The cable car is the easiest and fastest way to the top, cycling or hiking however is also possible, with the hiking taking roughly 45 mins. No car access is possible to the Skywalk, and hiking/ cycling is limited to daylight hours only.

There is a cafe at the Skywalk also, however it is rather pricey and serves some rather alternative food, however does make a good spot for a coffee and quick bite. Note, the cafe kitchen only opens at 11am in the off season.

For a simply mind blowing view and a moderately decent salad and latte, you must visit the Hallstatt Skywalk.

PS: the cable car costs ‚Ç¨16 for an adult return, tickets must be purchased at the bottom.

You can either walk up a few steps and across a bridge or cheat and take the lift to avoid the steps. There are a few steps down to the Skywalk with either approach. The terrace is not enormous by any stretch of the imagination but you get fantastic views over the Hallstaettersee and the village itself as well as the surrounding mountains.

If you do decide to do the cablecar then I would say it's almost a given to do the salt mines as well! (31 euros or like 22(?) for cablecar up and down)

There is a restaurant off behind the platform if you're looking to eat but I am unsure of their prices ! There is also like a cafe at the Salt Mines as well though I can attest that the price are a bit steep!

The view was simply amazing ! One of the best views I had in Austria!

We went up on the funicular to the platform and found the experience efficient and not too costly.
I would really recommend walking down from the platform however, as there are many information signs on the path down about the history of the area. The walk was approximately half an hour/an hour and also took in a waterfall with a viewing platform.
We would recommend getting to Hallstatt early in the morning as by the time we returned to the town (12 noon) there were cars queuing for entrance into the car park.
Overall a lovely trip, however we actually preferred the views from sankt Gilgen to those on the skywalk in Hallstatt.

We opted for a single up journey (9 Eur pp). In 2 min you're on top, surrounded with unparalleled views of fantastic nature around....snow caped mountains, fairy tale lake and village. There's a queue for taking solo pics at the Skywalk.
Descending down took us around 45 min through a shaded forest zigzag path, with great views and a waterfall you're about to encounter. The path is very steep, in some areas slippery and requires certain physical strength even when going down.

It was the end of May and we were surprised to find the viewing platform relatively quiet and we easily got a table at the nearby restaurant which can boast views that are almost as impressive.

If one goes to the platform to see all of Hallstatt you will, however be disappointed, as the churches and much of the old centre lie hidden below the cliffs and trees.",May 2017

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",4.0,"Hallstatt village is like someplace from a fairy tale. We took the local trains from Salzburg (cost saving Einfach Raus Ticket for a group of 5) to reach Hallstatt Bahnhof and then a ferry ride across the lake to reach the village. The train rides may seemed long but the views along the way were rewarding. The ferry ride also allowed us to capture the scenes of the village from another point of view.

A stroll through the village from the ferry pier will take you to the Tourist Information Center. The helpful staff will provide the information you need to get to the skywalk. We used the funicular railway to reach the skywalk. Hiking is also another way to reach the skywalk but I don't know how long the hike will take.

The skywalk is where you can admire the breathtaking views of the village, the lake and the hills surrounding the valley. The Hallstatt salt mine is also in the vicinity. We didn't have time for a visit as we were to catch the last ferry across the lake the same day.

If I were to be fortunate to visit Hallstatt again, I would definitely stay a night or two.

The views of the lake and surrounding mountains are breathtaking. There is a restaurant up there too, so you can take in the scenery along with a coffee and strudel!
It's not every day you will visit this most beautiful of Austrian villages, so would recommend it. Once you are at the skywalk, you have the option of visiting the salt mines too, but we didn't do this.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"This is probably the only reason one should visit Hallstatt. Great views from up the hill. Ensure you check weather before you go. If it is cloudy, not worth it then.
On a clear day (i was lucky to get it), you can villages across the lake and trains running in the mountains. It is pet friendly. I saw lots of dogs up there.
Restrooms are available at base and at the top. There is a restaurant on top as well.
To get the best photo, however you need to stand in line since the overhang can accomodate only 3-4 people for a group photo.
Dont take the boat ride just go for this. Keep around 1-2 hrs for this.

On the second day of Austria Hallstatt
It is the most beautiful town on the lake side of the world and is a city that is praised.
It is called a town of rock salt and flourished as a place to adopt salt. It was a really beautiful town. We just baked lunch mass dishes, but it was very delicious to eat with the salt we cooked here! Ô∏è
It is also famous for having been registered as a World Heritage site and used for filming sound of music.
I bought it for salt souvenirs, but it is really delicious, and I am eating it using steaks and grilled meat bowls with herbs.
Pumpkin cider oil dressing was applied to lettuce, so it looked dark, so it was „Åå but this was also delicious.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"The Hallstatt Viewing Platform is located above the town of Hallstatt, Austria. Hallstatt is located on the western shore of Lake Hallstatt about 50 miles southeast of Salzburg, Austria (it‚Äôs a very easy drive from Salzburg). To get to the viewing platform you have to buy a ticket on the funicular train and head up the hill towards the salt mine. You can buy a single ticket for the viewing platform or get a combo ticket to the salt mine which includes a train ticket. You can also walk up to the viewing platform for free if you have 1-2 hours and are in pretty good shape.

I visited this attraction with my wife on a Sunday afternoon in late May and really enjoyed the amazing views from the viewing platform. Since I had not heard about this platform it was a nice surprise after going on the nearby mine tour. We were lucky that the weather was perfect and we could see everything in the town, the lake and the surrounding hills.

Overall I really enjoyed looking at the beautiful town of Hallstatt from the viewing platform and highly recommend it. This is a must do attraction on any trip to Hallstatt (especially if you are going on the salt mine tour). Also, go to the tip of the platform and look down if you are not afraid of heights.

My friend is a runner and I'm in the army so we hiked it in about an hour, which the signs estimate it takes. Beautiful views all along the way as you go up, and of course the platform is breathtaking. If you don't want to spend money to get up there and are fairly fit, I would recommend the hike. There is a restaurant up top where you can buy water or have something to eat afterwards... we had a beer to celebrate the accomplishment of the climb. Worth it worth it worth it.

Austria,"Hallstatt Skywalk ""Welterbeblick""",5.0,"There is a narrow path almost across the Hallstatt Tourist office (across the street). After walking by 4 - 5 houses, you find yourself at the lift entrance. It is like the one in Salzburg.

You will reach to the top and walk up a bit. It is a cute place to take photos and enjoy the view. I like the other side (right side) of the view for some reasons.

If you further keep walking up you will come to the Salt Mine Museum. I walked up but did not get in (was not interested).

Do not buy the salt at the exit! They are super overpriced. Yes, salt in Salzburg/Salzburgkammer is great like ones from Mallorca. If you like, just go to supermarkets in Salzburg where you can buy the same at the real local price.

Halstatt is the most beautiful village in Austria in my opinion. You can either take the funicular or hike (only if super fit). The mountains are quite steep.

The village looks small from the platform and it gives way to the mountains and the lakes view. I went to the salt mines as well. In hindsight if i were to go again, i would just walk around and soak in the beauty of Halstatt.

There is a cafe up there as well so you can have your coffee with a breathtaking view.

I found better selection and prices in the center of Vienna. It is a good choice if you go for more mid-range labels, especially sports labels, but for A list designer is a total waste of time.

If you are looking for simple, regular clothing and you do not care about design and fashion, probably you can find a lot of stuff. But if you look for the opposite, i am sorry, there is almost nothing that you can buy. Too many people, old and tern products, the personal has become indiferent to the clients, very expensive food on site ( 7 euros for a Wurst?)
And let's not forget the prices. If you look online, you are gonna have the same prices or even some smaller ones.

Could not find many toilets nor enough and varied eateries for an outlet that size though. The multifaith/musollah provided (next to Swatch and toilets) is a much welcome respite for halal shoppers. Loved the Burberry outlet which provided an immediate 11% tax deduction on purchases made using credit card. A purchaser only needs to make sure that the tax deduction form is stamped by the customs at the departure airport. A full day may not be enough for some to go around each and every outlet.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"We spent a great 4 hours at Parndorf. This is a really nice collection of high end designers. The prices are also good and you can find some really good deals and merchandise. It can get quite busy at times, but overall well organized. They have very good fast food options and varieties. The drive there is quite long. The shuttle busses are very clean and have wifi and move on time. Just wanted to list a few things we wish we had known before we went:
- The only way to book the shuttle bus ride is online. You have to select a time slot when you do so. The bus drivers are however flexible and can take you outside of that time frame IF there is space on the bus. The bus ticket also gives you a free 2.5 Euro coupon for food or drink, but you have to redeem it at a customer service kiosk. We found this out AFTER we had lined up for food.
- If you want to claim tax free, some brands require your ORIGINAL passport (yes, you Gucci). Apparently this rule has been in place for around 6 months. We did not have our passports with us (and we were an hour from Vienna so couldn't go get them) so missed out on tax free savings from that store, but all the other places we went to were OK with a copy or number / expiry date.
- There are very long lineups for the tax free claims, but you can skip them and do it at the airport instead if you don't want to spend all day in a lineup.
Overall, good experience. I would go back again, with my passport of course.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,3.0,"Google says that Parndorf has a population of approximately 4000 people. There's not much around, except for this mega-outlet shop, attracting bargain hunters from Vienna and Bratislava like a kebab shop outside a late night pub.

Honouring the mantra of happy wife, happy life, we set out to Pandorf on the shuttle bus, with tickets booked online. The driver did not check a single ticket outward bound. It's all part of the plan. Bring 'em in, bring 'em in...

The outlets themselves are well built and resemble a consumerist Disneyland. Colourful buildings and many ""sales"", just like sales around the world where what you specifically want is regular price and the stuff that wouldn't buy even in a zombie apocalypse is surprisingly 70% off today! I do jest, as there were bargains to be had; you just have to look hard, be willing to tackle old ladies to get to them and negotiate with some shop keepers who obviously are jaded from being trapped here forever...

We did like the mini curling though, set up for Christmas.

And the Nordsee fish was good too.

Finally, loaded with bags (and a happy wife) we set off for the bus. There were so many sideways glances as people took mental notes of how many passengers there were and how many seats. Would they match, or would there be blood sports to determine final seating? Surprisingly (in an ironic use of the word) the driver checked tickets on boarding, with those who had not specified the time being put to the side. Eventually the bus was filled and it was back to Vienna with the booty.

What I want to say is if you do not want customers to remove anything from the tray, do not leave your customers to see the products by themselves. You need to learn to SERVE courteously. You also need to teach your staff to communicate in English which is the most common language for tourists.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,3.0,"From Uk, travelled from Budapest to Vienna, having visited many countries, the Austrians by far need a personaality transplant, Rude people.

We got the coach from across the Opera House,We bought the return ticket from the information centre at Pandorf for 5pm. We hung about the coach pick up area as there is a kids play area, Burger King, Starbucks (‚Ç¨5 Latte) after waiting for an hour, an influx of people came, no queuing system, nothing. The two men standing checking tickets were like Mafia. Told us ours will be scanned last as we purchased them from the info centre and the rest did it online, no one told us that online purchase was more superior as the cost was the same.

I have a two year old and he let everyone else go one first. Once we say down, two last minute customers came and he made me and my wife put the kids in our laps( one child is 7) once I challenehed this, he threatened to throw me off. Avoid bus transfers and certainly challenge this kind of rude behaviour. Two miserable Men checking tickets at 5pm, 27th Aug for Vienna coach return, as I go back to UK ( proper standard of living) you carry on scanning tickets in miserable Austria.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Being from England we are somewhat spoilt with designer outlets such as Bicester Village and Cheshire Oaks. Being a lover of a good bargain both my husband and myself with our two young children decided to head there for the day. The outlet itself is pretty good, a great selection of stores and services. I would recommend if you are after designer goods at a cheaper price however what I would NOT recommend is travelling by the bus that runs from opposite the opera house directly to the outlet.
Our journey to the outlet was somewhat straightforward, however on the way back we were mistreated and uncomfortable to say the least. We stood in good time waiting for the bus back having purchased our tickets from the guest services. It seems there is no such thing as a queuing system not common courtesy for someone who has been waiting longer or with kids. The guys who check the tickets were rude and I would say discrimatory judging by the people they were allowing on the coach. When my husband challenged one of them when we were stood at the front and he was allowing others on he got aggressive. Eventually we got on and found some seats thinking the worst was over. They then came on and told us we had to move seats and put our kids in our laps (my boy is 7 and we had bought a ticket for him) and told us if we didn‚Äôt like it we could get off. Wanting to get home we sat uncomfortably for the 40 min journey back to Vienna. All I can say is disgusting behaviour from the ticketing staff. They certainly ruined what was a pleasant day out

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"You will need at least four hours here, the place is enormous and just keeps expanding. Admission: I am an outlet addict, and I can say with confidence that this is one of the best. So many outlets end up being disappointing, with the same items you could get in any mall, at about the same price. Not so here. Just the Escada outlet alone is worth the trip if you like that brand, with genuine bargains. The Tumi outlet is full of Japanese tourists for a good reason. You will find all the major U.S. and international brands at the full range of price points from everyday to crazy luxury. There are several restaurants and coffee shops where the less shopping-robust members of your party can take a break, and there is a children's play area. There is an open air mall area as shown on the image, but there are also several enclosed buildings containing more shops including some nice European shoe and sportswear brands. I'll just conclude with this anecdote: the husband of my friend met us here because we were planning to go out for dinner after shopping. He was filled with scorn about outlets and about shopping in general. Three hours and an overflowing trunk of his car later, he had a whole new wardrobe and we had to drag him away...

Therefore whenever I go to somewhere in Europe, I‚Äôm looking forward to going to an outlet shopping mall in the country.
I didn‚Äôt know that there were large outlet shopping malls in Vienna at first.
As it turned out, it‚Äôs larger than other malls I‚Äôve ever been, such as The mall in Italy, La Vallee Village in France and Bicester Village in UK.

I booked its shuttle bus which departs from in front of Wiener Staatsoper.
You can get a meal coupon, 2.5 Euro worth, by showing the voucher at the infomation center in the mall.
It‚Äôs a good point that there are lockers where we can check our bags for free.

When I visited the mall, many shops were holding a sale.
Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find good deals so much.
As with other malls, if you buy larger or smaller size than standard proportions, you might get a heavy discount.

Incidentally there is tax refund office in the infomation center, where we can get a tax refund in cash.
Please note, In the office, you can‚Äôt refund tax to your credit card; if you don‚Äôt have your credit card, you can‚Äôt make the procedure - a debit card is unacceptable for a tax refund; even if you receive a tax refund, it‚Äôs necessary to go to the custom in the airport and drop the documents into the post box. Otherwise you‚Äôll be fined later.

As we reached the bus, they said priority will be given to online bookings. What?! So, luckily 6 people from the online booking didn't show up. Else we would have been left to wait for 2 more hours. We booked a 6pm and after that the next shuttle is at 8. Even if you stood in queue for the next two hours there was no guarantee you would get a seat.

Let`s get back to the title - if you are brand addicted, here`s a heaven for you. But don`t expect 50% discount or near this value. Small discount, something for the fans.
If you know the normal prices, here you`ll feel a little cheated.

A rational human being won`t find anything valuable here.

There is a shuttle bus operating from outside the Opera and it does not charge anything for going to the outlet. On the way back you have to pay ‚Ç¨15 per person. The bus starts from under clock near the bus stop near the opera subway station and it's the blaguss bus. There were other ways to get to this outlet that is via train and a shuttle taxi which takes you from the station to the outlet but you need to find out more about it because we use the bus shuttle service. The bus stop could be a little confusing as there is no particular sign board so you need to ask some people around there. Check out the timings for the bus for going in for coming back. You will have to book your return tickets on line only as there is no cash system.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Good enough if you're looking for outlet shops in Vienna. There were a few designer shops (Prada, Gucci, Burberry) which offered merchandise at discounted prices.

Prada bags ranged from 300-400+ for their nylon bags, 500 euros up for leather bags. Leather wallets cost 270-290 euros depending on the type. 200-300 euro discounts for most.

Gucci wallets were sold at 200 euros up. Burberry bags were priced at 400 euros up. Products sold were limited and don't expect to see those that are still sold in stores (esp Prada. There weren't Saffiano bags available, just wallets). For designer shops, they don't usually show the price so you have to check them out individually. Quite hard to find out which are the bargain items. Unless you ask the sales person which are on sale or have special prices.

Other stores (such as Furla, Mango, Aigner) offered good discounts and select sale offerings. Furla wallets ranged from 50, 60, 80 euros.

One tip: before going around the outlet, drop by the tourist office to get an outlet discount card. Check your Vienna City maps if there's a coupon that'll allow you to get the discount card. You'll get 5 coupons of 10% discount for regular priced merchandise of select stores.

The bus driver spoke German n said ""No English"" while we try to communicate. Luckily there was lady in the group who volunteered to translate to all that there were more buses arriving.

Upsides
- many upmarket brands
- nice environment to shop at with interesting landscaping
- numerous f&b joints to have a meal or take a break
- good security

Downsides
- extremely crowded, have never seen so many shoppers jostling with one another like as if it was life and death
- truckload of smokers, even allowed to smoke indoors, terrible for people who hate smoke or have medical issues
- difficult to find parking

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"We made sure we visited this Designer Outlet in Parndorf on a weekday to avoid the crowds. We took the train from Wien HBF going to Parndorf and the shuttle bus coming back to Vienna.

The train departed Wien HBF at 08:14AM and we were in Parndorf Ort BHF BY 8:48AM.
In the middle of our train journey, we had to call Abraham Taxi to pick us up from Parndorf Ort Bahnhof and take us to Parndorf Designer Outlet. It is a shared taxi ride at 2.20 euro per pax. Travel time from the station to the outlet is approximately 5 minutes only.

Upon arrival at Parndorf Designer Outlet, we immediately proceeded to the Information Counter (next to the Bus parking in the center and opposite the Porsche Design Store) to purchase our ticket for the shuttle bus ride back to Vienna at 4:30PM at 9.50 euro/pax.

After ensuring that we're confirmed for the shuttle ride back to Vienna, we immediately started our retail therapy. ;-) There are plenty of good brands to check-out to fit all budget. It was also very easy and convenient for us tourists to process our Tax Refunds. We get outright tax refunds from there and all we have to do is to drop-off the refund forms in the designated drop box at the airport where we would exit from the Schengen area. We will just have to make sure we do this within the required number of days so as not to forfeit the tax refunds granted to us.

We enjoyed our day in this outlet in Parndorf and were very happy with our purchases. Of course, prices of designer bags are not as low as the prices in the outlet in Florence but for all intents and purposes, we were happy shoppers that day. ;-)

Will definitely visit this outlet again on our next trip to Vienna.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"Parndorf is approx. 50km from Vienna. There are really a lot of shops and of course, if you plan your visit on Saturday - it's quite crowded.

There are also a lot of opportunities to make a break and enjoy a good cup of coffee. There is also some entertainment for kids.
They have plenty of brands and still extending the offer this spring with some more shops. Additional discounts are nicely communicated via e-mail if you subscribe.",Nov 2016
Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Compared to other outlets in other countries, clearly this is one category higher speaking about size. That meant unfortunately it is very crowded and both shops and parking. I visited especially expensive brand stores: Tommy, Furla, Ralph Lauren etc. Tommy I was surprised at the size of the store and I see that employees were a bit overwhelmed by the extremely high number of clients. We spend at list half an hour at cash register to pay. Prices were quite advantageous but in many cases there were no more than small size. Products with common sizes, eg 41, 42, the prices were clearly higher. Anyway below the price in the store. The shoes did not have the heart to look. The rest of the stores I entered, some of them (not name names) was uninteresting goods both in price and by products. I never knew where I could find a toilet and eventually we entered one of the few restaurants in this place. sandwich, salad, water, coffee 20 euros. My advice is to come early in the morning, to have food with you if you want to stay longer, and very important, to make a clear list of what you want to buy before.

We went in Jan and found some excellent deals at burberry, ralph lauren etc. It's an open plan mall so it can get cold if you shopping in the winter. It's also quite far from the city but they have a shuttle which turns out economical. If you are really into shopping and want to check most stores give yourself 4-5 hours.",Jan 2017
Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,2.0,"Even if you have a specific idea of what you want to buy, in places like this you should go around several shops, perhaps back and forth. You will be definitely able to materialize your dreams here, don't worry about me giving only two points, but on the other hand, it will be a hard work to do. Definitely, this is Outlet, it is not just a name, so the prices will correspond to what you say. Not only you should look for the goods, but also you should be vigilant of your wallet (and I do not mean pickpockets only).

So what are my reservations about the Designer Outlet in Parndorf:

1. At the time of our visit there was a construction work going on. It is OK to expand and build new shops, but the management did not think twice about the comfort of their customers. Access to parkings is not well marked, there is no information about which of them is more or less filled up. I would also dispute the urbanistic aspect of this extension, because it will overcrowd the inner space -- anyway new shops are built on the space of a former parking, so the management could sacrifice some of the outer parking spaces instead of the ""inner courtyard"". It seems that planners did not think about how will customers circulate -- it will be as bad as now during the construction.

2. Customers evidently do not need to drink and eat in the mind the management. Again it is either a wrong thinking of the management, or they are incapable to attract more catering. Few restaurants there were overcrowded in January (who want to eat in an open winter air?), and therefore they could treat their customers as a cattle. You can wait in Nordsee, pick up your food, pay, and then find there is no free seat -- your problem -- ""eat it standing or dump it, we got your money"". This is definitely not going by Austrian standards and Burgerland's hospitality. Given the time that customers spend there, they would deserve a better catering.

My advise is that you plan to eat before or after the visit, but somewhere else.

3. We choose Sweet and Meet -- a kind of being seated and served fast food. It is well organized, your order is going to the kitchen immediately, so our drinks arrived, while the waitress was still at our table. The food was very good. A cold shower came later with the bill. The waitress overcharged us by 10 EUR, and she did not give us any ticket. So this is a place to avoid.

I repeat my advise -- eat and drink elsewhere before and after your visit, or bring your picnic.

3. The salespersons have a very variable approach. One of the ladies in Samsonite definitely did not fit into serving customers. She was on no help, and she became very aggressive, when we wanted to see the luggage from inside. However, the disappointment did not stop here. The ticket issued showed that we were overcharged -- she keyed in a non-discounted price. Unhappily, they had to return the money back -- it may be an issue for them, because we paid by a credit card, and they could return only cash. Again this is not my typical experience in Austria. Some other shops also treated their customers as a cattle, while other salespersons were excellent. The quality of service in this place is variable, but in average lower that generally in Austria.

My advise is ""watch your wallet"". There may be pickpockets in the crowd, as everywhere, but I mean that you should watch what you pay, not only what was the price originally offered. The difference between the offered price and the cash register can be disappointing.

So in summary:

This is a place where prices are cheaper. However, it is not understood by everyone that prices are cheaper, because it is ""outlet"" (getting goods directly from the production), and not because it is a second hand or so. Have in mind also that these are ""cheaper"" prices for expensive goods, and this place is definitely not loss making or subsidised. There are some friendly salespersons and good shops. Therefore, it is a pitty that they are overshadowed by some others who are impolite and dishonest. To be ripped off twice in a half day in a rather restricted area is a signal to the management -- however that management also does not show much interest in customers' well being.

Go, see and take care.

Going home, i approached the service counter and asked , can i buy the ticket here ? She replied yes or u can pay at the bus place. Since i was there, i bought the ticket. Ticket price is 11 euro per person. So when i boarded the bus, the driver requested for tickets. Those who do not have are required to run to the service center for purchase. Lucky i bought mine else i would have been left behind as i saw a passenger or two left behind. I saw forum people have complaint the inconsistent about the information.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,3.0,"I have to say that the mall itself is nice, quite big with a good variety of shops and bargain prices, but the bad experience comes from the fact that we were misguided and misinformed every step of the way. We were told by hotel concierge and by the information desk (at a conference we were attending) that shops close at 8pm and that the last shuttle bus leaves at 9pm... Of course all of this turns out to be BS!! Shops close at 6pm and last shuttle leaves at 5:30pm on a Saturday. Did I mention that even when we got there we asked the man standing Near and managing the shuttle buses?!?! Seriously?!?! Had I known I wouldn't have gone there 4pm. So when we found the shops closing down at 6pm we headed for the buses and they were gone. No taxis, no uber in that area (and can't even imagine what that would cost). So we walked to a hotel which called us a cab from parndorf, took us to the train station and from there we made our way back into town. It took us 1.5 hrs to get back. So was it worth the pain and effort? No!

Either go early in the day to enjoy and browse the stores at your own pace or don't go at all... Not worth the trip if going for 2 short hours.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Departing from our walking tour in Vienna city, we have arrived here slightly past 2.00pm.

We were impressed by its magnitude and size where I think, with hundreds of local and international well known stores in fashion, bags, shoes, kitchenware, jewelry (there are also cafes, restaurants and fast food chain here) etc located here in an oval-shape one storey building structures, one can shop until drop! Very nice and trendy design and layout!

We were given 4 hours to ""explore"" this place where guys, be prepared to ""fatten"" your wallet before you come and all of you will be spoiled for choices which one to buy (not what to buy)! Haha.

Are the prices really cheap here? Generally we felt so, at least slightly cheaper than elsewhere from our personal experience. We visit the Swarovski outlet here and compared the prices of the same items that we bought in its Salzburg Crystal World Factory outlet. And it was much cheaper here, at least by 10-20 Euros. They also had a promotional price items up to 50% (where the factory outlet didn't have). So we bought more here.

Another example was the Lacoste's shirts. Prices here were generally cheaper (due to the special promotions and discounts given) than elsewhere and so we bought a few too.

Well, shopaholics will surely like this place and their addiction may ""worsen"" since they have lots to see and buy and who can withstand the temptation? So this place maybe a great cum comparable substitute to buying branded goods only in Paris, Milan or London, what you want, they all have it! One can easily spend up to a day here!

Leg cramped and getting tired from shopping? Worry not. As mentioned earlier, you can easily find a cafe or restaurant here to sit down and relax over a cup of coffee or ice cream, recharge yourself before embarking on another round of shopping spree!

Remember, you can also enjoy tax refund here should you purchase 75 Euros or more in any one shop here. Ask for the forms from the sales assistant. You may then proceed to the Global Blue office here to do your refund on the spot (but they will charge you an admin fee) or wait till you do it at the airport before departure. Very convenient. But the Global Blue is always having a queue but with 3 counters, one need not wait too long and yes, the staff could speak in good English and even Mandarin!

All of us in our tour group of 32 bought something and were very happy. It was only at 6.30pm when all of us assembled and boarded our coach heading to Budapest! (but some still felt 4 hours was not sufficient!)

YES 7 HOURS :$ place was nice, inspiration, various brands, high end brand and normal brands. There are many coffee shops and restaurants. Also self service machines for drinks and chocolate.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Third visit here with my wife. Prices have stayed the same, both the bus ticket, as well as prices of most designer goods there. Take a bus from opposite the State Opera house. There is no signage at the bus stop there to indicate that you are waiting at the right place. Just stand around behind the main public bus stop facing directly the main entrance of state opera house and the bus will arrive about 5-10min before the hourly departure. There will be a piece of small poster stuck to the driver's front windscreen, indicating that this is the right bus (the body of bus itself is just any other tourist bus, no logo of the outlet). No payment is needed when you board the bus. Do rush a little to the bus entrance when it arrives if there seem to be alot of tourists around you, as this time round, our bus at 12pm was actually full full and there were some who came on the dot and were rejected due to a full bus.
On arrival, go to the outlet management office, located behind adidas shop, on the second floor. Purchase your return bus tickets there (11‚Ç¨ per pax).
Now start your trudging through, and conquering of all the shops. It's an expansive outlet village. Check out their website for the full list of shops. Some new shops such as Tumi, Superdry have joined.
Had a good buy from Samsonite..:) though do note that the luggages come with 2 yeae instead of the usual 10year warranty as it's outlet item.
Remember to tell the cashier that you need a tax free form if need one.
Suggest a full day there.....5hours aint enough for me and wife..and that's without any meal time or break.. Lol..
New improvment over the years is the availability of free wifi in the entire mall now.. Though the coverage is not steady or constant. Takes awhile for the connection to work and it only works when you are out in the open and not when you are in the shops.
Good variety and selection of cafes and fast food.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"There is always room for improvment in Pandorf Fashion Outlet. I'm a client (user) from the very beginning, so maybe is better leave some advises to visitors instead of criticising the Outlet in general. The original Mall is expanding inside of Parking space so is better now to park already in one of the huge available parking lots between the different buildings and walk for a while, even if carrying your shopping bags. Now you can shop at 3 different spots, each unique in offering exclusive or less exclusive brands.
Even if one knows the selling items are a litte bit outdated, B quality, the prices are atractive and millions of buyers from all over the World justify it.
Indeed the Gastronomy is the weak point in the system in my humble opinion. Rarely you can have a decent meal in any of the ""restaurants"" including the fast food ones. Think an independent food court with a variety of stalls from ethno to regional could be the solution, even better if some cxould be maintained open till late evenning, do not forget many people are from neighbour's Countries and if the offer is good have dinner before returning home.
These are only thoughts of somebody leaving nearby.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"I like shopping here and also there is a great cafe in front of stores: Prada, MK and Boss. Even when I don't shopping, sometimes I just go there for a coffee. The quality is excellent.
There's a huge selection of stores from high fashion brands (Burberry, Armani, Prada, Gucci, Tods,etc.), sports brands: Nike, Adidas, Bogner, Sportalm, factory stores: TH and Ralph Lauren, True Religion.
Also when you need to buy a present there're stores like: Villeroy&Boch, Rosenthal as well as Lindt chocolate store.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"We‚Äôve been going to the Outlet for at least the past decade, stopping on our way to or from vacation in Hungary. We‚Äôve seen it develop with all its flaws and features. It‚Äôs a great place to shop but you really should have a plan to make the most of your time. Here‚Äôs what we do (N.B., we arrive by car):

‚Ä¢ Arrive relatively early to ensure a half-decent parking spot. Parking is free and there are multitudes of spaces, however the choice ones fill up quickly.

‚Ä¢ If you are more than one in the party, first make a reconnaissance round alone, noting which stores you probably will buy something in. Take photos of items or note them down, especially if they are clothes. It‚Äôs easier than you think to forget what you saw where.

‚Ä¢ Hit the bigger and more popular stores earlier in the day before the crowds get there. The smaller (and often more expensive) shops don‚Äôt necessarily get so crowded and can be left til later.

‚Ä¢ Meet at an appointed time at a caf√© to rest and reconsider what you want to purchase.

‚Ä¢ Each person should take a car key so that they are free to deposit their goods without having to lug them around all day. Having said that, there are lockers near the restrooms where you can store goods, too.

‚Ä¢ As usual with outlet malls, many clothes items are often not available in the most common sizes or popular colors. Don‚Äôt get your heart set on finding a specific piece, as you often won‚Äôt. On the other hand, if you are willing to dig, you sometimes can find really interesting things and get great deals, especially when there are special sales.

‚Ä¢ If you are from out-of-town, inspect your purchases closely before leaving as it probably will be too far to come back to replace them.

All in all we are quite satisfied with this outlet mall. The personnel in most shops ‚Äì at least the smaller ones - are quite knowledgeable about their products and are willing to help. We are always happy to return and help support the Austrian economy.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Went there a couple of times. Some of the stores are amazing, love their prices and offers. But some of the stores are a total rip off. For example LINDT store is a total joke, they have fake retail prices and after outlet ""discount"" they are still higher than in their real store located in SCS Vienna. Just look at the pictures I attached and you will get the point. They other thing it bothered me was the false listings on their web page, they listed that watch in Watch Station is 80‚Ç¨ and when I came there it was 100‚Ç¨. So don't relay on information on their web page.

Negative: low stocks - many things are out of stock (size/color/design)! the worst outlet i've been to with little stocks in stores!

I have been to several outlets in many countries. This one is really Hugh. There are several buildings surrounded large parking lots. I had to park my car rather far away from the buildings because of congestion. Don't go there on weekend if possible. 2. More than 100 brands. If you want to compare one thing in different brands. Here is the place. If you are shopping mania, here is the place. Anyway,all brands here are world famous,so you can't expect to buy something real cheap here. 3.Discount. Even though they said that they gave you 30-70% off. My wife found that in reality,it was just around 25% off. Besides,you can't expect to find some new model that just launched to the market. If you want to buy some specific good from any particular brand. You'd better do some research before going.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"This outlet is better than other ones across Europe. A lot of potential opportunities to buy wear which is sometimes in some countries unreachable. There are only two things which can your feeling make worse. Average real discount is about 25 percent, but in every shop you can find 50 or more percent discount. But understand right, numbers of this super sales are very limited. Some types of products are very limited, so you are not able to find any outlet with toys. On other side location of this outlet is real great, near to Vienna, Bratislava, Gyor and reachable from CZ.
My personal feeling is that, if I want something what I ""want"", mainly I didn't find good opportunity (low discount, not my size) but everytime i found in this outlet something what impress me to buy it immediately.
So conclusion is: if you want fine outlet, this is really good choice.

Imagine my horror last evening when I took it out and found it was made in China! This is cheating! Even when we paid for our purchases, the salesperson was so rude and made no apology when we pointed out to her that she didn't deduct the 10% that we were entitled to.

Shopping......I've seen a lot of reviews and I would like to point out that this is an outlet so keep your eyes open. Don't go looking for good deals at Nike or Mango stores, best deals are in high end stores like Prada, Gucci, Burberry, Hugo Boss, Zegna and so on. For example you can buy sunglasses in Prada or Gucci stores for between 80 and 120 euros. I highly recommend Bally store as they often have some really good deals.
You can't cover the whole outlet in one day (if you are a shopaholic)!
There are lots of bars and places to get fast food.
I suggest you visit their website before you go there so you can check out all the latest offerings, best deals come in mid-December.
Also, to be on a safe side, check your goods before you get out of the store just in case there is an issue.

I was very dissapointed when i realised that Miss Sixty and Stiefelk√∂nig stores were closed since i planned on getting some new jeans and shoes like Salvatore Ferragamo and Dolce&Gabbana. I made a plan as I usually do, and found this:
@Swarovski- two bracelets (‚Ç¨29 and ‚Ç¨34)
@Polo Raplh Lauren- sweater for ‚Ç¨45
@Home&Cook- Tefal mixer ‚Ç¨20, Rowenta hairdryer ‚Ç¨9 (1600w, travel size)
@Fossil - Erin bag ‚Ç¨40
@Mexx - dress, t-shirt, denim skirt and jeans (for kids) all for ‚Ç¨30
@The Cosmetics Company- Estee Lauder powder ‚Ç¨8, Clinique foundation ‚Ç¨7
@The Body Shop- mineral foundation ‚Ç¨4
@Jones- satin blazer ‚Ç¨25
@Stefanel - wool poncho ‚Ç¨31
@Liebeskind- belt ‚Ç¨10
@Calvin Klein underwear- bra ‚Ç¨20
@intimissimi - 2x basic bras for ‚Ç¨20

Unfortunately, on Late night shopping this August sport stores like Puma/Nike/Adidas had no men sneakers in size 44 that were under ‚Ç¨50 :/
Diesel was expensive for its offer, Furla had nothing under ‚Ç¨150 even though some bags were advertised for only ‚Ç¨40.
On the other side, I found new store (Watch...something :) that has some great Michael Kors bracelets (pricey, but gorgeous)! Also, we can expect La Perla store opening, very excited to see prices as they have amazing underwear!

We are unable to make on the bus. The lady told us that another bus and taxi will coming up for another half an hour. after that, the lady said the bus will come at 6. Then finally the bus come on 7 pm which is the next round after 5 pm. We was told to stay in line instead of we can go out and shopping more. The worst outlet ever paid money and waited for nothing",Jun 2014
Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"After having failed to get anything to wear in Milan (I am plus size girl), I was very lucky here in Parndorf. No need to talk about how many shops they have etc, as all that mentioned below.

Worth to highlight that I did not experienced any crowded buses or long queus in the shops even on Friday evening. Every shop assistant spoke English, and I should say they were really helpful.

The only issue I would like to stress is transportation. The las bus on weekdays leaves at the same time when shops get closed. When you are on another end shopping it is a bit difficult to watch the clock and be on time! There is a special taxi to the train station - great, but they pick up only those with tickets, no cash. We did not know that the tickets shall be purchased at the cash desk, not with the driver - and the driver on the way from Vienna did not told that, although he said ""you pay on the way back"". Luckily the way to the Parndorf railway station is 2 km only - and the sceneries are quite pictoresque. The suggestion could be (1) riding the last bus about half an hour after COB, and (2) adding info on tickets to the outlet map, for instance.

Despite of this minor issue, we enjoyed our time in Parndorf outlet - and now we enjoy our new outfits! I definitely recommend visiting Parndorf outlet if you happen to Vienna or Bratislava (bus from Bratislava is cheaper ;))

Not much different from other outlets. But the advantage of this one is that the shops are sheltered, so you never worry about rainy weather.

It also has the customer service which service your tax refund requirement. If you spend 75 euro in one store, you get tax refund of approximately 10 or more percent. Tip for shopping to get better tax refund to to put more items in one receipt under one name so that the refund percentage is higher versus the tax refund fee charge.",May 2014
Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,Very long list of top brands. A lot of special dicounts. Very helpfull staff almost in every boutique. One day is not enough to visit all the shops.,May 2014
Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,2.0,"If you are from outside Europe, this is a great place to shop as there are many European brands which are more difficult to find and more expensive outside the EU. Add the fact that you get VAT back for purchases more than 75‚Ç¨ at a single shop, means things a cheaper by about another 10%.

The only is sure is that it is very crowded. There are shuttle buses which leave from Vienna every hour or 2 depending on the day but they are always long queues getting there and even worse coming back. Wait for the bus at the queue at least half an hour before your planned trip. There a queues at the Global Blue refunds kiosk and at most food outlets as well so plan to spend more time than expected.

Many of the shopkeepers do not speak English and are a bit rushed to offer good service, because of the crowds. I would recommend going there only if you know what to buy. It's not ideal for a leisurely shopping trip. There were areas of advertised free wifi which could not really be connected to.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"I have visited this outlet twice, in August and November 2013. Each time i checked on their website (which is always updated) and saw some great reductions. So, lets start :)
Prada was a huge dissapointment since they had just smallest or biggest sizes or it wasn't cheap (‚Ç¨150-400 for shoes, bags were about ‚Ç¨600).
Michael Kors has so much to offer, but its bit pricey (got my wallet for ‚Ç¨60).
In Furla they had some great shoes for i think ‚Ç¨20, but limited sizes (didnt get those). Saw a beautiful small black leather wallet for ‚Ç¨55.
Stiefelk√∂nig had some great designer shoes, so i got mine Sergio Rossi's for only ‚Ç¨119!
Baldinini has some weird shoe sizes for me, but overall i would recommend it.
Pollini was awfull, not worth my time.
In Armani i got some underwear for ‚Ç¨5-10, but the quality is not that great, considering it is Armani. But for that price its super.
Fossil- nothing special.
The Body shop was great, bought a mineral foundation for ‚Ç¨4!
The cosmetics company is a bit strange, not looking as i expected it would be, but found estee lauder double wear for ‚Ç¨9 (only one shade), Bobby Brown pallete for only ‚Ç¨20.
Calvin Klein was dissapointing.
Gerry Weber is great, its huge and it has a lot of clothes to choose from, but i really needed some pointers like ""blazers"" ""skirts"" etc. You kinda get lost in there :) prices are veeery good, found a blazer for ‚Ç¨35, cardigan was ‚Ç¨20.
Vero moda/jack&jones is great store, found a sweater for ‚Ç¨4, t-shirt was ‚Ç¨10, sweatshirts for men were only ‚Ç¨10...
Only has some great offers on a few articles, but generally its not that good.
Vossen had some great cheap towels and they are such a great quality.
O'Neil had a special offer for a shirt that was in stock even in the evening, and the guys from that store were super helpful since i was buying for my brother.
Bench had no hats which was why i went there in the first place :/
Fissler has some great offers, both times i ended up buying kitchen knives.
Guess is awfull, wont be going there next time.
Reebok had a great offer so i bought ‚Ç¨12 snickers. But clothes was another story- not so cheap or no sizes.
Mango is great if you have time and will to dig in cause its a MESS :) shirt, skirt and a jacket for 40‚Ç¨!
Hallhuber also has great clothes, had my coat for only ‚Ç¨60! But they should male sale pieces a bit more visible.
Oh, and do not miss Spada shoes! I keep getting asked about my shoes for the past few months :) they weren't cheap, but sometimes they have big sales on some shoe models.
Polo Raplh Lauren was the biggest discovery- it's my new favorite store! (Especially when they send me a discount voucher for further reductions)
I believe that's all for now, will be posting a new review in June

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,It is one of the largest design outlets in Central Europe and offers most fashion brands on a big discount. Most shops are very small and mostly very full.

The buses are very comfortable and have free WIFI inside.The tickets for the bus can be bought upon return in the Outlet (information office), and they cost around 8,50 euro. The drivers of the buses are really polite and can give you all kinds of informations.
The Outlet is huge, and you need at least one day to go all around. There is a great choice of stores for everybody and great sales of all kinds. Especially in the high designer stores like Gucci, Burberry etc. All kind of cards are accepted.
There are bars and little restaurants all around to take a break and rest.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"For anyone who has visited the numerous outlets in the USA you would experience a sense of deja vu.

The concept is the same (past seasons clothing at discounted prices) and the layout is the same, ie outdoor set up (ie not in a mall).

The selection is quite extension considering it's in Vienna which is not known for its shopping.

The only drawback is the lack of shuttle buses to and from the place. The buses only runs from Thurs to Sun and even then it is at very limited times.

When we got to the bus stop 20min beforehand, the 1st bus was already full. But fortunately the 2nd bus came and we managed to get one, that was full again, but I'm not sure if there was a 3rd bus. If you are going to have 3 buses going there might as well spread it out a bit.

Remember to buy your bus ticket. You buy it at the centre, ie it's free to go to the centre, and they only charge you on the return.

Shopping here is good at reasonable prices, comparable to the USA again. There were quite a few nice cafes to eat.

All in all, worth a visit if you like shopping.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,4.0,"Parndorf is an Outlet which I would recommend to any visitor in Vienna to check out. A 40 minute drive from Vienna city centre, the Outlet is closer from the airport...approx 20 mins. It has both American and European brands (like RL, Gucci, Prada, Michel Kors, Burberry, Tommy, Diesel, Armani, Bally, Lindt, Boss...etc) though the value deals are better on the European brands.

The location also offers some good options for eating and taking coffee breaks during your shopping outing. There is never a guarantee of getting 'good deals' as with all outlets but for me there was always something that made the trip worthwhile. Having visited the place more than 5 times I must admit that I never returned empty handed or disappointed.

Driving there is a better option if possible as you can then decide your own timetable; for those where that is not an option there are buses which leave from Vienna city centre opposite the opera house in zone 1, and bring you back to the same spot. Overall a good outing!

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"I am regular customer since 2007, when I was on Erasmus exchance in Vienna for one year.

Since then, we are coming to Parndorf with my spouse at least 4 times a year.

Just few highlights from my long experience:

1. Always check their website prior to going there for discount cupons (last time there was flat off 20% in Ralph Lauren - which was quite useful - I bought 5 shirts to the office - many Czech people in the queue asked me where I took it - and they were quite suprised that I simply printed it out from the internet - it was applied togather with other discount, so I saved almost 50 euros)

2. There are no real outlets - basically except of few shops, it is morelike a big shopping mall - dont expect cheap XXXXL stuff - you can do a really nice shopping. My secret gem is the Espirit in Villagio (be supercarefull - the Parndorf consists of three different places next to each other - one is the typical McArthurglen with all the Hilfiger, Lauren, Lacoste brands - second is the big building with st.Oliver (they almost doubled prices in past years - not worth of visit) and the last one is called Villagio - it is a bit separated but holds few gems - including the Espirit - you can get there really nice stuff for outlet prices - cardigan 40 euros, t-shirts 10 euros etc.)

3. Dont come on the weekends - it is SUPER full - once I was not even able to fit in the Lauren shop, because it was too much crowded (including the one hour queue for cashier). We usually take a holiday on Friday and come to Parndorf around 9 am and try to finish the shopping before 2pm, when it gets busy. Also try to avoid CZECH, SLOVAK, HUNGARIAN and AUSTRIAN public holidays (pretty lot of days).

4. Parking can be a pain - especially during weekends - if its crowded - park your car in the Villagio section (always few free spots) and walk 5 minutes to the other parts.

5. Restaurants (most of them) do not accept credit cards (someone forget to tell them we are in 2013) - but there are plenty of ATMs.

6. Cheap accommodation - we usually sleep in Bratislava - if there are no good options in Vienna (30kms, but you need a vignette for Slovakia - its on a highway - maybe there is some workaround, but I dont mind paying 8 euros - Slovaks have a nice highways). Many of my friends go for a sleep to Hungary - it is close and you can get a room for 4 persons for 30 euros. I usually go to NH Hotels in Bratislava - they have sometimes some smart deals for 40 euros a night (2 persons) and there is spa included in the price.

7. I am pro - shopper (thanks to last 8 years with my spouse) so I can compare a prices from all around the world - Parndorf is not cheap as London, India (yes, I go there for shopping due to the different price strategy on Indian market - everything new starst on 50% of European prices) or NYC shops (or outlets), but is definitely way cheaper then all the shops in the region. Also the choice of shops is incredible, and Parndorf is well positioned between many interesting places in the Central Europe (Vienna, Neusiedler see, Budapest, Hungarian Spa etc).

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,3.0,"The outlet itself is good, with numerous brands at resonable prices, altough the staff in some shops is extremely rude (at BOSS for instance). The big brands have a good, visible discount, whereas the others are so and so in terms of money. The outlet provides a limited option of restaurants, which can be unpleasant for some. A great minus comes from the transportation - while Parndorf does provide transportation from Vienna to the Outlet, it is totally not organized: you are waiting in front of the Opera for a bus, alongside with other hundreds of tourists. When the bus finally comes, the crowd becomes histeric and no queues are respected anymore. And it's been like this since I go to Parndorf. Would it be so difficult to install some kind of system for respecting the queue ??????

The prices are decent, if you catch an extra reduction that is a great deal. I purchased Escada jeans for 39 Euros which seemed like a good deal to me. It can get smokey with everyone lighting up along the semi enclosed area in the outdoor shopping section. There are also some shoppers with families who do not know the meaning of good behavior in public spaces-yelling at each other, unruly children, barking dog and this was inside a store. If you can tolerate the outlet mall crowd this is not a bad way to spend a day getting a shopping fix.

What completely changed my mind though was the realization that I could basically get the same deals in Vienna or even Bratislava sometimes and I don't have to go to Parndorf for that to be stepped on by strangers from every side for some piece of clothing that is not even worth it in the end.

Although I protested to the management‚Äôs office, they said that they are sorry, but they can‚Äôt do anything.

At the same time you simply know that the clothes and all the other products are of a fine quality. Well, I guess they do not offer their newest collections, but still the clothes are really nice.

The outlet is quite big, so next time I will plan at least two days, so that I can look around in no hurry and buy all the things that I want. This time I managed to buy some sports outfit, but next time I will go for shirts, for some costumes and shoes, which I will need for work. Inside the outlet there are several dining places, which work as a la card restaurants or as buffet restaurants.

Since recently the bus return ticket is EUR 9,50 (and not EUR 7 as it used to be).

I would also recommend to those taking the bus to purchase the ticket in advance (after you have arrived to the place). You can not pay to the bus driver.

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,1.0,"dont ever go to the adidas shop in the Parndorf designer outlet! it is a life threatening place. I will never return there after what happened to me there. I was beaten by their security guard and sworn at both by him and by the employees. I spent a lot of money there and was treated very violently. I know you all think it sounds like something out of a movie but so did I when it happened I could not believe that they would allow themselves to do that to me. I strongly urge you not to put yourself in harms way and go through what I suffered. It is such a violent place, the people that work in this particular shop are racist, discriminative and violent. They do not fear the law because they are working for such a big company that they feel that they can do what ever they want to whom ever they want when ever they want. Do yourself a big favor and stay away!

Austria,Designer Outlet Parndorf,5.0,"I have been coming to Vienna quite frequently in the last few years. However this June was the first time I went to Pandorf. I doubt I would ever again start my shopping in Austria with anything else but Pandorf Outlet Mall.
Earlier I have been to some Outlet Designer Malls on Germany and the Netherlands, but this one from my perspective is the most Customer friendly.
It is extremely convenient that they have a bus leaving every hour from Vienna on Saturday. The Bus goes to Pandorf free of charge but return trip is EUR 8 per person. The bus takes about an hour to reach Pandorf, so you should keep this in mind while planning your trip.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The mountain peak is wonderful and the views from it are amazing.. One of the most beautiful things I have seen, although I have visited many places in the Alps.. Approaching the splendor of the Swiss Alps.. The access to the summit is by bus 25 from the main Salzburg train station till the end of the line , when you get out of the busy you will find the cable car station just in front of you. And as soon as you go up the mountain, you will know your way and find the whole city of Salzburg below you, as well as the river and the surrounding green attractive mountains.. Choose a day free of clouds, rain and with a good temperature to enjoy .. and have sport shoes with you that fit the slopes.. don't forget to bring juice or something to drink with you. The place is suitable for children and the degree of ruggedness is slight, but it is a bit difficult for wheelchairs and strollers.. The only problem is the crowding of people in the cable cars.. I benefited from the Salzburg card to ride the bus and go up to the mountain by cable car for free.. That activity is in my opinion the most important if you go to Salzburg

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Is also included in the Salzburg Card.
Be sure to pick a day with good wheather, otherwise you will miss out on the spectacular views. The ride looks scary because of the large span to the first pole, but it is smooth.
We went up and made the hike to the hill with the cross, like most people do. It's not that far but it's still a climb and you get nice views, also on the Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden. Top it off with lunch at the Hochalm Gasthof next to the lift and you will have spent three hours on the trip.
You can also hike to the Eish√∂hle and the Lentz cabin, but that is more for advanced walkers, and requires a whole day.
Walking shoes are advisable, if not necessary. Also take warm clothes, the wheather at the top can change quickly.

Everyone can take the cable car without having to show proof of vaccination, test or cure‚Ä¶..this in great contrast to hotels or restaurants close by‚Ä¶.This was really not corona proof.",Aug 2021
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We added this into our itinerary after enjoying the part of our bike tour in the mountains, and can't believe we nearly left without this! If you purchased the Salzburg card, this is included, and is by far the best thing to do.

You can take the bus all the way out to the cable car. It's a little scary for anyone afraid of heights or claustrophobic, but well worth it. Close your eyes, it will be over soon! Pack a jacket, as the temperature drops significantly at the top. We also packed a picnic, as there is a small cafe at the top, but we wanted something more exciting.

The best part is that much of the hiking on the top is relatively flat, which meant we had quite a bit of space to wander and explore without doing any hardcore hiking. You can continue on to the top of the mountain for even better views, but my mom was perfectly content to enjoy the bench and wait when she'd hiked about 3/4 of the way.

I truly cannot recommend this enough. It is one of the best views I've ever seen, and yes, I did cry when I made it to the top.

Cable car up is pricey (EUR25 return), but it is free with a Salzburg Card (one of its many many benefits).

Easy to reach from the town centre by bus. One of the bus routes (route 25) also goes via Hellbrunn and Salzburg Zoo, so it is very easy to combine all 3 into an excellent day trip (as we did).

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This is a must do attraction in Salzburg. The cable car takes you up to the top of the Untersberg mountain (1853 metres). The views are breathtaking. Great photos opportunities as well as to walk some of the tracks. The cable car is very popular but I still only had to wait 20-25 minutes to get on board. That was in the middle of the day so not sure if wait times are shorter or longer at other times. The cable is really easily to access from Salzburg, just catch a number 25 bus which will take you right to the cable car. If you buy a Salburg card It will cost you nothing to catch the bus and you will also not need to purchase a ticket when you get there. Just present your Salzburg card on the buses as well as to get on the cable car.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"While I hardly saw much, this was still amazing; I imagine breathtaking when one can actually fully see the view.

As many reviews mention, if you‚Äôre in Old Town Salzburg, take the 5 or 25 Bus üöç from Mirabellplatz. You‚Äôll need to get the ticket üéü directly from the bus driver, in cash üí∂, which is approximately 4‚Ç¨. They can make change for smaller bills, not 50‚Ç¨+. The ride there is maybe 30 minutes, at most, and drops you off in front of the lift üö† pickup. You‚Äôll need a separate bus ticket to get back.

We bought our tickets online for 25‚Ç¨ round trip to ‚Äúskip the lines‚Äù and used the QR code on the mobile ticket üì≤, both per the website. However, the attendants didn‚Äôt really know how to scan the codes üôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so they just let us through. I am guessing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è in late spring and summer there are lines whereas in late fall through early spring, not so much.

You can buy snacks ü•ßüßÅ and drinks ü•§üßÉ at the bottom in the lift station before you ascend.

The ride up and back is incredible, even when shrouded in clouds, fog, rain, hail and snow, sometimes all at once! ü§Øüö†üèî

There is a cafe at the top and they do take both cash and credit cards, which I confirmed. I do not recall seeing a geld automat/ATM. There are üöæ.

If you‚Äôre going anytime from late fall through mid spring, be prepared for it to be cold ü•∂ and there to be snow üå® on the mountains üèî and DRESS ACCORDINGLY. My husband and I are from New England in the States, had on proper clothes and footwear and were sliding all over. Except for the doorways, they do not shovel. Again, as mentioned in other reviews, there is a steep climb right out the door and it only goes up from there.

After that, enjoy a one in a million view, which I heard includes leading over on the Germany side and seeing Hitler‚Äôs Eagles Nest...if you‚Äôre into history and whatnot.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We arrived by bus from Salzburg to the district of St. Leonard (about 30 mins) to reach the base of Mt Untersberg to take the cable car to reach the top. We used our Salzburg Card.

The mountain WAS very steep (an ascent of 1,320m basically straight up to 1,776m above sea level). In places, the ride was bumpy. The views are spectacular however if you have issues with heights, look at the floor & not to the front when ascending at a vertical angle parallel to the cliff.
The ride is about 8-10 mins.

After we arrived at the top, we went outside & discovered a whole area of hill treks.
We walked up to some very steep viewpoints (no tracks, just pebbles & rocks) to Geiereck Peak (which is a monument to lost mountaineers & those who served in ww2) with a huge metal cross at the top & Salzburg Hochthron.
It took about an hour to hike to & from these two.

The views were stunning (on the German side is the region of Berchtesgaden, where Hitler's ""Eagle‚Ä≤s Nest"" is located), the air was clean, & we could feel it a bit strange to breathe the thin air. There were some very serious trekkers & mountain climbers.

Allow at least half a day.

If you'd rather walk, there is a path all the way up, although it does look steep and relatively hard going, so wear some sturdy boots - it may take a while. You can always get the cable car back down...

Great attraction, which actually (if using the cable car) you can manage in 2-3 hours or less, including the bus from the centre.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,A must visit while in Salzburg. Buy the salzburg card for the number of days you are going to be there. The bus route 25 takes you to the base of untersberg and brings you back into the city as well. Gorgeous views of the city and the mountains. The cable car ride is smooth . The restaurant at the top is busy but worth a stop for a quick bite. A must do for everyone,Jun 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We stayed a few days in Salzburg and were generally a bit disappointed. On the morning of leaving we drove to the Untersbergbahn; it was cloudy but we took a chance going up in the cable cart. The gondola took us through the clouds and when we arrived at the top thankfully the clouds just started breaking up, giving us the most beautiful view. As it was still early in the season and there was quite a bit of snow around, the bars at the top weren't open but we didn't care. We walked around in the snow for an hour, just taking in the mind blowing views and feeling as excited as kids in a sweet shop. By far the best experience we had in Salzburg.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"A great getaway from the bustle and bustle of a European cities trip with an extraordinarily picturesque ride of the mountain from where amazing views are afforded.
Well worth the trip out and great value if you have bought the Salzburg Card as it is free with this fantastic concept",Jul 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Nice little village, with attraction - cable train to top of mountain. In Top you can hike hour or two between different tops. In Cable train station is nice but expencive cafe and pub. I reccommend that trip highly, its very good 2-3 hour time spending, you will not regret.",Jun 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The gondola ride up to Untersberg seemed a little daunting, but it‚Äôs so smooth and so worth the views you get from up the mountain. Loved the place, the little hike up and the stunning view of the city spread out under us!",Jul 2019

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Untersberg Cable Car is such an Amazing and magical experience for me in Salzburg. The Untersberg Cable Car has been transporting hikers and the fans of great scenery since 1961. The Untersberg itself is one of the most popular recreation areas on the outskirts of Salzburg, for locals and visitors alike. Between the valley station in Gr√∂dig/St. Leonhard (elev. 456 m) south of Salzburg and the Geiereck mountain station (1,776 m), the lift rises an impressive 1,320 m in elevation!
The ride in one of two roomy gondolas takes about ten minutes. When you step out at the top, an incredible view of Salzburg City, Berchtesgadener Land (in Germany) and the Rosittental deep below reveals itself before your eyes. In good visibility, you can even see all the way out to the Salzkammergut lakes as well as Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria. The surrounding Alpine world is also boundlessly fascinating: Panorama boards help you get your bearings so that you easily be able to make out the Dachstein Massif as well as the Hohe Tauern range, an awe-inspiring world of eternal ice.
Over all, you MUST visit and try the Untersberg Cable Car when you are in Salzburg. Enjoy

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Personally I think that Salzburg is completely overrated. Most of the top attractions like the fortress and the Dom Quartier are just so-so (and I am being generous). Untersberg is the exception. So if you are in Salzburg, you must make the trip. And get the Salzburg card because its free with the card",Jul 2019
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,Hop on the number 25 bus to get here. Worth doing for the view. Beware of paying 5.00 for a cappuccino - and it not being a full cup! Not much to do at the top except for a good view of the airport and the little cafe.,Jun 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"As all the published myths about this mountain are true, I experienced a challenging and breathtaking trip. We used the cable car up and took a real scary but amazing trip down. Whoever is not brave and not used of heights, take the cable car down. There are paths downwards which are incredibly steep and frightening. Also plan enough time for your trip, there are really magical time gaps. But all in all, you are getting the experience of your life with stunning views and wonderful views.",Jun 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Great experience with amazing views!! We cycled out there from town which was about 7km along mainly separated trails. It‚Äôs costs ‚Ç¨23 return but it was worth it. The gondola ride itself was super, smooth and spectacular views. Walking around at the top brought even more spectacular views. Bring good shoes as there is snow up there you can walk through! I appreciated the restaurants at top for having a drink and taking in the scenery. Definitely a great half day journey.",Jun 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We had a great time taking the cable car to the top and walking on the mountain-top trails for an hour or so. We were there in early June and the walking and hiking trails were still mostly covered in 6-8 inches of snow, even though the day was warm enough for short sleeves. As a result, the trails were slippery and there are no handrails; this is a good place to bring a walking stick and wear shoes with some traction. The cable car was only scheduled to leave every 30 minutes, and we had to wait in a line and didn't make it onto the first car. But then about 15 minutes later another car came, so we didn't have to wait the full 30 minutes. We were there on a Saturday of a holiday weekend, so maybe that's why it was busier and they ran on a more frequent schedule.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Using the Salzburg card which cost ¬£40 for 3 days covering entry to most major tourist places like the fortress, Stiegl brewery, museums, river cruise and all public transport including the bus to and from the airport. Took bus 25 to untersberg about a 30 minute journey through Salzburg, about a minute walk to the cable car which takes you up the mountain. Costs about ¬£15 but again free with the card. Takes about 10 minutes to get to the top, great views on the way up. At the top there is a restaurant, going through the restaurant to outside walking around the mountain there is also a small bar, great place to have a beer. There was still snow up the mountain which was amazing",Jun 2019
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"The valleystation is easily reached with bus 25 from citycenter. The mountainstation is about 1770m high. From here you have a great view over Salzburg and surroudings. At the top you can take a hike to a higher peak nearby. Also you can walk up to the mountaincross directly behind the mountainstation, or walk down to a hotel/restaurant. There are also some trails up the mountain from the valley but you have to be an experienced hiker; the trails take an hour of 5 and pass some very steep sections. But scenery and rewarding afterwards must be great.",Jun 2019

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Untersberg is an amazing must visit must see must experience journey. It promises the best 8 to 10mins ride of your life...horizontally via a cable car.

Untersberg is gorgeous mountain range closest to Salzburg. It is easily reachable using the public transport to the main station.
We took bus 25 which takes you throught the small town and lanes and within 10mins you can see the change in the scenary.

Bus 25 takes you right to the doorstep of the cable car station. A brilliant idea...God bless the soul who thought of this!
U will need your Salzburg card and you will on your way up a cool amazing ascend into d gorgeous white limestone mountain...GORGEOUS VIEW OF THE HUGE MOUNTAIN RANGE N BELOW THE VILLAGE thats situated at the foot.

We were greeted with amazing snow atop the mountain...and the cable car took us higher the places was shrouded with an air of white mist...AMAZING!!!
Hikers skiers and tourists alike were here. Went we eent it had been smowing heavily and the restaurant al fresco seating was all snowed in. Otherwise it would be a lovely place to walk around ....amd have a peaceful quiet moment by yourself overlooking the beautiful view.

Do bring sm snacks if your plannim to stay longer and even have a picnic in the clouds.

A must see. Experience the lovely amazing feeling from up above..where else would you rather be?

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Traveled to the Untersbergbahn today to do a last minute journey up the mountain. There was quite a bit of snow up top and hiking was out of the question, The cable car ride up and back was magnificent. Many animals under the cable car frolicking in the snow and the scenery, as always, was astonishing. We have hike this mountain many times and normally just take the cable car down at the end of the day. We have never stopped at the Bergstation Restaurant until today. While the waitresses were friendly the overall service was terrible. We sat for 25 minutes before we were able to order. Clearly, they were understaffed‚Äîa management problem they should seek to correct.",May 2019
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This is really a ""must see"" place.
So easy to access via bus 25.
Cable car ride was much longer than I expected - stopped a couple of times to allow everyone to get photos. Was a little scary as it was sooo high but very new large and stable.
At the top there are places to get meals or drinks. We chose to sit in the sun surrounded by snow capped mountains üòä.
There is a short pathway up to an absolutely amazing outlook.
It had been snowing recently so were privileged with an awesome display. Snow was a little slippery in the shade but quite traversable if you are careful.
I can imagine it can get pretty cold up there so check weather conditions before leaving... today was t-shirt weather but tomorrow you may need a jacket, beanie and gloves.
Even better, it's included if you get a Salzburg Card.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,This is a spectacular cable car ride to the top of Untersberg Mountain (1853 meters). Definitely a must do for any trip to Salzburg. If you get a Salzburg card one of the things it covers is the cable car. It also covers public transportation so just take bus # 25 out to the end of the line (station Untersbergbahn) right next to the cable car.,May 2019

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,All the other reviews have said it all. Amazing! We had the most perfect Spring day for views and there was still snow!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This is absolutely unmissable.
I had an afternoon to kill and thought it might be cool, turns out it is just a 30 minute (max) bus ride from the city centre, 3 bus routes from the centre go there. The cable car runs every 30 mins, and takes about 5 mins to the top. The views are just out of this world! I went late april and though plenty of snow there, i went in a small top and shorts and was warm. Word to the wise - wear sensible shoes and sunglasses! The ground is all snow, so in heels or sandals it would be undoable.
Given the cable car access, it is also not crowded, and i enjoyed a beer at the cafe at the top in a peaceful atmosphere.
This really is a salzburg highlight, especially if you are not able to take a few more days to explore the region further.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,The ride with the cable car was very spectacular and a little scary as the gondola swings when passing the poles.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,This was the scariest/coolest thing. The gondola swings when going through brake stop gates and it is pretty crowded but the view is amazing.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,30 mins from HBF (train station) to cable car by bus 25. Terminus to terminus. Definitely must go if you have the time and Salzburg card. We went in March. It was sunny below and snowing at the summit after a long cable car ride.,Mar 2019

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Visited this after a recommendation by our hotel. Bit of a ride out of town on the bus (about 35 mins) but was easy to get bus and it stopped right outside the lift. The lift ride offered some views though it was packed so couldn't see much if in the middle of the crowd. The top though had amazing views of salzburg and its surroundings as well as out across the mountains. You can take a bit of a walk to a couple of points but in trainers we didn't venture too far on the ice and with the strong winds. Would definitely recommend taking some good walking shoes for this but even without you can still go a little way and admire the views. Also enjoyed a beer and gluhwien in the lodge at the top. Would definitely recommend and if doing makes the salzburg card well worth it on its own - the cars is the best I've come across and we saved a small fortune using a two day pass to see so much of the city.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Firstly- easy to get to. Bus 25 from the central bus station, platform B, runs every 30mins and is about 20mins out of town. Really obvious where to get off as there is a massive mountain with a cable car!
Grab a 24 or 48hr pass for 26Euros pp and it covers the public bus and all central excursions marked on the map including the cable car cost (25 Euro each if no pass).
This place is beautiful.
Wear sensible shoes if snowy and wrap up warm. Maybe a packed lunch if don‚Äôt want the bustle of the bar up there.
The views are sensational and you may get lucky and see a deer climbing the rocks or some of the other wildlife. You walk around but no hiking and suitable for all.
Can look back on Salzburg and see for miles and miles on a clear day.

Austria,Untersberg,3.0,"Untersberg is almost 1800m high and to reach the top is awesome as well as riding the cable car and viewing from great heights. However, it was foggy on the day we went so it was not optimal but still the thrill was there. Pick a day when weather forecast is good so you don't miss out. At the top is a one and only restaurant so the service is a little bit slow and there are not so much seats available. But it can be a good coffee area or a place to stay and eat, if you happen to come without proper outdoor,snow footwear and clothes to climb to the the peak, which is some meters still to climb. We reached the cable starting point by taking Bus 25 from Salzburg Center. It took around 45 minutes by bus. Untersberg is the end station. The cable car ride takes around 10-15 minutes, A tip is that you can also combine this Untersberg attraction with a visit to the Zoo or the Hellbrun Castle which are two of the stops on the way to Untersberg. The bus passes 4x per hour.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"So we agonized about buying the Salzburg pass and this was the first thing we did and we effectively got our money back. Such a good buy, so if you have the pass this is a must.
It is so easy to get to just hop on the number 25 bus if coming from the Alt Start head out the arch by Starbucks then turn right and walk about 50m and the stop is outside the Police Station.
The Untersberg is the last stop and is only around 20 mins from town. The bus ride is enjoyable too through the countryside.
A large cable car with capacity for 50 people transports people up to the top of the mountain. They cram people in so it's full like the subway so if you are claustrophobic try get a spot on the outside.
It's a stunning ride to the top and the view at the top is great. Make sure to dress warmly and have good grip shoes as you can walk on the snow to 2 lookout points.
There is a cafe at the top as well just a shame the staff both in the cafe and operating the cable car are not friendly at all.

A safe adventure as the cable car does all the work. A huge mountain.",Jan 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Other than those tourist attractions in the city, this is probably the best of all if one enjoys outdoor activities. This is the place where you will enjoy stunning views of the entire Salzburg. However, I would suggest that people should wear hiking boots rather than sneakers because of uneven pavement once you reach the summit. I had developed a blister on my foot due to the soft sole of my sneakers.

Additionally, one might need a pair of trekking poles to maintain the balance. Those slopes are quite steep. It could be difficult to climb without trekking poles.

Salzburg card is a must have for tourists here. For the amount of money you paid for the cable car, you might as well purchase the card so that you can ride for free.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Had to visit here whilst on a city break to Salzburg. It takes roughly 30 minutes on bus #25 from the city centre, the end of the route takes you to the bottom station of the Untersbergbahn Cable Car. I used my Salzburg Card (they're definitely worth buying) to get a trip up and down the mountain, otherwise a normal adult return would be ‚Ç¨25.

The trip takes just over 10 minutes to reach the summit but we were all packed in tightly and it was bit freaky when the cable car started swaying to and fro.

The views from the top don't disappoint. Even in early October there were bits of snow and slushy areas so I strongly recommend decent footwear if you want to explore the surrounds. If you're fit and able enough, it's worth trekking a bit further to the Salzburger Hochthron that is a slightly higher vantage point from which you can admire the splendour of the Berchesgaden Alps.

There's also 2 caf√©s and toilets that you can stop by to refresh. You can easily spend a couple of hours there on a fine day as we did and take in the fresh air and impressive views. You should definitely add this to your itinerary if ever you visit the area.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This is a wonderful spot to view the Austrian Alps after a 10 minute cable car ride. The most interesting sight was seeing the clouds pass by below you!
I would recommend wearing or taking appropriate clothing, a young lady in our cable car was wearing a summer dress and plimsoles...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ she realised her mistake when we got to the top of the mountain. There are plenty of trails leading of from the cable car station which you can explore.

Beware the weather, we had to leave as a thunderstorm rolled in and the staff advised the cable car would be suspended during the storm if we did not leave with them. I maybe brave but I'm not stupid...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. so down we came.
Over all I think this is a great attraction, true it is some way out of the city but definitely worth the trip.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Take the 25 Bus and do this.Up the cable car to the top of the world. You get panoramic views of Salzburg the Alps and Germany. Not much to do up here but there is a restaurant and views a plenty. You have to wait for the next car up about 20 mins so allow for that. I took a total of 2 hours. Entry was free on my 48 hours travel card. So beautiful,Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Our Salzburg Pass included the bus ride to get here and the cable car ride up the mountain. We did not realize how high and how strikingly beautiful up here. There are the layers of mountain ranges, cloud covered valleys, and green field below. Definitely worth the visit.",Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Easy trip from downtown Salzburg on bus # 25. Inters burg is the last stop on the route which takes about 20 to 25 minutes. Use the Salzburg Card to pay for both the bus and cable car. The ride up the mountain and the views on top are spectacular. There are some hiking trails on top to enjoy, along with a relaxed cafe. You could spend a lot of time here taking in the views and inhaling the cool crisp air. It is magical and an absolute must when visiting Salzburg.",Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Had a few hours to kill before leaving Salzburg, and having done the town, castle and gardens before, came across this on Trip Advisor, and wow was it impressive.
Bit of a queue even though it was late afternoon, but nothing major. The ride is steep but so impressive and the views from the top are simply incredible looking over all of Salburg and the surrounding area.
Well worth it and it is novel looking down on the aircraft going in and out of the airport!",Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Not surprised this is listed as the number one attraction in Salzburg. A 30 to 40 minute trip on the number 25 bus drops you at the bottom of the cable car, and nine minutes later you emerge at the top to some absolutely stunning views. We were really lucky today with the weather in the low 20s, and visibility as far as the eye could see. There are number of trails and none too difficult although sensible footwear and clothing is a must. You can smell the fresh air !!!!",Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"As others have pointed out, reaching the cable car stop is simply a matter of hopping onto bus #25. The final stop is the base station for the cable car (you can't miss it, the driver typically gets off and it looks like a station and not simply a roadside bus stop) It takes about 30-40 minutes from town. Once there, it's a short 10 minute ride to the top. At the top it was a few degrees cooler, so consider bringing a jacket. Make sure you check the weather before going too, there are reliable forecasts online that show the weather at the top. There's no sense going up on a foggy or cloudy day. I'd also highly recommend bringing a bottle of water (water at the top was pricey)

At the top station of the cable car there are 2 restaurants, both are very reasonably priced. The views in all directions are spectacular, and pictures don't do it justice. You can hang around the area near the top station and get great views, or if you're up for a hike you can make it to a nearby peak.

The hike is doable in sneakers, but I'd avoid anything like sandals. The hike takes awhile, and can be congested with other hikers. It's not an easy hike, there are very steep sections and it is very rocky. But don't let that scare you off, the views from the nearby peak are simply stunning. I'm no adventurer and made it up there in 45 mins or so in one piece.

As others have stated, if you plan on doing the cable car the Salzburg card is a no brainer, it effectively pays for itself on a 24 hour basis between the bus and cable car. Squeeze in a few other attractions and it's totally worth it. You can combine this with the Zoo or Hellbrun and get even more of your money's worth. We did the peak along with the Stiegl Brewery tour and two attractions in town the next morning.

With the Salzburg card you can proceed directly to the queue.

The only drawbacks were that the cable car is crowded on the way up and the way down. We saw a fairly long queue to head back down the entire time we were there.

This is absolutely worth checking out if you're in Salzburg.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We did this on a whim and weren‚Äôt disappointed. We had a lovely sunny day with light winds and clear visibility.

I‚Äôd certainly recommend hiking to the top if you‚Äôve got the stamina, it‚Äôs not too far (appx 1km), but does require stable footwear etc.

Will definitely be back for some fresh mountain air!",Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Included with the Salzburg card, Mt Untersberg is a must do.

Very easy to get there. Just take the 25 bus from Mirabelle Platz. Every 10 minutes Mon - Sat and every 20 mins on Sunday. The final stop is Untersberg Cable Car Station. All included on the card too.

The cars run every 30 minutes and get you to the summit in 10 minutes.

At the top is a shop/restaurant and outside a pub. What a place to enjoy a beverage and drink in the view!

The views are something else. Absolutely stunning. The area surrounding the cable car station offers panoramic views, but for those able and feeling brave there is a trail to follow across to a higher peak.

I definitely recommend wearing sensible footwear as can be a bit slippery on the paths. It was a very warm September day, so our jackets were sufficient, although it was a few degrees colder at the top.

After the decent back down, the bus stop is directly outside which takes you back into Salzburg. It‚Äôs worth noting that the 25 bus also covers Salzburg zoo and Helbrun Gardens. Could easily do all of these in one day.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,A must stop and just a short trip from Salzburg. You can see for miles from up here and there's a bit of hiking if you are up for it once you get to the top.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The view from the summit was breathtaking! Make sure to wear closed-toe shoes, as the path at the top was gravel (so not comfortable with my ill-advised sandals!)

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Mt. Untersberg is close to the Salzburg town.Me & my wife took the Bus no. 25 from near the train station and it took about 40 minutes to reach it's last stop - the base of the mountain.For all visitors I would recommend the Salzburg card.It is pretty cheap and gives free access to some tourist spots in Salzburg ( including this Mt.Untersberg) and free travel in public transport plus discounts in entry free of several sightseeing spots ! So we used ours to the full ! The cable car facilitates lovely viewing of the town as we ascend the Mount.The view from top is awesome !

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"So glad I included this on my visit - ignore google maps as line wasn‚Äôt showing the 25 bus, which gets you there in 1/2 hour from the city centre. The cable car ride is amazing and the view when you get to the top stunning. I chose to hike to the top of the mountain - as others have said it‚Äôs definitely more of a hike, so was glad I was wearing decent shoes and not sandals. View at the top was a bit misty but so glad I did it - probably took 30-40 minutes to get to the summit and back. Fantastic experience - not to be missed!",Sep 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"It was an overcast day but we decided to go to the top of the mountain anyways and we are so glad we did! The gondola ride is breath-taking! Once at the top we hiked to the summit. Hardly anyone was there. It was amazing as at times we were above the clouds. The views are memorable too. Caution- the hike up to the summit is strenuous and you should be wearing closed-toed shoes and bring a rain jacket/windbreaker. I had a walking pole which helped a lot. Some of the trail is climbing steep steps made out of longs with no hand-rail. The wet steps/logs made us take longer than we anticipated. But again- well worth it! We ended up at the small Inn near the gondola for lunch and a beer afterwards. It's charming and we were the only ones there! Gondola ride is included on the Salzburg Card which is a well-worth-it purchase.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"It was very exciting journey to the top and amazing view. We went to Untersberg on public transport bus number 25 from main bus station , from there it is the last stop. There we purchased Salzburg city card from nearby hotel , as the guys at the place were not selling this. Ride to the top and from there back, is every half an hour. The cable car is fully closed and safe, yet the journey is thrilling and view from the top is mesmerising. The hike to the peak seems good, though we did not go due to lack of time. Overall deserves first place among Salzburg's attractions.",Aug 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Went on a trip up the Untersberg whilst visiting Salzburg in winter time, it was an amazing experience, it was like being on top of the world, deep snow restricted how far we could walk but we ventured out a bit.

A lovely half day excursion.",Aug 2018
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"After having toured the city of Salzburg and seeing the most beautiful testimonies of the past, we wanted to see the Austrian nature around the city and the Untersberg cableway (suggested and included in Salzburg Card) it seemed like a good chance. And in fact it takes just a few kilometers by bus to get out of Salzburg and be immersed in the countryside, then a few kilometers later being in the mountains and climb up to almost 1900 meters through the cableway. The top allows you to admire the spectacular 360-degree panorama over the Salzburg plain, with the lakes and other peaks far out on the horizon. Just take a few steps to overcome the two or three crowded restaurants and you can find yourself immersed in the silence and peace of the mountain, dominating an infinite scenario from above.

When the clouds move in, its amazing, you cant see anything, not even a meter in front of you. But you are apart of the clouds! You cant miss this opportunity.

Take water. Good walking shoes. Take a lightlight coat/cardigan, as the weather changes quickly up on the mountain. I also found it very windy.
Recommend taking picnic/snacks, as there a benches.

From the upper station of the cable car there are a number of walks up to higher summits.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Yes pun intended, it was one of the hottest days in Salzburg in many years so we ‚Äúescaped‚Äù to the cool of the mountain.

Despite google saying it was very busy it was not so we could straight go up and enjoy the much lower temperature at the top which is roughly 1300 meter higher.

After thunderstorms the day before the view was very good and we enjoyed the walk to the higher of the 2 crosses. Good shoes of course a must.

Only downside we found was service in the restaurant where we where shooed away from sitting inside and told to sit in the blazing sun. Took that as a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for your money‚Äù so we took the trip back down to have a drink somewhere else.

Like everything in Austria, this cable car is beautifully engineered and whisks you in a somewhat cramped car to the very top of the Untersberg mountain - don't be under any illusions - this is a HIGH mountain!! Lovely crisp and cool at the top, we could see for as far as the horizon in every direction - and we even saw an Eagle, (not sure which type, but looked to me very much like a Golden Eagle - but could not be sure).

2 great cafe's at the top with a choice of cosy interiors or stunning views, (unsurprisingly the inside seats were all empty - but there were plenty of seats all round). Food was well priced, and great quality, and the seats were comfortable garden chairs with lovely cushions.

Totally recommend this place!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This experience was one I will always treasure - the views from the cable car were extravagant but had nothing on the views right on top of the mountain. Up there, the world is beautifully peaceful and not a sound can be heard apart from the voices of the other visitors.
The cable car journey was rather squashed during the height of summer, with people packed closely together. Personally I am not a huge fan of heights but I didn‚Äôt find the experience to be frightening. It feels like you are flying but the cable car does not feel unstable - only once does it accelerate over a crop of rock - all in all it is a very smooth journey going up and down!
Once out of the cable car you will find toilets and a cafe, as well as a rather pleasant viewing platform. Move out of the main building and you will walk along the side of a restaurant. I did not try any of the food here but instead brought my own packed lunch which was lovely to eat as I took in the astounding views.
We climbed up to the highest point where the wooden cross is, but I would not recommend the part to those who struggle with exercise or who are not too sure-footed as especially on the way back down there are some areas where it is easy to slip. However for those who are confident in climbing uphill, it is one hundred percent worth the exertion. There is another little high point where there is a larger metal cross near to the restaurant and the path up to this point is easier to climb, much more accessible, just a little steep. The views from there are also beautiful.
I would say this was my favourite experience I have done in the Salzburg area.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"The summit of Untersberg is1853 metres above sea level and the cable car traverses what appears a virtually a sheer mountain face. To avoid queues in the summer it is best to get there as early as possible for the first ascent which starts at 8.30 a.m. Do take clothing suitable for cold weather as there is a significant temperature drop between that in the town and the mountain summit. Also safe footwear is beneficial as some of the tracks are fairly loose, narrow and steep. The views throughout the cable car ride and on reaching the top of the mountain are spectacular so it is best if possible to chose a clear unclouded day.

The cost for an adult is Euros 25 but it is free to holders of the Salzburg Card.

Our only regret was that the incredible mountains in the distance were not clearly visible due to the clouds that moved in, so I recommend choosing a day that is sunny with excellent visibility. However we were limited in our time in Salzburg, one cannot order weather to suit one‚Äôs activities and we are so pleased we made the trip up to the summit. Well worth it.

The view was spectacular but we then decided to hike to the top of the peak with the large cross. That took about 25 minutes but it was definitely worth it. One had a 360 degree view from Salzburg in the valley to multiple mountain ranges and snow capped peaks in the distant.

We sat on the benches at the top for about 30 minutes enjoying the view. The way down was easier and we got back to the hotel about 3.5 hours after we left. It was a totally enjoyable to spend a morning.

Recommendations: Like anything in an area with lots of tourist, start early and avoid the crowds and heat. Also get a Salzburg card as it will save you quite a bit of money as the Gondola ride is not cheap. Then you can use the card to see other sights for free.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,We visited this on our Salzburg card. It was a stunning day and the views were amazing. I would recommend good shoes to walk in as there is a great walk which takes about 20 mins from the top of the cabled car. As the mountain has lots of marble it can be a bit slippery in street shoes.,Jun 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Gorgeous views from the cable car, gorgeous views where they drop you off, and gorgeous views from the peak of the mountain! It's a bit of a hike to get to the top, but well worth it. You can totally do it; I believe in you!!

(Also, shout-out to the tiny kid who kept saying ""oh mein Gott...oh mein Gott!!!!"" on the way up the mountain. Totally made the trip even more memorable :D)",May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This #1 for a reason. Must see, except do consider the weather!

It will be cool on top, at best. Spend some time and explore! Wear good shoes and hike away from the Cable Car, it is worth it. But bad weather will spoil a fantabulous view!",Jul 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We loved the cable car ride experience up which was ver exciting as it suddenly picks up speed when you think it is about to stop !
Once we reached the top, the children were delighted to see snow for the first time and didn't want to go back down. We easily spent about 2 hours up. The views were stunning !",May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"A very memorable experience for our family who had never yet been in a cable car ! A very exciting cable car ride to the top, and our children got to see snow for the first time in their lives , they were ecstatic !

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Untersberg is always a good idea for a trip. We prefer to take the cable car up, and hike our way down the mountain. Service in the bar by the cable car is good and prices are reasonable. If you want to hike your way down, prepare yourself for 3-4 hours walk, which can be steep-ish at some places, but manageable.",May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,The cable car ride was picturesque and takes place every half hour - be ready to hike so wear good walking shoes and carry sunscreen and water - the restaurant up there offers great beer n food and the views are breathtaking,Jun 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We took a bus from outside our hotel and it was a 40 minute drive to the cable car station. There was a short wait for the cable car, it goes a couple of times an hour and takes you up to 1853m. The views are spectacular and you can walk up to the highest point. There is a restaurant on the way. Make sure you take warm clothing as the temperature drops substantially as you ascend.
This is Free if you have the Salzburg Card",Apr 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Great hiking tours on and off the Untersberg. Care you're steps. Shouldn't be afraid of heights. Hiking shoes is a must. Up takes approx 6 hours... Down 4 till 5.,Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Just unbelievable view of what must be some of the most dramatic landscape on earth. The cable car ride is an experience in itself (it is the highest above ground in the alps); there is a restaurant at the top, but just a very short walk beyond that is an actual alpine hut ( where they serve beer, among other things). The true summit is about 15 minutes of mildly strenuous hiking from the station - well worth it for a true alpine experience. Very easy to get there by bus - take the #25 bus from anywhere on the line. Hellbrun Castle, and the zoo, are on the same bus route, so you can make a day of all three. And buy the Salzburg card before you do anything! It gets you free admission to these and all the major attractions, and covers your bus fare!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Amazing. Really just writing the review to show the pictures - such a beautiful view! Make sure you take a jumper/jacket as it does get cold. Hiking boots are not required, but steady shoes will be fine. Catch the cable car up which is mind blowing in itself.",Jun 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"I would consider Untersberg a must on any Salzburg trip. Super easy to get to, just catch the 25 bus for about 20 mins. The cable car is only ten mins up. Buy a salzburg card and you get your money‚Äôs worth just in the bus and cable car. Once at the top there‚Äôs a range of paths to take and things to see, a couple of restaurants to enjoy food and drinks. We had a baby so only spent about an hour up there and it was plenty. Easy trip but I hear that you need to pick a good day because cloud cover can ruin the views. Fortunately not for us!",Jun 2018
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"OK it was February . .

After we finished off the Sound of Music Bus tour we had a few hours to kill. We jumped on the number 25 bus that takes you right to the cable car station. The bus takes about 45 minutes from the centre of Salzburg.

We arrived just a cable car was due to leave. They ran every 30 minutes on the day we were there. The staff were kind and held the cable car whilst we sorted out tickets. It's not cheap but then it's probably a fairly expensive operation to fund.

There was just me my wife an one other tourist in the car . . We couldn't see the top pf the mountain as it was shrouded in cloud. It took my good lady by surprise as she had assumed the half way point was the top, but we still travelled in thick cloud for another 6 or 7 minutes to the top.

It was bitterly cold at the top and it was not possible to walk any distance from the station due to the thick snow and ice and our inability to wear sensible clothes. We could have had a hot drink at the cafe there but chose to come straight back.

We descended with our tourist friend and another family who had braved staying at the top for a while.

The descent was really interesting watching the valley bottom get closer and closer.

We had a while to wait for the bus so we had a nice hot drink and used the toilets there before heading back into Salzburg.

It was a cold but worthwhile detour from Salzburg and I imagine in nice weather would afford amazing views from the top cable car station.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,One lady was screaming when the cable car was approaching the mountain top; the cable car was full of tourists and it felt like we were crushing into the mountain wall. The view from the top was gorgeous! Quite satisfactory. It really gives you quite different experience from the city. You can use the Salzburg card for this magnificent experience.,May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We drove to the cable-car where we found parking was free. We used our Salzburg card which gave us a return trip. We were there for the first car of the day at around 8 30am. The view from the top of the ride is astounding with high peaks on three sides and the city of Salzburg on the plain several thousand feet below.

There were some very easy paths to the nearby summit and several trails for those who wanted more extensive hikes. It was very pleasant sitting in the sunshine sipping a cup of reasonably priced coffee whilst admiring the view.

Provided the weather is good I would list this as a ""must do"" on a visit to Salzburg.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Easy access with #25 bus from Salzburg. Incidentally, even easier if you have the ""Salzburg"" card. Magnificent territorial views several thousand feet below. Great walking trails but about a 45 minute walk to the tippy-top. WORTH IT!!",May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This is a do-not-miss experience if you are in the Salzburg area. We took the advice provided in other reviews and purchased Salzburg Cards and took the Bus 25 from the center of the city to the end of the line where you get on the cable car. The day was clear and sunny so we had great views on the way up as well as at the top. If you have a fear of heights the ride can be a challenge but it is worth doing. If the day is sunny don't forget the sunscreen and bring a jacket. Also wear sturdy shoes so you can walk some of the easier trails at the summit. Food and drinks are available at the cafe up top. Should we get the chance to return to Salzburg we will certainly take the ride up to Untersberg again.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Definitely worth a visit. Included in the Salzburg card for the cable car. Hiking up we heard takes about 3 hours. Just beautiful at the top. Lots of areas to walk around and a small restaurant too. We were there in the morning on a perfect blue sky day. Some were walking down.,May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Thanks to all the reviewers who helped us make the decision to visit. So easy to get to by bus and the Salzburg card is the way to do it! We spent three glorious hours on the awe-inspiring peaks and still had time to roam the sites of the city for free too!,May 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"First off, get the Salzburg card. Typically those cards are junk and not worth the money but here it's a steal. The cable car up to the mountain is a heck of a ride. Each time you roll over a support your heart jumps a little with the rocking car.

The whole day up and down is full of amazing views. The top is breathtaking and hopefully there is little for during your visit. The city bus to get here is simple. You don't regret going here.",Jun 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We had one day in Sazlburg as we travelled from Vienna and was due to return to Vienna the same night. We took a train and we arrived at the Salzburg Hbf. The first thing we did was buy a Salzburg card and this was included in it. Going up the cable car usually costs 25 Euros but the card was 25 Euros. So any other attraction on top of this was a bonus. The views were great from the top although there are only two cable cars that go up and down. There are cable cars every 30 minutes and this wasn't so bad as we were all able to fill in.

Overall, great views from the top and certainly recommend it if you have some time.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Our trip to Untersberg was one of the highlights of our stay at Salzburg. Easy to get to the Cable Car station (bus no. 25). The Salzburg card gives you a free one time use of the cable car. The views of the Bavarian Alps and the Salzburg area are spectacular!

During our ride up, we were amidst the clouds and my son really enjoyed seeing nothing but clouds around for a while (well, me too!).

Don't miss out on Untersberg (not recommended for very small children though - ours is a pre-teen).

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We visited Untersberg on Christmas morning with our adult children. It was so easy to get the bus from the main train station to the cable car to take you up. We went earlier in the morning so to beat the crowds. The trip up the cable car was great. We reached the top and saw the most magnificent views of majestic mountains and below the surrounds of Salzburg. It was fortunate we had clear blue skies with only a slight breeze. We walked through snow and had so much fun. I highly recommend visiting anytime of year, it would be well worth the visit. Make sure you wear appropriate footwear & clothes. Probably best not to go on cloudy and less visible day so check the weather forecast before heading off.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,We went here 1 day to find that the conditions higher up were too windy for the cable car to be operating so I would advise that you call ahead just to check so you don't have a wasted journey. Luckily we were coming from Hellbrunn which is just down the road so the following day we had the hotel call them up for us. We visited on a hot sunny day so it was a pleasant ride up on the cable car to the top of the mountain. On arrival the sky literally turned black and we were in the middle of a snow storm which lasted about 10 minutes before clearing back to blue skies & sunshine. The views of Salzburg down below & the surrounding mountains are breathtaking - definitely worth a visit.,Mar 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"There's a reason this is the number one attraction in Salzburg you have to go to the top of it to realise why. Being a little bit wary of heights I was worried about the cable car however no need to be it was quite a relaxing trip to the top would one little bump halfway so expect that. A lot of reviewers mentioning the Salzburg card definitely get it we were there 3 days and bought it on the second day it would allow you trips from the centre of town all the way out to this mountain, then access for free for the same. Number 25 bus goes there. A nice small cafe at the top followed by a bigger bar type pub that served is Goulash and beer after our home to the summit. Go, do it. It's a life changing experience it's that good.

Its like heaven and you are above the clouds and many snow surrounding.,Mar 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,One of the perks included when you buy Salzburg Card is to ride a cable car to Mt. Untersberg. If you're afraid of heights then this is not for you. The view from the moutain was spectacular! A bit cold which was 8 degrees celcius when we went up there. So wear comfortable shoes and a jacket during this tour. Salzburg card's price is EUR 25 which includes free transportation and free entrance to lots of tourist spots.,Apr 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Wow!!! This trip is most definitely worth it. Any trepidation about going so high up in a cable car are completely forgotten when you reach the top and experience the spectacular views. I would recommend anyone to do this and see for yourself,Apr 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,A wild experience for those afraid of heights. Worth going up to the top to see the views! The cable car was a smooth ride.,Apr 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Visited here with my 17 & 19 y.o. boys on Easter Monday. The mountain/cable car is located about 8km from downtown, but right on the 25 bus line (we combined this trip with a visit to Hellbrun Palace, which is on the same line). Admission for the cable car, palace and bus is free with the Salzburg Card (perhaps the best value of any tourist card I have ever seen).

The ride is much longer and more nerve-wracking than it looks and on this beautiful early April morning, it was a truly spectacular 8-9 minutes. You are dispatched into the station and then onto a patio before decamping onto what was a very cold, snow covered trail. I had worn hiking boots and would have struggled in sneakers. In fact, a number of people brought skis or snowshoes with them.

Even in the snow, there are a number of places to hike and it is my understanding that the hiking in the summer is incredible. The vistas were remarkable and trekking up and down the hilly area near the cable car was a fun challenge. It was also cool to see the waiter at the cafe using an ice scraper to clear off the tables for visitors having coffee in the morning sunshine. The vibe was almost apres-ski.

While Salzburg was great (we loved our time in the city), this may have been the highlight, but dress warmly, even as the season progresses (layers are the way to go). Mozart and the Sound of Music may be many people's reason to visit here, but this is a can't miss as well.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"This was a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the time. The gondola ride is longer and higher then it looks. Very scary! Coming down is worse with the maximum amount of people they can cram into the cable car. At the top there is a small cafe, amazing views and snow! We visited in mid April, but there might be snow year round...I don't know. Past the main building and the cafe, you are compelled to clim the snowy slope to the log cabin cafe/bar just a short distance away. I brought my jacket, but not good hiking boots. I slipped up the steep slope with just my tennis shoes only to discover the 2nd Bar/Cafe was closed on the Wednesday afternoon I visited. Past this building is a hiking trail covered in snow, but no guardrail or ropes to keep you from sliding down the cliff!!! This is really scary and dangerous and I gave up after a few slips up the trail. Others in my group happily danced as close to the edge possible, laughing in the face of death! Not for me! I inched back down to the first cafe and had a beer and bratwurst. The views are amazing, I did see people higher then the cafe at a lookout point that I couldn't find the path to. From the cafe you see the green fields of Salzburg, but from the gondola ride and this lookout point you get to see the beautiful snowy peaks if you are brave. The bus there was straight forward, take the 25 to the end and you'll see the gondola. Do not ask the bus driver ""are we there yet?"" questions cause he'll ask for more money! Something about the different zones, but nobody else had to pay! Sit down, keep your mouth shut and enjoy this awesome snow peak just a short trip from Salzburg, Austria.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"The 9-minute cable car trip to the top is good preparation for the chance to stroll around a snowy mountain top without needing skis or crampons. Un-fenced drops mean that children should be carefully watched but also make it seem much more like a real adventure than it would be in UK's H&S dominion. Eschew the unimaginative & over-priced cafe at the cable car terminus in favour of the little chalet bar just beyond, where you can get a suitably cold Steigl beer to sup outside. Avoid the ‚Ç¨25 cable car fee + ‚Ç¨5 bus fare by paying ‚Ç¨25 for a Salzburg visitor's card that includes both and much else besides, inc. e.g. the Hellbrun Castle which you can conveniently visit on the way back to the city.",Apr 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Was in Salzburg for the day, and it was so nice that I wanted to be outside, so I took an easy bus (#25) straight from the old town to here, and then took the tram up.

Very glad I did; the views are much nicer than I was expecting. [I guess I got the impression that this was more of an in-town hill.] Even with snow it was doable in tennis shoes to get to top viewpoint (and the views are still terrific if you can't do that), but I hadn't realized that this can be just the starting point for longer hikes! Maybe another time.

This combined quite nicely with going to Hellbrunn Palace & Trick Fountains afterwards (right on the same bus line). I left my hotel at about 7:45, didn't ever rush and still returned to Salzburg in time for a late lunch. I would do it in that order since there was no line at the cable car (at least in spring) at that time in either direction.

However, our trip was marred by the dreadful return trip where they decided to pack in 2 huge empty food trolleys plus loads of people to the point of sheer suffocation. Way way too many people were squeezed in, not helped by the fact that around me and my young children were at least 3 selfish parents holding their children up, meaning their kids' dirty clumpy boots were bumping my kids' heads!

Getting to the top about 5 mins approx to the top we had to negotiate the icy slope from the station. We went to the wooden cabin on the top for a beer. Clearly no urgency in service or collecting money at the end. So if you are in a rush dont bother. If you want to to sit up and relax with all the time in the world go and enjoy. Is worth the trip.

The gondola style cable car leaves the ground station every 30 minutes, and takes about 12 minutes to reach the top station. Once there, the world is at your feet. The views are incredible, and the trails lead deep into the mountains.

Take the 25 bus from city centre and take the cable car up. We planned to hike up but in winter it was only for professionals. I highly recommend people to wear sensible shoes. Some parts of the mountain the snow was knee high and I saw people wearing HEELED boots which is just bizarre, especially there‚Äôre quite some ups and downs on top. Another thing to look out for is overhanging snows. We can see parts of the top that the snow was overhanging from the cliff with a vertical drop to the bottom. some people have clearly ventured out from the fenced area to take pictures, which is so dangerous to do because you can‚Äôt see where the rock ends!

Good little cafe at summit. Easy to reach by bus. It took about 25 minutes from center of city.",Feb 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We went up Untersberg (do it with the Salzburg Card, actually, just get a Salzburg Card - it is great value!) on the day before Christmas.

We were lucky to be there on a sunny day, so we had the best views. You can literally see for miles! Not being skiers, we have also not been atop many snowy mountains, but it is an experience I would recommend to anyone.

Word of caution: Check if they are open before you get on the bus. It is a 30min bus ride one way. We spoke to other travelers, who did not take the same precaution, despite it being holiday season, and they were sorely disappointed. They were even more upset about wasting an hour, basically going nowhere.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Not a skier but it was an amazing journey to the top with a cablecar. Please invest in a Salzburg card as it is only 25 Euros but covers all your major sightseeing needs, including the public transport in and around the city. You can get it for 24 or 48 hrs and use it for the Untersberg cable car (which is 23 Eur by itself so it makes no sense to not get the Salzburg card) and also the Funicular which takes you to the Fortress in downtown Salzburg. Wear good gripping shoes (and warm clothes) and make sure you try the hot chocolate at the ski lodge which is about 200m walking distance from the cable car station at the top.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Caught the cable car to the top. This journey in itself was exciting but the views from the snow covered top were extraordinary. Lovely little tavern at the top were some of us stayed enjoying the warm sunshine and beverages. Others more adventurous walked through the snow to the summit. Highlight of the weekend.,Jan 2018
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Going up untersberg mountain was easily my favourite day in salzburg it is a must do on your trip! I would recommend getting a salzburg card as the bus to the mountain and cable car to the top would be more expensive than buying the card. The views are incredible, If you were interested in hiking to the peak you will definitely need appropriate shoes and to rent ski poles as its quite steep! Also note if you wanted to ski on untersberg there's only a small run and nowhere close by to rent skis.",Jan 2018

Then when your finally at the top you get to hike across snow and ice to summit the mountain. On the way back down, what better than to stop by the brewery/restaurant and have a beer and some food. The perfect morning.",Jan 2018

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We visited Untersberg via Number 25 bus from Salzburg taking 25 minutes to get there. The bus ticket and cable car ticket entrance was included with the Salzburg card we had purchased. The day was cold and sunny and it was not too busy so there were no queues. The trip up was amazing with the climb up seeming to take a very long time as once you had reached what looked like the top, then opened out into another and another vast expanse. Once at the top it was deep in snow and very slippery (no barriers), so good footwear is a must. They had broken the ice and snow up a little on the pathway as far as the cafe but it was still a bit tricky. The views were stunning in every direction and far below you could see Salzburg airport and many other places. A few visitors from 'our' cable car tried to make it as far as the cross but none made it as the slopes were just too dangerous and slippery. We had drinks in the chalet style cafe and this was fab, nice and warm with a great barman who had a bit of banter with his guests. Can honestly say this was a highlight of our 6 day trip and one we will certainly do again next time we are in Salzburg. If you buy a Salzburg Card either 24 or 48 hours you will save a lot of cash. We paid 32 euro for a 48 hour one and got free entrance to many, many attractions and free public transport in Salzburg. The cost of the bus to Untersberg and the cable car alone would have cost almost that.

Austria,Untersberg,2.0,"We visited Salzburg in July in hopes of hiking in the mountains such as Untersberg. Unfortunately, the Untersberg website did not provide enough information about the hiking possibilities (maps, routes and descriptions). Nevertheless, we decided to go to Untersberg and ask the ticket office for a hiking map and more information. However, the ticket officer did not know much more than we did. Since we bought the Salzburg Card, we took the cable car ride, which was scenic but not as interesting because we couldn't hike around the mountain.",Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"When we get to the cable car place, we looked out to the mountains and it was slightly covered with snow. I was feeling kind of disappointed thinking that this what we will get. The cable car took us all the way to mountains. We were able to see the whole city then everything was covered with clouds. Suddenly, as if we switched from place to place. We were urrounded by majestic views of the Austrian Alps. I can't express my feeling ps enough about the beauty and fresh air. We hiked all the way to the top ( 2000 meter). It was very rewarding experience and best part of our trip. We took the best pictures ever because it was sunny and clear with a blanket of clouds underneath us. Love this trip, can't say anything negative about it.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The best part of our Salzburg tour. You can't miss it. Take a public bus to the cable car station in Untersberg (around an hour ride or so), get into the cable car (unless you are an enthusiastic hiker), enjoy the nice city view from the nice cable car ride. But the best part was the view from the top and the hiking to the two peaks. On one side, it was the Salzburg city and beyond, the other side offered the majestic Alps. This was such an experience which I can't express with writing. Make sure you wear athletic shoes if you want to hike to the top, as some portion of the hiking path was steep.",Jun 2017
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"We took the cable car up and back on a sunny day in October 2017. Fantastic views of Salzburg and the surrounding area, although I think you'd be disappointed on a cloudy or foggy day. It was a lot colder up the top and there was a fair bit of snow. We brought a picnic lunch with us and also enjoyed a hot chocolate in the cafe.",Oct 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We did not know about the cable car until we heard it announced as a stop on the bus back from Berchesgarten, so stopped on a whim. The entrance to the cable car is right by the bus stop. In winter, the cars go up every half hour. It takes you to the top of one of the highest mountains in the area, with amazing views of snowy alps all around. The way up is very steep. When you reach the top, there is a lot of snow which is slippery where people have been treading. It was a brilliantly sunny day with totally clear skies when we went, so the views were truly fantastic. It cost about 23 Euros but it is free with the Salzburg card - a bargain if you plan to use the cable car.
You get there on the 25 or 840 bus - a few stops from the centre of Salzburg.

At the top you walk straight out into a snowy mountain top (I would highly recommend proper hiking shoes, we had spikes on ours as it‚Äôs very slippery!!) the views are incredible.
The trek to the summit is extremely steep, people we skiing down the slope, we didn‚Äôt go up ourselves as we felt the walk down would be extremely difficult, we settled for the 2nd highest point.
There‚Äôs a little bar/restaurant where we got a beer and strudel for a decent price, and watched the skiers and the other hikers slipping over in their inappropriate footwear.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Winter or summer, the Untersberg is a must if you visit Salzburg. A spectacular cable car takes you up the side of the mountain to near the top. Then a wide (but un-edged and with massive shear drop) steepish path takes you to the top and over the other side where you can get a cable car down into Germany. We got so far on the path, but it was icy and slippery and we decided to carefully go back after a bit as we had visions of going over the edge. Next time in the winter some kind of spiked shoes would be a good idea!",Jan 2018

It was a little scary...when you begin walking towards the summit, there is no rope, railing, etc to prevent you from going over the edge...the snow was very slick. But the views were indescribable!",Dec 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We went on the 25 bus to the Untersberg on New Year's Day - largely to let our children (who live in South Africa) see and play in the snow. The Untersberg didn't disappoint. The bus route is circuitous but it's quite a short and easy ride. The cable car is enormous fun and at the top, there are well marked paths with the ice coating on them broken down, so that walking is easy.

A warm coat, boots, hats and gloves are sensible and don't leave the paths - the surrounding snow covered slopes are often covered with a sheet of ice but the views of the Austrian/Bavarian Alps are stunning. We have views of alpine antelope, skiers and other walkers all out enjoying the sunshine. The views of Salzburg are a little limited, but there are alternative places (like Monschburg) for those views. It's highly recommended on a clear day.

Bundle up - we traveled in December and the mild cold at the bottom of the moutain was replaced by a whiteout snow storm when we arrived at the top. Simple snack shop at the top - but go outside and up the hill a little (follow the ropeline in the snow :) and there's a pub/restaurant awaiting you - warm and cozy!",Dec 2017

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Firstly get a Salzburg Card. Then get the bus 25 from the main railway station or one of the stops in the centre. At the end of the bus journey, about 30mins, is the cable car station just across the road. Once in the cable car it takes ten mins to get up the mountain. Cable car is large and people packed in. If you don‚Äôt like heights you‚Äôll be ok as in the middle of the car you can avoid looking out or down. Once at the top there is a cafe and an inside viewing point. Provided you are wrapped up well and have suitable footwear then you can walk quite some distance in the snow. Walk up to two peaks and the views are some of the best in the world. We took our two boys (age 6 and 9) and Grandad (aged 75) and they all loved it. One piece of advice is to keep a close eye on the weather to decide when is the best day and time to travel.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We made this trip on boxing day, bus 25 from Hbf straight to the Untersburg cable car which is just over the road from the bus stop. ( the journey takes 30 minutes). We used our Salzburg card which even if you just buy for one day and do this trip and one more tourist attraction will be worth the money. The cable car was quite a steep one, not for the faint hearted! Being December there was a lot of snow, so we were not able to walk very far ( the summit wasn't accessible), however don't let that put you off - make sure that you do this on a clear day, and the views are absolutely spectacular. We also had a hot chocolate and apple strudel in the little wooden cafe just 100m or so from the cable car- in total we spent just under an hour here, but it was definitely worth it. If you are going while there is snow, wrap up warm and wear footwear that is good on slippery surfaces as the short walk you are able to do is very up and down.

There is a Stubn at the top that serves pretty good food, beer and wine, and has both indoor and outdoor tables. The walk up to the cross at the top of the Untersberg takes about 20 minutes. You'll probably have to hike through some snow. The view is spectacular -- across Salzburg, it's airport, and a large part of Bavaria on one side, and across the high Austrian Alps on the other.

We paid ‚Ç¨36 each for a 48hr card which is definitely worth it and saves a fortune. I'd advice to wear sensible footwear. Yes you go up in a cable car but if you plan to walk to the peak of the mountain or just walk round the mountain I'd advice shoes or trainers with good grips. The views are amazing!!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We only had a day in Salzburg so bought the 24 hour Salzburg Card from the Tourist Office at the Train/Bus station. All public transport is included in the card as is the Untersburg cable car which in itself paid for the Salzburg Card. We took Bus 25 from the Main Bus Station and this is the last stop - it took around 45 minutes as it is out of town. Payment is easy on the bus, just let the driver know you want the Untersburg stop. We went around 2pm and it wasn't that busy so we went straight up on the next cable car. I thought I would be scared of the height the cable car travels up to but actually enjoyed the views downwards and upwards! The cable car is very fast and soon you are in the most spectacular 360 scenery around you. We were lucky that the clouds were not in our way and we could see all the way down to Salzburg.
There are a couple of walks up to the crosses but do wear sturdy shoes as it is gravelly on the paths and quite steep at some points. For a great photo point, as you pass the little outside sitting area from the cable car and the walking path forks 2 ways, if you follow the right hand path and before it turns a corner there is a little dip on the left hand side where there is a path in the grass you can walk to the ridge for some beautiful photos.
We stayed about an hour and got the next cable car down but had to wait 20 minutes for the next bus so we could go to Helbrunn Castle on the way back on the same bus. The online bus timetable for Salzburg is so useful to print off as it gives the exact timings of all buses and you can do your routes on there and it will tell you all the connecting times of any other buses/trains.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"with bus 25 from city center you reach the base of the cable car that brings you up to1800m in 12min. from there apart for obvious great 360¬∞ views, there are different paths from 10min to many jours of hiking. pick your choice. we did the 30min one with a daughter of 5, so nothing impossible. you are the lazy kibd? then just sit at one of the couple of restaurants at the top ( suggest the second one 5 min. up from the cable car.

it can be a full day if you stop at The castle Hellbrunn on the way back, with the same n.25 bus.
if you are the fit type or hiking fanatic you can descend on foot following the signed path.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Going to the top of Mt. Untersberg was a highlight of our visit to Salzburg. Of course, the perfect weather day helped. The ride on the cable car to the top is amazing and thrilling! The cable car is perfectly quiet as you glide along to the top. The views are incredible and amazing!! Hard to describe with words. Various hikes, some quite strenuous, take you to places with different views. We ate lunch at the topmost restaurant and had delicious food! The ride down on the cable car was just as incredible as the ride up. If you have a good weather day, be sure to include Mt. Untersberg on your itinerary. It is well worth it!",Aug 2017
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"I am not a fan of cable cars so I found this slightly difficult as you are quite packed in with others. (In our case a group of Japanese tourists who enjoyed accentuating the swaying). This being said the views were amazing. And the service efficient.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Possibly the biggest highlight of our trip in Salzburg.
1800 metres high and stunning 360degree views. Make sure the weather is spot on before going to make the most of the scenery.
The cable car will take you to the top in 10min where you can either set off on some hiking trails (worth doing) or relax at a small restaurant over looking the horizon.
*Tip get a Salzburg Card to reduce costs for the cable car (amoung other things) and make sure to wear decent shoes for hiking*
Free parking available on site where cable car is located but recommend to get there early.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,This is a great place to visit and you can reach here in thirty minutes through bus 25 at River salZach. It offers a free entry through Salzburg card. lift takes about 5 minutes and runs once per half hour so u need to wait at times. The view is nice and you can see upto 100 km on a sunny day but if it's cloudy then you have to live with fog. There are two resturants on top and one is cash only and other is cards if you order above ten euros. entry without card is 23 euros. There is an inside view Area and an outside euro trip. Nice attraction on cloudy day and perfect on sunny day.,Aug 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,If you've a Salzburg Card this is a great day out from Salzburg. The 25 from Rathaus is 'free' as is the ride up in the cable car (great ride!).

Check your weather forecast or you'll see only cloud,Aug 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"A must see! Observe the brown tourist signs from the A10 and ignore your sat nav (ours took us a very hair raising albeit scenic way which took twice as long). Or you can catch the No. 25 bus from Salzburg.

The views are spectacular; it wasn't cold in August so normal clothes suffice but good shoes are essential as some of the paths are uneven and can be slippery with moving gravel.

The cable car ride up and down is the highlight. Take your camera!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We visited Salzburg beginning of May and so the mountain was still snowy which was a little slippery with normal shoes/sneaker but it was OK. We were not prepared because we went there spontaneously so we didn't wear thick jackets, which was not so bad because the sun was super warm. We totally enjoyed our stay on top of the Untersberg and the service staff in the restaurants is very friendly as well!",May 2017
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Took advantage of the Salzburg Card and took the bus to Untersberg and it was well worth the trip! Gorgeous view and a great place to take a short hike for an even greater view!
Go early in the morning to avoid the lineups. The tram goes up every half hour and opened at 8. We caught the 9:30 tram and when we came down at noon, there was a lineup that snaked through the parking lot in the hot sun!",Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"My visit to the Untersberg was definitely a highlight of my stay in Salzburg. It is easy to get there. You can take bus nr 25 (to Untersberg). And the end of the busroute you take the funicular, that will get you close to the top of the Untersberg in about 15 minutes. The views from the mountain (and from the gondola) are magnificent! I just sat at the top and looked around for about an hour, there was so much to see.
From the funicularstation there are a few routes you can walk. If you have good shoes, you can also walk to the top. Warning: it is quite steep and there is not a real trail everywhere, so you really need shoes with a good profile underneath! But when you reach the top, the climb is totally worth it. If you don't want to walk, it is also possible to just relax at the cafe near the funicular and enjoy the view from there.
Fun fact: the Untersberg is on the border with Germany. When I was at the top, I got a textmessage that I had entered Germany.
If you are in Salzburg, make sure you have time to visit this place, it is absoluty beautiful!!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We didnt know what this attraction was really about until we got there. This mountain is on the border of Germany and Austria. A bus from the Old Town takes you to the foot of the mountain, where you can catch a cable car up. Cable cars leave every 30 minutes, but are packed full of people standing. The trip up the mountain in the cable car is very funny, as you think you are nearly at the top, until the car goes over a small crest in the mountain, and you see you still have a long way to go! For us the day was very foggy, but that actually added to the experience, as the cable of our cable car appeared to just disappear. Very cool effect!

You get to the top and the path is rocky and in some parts rather steep, but it is overall very scenic. Even on a foggy day, we could see down to the main city centre of Salzburg. The fog actually added a cool effect, as you walk along the path, and emphasises how high up you are. The walk can go on for as long as you like. We didnt realise how far it went, and walked for a while before we met some other hikers, who advised they had walked for over 2 hours and the mountain appeared to keep going.

At the top there is a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating.

Overall it is a great experience, we just wish we had worn better shoes to hike further and explore more.
Staff arent very friendly but its Austria, so whats new.

Austria,Untersberg,3.0,"Using the Salzburg Card gave me use of the chairlift up and recovered the card cost instantly and I then intended to do the hill top walk as a warm up for a few weeks of bigger hikes. I was assuming the track would be like a formed footpath given the closeness to Salzburg and the number of visitors arriving but although relatively flat, the track very quickly became 'wild' and turned into knobbly limestone rock with the tops worn smooth by years of trampling so that in the slight wet and mud it was quite slippery and falling onto the rough rock would have hurt!
After careful and slow plodding about halfway along the mountain top I found there was very few lookout points for views, with the track generally being safely far back from the plateau edge behind a screen of obscuring vegetation. At that point I turned around and headed into town to get more value from my Salzburg card!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"I hate being in a box suspended in the air but this was totally worth it. The ride up is about 9 minutes and pretty sturdy. Make sure to dress appropriately, I saw a lot of people getting on the lift in shorts and t-shirts. There is a significant difference (~10+ Celsius cooler) in weather at the top vs the bottom. If you want to walk it, it's about 2-3 hours down. Not sure about the way up. Also bring sturdy shoes for that. As the rocks wear down your feet after a while. Be sure to stop at the restaurant for a strudel and mulled wine if it's a cooler day. May have been the cheapest food in Salzburg (and great-tasting).

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,The Untersberg Bahn and the hilltop is pretty good. The cable car takes you from ground to around 2500m in 10 minutes. Good view of the mountains and the entire city from the hilltop. Good chance for anyone to get on top of the Alps and to view a good scenery. Would suggest to opt for the Salzburg card as the individual visit cost for this is pretty high.,Jun 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"If you are in Salzburg, I would recommend this place. The cable car ride to the top of Untersberg was a a very nice journey of few minutes. There are two restaurants at the top. View from the top was really amazing. You can spot few adventurous folks paragliding from here. It is a great place for landscape photography as well. During our time of visit in mid July 2017, the last descend of the cable car was at 05.30 pm.",Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We took the number 25 bus to the cable car ride station. The ride up is fun. They pack the car, but you still get to appreciate the views up. Once at the top the views are breathtaking. I love scenery and I cannot think of anything as wondrous and beautiful as I saw that day on top of Untersberg.

We hiked as far as we could and stopped numerous times for photo opportunities. The hike is challenging and slippery at times, so I highly recommend sneakers (trainers) or hiking shoes. Leave the flats, flip flops, and high heels at home.

We went in mid-July and the weather was cool up there. My Wife and kids took a light jacket and I a runners top, which we wore when the wind picked up. Wearing them made it comfortable. I saw plenty of people in t-shirt and shorts (I wore shorts), but it was July.

On the way back, we stopped and had lunch and a beer at the restaurant. The food was very flavorful and well worth stopping by. I can now say, I've eaten lunch and enjoyed a beer in the outdoors 1700 meters up. Good food and great views made lunch surreal.

We spent about three hours on this trip and to be fair, you can do it in two or as long as you wan. If you love views and hiking, plan on three hours minimum, if not four or five.

I would highly recommend this excursion to anyone and everyone, as I have incredible memories of fun times, good food, and simply breathtaking views.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Due to time constraints we were on the final run of the day - but it was so worth it to experience the cable car & the incredible vistas! It was easy to find the right bus which took us directly to the base where the cable car is entered. Highly recommended but advise good foot wear as others have mentioned.,Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Don't miss this opportunity to go to the top, on the Untersberg tram! It's a fabulous view of Salzburg, and valleys below, and provides two restaurants to choose from, once you get to the top. We hiked up to the Cross, and took pictures and a rock pedestal, overlooking the Alps. Later had lunch at the cafe on the side of the mountain. It was my wife Birthday, so I mentioned it on the tram, and everyone sang Happy Birthday to her. People from around the world, all together in a small tram, but they seemed like family.
Don't miss it. Just a short drive up the canyon.",Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Highlight of my time in Salzburg :D

As everyone recommends, the Salzburg card is a really good deal and allows a free ride up the mountain. To get there, you can take bus 25 from the city centre.

I would highly suggest going in the morning as the sun gets a little cray from noon. But overall, temperature was really nice. Wear grippy shoes (if you have trekking poles, that's a plus, but not necessary), pack a light snack and stay hydrated! For photographers, bring your tripod coz its worth it (doubles up as a trekking pole to haaaa).

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"First things first, get the Salzburg card. It's around 27 euro per person, but it gets you into multiple museums, the fortress and to the top of the Untersberg. We only had one full day and it was worth every penny.

Once you have your card take the bus to untersberg and enjoy an hour or two at the top. The views are top notch. There's a couple small restaurants up there if you want to have a drink before heading down. This is a no brainer, even tho it takes a little time to get there.

Finished in Germany and walked 30 mins back into Austria where the cable car start point was and where you can take a bus back to the city. Takes about 4-5 hours to walk down. There are some ice caves which have tours every hour. Waterfalls and lots of scenery on the way down,Jul 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We went up Mount Untersberg with the 48 hr Salzburg Card. I'm not sure how much it would have been without it but personally feel it was value simply because we wouldn't have considered it if it hadn't been 'free' for us. I was a bit worried about finding it, but it's actually really simple to get the bus - we got the bus from Rathaus, from memory the number 25(?) which is very regular, and it was the very last stop. We made a day trip of going to Untersburg and the Hellbrunn Palaces, all along the same bus route and very easy to know when to get off at each stop (also a free route with the Salzburg card!)

It was an absolutely incredible experience being able to go up. It was a little cloudy when we went but still very good sights around all the mountains. There are also a couple of cafes to get something to eat and drink, didn't seem too badly priced despite being in a tourist spot. I guess the only thing was that we weren't totally sure where to walk - this could have been improved possibly simply by asking at the reception, which possibly even had maps. I would definitely recommend asking before going if you explain if you want a proper hike or just a look around without too much strength. We walked to one of the crosses, we were going to walk to another but saw a sign which made it look like it was 3km away so we gave up - all the signs were in German (or they were pointing to landmarks that weren't recognisable to us) hence why it would make more sense to ask first or have a route in mind. We still enjoyed our time regardless.

As someone whose scared of heights I was a little nervy doing this, but actually I felt quite safe for most of it. The cable car is a totally covered, sturdy thing like on the London Eye or something - not like the ski slope type cars which are just benches, that would have absolutely terrified me! It does go a bit rickety so I guess be prepared for that (there are some seats in the cable car so you could try and sit on them) but honestly I was so mesmerised by the views that it had little effect on me.

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,I loved that a person on wheelchair could be lifted all the way to the top of this mountain but the irony is that the cable car station itself (at the ground level) isn't accessible .

The staff are friendly though still not as welcoming as those in Germany .

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Our group of three adults and a seven year old caught the cable car to der Untersberg on a whim as we drove past and had a spectacular sunny day. The cable ride is breathtaking. We have been on cable rides in Switzerland and Austria and whilst this was not as high, the dramatic drop offs on the way up really add to the thrill. At the top, there are loads of walking trails and it looks like some of these lead to camp sites as we saw people heading up on the last ride for the day with large backpacks and sleeping bags. We went up for the view only. Other than the hiking tracks, there is not much at the top. A short walk the crest, a small cafe and some seating. The site was loaded with people with daypack to it is obviously a hikers hub.
We all enjoyed the stop. The price for 3 adults and a kinder was 37 euro - we forgot to use our local card which may have gotten us a discount. We were in a rush to get up before the cable runs finished for the day.
Definitely a spectacular view of the area and surrounding mountains - all are marked on various signs at the top so you can orientate yourself. Note the tracks round the top are mostly rock (glacial till) so consider leaving your stroller behind even if you are just going to the top for a quick peak.

I will advise to spend at least an hour there. If you are travelling in hot weather, keep at least 2-3 water bottles with you as you may feel more thirsty at top.

The whole trip was very convenient. From the cafe where you get out of the cable car, you can choose a trail. We chose the 45-minute one to where the big cross is. The view was amazing. Sturdy shoes are a must. There's a little bit of snow in late May, but the gravel combined with some steep slopes would make it a difficult climb or descend if you wear the wrong shoes or flip flops. Running shoes are OK; just move slowly. In total, probably about 10 minutes of the walk (one way) was a little scary. The rest was not bad. People of average fitness should be able to do it. It is exposed, too, so wear sunglasses, hat, etc.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We didn't originally plan to do the cable car but accidentally found ourselves there and could not resist; we ended up doing the climb to each of the cross points (close to the German side) when the mountain was still covered in slushy snow - the views were absolutely worth it (I was singing Climb E'vry Mountain and looking for Edelweiss) but we were ill prepared for it (had on wrong shoes and clothes) and it was probably a bit dangerous as we stayed till the very last minute at 5pm and barely made it back to the cable car in time.

Go on a clear sunny day as the clouds obscure views of both sides. Wear the right shoes - it's rocky, wet sometimes, and slippery.

A local bus takes you there in about 45 minutes; it is included in the Salzburg Card.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"A great day out. You can walk up the mountain from Schmiedererplatz in Parsch (bus 6). It will take 3 hours or so and is well sign-posted. There are various routes from the straight up (I run/walk it in less than an hour) to the old railway track which winds its way up. Stop for a drink at the Zistelalm near the top.
Alternatively take the bus up the mountain, or drive and park at the Zistelalm. From here there is a wonderful ""Rundweg"" which is more or less flat, around 5 km long, pushchair friendly and takes you all round the mountain.
Finally from the very top you can paraglide or just watch the flyers and take in the impressive views of Salzburg and the awe-inspiring landscape around it.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"With the cable car station not to far from the City of Salzburg (there is a bus available, I'd say it takes you less than 30 minutes with the bus) you are up on a real mountain in a really short time. This time of the year you still have snow on top of the Untersberg while the city swets in 29¬∞C (happened two days ago^^).

On top of the mountain you can just enjoy the view, eat or drink something at the restaurant, walk a short distance to a near ""Huette"" a bit lower than the restauarant or walk for hours around or even go down all the way back (so up cable car, down by foot...or the other way around, just make sure to get a shutle as the starting point of the cable car is a bit different than the walking path).

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,Coming from Australia where we have very small mountains the Untersberg is a magnificent sight with great views. The ride up the mountain on the cable car is also impressive.,May 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Today I braved the cable car up the Untersberg, after years of plucking up the courage. If you're afraid heights, it's 9 minutes, 10 seconds of pure terror, as you make a steep ascent over a large drop!

I sat on the floor the whole way with my eyes closed, rocking gently backwards and forwards, looking like a complete moron.

Was it worth the ten minutes of fear though? Absolutely! The views over the Austrian countryside were breathtaking. I'd have braved double the time in the cable car just to stand on top of that mountain and see Salzburgerland all around me.

If you want to hike to the summit, it's not far but take sensible shoes with a lot of grip. There is snow up there, and it's slippery.

There are two reasonably priced cafes near the cable car station too, should you (like me) need to fortify yourself with gluhwein before braving the return trip.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Get a salzburg card and take bus 25 from central salzburg till the end terminal. Cable car ride of about 10 mins up to the top. There are 2 restaurants up there as well as stunning views of the town, sky and mountains. (Free WiFi, look out for the username and password)

From there, we chose to hike for another 20-30mins to see the sights of snow-capped mountains! For that, do be prepared to walk in slippery and ankle-deep snow. There are benches up there so you can actually bring some snacks up there for a little picnic if you like!

We also had fun balling the snow and throwing at each other! Oh there was a cool dude who slide down the slippery snowy slope. No, we didnt do that cos we were in jeans!

After the hike, we stopped by the restaurant for a hearty lunch - Austrian noodle, beef soup and kakao with rum - with the great view.

All in all, Untersberg is totally worth it! Definitely recommend it!

There are three bus stops betwen the two spots.The Palace is also uncluded in the Salzburg Card.,May 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This was the highlight of activities undertaken utilising the Salzberg Card. It is worth the effort to make the journey out of the city to get there. The cable car ride offers brilliant scenery that is topped only by the view at the top. Pack your warm jacket and sensible shoes to make the most of the short walk to the summit cross.
We also enjoyed a lovely cup of coffee in the tavern whilst waiting for our cable car to take us back down.",May 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Very attractive and cool thing to do while in Salzburg. Be aware of climate and prepare yourself nice. On the top is 1776 meters so it is really a mountain and the temperate can be very low. On my trip on the bottom was 20 degrees and on the top was only 3 degrees with snow and ice, but it was worth it.
The climb with gondola last full 10 minutes and it is impressive. Definitely something you need to visit.",May 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"First of all, make sure you have the Salzburg card. Second of all get the number 25 bus to the end of the line, get on the cable car (not for the faint hearted) and get up to the top of this mountain because the views you will get are out of this world. You literally feel as if you are on the top of the world. You need to wear sensible shoes - we sadly didn't so with the snow we couldn't walk any higher which a lot of people we doing - unless your brave like one woman who wore flipflops!
The cable car is a bit...don't look down! But again, you get some phenomenal views and its worth it - the hot chocolate with rum in the caf√© at the top helps with going back down - but the man there is a bit on the rude side! If you get the Salzburg card, public transport is free and so are a lot of attractions including this. If we hadn't have gotten the Salzburg card, this would have cost about 30 euro! Well worth it all round.

The cable car is not for the faint hearted - very very high!!

Wear decent shoes if there is snow on the ground - the higher platform and cafe were inaccessible to me and my cousins due to poor footwear choice (no grip) and a slippery slope of doom up to the next bit. I saw an American try to come back down in flip flops, it was messy.

The cafe is basic, but did a mean hot chocolate 'mit captain morgans'. Took the edge off the return journey on the cable car. The cafe guy is really miserable üòÇ

The scenery as you are ascending is fabulous- super sights and views overlooking Salzburg - we spotted deer as well. At the top there are also 2 restaurants which would be great for lunch. It was a wonderful trip and one of the highlights whilst in Salzburg!",Jul 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This attraction should be the first on your list, You can get here by public transportation, or better if you are driving you can park at the cable car office's lot for free.
Get Salzburg card, you will make your money back by only visiting two attractions.
From the foot of the mountain, it is about 15 minutes ride to the top, and the last car ride back is at 1700.
The view from the top is unlike any-other, definitely worth it, we even got to play with snow in April.
Once on top it is about half kilo path to walk on the mountain nose, to go and comeback, there is also a cafe.
Take bus #25 to last station Untersbergbahn, see photo
reserve minimum of 1 hour for this attraction starting from the cable car ride at the bottom.

Even from the lower level the view is amazing, city on one side and snowy mountains on the other. Although it was covered in snow, it wasn't that cold so don't need to bring winter jackets haha though I would recommend snow shoes if you want to walk to the peak! There is also 2 restaurants up the top. Cable cars leave every 30 mins, going up is usually crowded but going down is fine. You can take strollers up but will have to leave them by the restaurant to walk the rest due to snow. Also big car park.

First things first, you should buy a 24h tourist pass (24E) and this includes free transportation in the city as well free ride to the top and back (good deal). It's an incredible view at the top. We went about 30 minutes to reach the ""cross"" from another peak (not sure if that was already in Germany or not, but it was great) and had lots of fun climbing and being on the top :) I do recommend that you wake up early and go there in the early morning (they open at 8:30/9:00) otherwise it gets quite crowded.",Mar 2017

It is about a 10 minute gondola ride to the peak and there is a cafe and restaurant up there. You can spend as much or as little time at the top. There are walks from the top as well as great photo opportunities. I recommend going if you are wanting a great view of Salzburg (but only on a clear day!)",Mar 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"It goes without saying that you need to pick a clear day. We rode to the cable car station from Salzburg on bus route 25 which stops about 50m from the cable car. Its about a 10 minute ride to the top and what a ride.

Once at the top walk through the cable car station and past 2 cafes. You can then go to three lookout points;

1. Behind you and above the cable car station and marked by a giant lattice cross. Great views of Salzburg from here.
2. Carry on along the trail for a couple of hundred metres and you will see a miners pick and helmet statue. They're are good views of the Alps from here.
3. Or if you feel really energetic, continue on the path to the mountain peak from which you get magnificent views of the Alps.

We went up at the end of March and there was still snow on the ground so we only got as far as the miners pick lookout. You will need at least an hour walking in the snow to teach the peak.

We thought the trip to the top would end in a lookout and a quick descent, then back to Salzburg. How wrong we were, the view at the top was topped off with a log cabin at a higher elevation that sells coffee and cake, plus other goodies. The day was perfect, blue skies and views for miles. The snow at the top made the lookouts surreal for a family of Australians who don't experience snow during winter. The clouds floated below as we drank our coffee - bliss",Dec 2016

Didn't expect to see as much snow as I did, we spent a couple of hours up here walking and enjoying the views. There is a bar to have a nice rest.

We were lucky as there was lots of snow on top which was great fun trying to walk on. We called into the tavern and had some hot goulash soup to warm us up. Awesome trip. You can use your Salzburg card here as well. Catch number 25 bus from Mirabell Plaz and get off at Untersberg. It's the last stop. It's very easy.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Using the Salzburg Card, we went up Untersberg in early March. The bus is very efficient and runs every 10 minutes during peaks/20 minutes during off peak from central Salzburg to Untersberg. The journey takes approximately 30 minutes depending where you get on. With the Salzburg card, you don't need a ticket to access the cable car, simply wait until boarding which is on the hour and half hour and show your card. The cable car journey lasts 10 minutes and is stunning. When you arrive at the top you have beautiful views and plenty of snow to enjoy. We had walking boots and no walking sticks, and we managed to walk for about 30 minutes (slowly) admiring different views and aspects.

Note that the cafe/bar just outside of the cable car station at the top of the mountain is cash only (much to the displeasure of some American tourists who had ordered and eaten before realised they couldn't pay and asked where the nearest ATM was ;) )

Definitely make the effort to visit this location - amazing views and great fun.

Within 15 minutes of walking we were stripped down to t-shirts and deeply regretting not having brought sunglasses and sunblock. The weather was perfect - cloudless and still.
We had taken the bus from the train station in Salzburg and both the bus fare and the cable car were included in our Salzburg Card. The ride up the mountain is spectacular and takes about 10 minutes. Hold on to small children when you exit at the top as the edges of the path fall away precipitously. From here, passing 2 small eateries, you can climb up to a wooden cross. This takes 20-30 minutes and involves a couple of steep dips and climbs in the path which were fun to navigate in the snow.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Stunning trip on the cable car. The land around Salzburg itself is generally quite flat, so when you take the bus ride out of the city towards the mountains it's a very impressive view to see them rising up so steeply and suddenly. We got out there in time for the 1st or 2nd trip of the day and being a Sunday morning it was very quiet which was nice too.

The actual ride on the cable car lasts barely 10 minutes, but it is spectacular if you're lucky enough to have a clear and sunny day! I'm not sure of the exact vertical distance it rises in the ~3km of cable it traverses, but it must be well over 1000m given that the top is at an altitude of 1776m! You get great views back to the northeast over Salzburg, and into the Alps to the south.

When you get to the top, there's an indoor viewing area with lots of windows, a small balcony facing towards Salzburg, and a door you can go through out onto the mountainside behind the cable car station. This may look slightly hazardous when covered in snow because there are some steep gradients to walk up/down and very little in the way of barriers in the way of what would be a long slide/fall down the side of the mountain. A pair of hiking poles might be a decent idea for a winter visit, and keep a very close eye on children.

The path goes up to the intermediate peak of the mountain just behind the cable car station, at a little over 1800m. You can stand on the top and get a 360 degree view of the area and it is stunning on a clear day. If you're feeling adventurous you can also continue on up the path to an even higher peak marked by another large cross.

Even though it was late December it wasn't even that cold up there as it was full sunshine on top of the mountain. We walked to both crosses which was worth it but you have to be careful at this time of year as the snow was a bit tricky to walk on.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Well health and safety would have a field day if this was in the U.K.! Great ride up in the cable car through the clouds to the top. When you leave the station you go through the viewing platform (inside) to the side of the building. You can then walk up hill (compact and soft snow) to the inn in the top (opens at 12) slipping and sliding as you go. No barrier, nice views of a rather long drop down the mountain if you take a tumble. Some intrepid souls trotted off up towards a cross in the distance, not I, having managed to get to the pub I stayed there until I ""slid"" back down to get the cable car.

In all seriousness a fabulous view, quiet, peaceful, even when visibility is poor it's still worth it. However the odd barrier at the edge would probably be a good investment in winter!

Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"The views from the top of the mountain are incredible. Only issues are that the cable car only comes every half hour and shuts at 4pm (at least at the end of January). We just missed the 3pm one by a few minutes so we had to catch the 3:30 which didn't give us much time to look around. Also, we went on a beautiful sunny day. I imagine there is less visibility with bad weather.",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,The photographs of this area on trip adviser are in summer season mainly so you don't get the unbelievable breath taking beauty in winter. It is beautiful romantic charming and utterly beguiling üåπyou can't help but fall in love with the place. Close your eyes and listen to the awesome sound of silence. Open your eyes and you will be singing with Julie Andrews..........,Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,We had visited this place in the month of september...We need to go up on the mountain through a cable car.Since it was cloudy that day we couldnt enjoy the great view..But it is a fantastic place to visit.,Sep 2016
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"From Untersberg (translation: under the mountain) you can take an cablecar to the top of the mountain and have a nice panoramic view! As i wrote in the Salzburg downtown review, the city is small so if you are bored about the visit in downtown and want have something different, go to Untersberg (about 10 KM) from downtown and take the cablecar. Better of course in summer or winter with sunny days.",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Free cable car with the Salzburg card. Have been up twice in the winter only. Small cafe at the top which is great. Keep in mind there are no barriers so keep your children under supervision. Great views on a clear day, and something totally magically on a foggy day - you feel like you are the only people in the world.",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The view from this mountain is amazing! You see all the surrounding, this location is especially worth visiting in the winter, the mountain gets snowy and fun, although if you are afraid of cold be aware that the top is quite windy.",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,We went up to the top using the cable car. We got to see some amazing views from the top. I would suggest taking a Salzburg card so that the transport within Salzburg and the cable car are free to use. Would recommend a visit to Untersberg,Oct 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We had the 24 hour Salzburg card so used this to go here. This trip alone paid for it. Take the 25 bus from the main stop outside the Bristol Hotel and it takes you to the cable car.
Astonishing ascent/descent and of course great view across Salzburg and beyond. Well worth it",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,Well worth a trip here. 25 bus from town droops you off at the cable car which is free if you have a Salzburg card. Great ride to the top where you can stroll around and visit the tavern. We enjoyed a drink sitting in the snow which was fantastic.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This was by far the highlight of my visit to the area...I was afraid to go up that high steep mountain but was so happy I did. It was cold snow and ice on the mountain top but so exciting to see. The air was crisp and clean, the view was absolutely fantastic. I was beautiful beyond words.",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,3.0,"We bought the Salzburg card and took bus 25 to get there. The cable car is nice, you can see a great view. Once we reached the top we were a bit disappointed. There's a door to get out on the top but due to the weather and the narrowness of the passageway we thought it was unsafe to climb up to the top. The snow was covering everything so it was very slippery and there's no fence, we thought it's a bit dangerous coz if one fell she can slip and fall. Great view though but we couldn't stay more than 20 minutes.",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Free with the Salzburg card..!!
Get the no.25 bus from the centre of town and it takes you straight to the cable car.
Great ride up in the cable car, little scary if you don't like heights but totally worth it when you get to the top and see the magnificent views.. Nice little restaurant at the top as well .",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"This was a fund 1/2 day outing. Take city bus 25 for a 20 minute bus ride to the bottom of the Gondola. At the top you have a great view and you can hike around the top and climb a little more for even better views. We went in December when there was snow- dress warm- It was a little slippery, but even kids as young as 8 or 9 were able to make it up the slope. With out snow it should be an easy hike for any one. Get the Salzburg card: It gives free bus fare and Gondola, plus many other activities around town. With just Untersberg and the palace, it paid for itself.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Its a must visit place when you're in Salzburg. A nice cable car ride to top of the mountain and beautiful view, wind all mixes up very good",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"What an amazing day trip! Took the cable car up Maria's mountain..... perfect!! Walked to the top in deep snow to have photos taken by the cross. Stunning views! Use the Salzburg card to get free entry. Cafe at the top - in Germany! Really lovely and reasonable as well, not to pricey. A must for the views - plan for a clear day and you will not be disappointed!",Jan 2017
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Was in Salzburg and followed the TripAdvisor recommendation about this place. Took a bus from just outside the train station , trip took just under half hour & cost only a few Euros one way. Bus stops just near to the cable car station. Cost per adult is around ‚Ç¨23 (round trip). It can get rather packed in the cable car but it's a fun ride and views are amazing. Once on top of the mountain the views are even more breathtaking! In winter be prepared for snow & ice. There is a cafe at the cable car station but I would recommend the cosy wooden lodge just a short walk up. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I would love to return!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"You should get a Salzburg card if you don't ant to wait in queue and if if are planning to visit a number of places by public transport in Salzburg.
Now here goes the description of Untersberg. It is very cold and the snow is quite slippery. Please choose and wear the correct type of shoes before you visit Untersberg. I made the mistake of wearing my rainboots there and had quite a challenging time trying not to fall. Also, do not take babies and toddlers, especially if you are planning on visiting during winter. Nor your beloved pets. The cold will be a torture for them.

Now the good part- It will be a treat to your eyes and mind (ie, if you have worn enough warm clothes to counter the cold). The view from Untersberg summit is splendid. And if you are wearing the correct type of shoes then you can explore bit further from where the seilbahn station is. I suggest you take the first trip (9:00AM CET) of the Untersbergbahn. This way you'll get more sunlight, and less crowd. There's also a small cafetaria at the cablecar (seilbahn) station at the top of Untersberg.

How to reach the seilbahn station? Take bus 25 from Salzburg HBf and the end point of the bus is the Untersbergbahn station.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"If you have a clear day, I highly recommend taking the cable car up Untersberg. The views were spectacular!! Totally worth it. Free entry with the Salzburg Card. The restaurant (not the one in the station where the cable car is, the other one that is just outside the station) was super cozy and offered delicious traditional Viennese food. The spaetzle and fritattan soup were very good especially.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We travelled to the Untersberg by bus using the Salzburg Card, on a very cold wintery day. A magical place to be on such a snowy day, the views were amazing and what better way to warm up than to have a hot chocolate with rum at the the inn at the top!",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"The view from the top was absolutely stunning, we enjoyed it. Two things which tripped us up though. Firstly, we did not realise how far out of the city it was, and secondly that our Salzburg Cards expired whilst we were up there and we had to pay for the return journey.",Feb 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Not crazy about heights but so worth the view. So glad I wore sturdy shoes as it is extremely slippery up there this time of the year. Fantastic outing.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Absolute perfect view over Salzburg. Highly recommend as it's so easy to get to and free of you get the Salzburg card. It's only a it's a short ride from the Schloss Hellbrunn so it can be done as a day out.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"As others have mentioned, get the Salzburg Card, then take the bus 25 out to Untersberg. If you don't have proper snow clothing, there is conveniently stores (with decent prices) in a small town nearby called Anif (on the bus route). I hadn't packed proper clothing, so I stopped and added a sale pair of snow boots of good quality, plus inexpensive other items from the neighboring store (those seem rather cheap and aren't holding up well, unlike the boots).

I went up early, so it wasn't crowded and I was able to get a great spot on the first cable car with only a short wait for it to come down! The weather was clear, but by the time I left, you could barely see in front of your face because a storm blew in, so check the weather! It was bitterly cold and people without proper shoes were sliding all over the place, but I got around just fine. I didn't have snow pants and survived, but dress like you're headed skiing and you'll enjoy it much more!

Time here really varies - some people went up, took a few pictures and back down. If you spend any time exploring, expect to spend 2 hours total. If you want to eat or drink at the little pub outside and up the hill, add even more time.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Read trip advisor before journey so we have all snow boots and ski trousers with us to change after a fantastic ride in cable car. My teenage children suddenly changed into perfect carefree angles in the snow. It's like magic. Loved every bit of our 4 hours there. Nice and safe hiking route even for my 11 years old. Thanks to all previous reviews making us prepared from clothing to bus schedule and the most useful Salzburg Card. Tempted to go up to the mountain again if the kids are bored of museums tomorrow.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,I'm terrified of highs but I did it. The ride up was stunning and once to the top there was snow all over the place. The view was breathe taking and you can go all the way up to the top where the cross is. Cute alpine pub that's cute inside. Don't miss this and go on a clear day.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,It was a bit of lousy weather the day we chose to go up untersberg mountain but it definitely did not affect the delight we had. We used our Salzburg card which I might add was a great investment as it included the bus fare and the lift to the peak. The top of the mountain was snow covered with -7 degree temperature and cloud cover but it was an experience none of my family will forget. We went to the restaurant at the top for some fantastic hot chocolate and gluhwein to help defrost us. The cable car ride gave us some unbelievable sights and views that makes it worthwhile even with the freezing weather. A real must do.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Visited Untersberg and took cable car to summit. Great day and snow was lovely on mountain as we made our way up. Place to eat as you arrive and a traditional bar further up out of initial buildingat the top. Visit worth money however, good tip is to get a Salzburg card and you will get your bus fare and entrance for free. Lots of photographic opportunities. Few steps to climb so not great for anyone who may struggle.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"I visited in December and it was quite cold with some snow fall. The whole place looks so beautiful from the top and snow adds to the beauty. I happened to talk to some locals there and they gave me quite some interesting information about the place, its history and the fauna specific to this part of the region. Just be careful during the winter with your shoes, if they are too slippery you might fall quite often.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,If you are ever in Salzburg I highly recommend that you go to this attraction as it has wonderful views of the surrounding areas. If you do go to this attraction I suggest that you wear warm clothes as it is very cold at the top. You can't go wrong with this attraction. NB GO UP ON A SUUNY DAY.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Visit this attraction using a Salzburg card and couple it with a visit to the fortress in Salzburg and you will cover the purchase price of the card. The ride from Salzburg on the bus is worthwhile. The ride up the mountain is spectacular, particularly if you gave not been in a cable car before. The view from the top are spectacular. The cost of the food in the inn close to the top of the cable car is very reasonable.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Take the 25 bus to the end, you can't go wrong. Again, use the Salzburg city card for entry and travel, much more cost effective. A short trip up, and a short walk to the top. I'd recommend slightly capable footwear if you go in winter like me, snow and skateboard shoes are a bad, yet funny, mix. Worth the trip for sure, though try make it on a sunny, or high cloud day.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Well this trip up the ropeway ..my life literally flashed by in front of my eyes.i recorded a message for my parents telling them how much I loved them..
It's one ride of a life time. So high up in the mountains. Freezing cold in july too.

Please do carry warm clothes ...it's too cold up there.wear comfortable shoes as there's a lot of rubble and loose stones and it's a steep climb. But once you are there..what a view.The air never felt fresher. Well worth your time and money",Jul 2016
Austria,Untersberg,4.0,"Thankfully the Untersberg was included on the Salzburg card. We were very keen to visit. The trip by bus was pleasant (and also included on the Salzburg card) and the wait for the cable car was about 20 min as the last one had just left. Quick trip up, and I had some trouble with the heights (ie looking down). However from the top, and on firm ground we walked up to the summit and had a great view. It would have been a much better view if it was fine, but cloudy and a little drizzly made the view restricted. Could see all of the surrounding valleys, and you really get to see how beautiful Austria is. Is a must see, and is included on the Salzburg card which is avail at the same cost from all Hotels.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,This is an experience not to miss. The views were stunning. We had a clear sunny day (10th Dec). The cost was Euro 23 per person and the ride on the cable car takes about 10 minutes. We stopped for brunch in the chalet restaurant on the top and had an excellent goulash soup and very large piece of apple straddle. Much to my surprise the hot chocolate with rum was wonderful and really warming after the walk.,Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"When in Salzberg the castle is so prominent you feel you must visit it. However it isn't like some of the great German or French castles. It is mostly just a ""shell"".
Of course the views are great from the battlements but inside - no. There is an ""audio commentary"" but I think it even has difficulty finding enough of interest inside - mostly concentrates on the history.
Nice that there is a Funicular to get up to it, but if I hadn't had a Salzberg Card I don't believe the cost would have been worth it.",Dec 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We were really lucky to get fantastic weather on the first day of opening of the cable car. Take the No.25 bus all the way. An easy trip to the top of the mountain for some fantastic views.
If you get vertigo, don't panic. The walk at the top is easy and feels safe at all times. The path is wide and the barriers are reassuring, even in the snow. The cafe at the top is a great place for lunch, a beer or some gluhwein. Saw lots of alpine choughs (birds) and several memorials including one to the gebirgsj√§ger which I found particularly interesting. A very worthwhile, fun and interesting place to visit when in Salzburg.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"A group of us rode bikes from Salzburg city centre out to Untersberg. If you have the time and energy I highly recommend getting there this way. We rode through little villages and got great views of the mountain the whole way there. Bike rental was approx. 10 euro for the day including a lock.
Once arriving at Untersberg, we got onto a cable car almost straight away. The entire trip up takes around 10 minutes. Try to get a spot near a window because the views are stunning. Austria is a beautiful country and the chance to see it from up high cannot be missed.
Once up on the mountain, there are plenty of walking tracks of varying times/distance with views in all directions.
There are a couple of different cafes also. We chose the Hochalm am Untersberg as there were plenty out seats outside. Food was reasonably priced, drinks were on the expensive side.
The wait for the cable car back down was a bit longer as we were there towards closing time so most people were trying to get back down.
There is also a small stream nearby with nice banks and water to relax in if you get the chance.

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"A trip to Untersberg was on our must-do list while in Salzburg. This was an easy short trip to do from Salzburg, and using the Salzburg card on public transport Bus 25 to Untersberg and then on cable car to mountain top made it good value.

We enjoyed our first trip in mid September so much on a very grey day with quickly moving clouds that we made another trip the next day when it was clear, blue and sunny - two very different scenes but equally stunning views and moods of the mountain. The first day we could hear the planes taking off and coming in to land in Salzburg and the next day we could see them on the runway below! Lots of walks and trails to go for a short or long walk, warm layered clothes and reasonably sturdy shoes are the best.

Works well if you can time the return bus with cable car both ways; we then combined this with a visit to Schloss Hellbrunn on the return journey to Salzburg for great sightseeing day!

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"We took the bus 25 from the Hauptbahnhof of salzburg. it too us around 30 minutes to reach there. We waitied for the next cable car to take us up the mountain. They make a trip to the mountain each 30 minutes. The travel time itself using the cable car took around 10 minutes. The views were amazing during our way up. Try always to get first in the cart to be able to find a place beside the window as it is always crowded.
Up the mountain we stayed around 1 hour. And the views were just amazing. You can do some hiking up the mountain if you want.
One small tip, coffee up the mountain cost us around 6 eur and it was not so good so avoid it :)

Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Easy 1/2 hour public bus trip on the number 25 bus which we caught from Mirabellplatz. Note - the Salzburg Card provides free entry on the cable car to the summit and also free bus travel. The cable car ride up and down provides stunning views provided you aren't afraid of heights! Up top we had a full on alpine experience with heavy snow on the ground & trees but with the right clothing and shoes on was fine to walk in provided you kept to the paths. Definitely make the effort to go up The Untersberg if you're in Salzburg.,Oct 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,Easy to get to by bus from Salzburg centre. Only had to queue for 10 minutes each way which was unexpected. Very smooth cable car ride. We went on a walk to a cross not far away. There was a lot of cloud when we went up but it was clear and sunny at the top which made the views even more special. We had delicious hot chocolate and strudel in the inn just past the cable car. Great atmosphere and very friendly service.,Oct 2016
Austria,Untersberg,5.0,"Absolutely stunning up there.

We got the 25 bus from marketplatz. Waited until the last stop and 30mins later we were at the cable car station. The cable car runs on half hour and hour.

Beautiful views on the way up and amazing views from the top. We were there on a hand luggage only flight, so no room at all for appropriate clothing to go hiking around the snowy mountain. It was very slippy, so be careful if you're dressed for Salzburg city like we were. really wish we'd been dressed for a proper walk around.

Had a beer and frankfurter up there which made us really feel we'd arrived in this beautiful place.

Another vote here for getting a salzburg card...this trip was all included (bus & cable car fee)
