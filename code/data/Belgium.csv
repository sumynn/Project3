Grand Place,Belgium,"You can visit the place for free. We visited this place when we went to Brussels in October 2021. We saw some people did not wear their mask but we kept wear our masks.

We can see the beautiful square buildings in this place. At night everything turned even more beautiful. They have some restaurants for people to enjoy their day. It is difficult to find place to sit. So, it is standing place.

The place is easy to reach by tourists maps. We walked from Brussels metro station to this place and took around 15 minutes.

Grand Place,Belgium,"We entered the square as there was a college graduation ceremony happening. You can stand and marvel for hours at the intricate facades of each building. I'd recommend grabbing a beer or two, sitting any one of the many outdoor cafe spots, and really taking the time to analyze each building. There is a horse and buggy service in the square and a central place for locals and tourists to walk through. It's stunning.",5.0,Oct 2021

Grand Place,Belgium,"My wife is in a wheelchair with limited mobility, which means she can get out and walk a few meters if she has to. She definitely had to in order to see this square. The streets leading into it had cobblestones that were so uneven I couldn't push her so she had to walk in while I pushed the chair behind her. Good luck if you can't walk at all.
Once we got in the pavement was a bit smoother so I could at least push her but every few meters we would come to a bone-jarring stop as we hit an uneven space and were stopped dead in our tracks. But we did make it around well enough to take some photos then we had to walk her out at the end.
So you may be thinking that the next best alternative would be to take some sort of mobile tour: a car, bus, whatever. Well we did that. We had an electric Rickshaw pick us up at our hotel so we could leave the wheelchair behind and he took us for a nice tour of the sites. Well, a lot of them anyway. When it came to Grand Place all vehicles are banned because of terrorism fears so we couldn't go in. So if we didn't take that wheelchair trip we would have missed it completely.
I did get a lot of nice pictures of the square, both in the morning while it was deserted and while it was lit up at night. Unfortunately I had to leave my wife back at the hotel and go by myself in order to do it.

Historic Centre of Brugge,Belgium,"Bruges is relatively unknown in the United States and, although we travel a great deal, we were not much aware of it. In fact, it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Bruges was one of the richest cities in the world around 1400 and the architecture and city grid are very much intact from that period to around the mid-1600s. It has wonderful buildings, canals, decorative elements, and buckets of charm. You can have a delightful time in the historic center, and you will find endless surprises if you go outside of it.

Bruges is one of those cities where the city itself, rather than a particular building or site, is the star of the show. San Francisco, Prague, and Amsterdam are in the same boat.

The atmosphere and ambience around the city is wonderful. There are great restaurants and shops and it's just fun to explore.

Ghent City Center,Belgium,"My husband and I came in on the train from Bruges. Leaving Bruges, the directions were clear and easy. Once in Ghent, the experience was quite the opposite. We could not figure out which tram to take to Saint Bevos. Help was scarce and misdirection was also common. St. Bevos personnel were at best courteous but more inclined to scold. The virtual tour was shorter than other tours Why? Who knows. The altarpiece was magnificent. The rest was lacking in any type of spiritual renewal. Ghent, itself was dirty and many of the shops were closed. Instead of spending the day in Ghent, following the Rick Steves self guided tour, we scurried back to Bruges.",1.0,Aug 2021

The Markt,Belgium,"The Market Square is pretty much the center of Bruges, with the bell tower, as well as a row of restaurants you have likely seen countless times in travel literature and on postcards.

This is one of those places where the ambience is part of the fun. It’s a beautiful Medieval square. Even the newer buildings have Medieval elements so that they will fit in better. There are usually 6-12 horse carriages and the bell tower frequently chimes.

At one time, the canals came up to the edge of the square (hence the market), but today the closest canal is a few blocks away. Of the buildings on the square, you should make a point of visiting the town hall.

One note: the row of restaurants on the square looks great, but take a look at the reviews before you try one. There are many nearby restaurants that don’t appeal primarily to tourists where you might have a better experience. Your choice.

Citadelle de Dinant,Belgium,"There are a few different ways to get to the citadel. 1) Drive to the top and park. 2) Take the cable car. 3) Take the stairs.

I paid for the cable car. 10 Euros per person was outrageous, but I paid because I didn't feel like walking up the 400+ steps at the time. The cable car ride itself only lasts for maybe 2 or 3 minutes. The 10 Euros also covers the cost of entrance to the citadel.

There is a café, giftshop, toilets (not free), and a small museum inside the citadel. Of course, you're afforded wonderful views from the top.

Arguably the main attraction in Dinant and when the weather is fine it's a rather pleasant experience.
