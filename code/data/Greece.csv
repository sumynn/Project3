Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Feels unreal being in the place you've heard about and seen in so many photos, imaging live human beings having lived and functioned there a few thousand years ago",Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"The wind was cold and vicious the day we went up - we still had a wonderful time! We pretended Zeus himself was at work. It's a beautiful, wondrous thing. You have no idea how big it is until you're standing beneath the pillars. Amazing.",Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Well, I can tick off a bucket list item having always wanted to visit here - I wasn't let down. The whole site is totally awesome and the history is palpable and alive. You really must visit.

Be aware: arrive as soon as you possibly can. We got there for 8am (opening time) and enjoyed a calm walk around - it was busy but fine - no waiting and very civilised. However, as we were leaving, swarms upon swarms of tour groups from cruise ships were ascending and I was so relieved that we had avoided the nightmare; the site has many steps and is uneven, so to have to manoeuvre the site with so many people would have been uncomfortable and would have spoilt the visit.

Mark my words, avoid peak times to ensure your enjoyment and safety and pre book your tickets so that you can skip the queues.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Arrived early and the lines were starting to grow. There is a steep walk up uneven ground, lucky for us we visited in October when the temperatures were only in the low 80s.
There are a limited number of restrooms and a lift for disabled visitors.
The views from the top are stunning and you can get up close for that iconic photograph of the graceful Parthenon.
Be sure to visit the nearby area of Plaka after your visit.
The lines around midday as we left were very long, bear this in mind when visiting",Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"It was incredibly windy when we visited but so worth it. Would not advise visiting after a rain -- as it was, the stone paths were smooth and slick from years of wear. We got tickets from the side entrance -- didn't check out the front entrance but we were told the side entrance would be less crowded. Even so, there was a line. If you go to the front of the line, you can download a QR code tht allows you to buy tickets on your phone and skip the line. Recommended! The site is huge. Never realized how big it is. When I think of the Acropolis, I think of the main structure ... not all the other structures on the premises. They are doing a lot of renovations so lots of scaffolding and other equipment on site but well worth a visit.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"There are some unmissable world experiences: this is one. Other reviews will have written plenty, so I'll be brief.
I used the 3-day combo pass and it worked well for me. There were no queues anywhere but I was Earl in the day and it's later in the year. Still, the weather was excellent. Don't forget water and sun protection even now!
If time permits, visit twice. First to get the idea, and second, after buying a guidebook and reading it, to consolidate. If no time, buy the guidebook beforehand.
I didn't use a tour guide, I prefer to wander. Each to their own. Enjoy this world-class experience.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,Would recommend going early in the morning so you beat the groups from cruises and buses. So much on the ground to walk and read about history. Totally a worthwhile destination,Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Bucket list, Instagram, Facebook, must see, tick off place.
Athens is a bit of a dump, very crowded, dirty and busy place but the Acropolis really is a must see, must visit, iconic, world famous site. €20 to get in and a pleasant walk to the top.
Very photogenic place and great views from the top. It can be busy and the top and some of the steps can be very slippery due to the wear on the stones.",Oct 2021

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Of course if you visit at midday in peak tourism season, maybe you won't have such a great impression. If you go at opening or in a quieter season, you'll be able to really appreciate it. So famous and historic, amazing views. I got up early, visited at opening and no lines. By time I got back down, the line was down the street. But it's one of the most famous sights in the world, so kind of must see if you're in Athens.",Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,The Acropolis is a world-leading site in Athens. It is a must for any visitor. In the night it is exceptionally beautiful. A must.,Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,1.0,"I am writing this negative review in protest of the inflexible policies of this popular tourist attraction. I went recently on a Sunday morning with the intention of visiting the Acropolis Museum in the afternoon. By mistake, I entered the wrong line and ended again in the Acropolis Park. I had no idea that the Acropolis had more than one entrance and one of them is very close to the museum so it is very easy to get confused and get in the wrong place. I only realized this after I bought the ticket and asked a staff member about the museum. They were very unsympathetic about my situation and refused to refund or even appologize for the confusion.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Amazing! We went on European Heritage Days so we were able to get in for free. We thought the lineups and crowds would be ridiculous, but the grounds are so big that even though it was busy, there was still lots of space to get close up to the ancient ruins. It was better than we imagined and totally worth visiting.",Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"The acropolis is so beautiful!!! It made me feel so small, part of an ancient history… Everybody who has been there before me… Wordless!!",Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,Make sure you buy the 5 day pass. Its €20 for the acropolis on it's own but only €30 for the 5 day pass so well worth it. Great site. Was a lifelong dream to see it. It didnt disappoint. However Delphi was even better.,Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,3.0,"TL;DR version: As one other reviewer posted here, visiting the Acropolis is more stressful than it is enjoyable, romantic, or fun.

While the Acropolis is beautiful and certainly worth the effort to climb and enjoy, the staff there make it incredibly difficult for visitors to do so. The flow of traffic is somewhat difficult to navigate, and many visitors have audio tours in their ears. When they happen to wander in the wrong direction, the staff attempt to steer them back on course and have to do so quite loudly or harshly — atop of patch of very slippery marble. Disappointingly, the staff try their hardest to control the way people take photos, and this is where we ran into trouble. A rather overzealous woman stationed at the southeast corner of the Parthenon shouted at us from across the marble field to delete our photos “out of respect for the site.” Unfortunately, the fact that she had screamed so loudly to us meant that every single person in the area had heard the commotion and turned to watch the (non-)drama unfold.

After we approached the woman (it took a minute or so to actually walk over to where she was), we asked her “Which photo was the problem so that we know not to do it again.” In the end, after reviewing our photos, she apologized (we had not crossed a barrier, we did not pick anything up, and were not climbing anything; it should also be noted that pictures may be taken of all the structures without flash). It made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience, and we departed from the top of the hill not shortly after (due in part to simply being tired).

Unfortunately, it is now painfully clear the awful reputation of the guards at the Parthenon is one they deserve to have — they are, for all intents and purposes, mall cops. Not even one minute after our collision with this woman, we heard her whistle again at another group of people. Athens has been an absolute joy so far, home to some incredibly nice people, and all of our interactions at other attractions, supermarkets, and retail shops have been lovely. I’ve been able to practice my Greek as much as I can, and I’ve loved every second of it. It is a shame that the staff at the Acropolis are so hyper-focused on fighting the wrong battles. I saw many children climbing the ruins, people slipping on marble, and elderly persons in need of assistance with no guards around to offer any. Also, the rather large guided tours clog the entryways (particularly at the Propylaea), making the Acropolis a rather precarious site. In my eyes, efforts could certainly be made to improve safety over policing those who had not been doing anything wrong. If you are expecting the same level of kindness or professionalism one would see at any museum across the EU, at the Colosseo, Palatino, Les Invalides, or the Catacombs of Paris, forget about it.

Greece,Acropolis,3.0,"The view and buildings are impressive. What I personally missed was the storytelling in the information that was provided. Many of the signs were (too) literally translated from Greek, which didn't make them really pleasurable to read. There were some guided tours, but they weren't advertised at the ticket office.

When I visited there was no waiting line, so at least around this time of year it's not necessary to buy a skip the line ticket or anything like that.

Tip: buy the combination ticket (€30) which allows acces to various archeological sites. When you're under 25 the ticket is free.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"We had a guide for the day which really made it easy to cover a lot of Athens in an efficient manner.

We had purchased the combined thicket the afternoon before so we could skip the line. And our driver as able to drop us in the parking lot at the top of the hill so our walk to the entrance took less than five minutes.

Go Early. We were there at about 8:30 and the crowd was already starting to build.

There is quite a bit to see so allow at least 90 minutes so you can take time to take it all in.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"I feel so lucky to have visited here. Post pandemic numbers meant it was still busy but not insanely rammed. We visited as part of a guided tour at sunset and it was perfect.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"The whole area was fascinating to me--far grander and more impressive than I realized! History makes sens and definitely comes into perspective better after visiting this grand site. I recommend you hire a guide (we tried but couldn't book for our time slot) or download a guided tour (we used Rick Steve's guide which was invaluable. They say allow 2 hours for this tour but we spent much longer just because it was so interesting. The climb is no joke so wear sturdy, supportive walking shoes. The surface is rocky and uneven.",Sep 2021

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"The visit to the Acropolis was spectacular, inside of which the most incredible monument was the Parthenon. It is a visit of two hours, namely if you contract a local guide to explain the history related to the monuments. I strongly advise a local guide which you can find near the ticket office and will cost 20€ per person.",Oct 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Once in a lifetime experience to visit this UN World Heritage site. We downloaded Rick Steve's audio guide and were in line at the ticket office at 7:45 to be one of the first on the site. I'd recommend both of these tips to make your experience as good as ours. Crowds get large after 10. We toured the Acropolis first thing in the morning and then moved to the Ancient Agora, Roman Agora and finished the day at the Acropolis museum.",Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,4.0,"Visiting the Acropolis is obviously a ""Must Do"" when in Athens. As expected, it is a fascination place and we were lucky and there weren't too many tourists (Friday afternoon, 34 degrees). I would absolutely go there again. Great view as well.

Nevertheless - what you see is what you'll get: so if ruins aren't for you, then it's probably enough to see it from far.",Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"The Acropolis in Athens is something you visualize when you think of Athens - much like the Taj Mahal in India. In both cases, pictures do not do them justice. You need to walk around the structures to feel the history. We had a very knowledgeable local guide who made it even more special. I understand they expect to have the temple completely restored in 15 years. That will be something to see.",Sep 2021

Greece,Acropolis,4.0,"A little known fact is that there is an elevator for the handicapped that keeps you from going all the way up hill.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,On of the must visits of Athens. You can see it from far and from the whole city. But you have to climb up that mountain to experience it! breathtaking views over the city,Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,4.0,"It is advised to do some reading before the visit, or take a guide / audio-guide. Do NOT take ""Headout"" audio-guide and pay extra for it, because it is impossible to follow. There's not a lot of shadow so it's better to visit in the morning / evening.",Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,3.0,"I do not want my rating to mislead travelers - Acropolis is a 5 star, one of a kind site, but I deducted two stars because of things explained in the headline.
This was my fourth visit to Acropolis over the decades, and this time I went because of my 15y daughter who wanted to visit it.
My first surprise was a 20 Euro entrance fee - significant rise from my previous visit 5y ago, making it the most expensive site not in Greece, but in all SE Europe.
Second, they demand mask wearing !!!??? I deeply respect all Covid measures and obey all of them, but wearing masks in such a vast open space in scorching 40+ 'C in July really makes no sense.
Everything else about the site many others explained here.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Went to the Acropolis, Sept 2021. So Covid was still a thing and I would assume it impacted the crowds. That said, I highly recommend going either early, or late in the day when the cruise crowds are gone. It's busy all the time, but when a few thousand surge in all at once I bet it gets pretty hectic.
Secondly get a licensed guide. We had a gentlemen named Angelos Kokkaliaris, who I recommend very strongly. A guide will really make this place pop. If you're not a total history buff, a lot of what your looking at is just piles of rocks.
In summary, this was absolutely a bucket list visit. The site is overwhelming. You really feel like your walking through history. And craftsmenship that went into this temple, 1500 to 2000 years ago is nothing short of mind blowing. This is a must do.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Great site. Well maintained. Bring good walking shoes because you do have to walk up a path that is a little uneven as well as walk up stairs. Nothing torturous or even difficult, but you need proper footwear. Take a water bottle because there are water fountains with safe water at the top.",Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,4.0,"The Acropolis was only 10 minutes from my hotel so was easy to get there for the 8am opening. Comfy shoes are a must.
A slice of history that would be a shame to miss, to truly experience this then you need to enter. Entry was €20.",Sep 2021
Greece,Acropolis,4.0,"Obviously a must see. We followed the advice abs series at 08:30 (its open form 8-8) until October. It’s similar to the Forum in Rome with temples for the gods. It used to be a walled city and considering that’s it’s built on a hill makes the architecture even more impressive. The views are stunning and stretch to the port. There is nowhere to buy food or drink but there are watering taps and toilets at the top. Check before you drink as the heat turns the water into bath water temperatures.
We entered from the main gate and exited through the theatre (not the amphitheatre which is still in use) and we’re greater by a string of restaurants with cold water and cold beer.

Unfortunately the experience was tarnished by a NATO delegation doing a media tour. There was no prior notification ( I understand that for security reasons but simply stating that it’s open later would suffice.) We arrived at half past 8 and had to wait in the searing sunshine until 11:00 without any access to toilets as they were also locked, before the last VIP’s sauntered down the path to the exit to much boos and hand clapping. One delegates comment summed the NATO up perfectly “you learn to ignore them”.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"The craddle of our (western) civilization, this is a place that everybody should visit at least once in the lifetime. The architecture, the simetry, the cult of the beauty, the democracy, the idea of placing the Gods and tgeir temples above us,..everything that we are today was born here.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,Really interesting and historical important place. Don’t worry about amount of steps to the hill - it’s very convenient and comfortable road.

Greece,Acropolis,4.0,Challenging walk to the top but imagine the Ancient Greeks walking all the way from the sea! We didnt take a guided tour. Too much info for me to retain but we just marvelled at the sites and caught a bit of info while passing tour groups.,Sep 2021

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"We left our hotel early and arrived at the ticket office shortly after it opened and purchased the Acropolis Combo Ticket. As we approached the entrance a gentleman asked if we would like a tour. After negotiating a price and length of tour we journeyed to the top. Be careful and don’t be in a hurry as we saw several people fall. Fortunately all seemed to be unhurt. If you have trouble walking there is a lift that can be used. So please look into that. Once we got to the top we were amazed at the structures and the views of Athens. This is something you do not want to miss and you don’t want to be hurried. After our tour was completed we spent an extra thirty or forty minutes wandering around on our it. It is certainly a site to behold.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"It was a challenge for me. I had knee surgery three months ago. Our taxi driver drove us up to the main gate because i had crutches.
There was a side access for people with disability. There was a cart to drive us to the special elevator. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
Got to enjoy exploring the top of the hill before returning to the main level via the elevator.
Beware the ground on top. There were about 15 steep stairs fir the next level. Ground is very uneven and big rocks are “polished “ from centuries of people walking on them.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"From the moment I was in contact with Faye﻿ about my upcoming trip to Greece, she was extremely knowledgeable and accessible in helping me plan where I wanted to go in Greece. (Rick Steve’s trip was cancelled due to Covid). Every suggestion and recommendation she had was excellent and helped me navigate efficiently and joyfully through Athens. From her extensive knowledge of archeology and history, she fast- tracked all the important information that I needed to know without reading every placard in the Acropolis Museum. It can be overwhelming to be in Athens in the summer heat, but enthusiastically and energetically, Faye lead me to the great sites and her guidance was invaluable!! I would beyond recommend this classy lady to guide me wherever I wanted to explore in Greece! Do yourself a favor and just trust her guidance. She knows what she is doing! From finding a shady spot at the Acropolis so she could go into more detail about a marble sculpture- to how to get to the airport: Faye is who you want by your side in Greece.

The approach of entrance at site still seems the same as several years ago and where most tourist attractions leveraged COVID to enhance and rethink their model (e.g. by imposing prefixed timeslots), this does not seem to have happened here.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"An Amazing Amazing place to visit well worth the time, walk and effort.. Just don't understand why visitors torture themselves visiting in the middle of the day when lines are extremely long and it's super hot. .we waited until after 6pm to visit the site was half empty, no long lines at all and it wasn't as hot. FYI order your tickets online that's really what skip the line is..once u enter no such feature which gets u to the site exist. one saturday afternoon from our airbnb balcony we could see the line leading to the actual site snake down the hill..shameful not for the great site, but for the visitors suffering in that heat!",Jul 2021

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"Breathtaking and incredible the history that is here. Reading many reviews, we knew to hire a private tour guide. We booked with Dimitris Papandrou – knowledgable and understanding about my slow mobility – we found him at the entrance. There was a small line, maybe 20 people, at the ticket booth. We went right when it opened to try and avoid the heat of the midday. Be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen! It is an uphill climb, but it doesn't feel like one as our guide kept us enthralled with historical facts and history lessons – most of which is not on the reading plaques around the artifacts. The view is spectacular and the history is remarkable. Well worth the climb and remember to take your time and soak all the ancient history in.

Greece,Acropolis,5.0,"For a girl who studied Ancient Greek history in college and considered a career as an archaeologist, a visit to the Acropolis was a dream come true! From our hotel it looks as if the climb up the hill will be a long, hot tiring one, but with our private guide (which I highly recommend), it was quick and easy and painless. Be sure to wear a hat, sunscreen, and take a bottle of water. Thanks to COVID, and going early in the morning, there was no line at the ticket booth. We walked right up and right in! The ruins are breathtaking, and so beautiful. Be sure to take your camera! Sadly, there were those with no respect, who were climbing over the ruins, standing on top of the ruins, and generally not being their best selves, but luckily the crowds were not bad before noon. As we were leaving to walk to our lunch in Plaka, the crowd had begun to pick up quite a bit, as did the heat.

Greece,Acropolis,4.0,"Loved seeing the Acropolis. Some tips. Go in the morning - it does get hot and there is no shade. Also, they advised us that a few days prior they had closed the site from 1-5pm because there was a heat advisory. There were guides outside the Acropolis offering tours and we joined up with another couple to pay 20 euros per person. We found it well worth it.The ticket for the Acropolis is 20 euros, but for 30 euros you can get access to a few other sites around the city. We did the 30 euros and regretted it as we didn't end up using it (we only had a day in Athens). Also, it doesn't include access to the Acropolis museum (which we wrongly assumed) and that's an additional 10 euros. The museum is really great - nicely designed space to learn more about the history and see the original artifacts.

It’s an exceptional museum with excellent snd sparing use of technology to more fully explain the construction, sculptures and history. We were at the entrance to the Acropolis at 8am so avoided both heat snd increased crowds arriving after 9am. Suggest doing same.

If you have children, take ID to get a reduced price ticket. The staff are helpful and are positioned in different places around the site to guide you. Although there is quite a bit of restoration going on, it doesn't detract from the visit. It's good to see they are doing the work. There are great views of the city, but in my opinion the better views are from the top of Mount Lycabettus where you can see the city and the Acropolis.",Jun 2021

Greece,Imbros Gorge,4.0,"A delightful walk, I wore sneakers, no problem, just had to be a little cautious where I put my feet! Only a couple of things worth mentioning, firstly that the ""real"" entrance to the gorge is actually 1k outside the village, and secondly, the taxi option if you want to return to your car at the top of the gorge is €20 for a vehicle (which we shared, which brought down the cost), and although this sounds expensive, it's actually a fair price as it's quite a long switchback ride back up the mountainside by road. I felt bad beating them down in price when I realised it wasn't a simple jaunt back up the gorge but a fair old hike!

My Nike trainers coped well with the rough stones underfoot, but it's true that the constant care needed watching every foot placement on the rocky path became quite tedious and I might have felt more sure-footed in hiking boots/shoes. Took 2.5 hours at a comfortable pace, stopping often for photos or to let faster walkers pass. It was a beautiful walk, mostly in shade and accompanied by the odd kri kri! We did it as part of an organised tour (getyourguide) and this worked very well.",Oct 2021
Greece,Imbros Gorge,5.0,Beautiful nature and landscape. Not too hard. We did the hike with running shoes and it was uncomfortable because there are a lot of loose rocks on the trail. Therefore good hiking shoes are recommended however if you want it is possible to do the hike with regular shoes also. There is a taxi service back to entrance it costs 4 eur per face.,Sep 2021
Greece,Imbros Gorge,5.0,"The walk is 7km from the main entrance to the first taxi stand. It took us 2h20m on a slow pace.
We took a ride in the back of a pickup truck back up for only 4 euro per person.

It is a nice walk and very doable for beginner walkers as long as you have some decent shoes.

The trip would be 8km if you start at the tourist traps. When you follow the main road and see lots of 'main entrance' signs and cafés then continue for about a kilometer to find the real main entrance and free parking!

BUT! 2 warnings. The people in this area are the first Cretes we met that are truly tourist annoying. In the village you will see many signs ""entrance to gorge"" right next to a tavern. Do not stop, its a tourist trap. The real entrance is 1 km out of the village!

The second point is at the end, just get on the first taxi option available, they asked for 4 euros for a trip back up. We continued to the road and there they requested 15 euro for the both of us for the ""taxi"" uphill back to imbros.

The path is not difficulte, but wear apropriate shoes for hiking, it will prevent you to step wrong and hurt yourself.
It's 8km one way. and if you don't want to go back hiking, there are planty taxis (5€ per person) to take you back to imbros.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"We set off from Imerovigli reasonably early, around 8.30 am, and keeping to a steady pace with a few short breaks at points of interest, arrived in Oia just before 11. This allowed enough time to see some of the town and its busy streets and shops, and then catch the bus back to Fira.
The walk is certainly spectacular, and generally safe and easy to negotiate – just one part of the path, just before and after you briefly join the road, is a little less secure underfoot. There are plenty of natural stopping points for you to take in the views, including three typically whitewashed churches, and a rock where you are advised to “save the camera and enjoy the view”!
The walk from Imerovigli to Fira adds no more than 30 minutes to the time needed to do the whole walk, and the path is consistently good quality underfoot.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4.0,"Fantastic views and a great sense of achievement on completing the walk.
We are a relatively fit couple in our 50’s ,and we did this on an October morning when the temp was about 20 c.
The walk out of Fira is very uphill and after 15 mins I was wondering whether this was going to be doable.
However with regular 2 minute rests we managed the initial steep incline.The next 4-5 km was still a bit up and down but not too taxing and the views great.There is a 20 min section where the path narrows and there is a sheer drop to the sea with no netting that might unnerve some people,although the walking wasn’t tricky if you watched your feet.
After the short stretch of road you turn left after a small cafe,for us the next 2 k or so was the toughest, it was up hill for what seemed like forever and certainly tested your fitness to the full.
Eventually you reach a small church casting welcome shade where you can rest for a bit.
Then it’s downhill into Oia-lovely but full of cruise passengers.
To find the picture spot with the 2 blue domes you have to walk to the far side of the town and turn left down an alley just past a church-we found it by chance following some other people.
Then back to the other side of town to find a taxi- which was not that straight forward,no real taxi rank.Flagged one down after 20 mins purely by chance.
In summary as others have said ,you do need a reasonable level of fitness to do the whole walk(12k and 4 hours including walking around Oia).You must have covered decent footwear.
I couldn’t have done this in the heat of summer,so bear that in mind if your not really fit.
Very glad to have done it ,well worth the effort,but I reiterate it is not an easy walk and it is impossible to bale out at certain points and there are very few taxi opportunities on route if you find it too much.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"I don't understand the attraction of the Fira to Imerovigli leg ... it's just a walking path through commercial developments. The real hike is from Imerovigli to Oia. I stayed in Imerovigli, so it was just lock the door and go. Or take the island bus to Imerovigli, walk one block towards the caldera and take a right.

I don't have anything to offer that you won't see elsewhere. Trail is of mixed quality and you'll need good shoes. The two snack shops might not be open. Take water with you. Expect wind and mostly sun although if you go in the morning, you'll have some shade. Easier to take the bus back from Oia. Do be careful because parts of it won't be accessible for medical aid.

Some parts are steep; recommend to wear walking shoes with good soles (some parts involve walking over loose stones/terrain), bring water.

We started in Oia and ended in Fira and the total walk took just under 4 hours, stopping for a drink in Imerovigli en route.

A lovely way to see some other villages and nose in to some hotels. The walk is quite challenging in parts due to how steep it can be so if you have any mobility issues you will struggle. Terrain is a mix of gravel tracks, cobbles and smooth tiles. We did it in sandals which was doable, but next time I’d go for better ankle support as they were sore for a couple of days after!

Finished the walk with a gorgeous lunch in Vanaila in Fira. One of the best meals we had.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Make no mistake, this is a hike!! We did it in about 2.5hrs, but it was hard graft. We started from Ferostefani, so about 10km. Thankfully there’s a few places en route to get a drink, but there’s not much shade so be prepared to get hot and sweaty. It’s worth it though and I’m glad we did it, and when we looked back from Oia on the route we took I was proud of myself…..looks a lot further than 10k! One thing to be careful of…..getting the bus back. If I was to do it again, I’d bus to Oia and walk back to Fira. (We didn’t do this tho so not sure if it would be any different) The queue for the bus at about 5pm in Oia was horrendous. We couldn’t get on the bus despite turning up 10 mins early. Faced with waiting another 30mins for a bus we got a taxi with another couple (this was €35 for four of us). Santorini really needs to put more buses on. We got a car for a few days after this based on that experience, I’m not standing an hour in a bus queue after that hike.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"The hike is tough, but if you are used at hiking you will survive. It is no Himalayan climb. Assuming you are visiting Santorini in summer, the temperature is high. Start very early in the morning (you will also have the halleys of Fira all for yourself). Wear proper hiking shoes, cause the gravel in some parts is slippery.
I suggest to walk from Fira to Oia, then return by bus (they are frequent and fast).
At the end, I think the municipality of Santorini should invest more in this touristic asset. Other Cycladic islands have developed a lot their historic routes. With the breathtaking views, this trail is easily the most beautiful of all. Unfortunatley, the signposting is barely sufficient and the paving stones in the last part just before Oia are really deteriorated.

This is not a ""simple walk""...this is a grueling trek (this, coming from someone who hiked the Inca Trail).

The views are spectacular and you get a real feel for the island, its geological history, and the surroundings, but its tough.

Our hotel told us to start at 6am, and we scoffed at them. It's vacation and we don't want to wake up early!

Well, it gets hot, and between Imervigli and Oia, there are very few places to stop, so make sure you've got some water and plenty of sunscreen.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"This was something that I really wanted to do during our visit. However it is NOT for the faint of heart and shouldn't be rushed. It is a long, steep and sometimes treacherous hike. Despite that, the scenery is unlike any you will see on any guided tour. Because you are going places that are not accessible by car, you should plan your hike accordingly. There are very few places for shade and places to purchase drinks or food are few and far between so be sure to have plenty of water with you. Also make sure you are wearing appropriate footwear. The paths were paved at one time, but now are nothing but rubble, making it easy to twist an ankle when you are walking. There were several times while we were hiking that my daughter and I were starting to question whether or not to turn back, but looking back now, I am so glad we didn't. It turned out to be one of the most unforgettable things we did and we got some amazing photographs!

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful hike. It is about 12kms in length. Best to go early in the morning or late in the evening as the midday heat would make it quite difficult. We did it from Fira to Oia. We got the 7.30am bus from Oia and started the walk at about 8.10am. The walk officially starts at the Atlantis hotel- turn right out of the bus station go straight on across the road and straight up to the hotel Atlantis. You then follow the path more or less keeping the water on your left for the entire journey. There are a few signs every now and then so it is easy enough to find your way. It is quite a mixed terrain so good footwear is a must. There is quite a climb in parts, so some level of fitness would certainly help. Bring plenty of water as most cafes won't be open early in the morning. There is a nice van about half way on one of the main roads- a welcome sight when we had run out of water. We had an ice cold Coke to revive us and replenished the water stocks. It took us about 2hrs 45mins to complete the hike, and it was nice and quiet at that hour of the morning.

Greece,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,5.0,"On our fifth day, we got up early and walked from Oia to Fira; a four to five hour ‘moderate’ walk along a scenic trail that offers many many memorable views. The trail consists of pathways of concrete, cobblestone and at times dirt and gravel; and in one short spot (a few hundred meters); you are walking on the edge of a busy roadway. My wife and I are in our 50’s and quiet fit however at times we were challenged, take plenty of water / sunscreen and wear appropriate footwear and clothing (hats). When choosing which part of the day to walk, consider the rising and setting of the sun and that the walk is a moderate one. When planning, consider the distance of unpopulated areas as there will be no opportunity to purchase water or access ablutions. At the halfway point, there are a few donkeys to hire but these are of limited numbers. On the outskirts of Fira, my wife and I popped into a cafe, freshened up, then meandered our way into Fira then had a loooooooong lunch. We then caught the bus (under 2 Euro each) back to Oia.

1) DON'T walk all the way through, it's pointless and difficult.
2) START from Imerogvili (take a bus from Fira, it's 10 minutes, NOTE that the buses to Oia don't go to Imerogvili).
3) WALK from Imerogvili to the little white church Agios Markos and then back (or less), it will take you 1-1,5 hours and the road is good.
4) ALSO WALK from Fira to Firostefani or from Imerogvili to Firostefani if you want to see the white towns. In fact, the three of them are one town.
5) If you still want to go to Oia, TAKE a hat, a sunscreen, and plenty of water. THINK TWICE.
Again, I encourage you to not do that either than starting at 7-8 AM. It's not worth it, the views are totally the same all the way through, it's enough to walk just a bit. I'm in a very good shape and I've had a bad migraine seizure for the first time in my life after this terrible hike, it is steep all the way through and incredibly hot, I started at 9:30AM. It was good at first, then when I reached the black mountains after Agios Markos, it became a hell.

Several cafes which play music, and a shop selling inflatable beach gear etc right at the entrance only. Bouncy castle activity in the sea looked good. Some activities like paragliding (?) behind a boat.

Greece,Porto Limnionas Beach,4.0,"A very beautiful spot for swimming and snorkelling. Great view under water and a lot to see.

The water is a lot colder compared to other places on the island tho! This is probably due to the water from the open sea and the caves.

This whole area is just beautiful! Above the water and under it!!

But.. this is no “hidden gem”, it is very crowded! There were barely any spots to sit of lay down, and that while we were quite late in the season. It only started to be a little less crowded when the sun started to get low.

We definitely enjoyed our time here, and had some of the more beautiful views under water we had so far.

It is in such a picturesque setting flanked on either side by rugged coastline with mountains as a backdrop all surrounding crystal clear blue seas.

As well as swimming it us a popular spot for snorkeling and diving.

Think it would be more accurate to call this a swimming lagoon rather than a beach, as there is no beach.

There are some sunbeds available for hire this are dotted around on ledges and concrete platforms along the headland. Space is really at a premium here and people  can be found spread out on their towels all over the place, it was really busy.

We did climb down the man-made stone steps to a concrete platform where people were launching themselves from into the beautiful blue waters below. For the more adventurous they were climbing up on to the rocks and diving & jumping into the sea.

There is a Taverna which rents out sunbeds and there is also Scuba Diving Centre.

Via a small rock path down you can reach the water (take some rock shoes with you, it’s better than bare feet). The water was simply astonishing, very clear and blue and there were nice caves and clean rocks. We went with diving gear and to see the most the Porto Limnionas has to offer I really recommend doing the same. There were beautiful fishes and the raw underwater nature was breathtaking.

Greece,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,5.0,"The Archaeological Museum in Heraklion has always been, together with the main excavation areas, the place of excellence for the knowledge of the Minoan civilization. The fresco of men and women performing evolutions on the bull, the ""prince of lilies"", the cup-bearer, the mysterious Phaistos disc, the sculpture of the bull with golden horns, and many other masterpieces, have long been unforgettable pieces of Museum (and as such I remembered them well from my first visit, in August 2002).
But now the new location of the museum and above all the new organization of it make it even more valuable. Not only the Minoan civilization, but what preceded and followed it in Crete, up to the end of the classical world, is admirably illustrated and supported by works of great interest. It is therefore in fact now the ""Museum of Crete"" par excellence, in which the Minoan story appears to be the highest point of an overall history of this island, for centuries the western outpost of the most advanced civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East.
If before the recent renovation the Museum was already unmissable for what it contained, now it is also because it allows you to verify the high level of the approach that by this renewed museum the contemporary Greek cultural world has practiced towards this sublime island and its history.

Greece,Heraklion Archaeological Museum,3.0,"The museum was fascinating. Obviously there was a lot of focus on the Minoan civilisation and I was amazed at the number of very ancient artifacts that have been accumulated in the museum, covering many different aspects of life. The museum was well organised into different historical periods. The content of this museum makes it a must to visit if you are interested in ancient history.

Our first attempt to visit this place was pretty frustrating. It was about 11:20 am and there was a big queue to get in that went around the corner of the building. We got to the front only to be told that they needed to see our Covid vaccination certificate and passport! There was no indication (no signs outside for example) stating this. We queued for 25 minutes in the midday heat only to be turned away at the entrance because we didn’t have our vaccination certificates or passports with us! I can’t believe how strict they were - even more than actually getting into the country!

We came back the day afterwards with all the required documentation determined to go because we’d bought tickets already at the historical site of Knossos. Luckily the tickets were valid for two days.

One good thing about the museum is that it is open until fairly late. At the time of writing this, the museum closed at 20:00 during the weekdays. We decided to go there at 17:00 and there were no queues outside and only a few people in the museum. We took our time and really enjoyed our visit.

Our initial experience was not very good but with some adjustments, it turned out to be worth it. I would advise people to bring all your documents with you no matter how ridiculous it seems. I would also advise either to go there early or better still late on to avoid the peak tourist periods.

We bought the double ticket an visited the museum after Knossos, which I am grateful for, because they complement eachother (and I believe we missed the longest queues due to this), for example we got to see the bathtubs that our guide at knossos explained were used to bury the people in, and the museum had these with the scelletons in the featal position, so everything we were told at knossos we get to see at the museum. The collections really show how advanced everything was. I easpecially enjoyed that pottery, crockery, teacups and jewelly from thousands of years ago might very well be something designed and made by an artisan today. Very friendly staff, took a little while to get in as they make sure everyone kept distance, but once inside it worked very well as you could spend time at the exhibits you most wanted to see and skip past others, walk back etc.

We spent about 2hrs there for a complete visit, could easily be one more or one less hour depending on your interest. Vigilant but unobtrusive staff.",May 2021

Greece,Monolithos Castle,3.0,The castle is about 2 hours away from Rhodes. It is a very steep climb up to the top. The views are wonderful. It was hazy outside so my pictures were terrible.,Jun 2021
Greece,Monolithos Castle,5.0,"After a stunning drive on the western side of the island, we reached the Monolithos Castle. Cell service was very limited so the navigation was sketch getting there. The attraction was not staffed and some stupid af bro was climbing on top of everything. Scaling roofs and jumping up and down to see if it was stable to walk on. Aside, the views were spectacular and there was enough signage around to learn about the castle. Would really love the tourism bureau of Rhodes to create a driving tour commentary on their attractions. I think it would entice more people to drive down to this side of the island.

Greece,Agrari Beach,4.0,"Fantastic little beach, the only downside is that the sand is quite coarse. This is a very relaxing place which is off the beaten path on Mykonos as it’s not accessible by the beach busses. Two beach beds are €30, with very friendly an attentive staff. Food options are limited to sandwiches and fries on the beach, or a (very) near by sit-down restaurant. The atmosphere is relaxed here and the spot seems popular with locals. Be advised, you’ll be driving narrow, steep, and windy roads to here but it’s worth it. Luxury boats pass by regularly and we noticed several vips being flown to nearby resorts by helicopter. The water is very clear a little further from shore. Beach has all imaginable amenities including easily accessible shower. Food prices are reasonable at the restaurant. Parking is free and close to the beach.
